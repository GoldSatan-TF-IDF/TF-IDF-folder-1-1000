in bishah shazli king of zuwayza tewfik hajjajs majordomo qutuz hajjajs secretary in bishah one leudast looked across the snowcovered ruins of sulingen the silence seemed unnatural after two spells of fighting in the city he associated it with the horrible din of battle bursting eggs the hiss of beams as they turned snow to sudden steam fire crackling beyond hope of control masonry falling in on itself wounded behemoths bawling wounded horses and unicorns screaming wounded men shrieking none of that now everything was silent eerily so young lieutenant recared nudged leudast and pointed look sergeant recared said his unlined face glowing with excitement almost with awe here come the captives aye leudast said softly he couldnt have been more than two or three years older than recared himself it only seemed like ten or twelve awe was in his voice too as he said it again aye he hadnt known quite so many algarvians were left alive in sulingen when their army at last gave up its hopeless fight here came some of them now a long column of misery by unkerlanter standards their tall enemies from the east were slim even when well fed now after so much desperate fighting cut off from any hope of resupply most of them were redheaded skeletons nothing more they were filthy too with scraggly red beards covering their hollow cheeks they wore a fantastic mix of cloaks algarvian tunics and kilts long unkerlanter tunics and any rags and scraps of cloth they could get their hands on some had stuffed crumpled news sheets and other papers under their tunics to try to fight the frigid winter here in the southwest of unkerlant here and there leudast saw algarvians in pathetic overshoes of woven straw snug in his own felt boots he almost pitied the foe almost king mezentios men had come too close to killing him too many times for him to find feeling sorry for them easy lieutenant recared drew himself up very straight seeing them makes me proud im an unkerlanter he said maybe the ability to say things like that was part of what separated officers from ordinary soldiers all leudast could do was mumble seeing them makes me glad im alive he didnt think recared heard him which might have been just as well most of the algarvians trudged along with their heads down they were beaten and they knew it a few though still somehow kept the jauntiness that marked their kind one of them caught leudasts eye grinned and spoke in pretty fair unkerlanter hey bignose our turn today tomorrow yours leudasts mittened hand flew up to the organ the redhead had impugned it was of a good size and strongly curved but so were most unkerlanters noses he waved derisively at the algarvian waved and said big up above big down below aye all you unkerlanters are big pricks the captive came back with a chuckle some soldiers would have blazed a man who said something like that leudast contented himself with the last word you think its funny now you wont be laughing so hard when they set you to work in the mines that struck home the algarvians grin slipped he tramped on and was lost among his fellows at last the long tide of misery ended recared shook himself as if waking from a dream he turned back to leudast and said now weve got to get ready to whip the rest of king mezentios men out of our kingdom sure enough sir leudast agreed he hadnt thought about what came after beating the algarvians in sulingen he supposed thinking about such things before you had to was another part of what separated officers from the men they led what state is your company in lieutenant recared asked about what youd expect sir ive got maybe a sections worth of men leudast answered plenty of companies had sergeants in charge of them these days and plenty of regiments like recareds were commanded by lieutenants with a nod recared said have them ready to move out tomorrow morning i dont know for a fact that we will move tomorrow but thats what it looks like aye sir leudasts sigh built a young fogbank of vapor in front of his face he knew he shouldnt have expected anything different but he would have liked a little longer to rest after one fight before plunging into the next they didnt go north the next morning they did go north the next afternoon tramping up roads made passable by behemoths wearing snowshoes here and there the snow lay too deep even for behemoths to trample out a usable path then the weary troopers had to shovel their way through the drifts the duty was as physically wearing as combat the only advantage being that the algarvians werent trying to blaze them or drop eggs on their heads one of leudasts troopers said i wish we were riding a leyline caravan up to the new front then wed get there rested the way things are were already halfway down the road to being dead he flung a spadeful of snow over this shoulder then stooped to get another one a few minutes later the company emerged from the trench it had dug through a great drift leudast was awash in sweat his lungs on fire regardless of the frigid air he breathed when he could see more than snow piled up in front of him he started to laugh there a few hundred yards to one side of the road lay a wrecked caravan its lead car a burntout blasted ruin the algarvians had planted an egg along the ley line and its burst of sorcerous energy had done everything the redheads could have wanted still want to go the easy way werbel no thanks sergeant the trooper answered at once maybe this isnt so bad after all leudast nodded he wasnt laughing any more the steersmen on that leyline caravan were surely dead so were dozens of unkerlanter troopers bodies lay stacked like cordwood by the ruined caravan and more dozens maybe hundreds of men were hurt the algarvians had gained less by winning some skirmishes when the regiment encamped for the night in the ruins of an abandoned peasant village lieutenant recared said there are some stretches of ley line that are safe our mages keep clearing more every day too i suppose they find out if the ley lines are clear by sending caravans on them leudast said sourly this one wasnt no but it will be now after the mages cancel out the effect of the energy burst recared answered and then theyll find another cursed egg a mile farther north leudast said find it the hard way odds are you havent got the right attitude sergeant recared said reprovingly leudast thought he had just the right attitude he was opposed to getting killed or maimed he was especially opposed to getting killed or maimed because some mage hadnt done his job well enough having the enemy kill you was part of war he understood that having your own side kill you hed come to understand that was part of war too however much he hated it in good weather on good roads they would have been about ten days march from where the fighting was now they took quite a bit longer than that to get there the roads even the best of them were far from good though the winter solstice was well past the days remained short and bleak and bitterly cold with a new blizzard rolling in out of the west every other or every third day and though no redheads opposed them on the ground the algarvians hadnt gone away and given up after losing sulingen they kept being difficult whenever and wherever they could unkerlant was vast and dragons even thinner in the air than soldiers and behemoths were on the ground that meant king mezentios dragonfliers could fare south to visit death and destruction on the unkerlanters moving up to assail their countrymen when eggs fell leudast dived into the closest hole he could find when algarvian dragons swooped low to flame he simply leaped into the snow on his belly and hoped his white smock would keep enemy dragonfliers from noticing him it worked after each attack ended he got up and started slogging north again not everyone was so lucky hed long since got used to seeing corpses sometimes pieces of corpses scattered in the snow and staining it red but once the algarvian dragons had been lucky enough to take out a column of more than a dozen unkerlanter behemoths and the crews who served their eggtossers and heavy sticks the air that day was calm and still the stench of burnt flesh still lingered as he tramped past dragonfire had roasted the behemoths inside the heavy chainmail they wore to protect them from weapons mere footsoldiers could carry even the beasts snowshoeencased hooves and the ironshod curving horns on their noses were covered with soot from the flames the dragons had loosed last winter i hear the algarvians were eating the flesh of slain behemoths recared said he hadnt been in the fight the winter before leudast had he nodded aye they did sir after a pause he added so did we oh beneath his swarthy skin beneath the dark whiskers hed had scant chance to scrape recared looked a little green what was it like strong gamy leudast answered another pause a lot better than nothing ah aye recared nodded wisely do you suppose well not these beasts leudast said not unless you want to stop and do some butchering now if we keep going well be miles away before we stop for the night thats true lieutenant recared considered in thoughtful tones he remarked field kitchens havent been all they might be have they leudast started to erupt at that then noticed the small smile on recareds face king swemmel expected his soldiers to feed themselves whenever they could field kitchens were almost as rare as far western mountain apes roaming these plains the regiment ate behemoth that night and for several days thereafter it was as nasty as leudast recalled it was a lot better than the horrible stuff the algarvians had been pouring down their throats in the last days at sulingen though and as hed said it was ever so much better than nothing a couple of nights later thunder rumbled in the north as the unkerlanter soldiers made camp but it couldnt have been thunder the sky for once was clear with swarms of stars twinkling on jet black when the weather was very cold they seemed to twinkle more than on a mild summer night leudast noted that only in passing he knew too well what that distant rumbling that went on and on meant scowling he said were close enough to the fun to hear eggs bursting again i didnt miss em when we couldnt believe you me i didnt fun werbel hadnt been in the company long but even he knew better than that more chances to get killed is what it is thats what they pay us for leudast answered when they bother to pay us i mean hed lost track of how far in arrears his own pay was months he was sure of that much and he should have been owed a lieutenants pay or a captains not a sergeants considering the job hed been doing for more than a year of course recared should have been paid like a colonel too werbel listened to the eggs in the distance with a sigh he said i wonder if theyll get caught up before the war ends leudasts laugh was loud raucous and bitter powers above what makes you think itll ever end sidroc was glad forthwegians had the custom of wearing full beards for one thing the thick black hair on his chin and cheeks and upper lip went a little way toward keeping them warm in the savage cold of southern unkerlant coming out of gromheort in the sunny north hed never imagined weather like this had anybody told him even a quarter of the truth about it before he knew it for himself he would have called that fellow a liar to his face no more for another the beards the men of plegmunds brigade forthwegians fighting in the service of their algarvian occupiers wore helped distinguish them from their unkerlanter cousins unkerlanters and forthwegians were both stocky oliveskinned hooknosed both given to wearing long tunics rather than kilts or trousers but if sidroc saw a cleanshaven face he blazed at it without hesitation at the moment he saw very little his regiment about a companys worth of men after all the hard fighting theyd been through was trying to hold the unkerlanters out of a village called hohenroda it lay somewhere not far from the important town of durrwangen but whether north south east or west sidroc couldnt have said to save his life hed done too much marching and countermarching to have any exact notion of where he was eggs crashed down on the village and in front of it the log walls of the cabin where he was sheltering shook he turned to sergeant werferth those unkerlanter buggers have every eggtosser in the world lined up south of here seems like wouldnt surprise me werferth answered if anything ever did faze him he didnt let on hed served in the forthwegian army till the algarvians destroyed it sidroc had been only fifteen when the derlavaian war began three and a half years before werferth spat on the rammedearth floor so what that was too much calm for sidroc to handle theyre liable to kill us thats what he burst out every once in a while his voice still broke like a boys he hated that but couldnt help it they wont kill all of us and the ones whore leftll make em pay a good price for this place werferth said hed signed up for plegmunds brigade as soon as the recruiting broadsheets started going up on walls and fences as far as sidroc could tell werferth didnt care for whom he fought he might have served the unkerlanters as readily as the algarvians he just liked to fight more eggs burst a fragment of the metal casings that held their sorcerous energy in check till suddenly and violently released slammed into the wall timbers creaked straw from the thatched roof fell down into sidrocs hair he peered out through a tiny slit of a window i wish we could see better he grumbled they dont build houses with southfacing doors in these parts werferth said a lot of em havent got any southfacing windows at all not even these little pissy ones they know where the bad weather comes from sidroc had noticed there werent any southfacing doors but he hadnt thought about why questions like that didnt interest him he wasnt stupid but he didnt use his brains unless he had to hitting somebody or blazing somebody struck him as easier werferth went to the other little window he barked out several sharp curses here they come he said and rested his stick on the window frame the business end pointing out toward the unkerlanters mouth dry sidroc did the same hed seen unkerlanter charges before not too many or he wouldnt have remained among those present now he had to try to fight off another one it was he had to admit an aweinspiring sight king swemmels soldiers formed up in the frozen fields south of hohenroda out beyond the range of the defenders sticks row on row of them all in fur hats and white smocks sidroc could hear them howling like demons even though they were a long way off do they really feed em spirits before they send em out to attack he asked werferth oh aye the sergeant answered makes em mean i shouldnt wonder though i wouldnt mind a nip myself right now then in the distance whistles shrilled the ice that ran up sidrocs back had nothing to do with the ghastly weather he knew what was coming next and it came the unkerlanters linked arms row on row of them the officers whistles squealed once more the unkerlanters charged urra they bellowed a deep rhythmic shout as snow flew up from their felt boots urra urra swemmel urra urra if they couldnt overrun hohenroda if they couldnt overrun the whole cursed world they didnt know it no doubt because they were drunk they started blazing long before they got close enough to be in any serious danger of hitting something puffs of steam in the snow in front of them showed that some of the men from plegmunds brigade had started blazing too fools werferth growled bloody stupid fornicating fools we cant afford to waste charges like that we havent got any kaunians around to kill to give us the sorcerous energy we need to get more they didnt even have any unkerlanters to kill for the same purpose the local peasants had long since fled hohenroda the men of plegmunds brigade were on their own here or so sidroc thought till eggs started bursting among the onrushing unkerlanters he whooped with glee and with surprise plegmunds brigade was made up of footsoldiers it had to rely on the algarvians for support i didnt know there were eggtossers back of town sidroc said to werferth neither did i werferth said if you think our lords and masters tell us everything theyre up to youre daft and if you think those eggsll get rid of all those unkerlanters youre even dafter by the powers above sidroc knew that too well as the eggs burst in their midst some of swemmels men flew through the air to lie broken and bleeding in the snow others as far as he could tell simply ceased to be but the unkerlanters who still lived who could still move forward came on they kept shouting with no change in rhythm he could hear then they were close enough to make targets even werferth couldnt criticize sidroc thrust his right forefinger out through a hole in his mitten his stick required the touch of real flesh to blaze he stuck his finger into the opening at the rear of the stick and blazed at an unkerlanter a few hundred yards away the man went down but sidroc had no way to be sure his beam had hit him he blazed again and then cursed for he must have missed his new target the unkerlanters were blazing too as they had been for some little while a beam smote the peasant hut only a foot or so above sidrocs head the sharp tangy stink of charred pine made his nostrils twitch in drier weather a beam like that might have fired the hut not so much risk of that now nor of the fires spreading if it did take hold mow em down werferth said cheerfully down the unkerlanters went too in great swaths almost as if they were being scythed at harvest time sidroc had long since seen swemmels soldiers cared little about losses if they got a victory they didnt count the cost theyre going to break in he said an exclamation of dismay they might pay a regiments worth of men to shift the companys worth of forthwegians in hohenroda but that wouldnt make the detachment from plegmunds brigade any less wrecked it wouldnt make sidroc any less dead we have three lines of retreat prepared werferth said well use all of them he sounded calm unconcerned ready for anything that might happen and ready to make the unkerlanters pay the highest possible price for this miserable little place in the abstract sidroc admired that when fear rose up inside him like a black choking cloud he knew he couldnt hope to match it and then instead of swarming in among the huts of hohenroda and rooting out the defenders with beams and with knives and with sticks swung clubwise and with knees in the crotch and thumbs gouging out eyes the unkerlanters had to stop short of the village more eggs fell among swemmels men these from the northeast heavy sticks seared down half a dozen men at a time algarvian behemoths fighting as they had in the old days before sticks and eggs were so much of a much got in among the unkerlanters and trampled them and gored them with ironencased horns and the unkerlanters broke they hadnt expected to run into behemoths around hohenroda when they fought according to their plans they were the stubbornest soldiers in the world when taken by surprise they sometimes panicked sidroc was heartily glad this proved one of those times run you buggers run he shouted and blazed a fleeing unkerlanter in the back relief made him sound giddy he didnt care he felt giddy theyve got snowshoes werferth said the algarvian behemoths i mean they didnt last winter you know the algarvians hadnt figured theyd have to fight in the snow it cost em werferth didnt just like fighting he liked going into detail about fighting sidroc didnt think that way hed joined plegmunds brigade mostly because he hadnt been able to get along with anybody back in gromheort a lot of the men in the brigade were similar misfits some of them were outandout robbers and bandits hed led a sheltered life till the war things were different now some of the behemoth crews waved to the defenders of hohenroda urging them out in pursuit of king swemmels men sidroc had no intention of pursuing anybody unless his own officers gave the order he muttered under his breath when shouts rang out from inside the village forward south those shouts were in algarvian algarvian officers commanded plegmunds brigade and all orders came in their tongue in a way that made sense the brigade had to fight alongside algarvian units and work smoothly with them in another way though it was a reminder of who were the puppets and who the puppeteers lets go werferth said he would never be anything more than a sergeant of course had forthwegs independent army survived he would never have been anything more than a sergeant either for he had not a drop of noble blood sidroc winced and cursed as the icy wind tore at him when he left the shelter of the peasants hut but he and his comrades were grinning at one another as they formed up and advanced toward the behemoths and toward the tumbled unkerlanter corpses in the snow the algarvian behemoth crews werent grinning who are these whoresons one of them shouted to a recognizably algarvian lieutenant among the forthwegians they look like a pack of unkerlanters were from plegmunds brigade the lieutenant answered sidroc followed algarvian fairly well hed learned some in school mostly beaten in with a switch and more since joining the brigade which had ways of training harsher yet plegmunds brigade the redhead on the behemoth burst out plegmunds bloody brigade powers above we thought we were rescuing real algarvians love you too prickface that was a trooper named ceorl like sidroc in the squad werferth led he always had been and always would be more a ruffian than a soldier here though sidroc completely agreed with him major spinello eyed the approaching algarvian physician with all the warmth of a crippled elk eyeing a wolf the physician either didnt notice or was used to such glances from recuperating soldiers good morning he said cheerfully how are we today i havent the faintest idea about you good my sir spinello replied like a lot of algarvians he was given to extravagant flights of verbiage as for myself ive never been better in all my born days when do you propose to turn me loose so i can get back into the fight against the cursed unkerlanters hed been saying the same thing for weeks at first the healing mages had ignored him then hed been turned over to mere physicians whod also ignored him this one said well we shall see what we shall see he pressed a hearing tube against the right side of spinellos chest if youd be so kind as to cough for me after taking a deep breath spinello coughed he also had the algarvian fondness for overacting with the energy he put into his coughs he might have been at deaths door from consumption there you quack he said when he let the racking spasm end does that satisfy you perhaps fortunately for him the physician was harder to offend than most of his countrymen instead of getting angry or instead of continuing the conversation through seconds as some might have done the fellow just asked did that hurt no not a bit spinello lied without hesitation hed taken a snipers beam in the chest powers above a snipers beam right through the chest down in sulingen he had the feeling hed hurt for years to come if not for the rest of his life that being so he could he had to deal with the pain i was listening to you the physician said so that you know i dont believe you not a word of it so that you know sirrah i dont care what you believe spinello hopped down from the infirmary bed on which hed been sitting and glared at the physician he had to look up his nose not down it for the doctor overtopped him by several inches he was a bantam rooster of a man but strong for his size and very quick he also had a powerful will under his gaze the physician gave back a pace before checking himself voice soft and menacing spinello demanded will you write me out the certificate that warrants me fit to return to duty to his surprise the physician said aye he reached into the folder hed set on the bed and pulled out a printed form in fact i have filled it out all but the signature he plucked a pen and a sealed bottle of ink from the breast pocket of his tunic inked the pen and scrawled something that might have been his name or might equally have been an obscenity in demotic gyongyosian then he handed spinello the completed form this will permit you to return to duty major it doesnt warrant you as fit because you arent fit but the kingdom needs you and youre unlikely to fall over dead at the first harsh breeze powers above keep you safe he bowed and spinello bowed in return more deeply than the physician had that was an extraordinary courtesy as a count he surely outranked the other man who was bound to be only a commoner but the physician had given him what he wanted most in all the world he bowed again i am in your debt sir with a sigh the physician said why a man should be so eager to rush headlong into danger has always been beyond me you said it yourself algarve needs me spinello replied now tell me at once is it true the last of our brave lads have had to yield themselves in sulingen its true the physician said grimly the crystallomancers cant reach anyone there and the unkerlanters are shouting themselves hoarse at the victory not a word about the price we made them pay spinello cursed the algarvians had fought their way into sulingen the summer before fought their way into it and never fought their way out again south beyond the wolter river lay the mamming hills full of the cinnabar that made dragonfire burn so hot and fierce take sulingen storm over the wolter seize the mines in the hills it had all seemed so straightforward it would have been too had the unkerlanters not fought like demons for every street for every manufactory for every floor of every block of flats and now even though swemmels men had as the physician said surely paid a great price an algarvian army was gone gone as if it had never been i hope they send me west again in a tearing hurry spinello said and the physician rolled his eyes spinello pointed to the closet at the far end of the room im sick of these cursed hospital whites is my uniform in there if you mean the one in which you came here major no the physician replied that one as i hope you will understand is somewhat the worse for wear but a majors uniform does await you aye one moment he went over to the closet set a hand on the latch and murmured softly there now it will open to your touch we couldnt very well have had you escaping before you were even close to healed i suppose not spinello admitted theyd known him all right he walked over to the closet and tried the latch it did open it hadnt before hed tried a good many times with a squeak of dry hinges the door opened too there on hooks hung a tunic and kilt of severe military cut the tunic he saw to his pride had on it a wound ribbon he was entitled to that ribbon and he would wear it he got out of the baggy infirmary clothes and put on the uniform it was baggy too baggy enough to make him angry couldnt they have found a tailor who wasnt drunk he snapped it is cut to your measure major the physician answered your former measure i should say youve lost a good deal of flesh since you were wounded this much spinello didnt want to believe it but he couldnt very well call the physician a liar either also hanging in the closet was a broadbrimmed hat with a bright feather from some bird from tropical siaulia sticking up from the leather hatband spinello clapped it on his head hadnt shrunk anyhow that was a relief the physician said i have a mirror in my belt pouch if youd like to see yourself we dont keep many in infirmaries they might dismay patients like you and they might do worse than dismay others the ones unlucky enough to receive head wounds ah contemplating that was enough to make spinello decide he hadnt come out so bad after all in unwontedly quiet tones he said aye sir if youd be so kind of course major the physician took it out and held it up spinello whistled softly he had lost flesh his cheekbones were promontories just under the skin and the line of his jaw sharper than it had been since he left his teens an era more than a dozen years behind him now but his green eyes still gleamed and the attendants whod trimmed his coppery mustache and little chin beard and side whiskers had done a respectable job he tilted the hat to a jauntier angle and said how ever will the girls keep their legs closed when they see me walking down the street with a snort the doctor put the mirror away youre well enough all right he said go back to the west and terrorize the unkerlanter women oh my dear fellow spinello rolled his eyes a homelier lot youd never want to see built like bricks almost all of them i had better luck when i was on occupation duty in forthweg this little blond kaunian couldnt have been above seventeen his hands shaped an hourglass in the air and shed do anything i wanted and i do mean anything how many times have you told me about her since youve been in my care the physician asked her name was vanai and she lived in oyngestun and and every word of it true too spinello said indignantly he took a cloak from the closet and threw it on then dealt with shoes and stockings he was panting by the time he finished dressing hed spent too long flat on his back but he refused to admit how worn he was even to himself now then what formalities must i go through to escape your lair here he presented the certificate of discharge to the floor nurse after she signed it he presented it to the nursing station downstairs after someone there signed it spinello presented it to the soldier at the doorway the man had won the soft post with a right tunic sleeve pinned up short he pointed along the street and said the reassignment depot is three blocks that way sir can you walk it why is this a test spinello asked rather to his surprise the onearmed soldier nodded he realized it made a certain amount of sense you might browbeat a doctor into giving you a certificate but no one who couldnt walk three blocks had any business going off to the front the soldier signed the certificate quite legibly spinello asked him were you lefthanded before no sir the fellow answered i got this in forthweg early on ive had two and a half years to learn how to do things over again with a nod spinello left the infirmary for the first time since being brought there and headed in the direction the disabled soldier had given him before the war trapani had been a gay lively city as befit the capital of a great kingdom the gray gloom on the streets now had only a little to do with the overcast sky and the nasty cold mist in the air it was a thing of the spirit not of the weather people hurried along about their business without the strut and swagger that were as much a part of algarvian life as wine women mostly looked mousy which wasnt easy for spinellos redheaded compatriots the only men in the streets who werent in uniform were old enough to be veterans of the six years war a generation before or else creaking ancients even older than that and everyone men and women alike looked grim the news sheets the vendors sold were bordered in black sulingen had fallen all right it had been plain for a long time that the town would fall to the unkerlanters but no one here seemed to have wanted to believe it no matter how plain it was that made the blow even harder now that it struck home big signs outside the entrance named the reassignment depot spinello bounded up the marble steps threw the doors wide and shouted im fit for duty again the war is won some of the soldiers in there laughed some of them snorted some just rolled their eyes no matter who you are sir and no matter how great you are you still have to queue up a sergeant said spinello did though he hated lines when he presented the multiply signed certificate of discharge to another sergeant that worthy shuffled through files at last he said i have a regiment for you major if you care to take it that was a formality spinello drew himself up to stiff attention aye he exclaimed the catch in his breath was partly from his healing partly excitement the sergeant handed him his orders as well as a list of leyline caravans that would take him to the men who held the line somewhere in northern unkerlant they were waiting for him with bated breath they just didnt know it yet if you hurry sir theres a caravan leaving from the main depot for eoforwic in half an hour the sergeant said helpfully thatll get you halfway there spinello dashed out of the reassignment depot and screamed for a cab he made the leyline caravan he needed as he glided southwest out of trapani he wondered why he was in such a hurry to go off and perhaps get himself killed he had no answer any more than the physician had but he was marshal rathar wished with all his heart that he could have stayed down in southern unkerlant and finished smashing the algarvian invaders there they were like serpents you could step on them three days after you thought they were dead and theyd rear up and bite you in the leg rathar sighed he supposed general vatran could handle things till he got back king swemmel had ordered him to cottbus and when king swemmel ordered every unkerlanter obeyed as it was rathar wouldnt reach cottbus as fast as swemmel hoped and expected now that the algarvians had been crushed in sulingen and driven back from it more direct leyline routes between the south and the capital were in unkerlanter hands once more the trouble was too many of them werent yet usable retreating algarvian mages had done their best to sabotage them retreating algarvian engineers relentless pragmatists had buried eggs along the ley lines that traveled them after the algarvian mages efforts were overcome and so rathar had to travel almost as far out of a straight line to get from the vicinity of sulingen to cottbus as he had when coming south from cottbus to sulingen when things looked blackest the summer before the steersman for the caravan kept sending flunkies back to rathar with apologies for every zigzag the marshals displeasure carried weight after swemmel but a long long way after swemmel rathar was convinced only he knew how far he was the most powerful man in unkerlant but the marshal wasnt particularly displeased not when he didnt want to go to cottbus in the first place he said i do prefer not getting killed on the journey you know the steward whod brought him news of the latest delay had been pale under his swarthy skin now he breathed easier when the steward left the caravan car a breath of chill got in reminding the marshal it was winter and a savage unkerlanter winter at that outside inside with all the windows sealed with a redhot coal stove at each end of the car it might as well have been summer in desert zuwayza or possibly summer in a bake oven rathar sighed unkerlanter caravan cars were always like that in winter he rubbed his eyes the hot stuffy air never failed to give him a headache he yawned lowered the lamps and went to sleep he was still sleeping when the leyline caravan silently glided into cottbus an apologetic steward shook him awake yawning again the marshal pulled off the thin linen tunic hed been wearing and put on the thick wool one hed used in the caves and ruined houses that had been his headquarters buildings down in the south for good measure he added a heavy wool cloak and a fur cap with earflaps sweat rivered off him powers above get me out of here before i cook in my own juices he said hoarsely aye lord marshal the steward said and led him to the door at the end of the car he had to go past a stove to get there and did come perilously close to steaming then the steward opened the door and the frigid air outside hit him like a blow in the face cottbus was well north of sulingen and so enjoyed a milder climate but milder didnt mean mild rathar sneezed three times in quick succession as he walked down the wooden steps from the leyline car which floated a yard off the ground to the floor of the depot he pulled a handkerchief from his belt pouch and blew his large proudly curved nose your health lord marshal his adjutant said coming to attention and saluting as rathars feet hit the flagstones its good to see you again thank you major merovec rathar answered its good to be back in the capital what a liar what a courtier im getting to be he thought merovec gestured to the squad of soldiers behind him your honor guard sir and your bodyguard to make sure no algarvian assassin or grelzer turncoat does you harm on the way to the royal palace how generous of his majesty to provide them for me rathar said the soldiers looked blankfaced and tough typical unkerlanter farm boys they were no doubt equally typical in their willingness to follow orders no matter what those orders were if swemmel had ordered them to arrest him for instance they would do it regardless of the big stars on the collar tabs of his tunic swemmel stayed strong not least by allowing himself no strong subjects and rathar knew hed won a good deal of fame for his operations in and around sulingen if swemmel wanted to seize him he could rathar knew that and so he strode up to merovec and the unsmiling soldiers behind him i have a carriage waiting for you lord marshal his adjutant said and others for the guards here if you will come with me the carriage was only a carriage not a prison wagon the troopers got into four other carriages they took station around the one that carried rathar no an assassin wouldnt have an easy blaze at him the marshal didnt particularly worry about assassins king swemmel now king swemmel saw them behind every curtain and under every chair cottbus by night was dark and gloomy algarvian dragons still flew over to drop eggs on the unkerlanter capital the darkness helped thwart them even if they didnt come nearly so often or in such numbers as they had the winter before algarvian behemoths and footsoldiers had almost broken into cottbus then theyd been pushed back a good way since which meant a longer harder journey for king mezentios dragonfliers well what sort of juicy court gossip have you got for me rathar asked his adjutant major merovec stared even in the darkness his eyes glittered as they widened nnot much lord marshal he stammered rathar was normally indifferent to the petty and sometimes not so petty scandal that set tongues wagging at every court on the continent of derlavai and every court off it too horses hoofbeats muffled by snow on stone the carriages entered the great empty square around the royal palace surrounding the square were statues of the kings of unkerlant swemmels loomed twice as tall as any of the others rathar wondered how long the outsized image would endure in the reign of swemmels successor that was not a thought he could ever speak aloud inside the palace lamps seared eyes used to darkness the king had trouble sleeping which meant his servitors hardly slept at all his majesty will see you in the audience chamber a messenger told rathar the marshal hung the ceremonial sword of his rank on brackets in an anteroom to that chamber unsmiling guards patted him with intimacy few women would have dared use only after enduring that could he go on and then he had to prostrate himself before the king and face against the carpet recite his praises until given permission to rise at last king swemmel gave it as rathar climbed to his feet a knee clicked he wasnt so young as he had been the king said we wish to continue the rout of the cursed algarvians from our land punish them we command you his dark eyes flashed in his long pale face your majesty i aim to do just that rathar replied now that their army in sulingen is no more i can shift soldiers to my columns farther north with luck well bag most of the redheads still in the southwestern part of the kingdom trap em as neatly as we did the ones whod reached the wolter he knew he was exaggerating or rather that he would have to be very lucky indeed to bring off everything he had in mind the algarvians would have a lot to say about what he did and what he ended up unable to do getting his sovereign to understand that was one of the hardest jobs he had so far hed managed had he failed unkerlant would have a new marshal these days rathar didnt particularly fear for himself he did doubt the kingdom had a better officer to lead her armies swemmel said at last we have them on the run by the powers above we shall punish them as they deserve when king mezentio is in our hands well boil him alive as we served kyot kyot his identical twin had fought him for the throne and lost had he won he would have boiled swemmel and probably rathar with him though he might have contented himself with taking the soldiers head as far as rathar was concerned his king was putting the unicorns tail in front of its horn the marshal said this war is still a long way from won your majesty but swemmel had the bit between his teeth and trampled on and before we do well give mezentios cousin raniero the misnamed king of grelz an end to make mezentio glad hes just being boiled aye we will gloating anticipation filled his voice rathar did his best to draw the king back from dreams of revenge to what was real we have to beat the redheads first you know as i said i want to keep biting chunks out of their forces in unkerlant we bit out a big chunk when we took sulingen back but they can still hurt us if we get careless i aim to pin them against one river barrier after another make them fight at a disadvantage or else have to make a whole series of difficult retreats swemmel wasnt listening aye when raniero falls into our hands well flay him and draw him and unman him and oh whatever else strikes our fancy we almost ought to thank mezentio for him rathar said one of our own nobles on the grelzer throne in herborn would have brought more traitors to the algarvian side than raniero has a hope of luring traitors everywhere swemmel muttered everywhere his eyes darted this way and that well kill them all see if we dont during the twinkings war and even after it there had been a good many real plots against him there had also been a good many that existed only in his fevered imagination real plotters and imagined ones were equally dead now with no one to say who was which traitors to rathars relief swemmel wasnt looking at him almost desperately the marshal said as i was telling you your majesty our plans swemmel spoke in peremptory tones set all the columns moving now the sooner we strike the algarvians the sooner they shall be driven from our soil did he mean the soil of unkerlant or his own personal soil rathar often had trouble telling do you not agree your majesty that your armies have had more success when you waited till everything was ready before striking rathar asked hed had trouble getting swemmel to see that throughout the war he didnt want more trouble now swemmel of course cared nothing for what his marshal wanted swemmel cared only for what he wanted and now glaring down at rathar from his high seat he snapped we have given you an order you may carry it out or someone else may carry it out we care nothing about that we care only that we should be obeyed do you understand us sometimes a threat to resign would bring swemmel to his senses when he tried to order something uncommonly harebrained rathar didnt judge this would have been one of those times the king wouldnt have summoned him from the south for anything but a show of unquestioned allegiance and swemmel would remove him and likely remove his head if he balked rathar looked down at the carpet and sighed aye your majesty he said casting about in his mind for ways to say he obeyed while in fact doing what really needed doing and think not to evade our will with plausible excuses king swemmel barked he might not have been a very wise man but no denying he was clever rathar sighed again back before the derlavaian war broke out skarnu had been a marquis he still was a marquis when you got down to it but he hadnt lived like one for years and if the algarvian occupiers of his native valmiera ever got their hands on him he wouldnt live anymore at all this was what he got for carrying on the fight against the redheads after king gainibu surrendered had he made his peace with the conquerors he could have been living soft in the familial mansion on the edge of priekule the capital instead he found himself holed up in a dingy coldwater flat in ventspils an eastern provincial town of no great distinction indeed of no small distinction he could think of his sister still lived in that mansion he growled down deep in his throat krasta curse her had an algarvian lover skarnu had seen them listed as a couple in a news sheet colonel lurcanio and the marchioness krasta lurcanio curse him had come too close to catching skarnu not long before hed had to flee the farm where hed been living the widow hed come to love and the child his child she was carrying he hoped lurcanios men had only been after him and that merkela was safe hope was all he could do he didnt dare write to the farm outside the southern village of pavilosta if the algarvians intercepted the letter their mages might be able to use the law of contagion to trace it back to him powers below eat them he muttered he wanted to pour out his soul to merkela but the enemy silenced him as effectively as if theyd clapped a gag over his mouth he went to the grimy window and looked down at the street three stories down wan winter sunshine filtered between the blocks of flats that sat almost side by side not even sunshine though could make the cobbles in the streets the worn slates of the sidewalks and the sooty slushy snow in the gutters and in the corners by stairways anything but unlovely the wind shook barebranched trees their shifting shadows put skarnu in mind of groping grabbing skeleton hands blond valmierans in tunics and trousers trudged this way and that from what skarnu had seen nobody in ventspils did much more than trudge he wondered if he could blame that gloom on the algarvian occupation or if life in a provincial town would have been bloody dull even before the invaders came had he lived his whole life in ventspils he suspected he would have been gloomy most of the time himself up the street came a couple of algarvian soldiers or constables he didnt recognize them by their red hair like a lot of his countrymen they wore hats to fight the cold he didnt even recognize them by their pleated kilts though he soon noticed those no what set them apart was the way they moved they didnt trudge they strutted heads up shoulders back chests out they moved as if they had vital business to take care of and wanted everybody around them to know it algarvians skarnu said with fine contempt if they werent the most selfimportant people on the face of the earth he didnt know who was he laughed but not for long their pretensions would have been funnier if they hadnt dominated all the east of derlavai and then they came up the stairs to his block of flats when he saw that he didnt hesitate for a moment he grabbed a cloth cap stuffed it down as low on his head as it would go and left his flat closing the door behind him as quietly as he could his wool tunic would keep him warm for a while outside he hurried to the stairs and started down them as hed thought he would he passed the algarvians coming up he didnt look at them they didnt look at him hed gambled that they wouldnt their orders were probably something like arrest the man you find in flat but there wouldnt be any man in flat to arrest when they got there if skarnu hadnt seen them coming vapor puffed from his mouth and nose as he opened the front door and went out onto the street he was already hurrying up the sidewalk in the direction from which the redheads had come a clever touch he thought when he realized he didnt know for a fact that theyd been after him he laughed though it wasnt funny how likely that this block of flats held two men the algarvians wanted badly enough to send their own after him instead of entrusting the job to valmieran constables not very a youth waved a news sheet in his face algarvians smash unkerlanter drive south of durrwangen he cried the news sheets of course printed only what king mezentios ministers wanted valmiera to hear theyd stopped talking about sulingen for instance as soon as the battle there was lost they made the victories they reported these days sound like splendid triumphs instead of the desperate defensive struggles they had to be skarnu strode past the vendor without a word without even shaking his head he turned a corner and then another and another and another picking right or left at random each time if the algarvians came bursting out of the block of flats hot on his trail they wouldnt have an easy time following him he chuckled he didnt know himself where he was going so why should the redheads that didnt stay funny long though he had to pause and get his bearings not easy in ventspils since he didnt know the town well in priekule he could have looked for the kaunian column of victory that would have told him where in the city he was till the algarvians knocked it down the victory it celebrated was one the kaunian empire had won over the barbarous algarvic tribes a victory that still rankled the tribesmens barbarous descendants more than a millennium and a half later though he took longer than he should have he finally did figure out where he was then he needed to figure out where to go that had only one answer really the tavern called the lion and the mouse but the answer wasnt so good either were the algarvians after him in particular or were they trying to smash all the resistance in ventspils if the former they might know nothing of the tavern if the latter they were liable to be waiting in force around or inside it he muttered under his breath a woman passing by gave him a curious look he stared back so stonily she hurried on her way as if shed never looked at him at all maybe she thought him a madman or a derelict as long as she didnt think him one of the handful who kept the fight against algarve alive he cared nothing for her opinion ive got to go he realized the lion and the mouse was the only place where he could hope to meet other irregulars they could find him somewhere else to stay or spirit him out of ventspils altogether without them skarnu didnt want to think about that one man alone was one man helpless he approached the tavern with all the caution hed learned as a captain in the valmieran army before the algarvians used dragons and behemoths to smash that army into isolated chunks and then beat it he couldnt see anything that looked particularly dangerous around the place he wished raunu his veteran sergeant were still with him having been in the army as long as skarnu was alive raunu knew far more about soldiering than skarnu had learned in something under a year but skarnu was a marquis and raunu the son of a sausage seller so skarnu had led the company of which theyd both been part after twice walking past the doorway to the lion and the mouse skarnu the mouse decided he had to put his head in the lions mouth scowling he walked into the tavern the burly fellow behind the bar was a man hed seen before which meant nothing if the man was in bed with the algarvians but there at a table in the far corner of the room skarnu spied a painter who was one of the leaders of the underground in ventspils unless he proved a traitor too the algarvians didnt know about this place skarnu bought a mug of ale nothing wrong with ventspils ale and sat down across the table from him well hello pavilosta the painter said didnt expect to see you here today that sounded polite but harsh suspicion lay under it skarnus answering grimace was harsh too he didnt care to have even the name of the village hed come from mentioned out loud after a pull at the ale he said a couple of redheads came into my block of flats an hour ago if i hadnt spied em outside they wouldve nabbed me well we cant expect the algarvians to love us not after we yanked those sibian dragonfliers right out from under their noses the local underground leader said theyd want to poke back if they saw the chance to do it i understand that like the painter skarnu kept his voice low but are they after underground folk in ventspils or me in particular why would they be after you in particular the other man asked then he paused and thumped his forehead with the heel of his hand i keep forgetting youre not just pavilosta youre the chap with a sister in the wrong bed thats one way to put it aye skarnu said it was in fact a gentler way to put it than he would have used it also avoided mentioning his noble blood common women could and did sleep with the redheaded occupiers too after a pull on his own mug of ale the painter said she knew where you were down in pavilosta she did or else the algarvian shes laying did but how would she know youve come to ventspils how would the redheads know either obvious answer is theyre squeezing somebody between pavilosta and here skarnu said i had a narrow escape getting out of there they might have stumbled onto somebody who helped me he named no names what the other fellow didnt know king mezentios men and their valmieran stooges couldnt squeeze out of him skarnu wouldnt have been so careful about security even during his duty in the regular valmieran army if theyve got hold of a link in the chain between here and there that could be unpleasant the painter said every time we take in a new man we have to wonder if hes the fellow whos going to sell the lot of us to the algarvians and one fine day one of them will do it someone skarnu had seen once or twice before strolled into the lion and the mouse instead of ordering ale or spirits he spoke in casual tones redheads and their dogs are heading toward this place some people might not want to hang around and wait for them he didnt even look toward the corner where skarnu and the painter sat skarnus first impulse was to leap and run then he realized how stupid that was it would make him stand out which was the last thing he wanted and even if it didnt where would he go ventspils wasnt his town aside from the men of the underground he had no friends and hardly any acquaintances here after a last quick swig the painter set down his empty mug maybe wed better not hang around and wait for them he said with which conclusion skarnu could hardly disagree skarnu didnt bother finishing his ale he left the mug on the table and followed the other man out where do we go now he asked there are places the painter said an answer that wasnt an answer after a moment skarnu realized the underground leader had security concerns of his own sure enough the man went on i dont think well have to blindfold you im so glad to hear it skarnu had intended the words to be sarcastic they didnt come out that way the unkerlanters might have the algarvians on the run in the distant west but here in valmiera the redheads could still make their handful of foes dance to their tune fernao was studying his kuusaman that was he understood a curious thing for a lagoan mage to do though lagoas and kuusamo shared the large island off the southeastern coast of derlavai his countrymen were in the habit of looking in the direction of the mainland and not toward their eastern neighbors whom they usually regarded as little more than amusing rustics that was true even though a lot of lagoans had some kuusaman blood fernaos height and his red hair proved him of mainly algarvic stock but his narrow slanted eyes showed it wasnt pure lagoans also did their best not to notice that kuusamo outweighed their kingdom about three to one outside a storm that had blown up from the south did its best to turn this stretch of kuusamo into the land of the ice people the wind howled snow drifted around the hostel the soldiers of the seven princes had run up here in the middle of nowhere the district of naantali lay so far south the sun rose above the horizon for only a little while each day down on the austral continent of course it wouldnt have risen at all for a while on either side of the winter solstice having seen the land of the ice people in midwinter fernao knew that all too well here he had a coalburning stove not the brazier hed fed lumps of dried camel dung i shall shovel snow he murmured a particularly apt paradigm you will shovel snow he she it will shovel snow we shall shovel snow youplural will shovel snow they someone knocked on the door one moment fernao called not in kuusaman but in classical kaunian the language he really did share with his kuusaman colleagues just getting to the door took rather more than a moment he had to lever himself up from his stool with the help of a cane grab the crutch that leaned by the chair and use both of them to cross the room and reach the doorway and all of that he thought as he opened the door was progress hed almost died when an algarvian egg burst too close to him down in the land of the ice people his leg had been shattered only in the past few days had the kuusaman healers released what was left of it from its immobilizing plaster prison pekka stood in the hall outside hello she said also in classical kaunian the widespread language of scholarship i hope i did not interrupt any important calculations i hate it when people do that to me no fernao smiled down at her like most of her countrymen the exceptions being those who had some lagoan blood she was short and slim and dark with a wide face high cheekbones and eyes slanted like his own he switched to her language to show what he had been doing we shall shovel snow youplural will shovel snow they will shovel snow she laughed against her golden skin her teeth seemed even whiter than they were a moment later she sobered and nodded your accent is quite good she said first in kaunian then in her own tongue thanks fernao said in kuusaman then he returned to the classical tongue i have always had a knack for learning languages but yours is different from any other i have tried to pick up awkwardly he stepped aside please come in sit down make yourself at home i wish i were at home pekka said i wish my husband were at home too i miss my family her husband fernao knew was no less a sorcerer than she but one of a more practical bent as pekka walked past she asked were you using the stool or the bed i do not want to disturb you the stool fernao answered pekka had already sat down on the bed by the time he closed the door hobbled back across the chamber and carefully lowered himself onto the stool he propped the crutch where he could easily reach it before saying and what can i do for you this morning he knew what he wouldnt have minded doing not for her but with her hed always reckoned kuusaman women too small and skinny to be very interesting but was changing his mind about pekka that was probably because working alongside her hed come to think of her as colleague and friend to admire her wits as well as her body whatever the reason his interest was real he kept quiet about it by the way she spoke about leino her husband and uto her son she wasnt interested in him or in anyone but them making advances would have been worse than rude it would have been futile though a good theoretical sorcerer fernao was a practical man in other ways stretching out his legs in front of him he waited to hear what pekka had to say she hesitated something she seldom did at last she answered have you done any more work on ilmarinens contention which contention do you mean he said as innocently as he could he has so many of them that got him another smile from pekka like the first it didnt last long you know which one she said no matter how many strange ideas ilmarinen comes up with only one really matters to us now and that was also true fernao sighed he didnt like admitting even to himself how true it was here though he had no choice pointing out the window the doubleglazed window that helped hold winter at bay in the direction of the latest release of sorcerous energy the kuusaman experimental team had touched off he said that was fresh grass summer grass he pulled up from the middle of the crater i know pekka said softly fresh grass in the middle of this she pointed out the window too at the snow swirling past in the grip of the whistling wind more softly still she added it can mean just one thing fernao sighed again the calculations suggested it all along so did the other experimental results no wonder ilmarinen got angry at us when we didnt want to face what that meant pekkas laugh was more rueful than anything else if ilmarinen had not got angry over that he would have got angry over something else she said getting angry and getting other people angry is what he enjoys more than anything else these days but she stopped she didnt want to say what followed logically from ilmarinens grass either in the end she did we really do seem to be drawing our energy in these experiments by twisting time itself there it was out fernao didnt want to hear it any more than hed wanted to say it but now that pekka had said it he could only nod aye that is what the numbers say sure enough for once he was glad to be speaking classical kaunian it let him sound more detached more objective and a lot less frightened than he really was i think the numbers also say we can only draw energy from it when we send one set of animals racing forward and the other racing back pekka said we cannot do any more meddling than that can we she sounded frightened too as if she were pleading for reassurance fernao gave her what reassurance he could i read the calculations the same way so does siuntio and so does ilmarinen for all his bluff and bluster i know pekka said i have had long talks with both of them talks much more worried than this one maybe she found kaunian distancing too but she added what if the algarvians are also calculating calculating and coming up with different answers for effect fernao tried a few words of kuusaman then were all in trouble pekka let out a startled laugh then nodded fernao wished he could have gone on in her language but had to drop back into classical kaunian but most of their mages are busy with their murderous magic and the rest really should get the same results we have powers above i hope so pekka exclaimed the energy release is dreadful enough as is but the world could not stand having its past revised and edited before fernao could answer someone else knocked on the door pekka sprang up and opened it before fernao could start what was for him the long slow involved process of rising oh hello my dear master siuntio said in kuusaman before courteously switching to classical kaunian so fernao could follow i came to ask if our distinguished lagoan colleague would care to join me for dinner now i ask you the same question as well i would be delighted sir fernao said and did struggle to his feet and i pekka agreed things may look brighter once we have some food and drink inside us a buffet waited in the dining room fernao piled kuusaman smoked salmon as good as any in the world on a chewy roll and added slices of onion and of hardcooked egg and pickled cucumber along with a mug of ale that made a dinner to keep him going till suppertime would you like me to carry those for you pekka asked if you would be so kind the plate anyhow fernao answered i can manage the mug now i have two hands but i would need three till not too long before hed had an arm in a cast as well as a leg then hed needed four hands and possessed only one pekka had built a sandwich almost as formidable as his own she did some substantial damage to it before asking siuntio master do you think you will find any loopholes in the spells we are crafting siuntio gently shook his head he looked more like a kindly grandfather than the leading theoretical sorcerer of his generation no he said we have been over this ground before you know i see extravagant energy releases aye far more extravagant than we could get from any other source but i see no way to achieve anything but that we cannot sneak back through the holes we tear in time and a good thing we cant too i agree fernao said gulping down a large mouthful of salmon to make sure his words came clear on both counts i agree i dont believe even ilmarinen will disagree on this siuntio said disagree on what ilmarinen asked striding into the dining hall as if naming him could conjure him up with a wispy white chin beard wild hair and gleaming eyes he might have been siuntios raffish brother but he too was a formidable mage disagree on what he repeated on the possibility of manipulating time along with extracting energy from it siuntio told him well that doesnt look like its in the math ilmarinen said on the other hand you never can tell he poured himself a mug of ale and then for good measure another now this is a proper dinner he declared as he sat down by fernao do you truly think the question remains unanswered fernao asked him you never can tell ilmarinen said again probably as much to annoy fernao as because he really believed it we havent been looking all that long and neither have the redheads excuse me the algarvians fernao had red hair too ilmarinen went on a good thing the algarvians are too taken up with killing people to power their magic to look anywhere else aye a very good thing he emptied the mugs in quick succession then went back and filled them again two a guard clattered his bludgeon against the iron bars of talsus cell come on you cursed traitor get up the guard shouted at him you think this is a hostel eh do you no sir i dont think that sir talsu replied as he sprang off his cot and stood at attention beside it he had to give a soft answer or else the guard and maybe three or four of his comrades would swarm into the cell and use their bludgeons on him instead of on the bars hed got one beating for talking back he didnt want another one youd cursed well better not the guard snarled before stamping down the hall to waken the prisoner in the next cell after not enough sleep talsu was glad when he couldnt see the ugly lout any more the prison guard was as much a jelgavan as he was a blond man who wore trousers but he served mainardo the younger brother king mezentio of algarve had installed on the jelgavan throne as readily as hed ever served king donalitu donalitu had fled when jelgava fell his dogs had stayed behind and wagged their tails for their new masters another jelgavan came by a few minutes later he shoved a bowl into talsus cell the barley mush in the bowl smelled sour almost nasty talsu spooned it up just the same if he didnt eat what the gaolers fed him he would have do make do on the cockroaches that swarmed across the floor of his cell or if he was extraordinarily lucky on the rats that got whatever the roaches missed and got their share of roaches too the cell didnt even boast a chamber pot he pissed in a corner hoping he was drowning some roaches as he did it then he went back and sat down on his cot he had to be plainly visible when the guard collected his bowl and spoon if he wasnt the guard would assume hed used the tin spoon to dig a hole through the stone floor and escape then he would suffer and so would everyone else in this wing of the prison as always the guard came by with a list and a pen he scooped up the bowl and the spoon checked them off on the list and glared through the bars at talsu dont look so bloody innocent he growled youre not if you were you wouldnt be here you hear me aye sir i hear you sir talsu answered if he didnt sit there looking innocent the guards would decide he was insolent that rated a beating too as best he could tell he couldnt win of course you cant win fool he thought if you could you wouldnt be stuck here he felt like kicking himself but how could he have guessed that the silversmith who taught classical kaunian to wouldbe patriots in skrunda was in fact an algarvian catspaw as soon as talsu wanted to do more than learn the old language as soon as he wanted to strike a blow against the redheads who occupied his kingdom hed gone to kugu who was more likely to know how to put one foe of the algarvians in touch with others the logic was perfect or it would have been if mezentios men hadnt stayed a jump ahead algarvians had caught him theyd said he was in their hands but they must have decided he wasnt that important because theyd given him to their jelgavan henchmen for disposal thanks to the fears of jelgavas kings her dungeons had been notorious even before the redheads overran the kingdom talsu doubted theyd improved since after breakfast the jelgavan guards retreated to the ends of the corridors cautiously captives began calling back and forth from one cell to another they were cautious for a couple of good reasons talk was against the rules the gaolers could punish them for it no matter how innocuous their words were and if their words werent so innocuous but did get overheard talsu didnt like to think about what would happen then for the most part he kept quiet his corridors exercise period came at midmorning one by one the guards unlocked the cells come along their sergeant said dont dawdle dont give us any trouble no one seemed inclined to give them trouble they carried sticks now not truncheons along with his fellow unfortunates talsu shuffled down the corridor and out into the exercise yard there under the watchful eyes of the guards he walked back and forth back and forth for an hour the stone walls were so high he got not a glimpse of the outside world he had no idea in what part of jelgava the prison was but he could look up and see the sky after spending the rest of the day locked away from light and air he found that precious beyond belief all right scum back you go the guard sergeant said when the exercise period was over now talsu stared down at the stone paving blocks so the guards couldnt see his glare the algarvians hadnt built this prison or the others much like it scattered over the face of jelgava jelgavan kings had done that to keep their own subjects in line but the redheads were perfectly willing to use the prisons and the guards as long as they kept their jobs didnt care whom they were guarding or for whom or why talsu sat back down on his cot and waited for the bowl of mush that would be dinner it might even have a couple of bits of salt pork floating in it something to look forward to he thought the worst part of that was noticing how seriously he meant it but a guard strode up to the cell before dinnertime talsu son of traku he demanded aye sir talsu said the guard made a check on his list he unlocked the door and pointed a stick at talsus chest you will come with me he said interrogation what about my dinner talsu yelped he really had been looking forward to it they wouldnt save it for him he knew that all too well instead of answering the guard jerked his stick as if to say talsu wouldnt need to worry about dinner ever again if he didnt get moving right now having no choice he got moving even his interrogator was a jelgavan a man who wore the uniform of a constabulary captain he did not invite talsu to sit down indeed but for his stool and those on which two armed guards perched the room had nowhere to sit one of the guards rose and positioned a lamp so it shone straight into talsus face it was bright enough to make him blink and try to look away so the constabulary officer said you are another one who betrayed his lawful sovereign what have you got to say for yourself nothing sir talsu answered nothing i could say would get me out of the trouble im in anyhow no there you are wrong the interrogator said give us the names of those who plotted with you and things will start looking better for you in short order you may rest assured of that i know whereof i speak i dont know any names talsu said as he had the first time theyd bothered questioning him how could i know any names nobody did any plotting with me i was all by myself and your man got me he didnt try to hide the selfreproach in his voice you assert then that your father knew nothing of your treason it wasnt treason not in talsus eyes how could turning on the algarvians be treason for a jelgavan it couldnt he didnt think the constable felt that way though so all he said was no sir you ask around in skrunda hes made more clothes for the algarvians in town than anybody else there the interrogator didnt pursue it from which talsu concluded hed already asked around and had got the same answers talsu had given now he tried a new tack you also assert your wife knew nothing of this of course i do talsu exclaimed in alarm he didnt try to hide i never said anything about it to gailisa by the powers above its the truth and yet she has plenty of reasons for disliking algarvians is that not so the interrogator went on is it not so that she saw an algarvian soldier stab you before you were married aye that is so talsu admitted what he could hardly deny but i never told her about anything if i had told her about anything she probably would have wanted to come with me i didnt want that to happen i see the jelgavan in algarvian service said in tones suggesting talsu hadnt helped himself or gailisa with that answer you are not making this easy you could as i have said if only you would name names i havent got any names to give you talsu said the only name i know is kugu the silversmiths and hes been on your side all along i cant very well get him into trouble can i i would if i could he thought perhaps we can refresh your memory his interrogator said he rang a bell a couple of more guards strode into the chamber without a word they started working talsu over he tried to fight back but had no luck one against two was bad odds to begin with and the fellows with the sticks would have intervened had he got anywhere he didnt the bruisers had learned their trade in a nastier school than hed known even in the army and learned it well they had no trouble battering him into submission when the battering was done he could hardly see out of one eye he tasted blood though no teeth seemed broken one of his feet throbbed a guard had stamped down hard on it his ribs ached so did his belly calmly the interrogator said now then who else knew that you were plotting treason against king mainardo no one talsu gasped do you want me to make up names what good would that do you if you want to name some of your friends and neighbors go ahead the interrogator said we will haul them in and question them most thoroughly here is paper here is a pen go ahead and write but they wouldnt have done anything talsu said id just be making it up youd know i was just making it up suppose you let us worry about that the interrogator said once you make the accusations things will go much easier for you we might even think about letting you go i dont understand talsu said and that was true he had trouble understanding anything but his own pain the jelgavan constabulary captain didnt answer he just steepled his fingertips and waited so did the guards with sticks so did the bully boys whod beaten talsu it would be so easy talsu thought i could give them what they want and then they wouldnt hurt me anymore he started to ask the interrogator to hand him the pen and paper what happened to the people he might name didnt seem very important it would after all be happening to someone else but what would happen to him nothing that didnt seem likely all at once he saw the answer with horrid clarity if he gave the algarvians or rather their watchdog here a few names they would want more after he gave them a first batch how could he refuse to give them a second and then a third how could he refuse them anything after that he couldnt had kugu the silversmith started by making up a few names too talsu gathered himself there wasnt anybody else he said they beat him again before frogmarching him back to his cell hed expected they would hed hoped his armor of virtue would make the beating hurt less it didnt and he didnt get the bowl of mush hed missed when they took him away even so he slept well that night the blizzard screamed around the hostel in the barren wilderness of southeastern kuusamo it left pekka feeling trapped almost as if she were in prison she and her fellow mages had come here so they could experiment without anyone else but a few reindeer noticing that made good sense some of the things they were doing would have wrecked goodsized chunks of yliharma or kajaani even if they went perfectly and if some of those experiments escaped control pekkas shiver had nothing to do with the ghastly weather but while the blizzards raged pekka and her colleagues couldnt experiment at all if the rats and rabbits they were using froze to death the instant they went out of doors in spite of the best efforts of the secondary sorcerers they were useless that limited the amount of work the mages could do when pekka said as much over supper one evening ilmarinen nodded soberly we should use kaunians instead he declared no one cares whether they live or die after all the algarvians have proved as much pekka winced so did siuntio and fernao that ilmarinen spoke in classical kaunian to include fernao in the conversation only made his irony more savage after a moment siuntio murmured if we succeed here well keep the algarvians from slaughtering more kaunians will we i doubt it but ilmarinen checked himself well maybe a few and will we also keep swemmel of unkerlant from slaughtering his own folk to hold back the algarvians maybe a few again what we will do if were lucky is win the war this way its not the same thing and wed be fools to pretend it is right now winning the war will do fernao said if we do not do that nothing else matters siuntio nodded in mournful agreement he said even if we do win the war though the world will never again be what it was too many dreadful things have happened it will be worse if we lose pekka said remember yliharma a sorcerous algarvian attack had destroyed much of the capital of kuusamo had slain two of the seven princes and had come too close to killing her and siuntio and ilmarinen everyone remembers wars siuntio still sounded sad remembering what happened in the last one gives an excuse for fighting the next one not even ilmarinen felt like trying to top that gloomy bit of wisdom the mages got up from the table and went off to their own chambers as if trying to escape it but pekka soon discovered as she had before that being alone in her room was anything but an escape sometimes the mages would stay in the dining hall after supper arguing about what they had done or what they wanted to do or simply chatting not tonight they drifted apart and went upstairs to their chambers as if sick of one anothers company there were times when pekka was sick of her comrades company most often of ilmarinens then of fernaos and occasionally even of siuntios tonight wasnt one of those angry times she just didnt want to talk to anyone instead she worked on two letters side by side one was for her husband the other for her son leino would be able to read his own of course her sister elimaki who was taking care of uto would surely read aloud most of the one written to him even though he was learning his letters the letter to uto went well pekka had no trouble writing the things any mother should say to her son those were easy and flowed from her pen as easily as they flowed from her heart she loved him she missed him she hoped he was being a good little boy with uto often a forlorn hope the words the thoughts were simple and straightforward and true writing to leino was harder she loved him and missed him too missed him with an ache that sometimes made her empty bed seem the loneliest place in the world those things were easy enough to say even though she knew other eyes than his would also see them functionaries serving the seven princes studied all outgoing correspondence to make sure no secrets were revealed but she wanted to tell her husband more she couldnt even name the mages with whom she was working for fear that knowledge would fall into the algarvians hands and give them clues they shouldnt have she had to talk about personalities in indirect terms a surprisingly difficult exercise she had to talk about the work in which they were engaged in even more indirect terms she hadnt been able to tell leino all that much about it even when theyd been together he hadnt asked either hed known when silence was important and respected the need for it weve had simply appalling weather lately she wrote if it were better we could do more that seemed safe enough most of kuusamo had appalling weather through most of the winter hearing about it wouldnt tell an algarvian spy where she was and bad weather could interfere with any number of things not all of them things in which a spy would be interested i hope to be able to see you before long shed been told she might be able to leave for a little while in the not too indefinite future but even if she did manage to get away could leino escape his training as a proper military mage at the same time she thought he should have stayed in a sorcerous laboratory improving the weapons kuusaman soldiers would take into battle but the seven princes thought otherwise and their will counted for more than hers sighing she stared down at the page she wanted to tear it up and throw the pieces in the wastebasket she had to be able to do better than the words shed put down the words that seemed so flat so useless even so stupid what would leino think when he saw them that hed married a halfwit hell understand she thought im sure hes learning plenty of things he cant tell me too most of her believed that just enough had doubts though to leave all of her upset and worried she jumped when someone knocked on the door springing away from her letters was something of a relief even arguing abstruse theoretical calculations with ilmarinen seemed more appealing than trying to say things she couldnt say without having them cut out of her letter before leino ever saw it but when she opened the door she found fernao standing there not ilmarinen the lagoan mage leaned on his stick and had his crutch stuck under his other arm i hope i am not disturbing you he said in careful classical kaunian not even a little bit pekka said in kuusaman she started to repeat that in the scholarly tongue but fernaos nod showed hed followed her come in she went on in kaunian now sit down what can i do for you i thank you he said and made his slow way into her chamber she took a couple of steps back not only to get out of his way but to keep him from looming over her quite so much lagoans were almost uncouthly tall maybe fernao sensed what she felt for he sank onto one of the stools in the room or maybe hes just glad to get off his feet pekka thought had she been injured as fernao was she knew she would have been she turned the chair on which shed been sitting to write away from the desk shall i make you some tea she asked she couldnt be much of a hostess here but she could do that fernao shook his head no thank you he said if you do not mind i can talk with you without thinking i am once more a student bearding a professor in his den pekka laughed i often have that feeling myself around siuntio and ilmarinen i think even the grandmaster of your kingdoms guild of mages would have it around them grandmaster pinhiero is not the most potent mage ever to come out of our universities fernao said but he would speak his mind to anyone even to king swemmel of unkerlant lagoans had always had a reputation for speaking their minds regardless of whether doing so was a good idea pekka asked would that make grandmaster pinhiero a hero or a fool without a doubt fernao answered pekka chewed on that for a little while before deciding it was another joke and laughing again fernao continued every time i see how far you kuusamans have come it amazes me why is that pekka knew her tone was tart but couldnt help it because you lagoans do not think kuusamo worth noticing at all most of the time that probably has something to do with it he said which caught her by surprise we did notice you when it came to declare war against algarve i will say that we would have done it sooner had we not feared you might take mezentios side and assail us from behind ah pekka found herself nodding aye i knew people who wanted to do exactly that she remembered a party at elimakis house some of the friends of elimakis husband olavin the banker had been eager to take on lagoas olavin was serving the seven princes these days pekka suspected most of those friends were doing the same thing did you fernao said and pekka nodded again he shrugged well i can hardly say i am surprised it would have been unfortunate had that happened though even as pekka wondered how he meant the word he explained unfortunate for lagoas unfortunate for the whole world aye you are likely to be right pekka glanced over her shoulder at the letters to leino and uto then back to fernao may i ask you something as if he were a great noble he inclined his head to her of course how do you stand it here cut off not just from your family but from your kingdom as well fernao said for one thing i have not got much in the way of family no wife no children and i am not what you would call close to either of my sisters they never have understood what being a mage means and for another the work we are doing here matters it matters so much or may matter so much i would sooner be here than anywhere else that was a more thoughtful answer than pekka had expected she wondered how long fernao had been waiting for someone to ask a question like hers quite a while she guessed which might also be a measure of his loneliness why have you not got a wife she asked and then realizing she might have gone too far she quickly added you need not answer that but the lagoan didnt take offense instead he started to laugh not because i would rather have a pretty boy if that is what you mean he said i like women fine thank you very much but i have never found one i liked enough and respected enough to want to marry her after a moment he held up his hand i take it back i have found a couple like that but they were already other mens wives oh pekka said and then half a beat slower than she might have aye i can see how that would be hard was he looking at her she didnt look over at him not for a little while she didnt want to know you have things you were doing i see awkwardly fernao levered himself to his feet i shall not keep you may you have a pleasant evening he made his slow way to the door and you pekka said she had no trouble looking at his back but when he had gone she found she couldnt continue the letter to leino she put it aside hoping shed have more luck with it in the morning ealstan enjoyed walking through the streets of eoforwic much more these days than he had a few weeks before true the algarvians still occupied what had been the capital of forthweg true king penda still remained in exile in lagoas true a kaunian whose sorcerous disguise as a forthwegian was penetrated still had dreadful things happen to him and yet sulingen was scrawled in chalk or charcoal or whitewash or paint on one or two walls or fences in almost every block up till now a lot of forthwegians had been sullenly resigned to algarvian occupation king mezentios men looked like winning the war most people most people who werent kaunians anyhow had got on with their lives as best they could in spite of that ugly weight hanging over them now even though the algarvians still held every inch of their kingdom some of them didnt a couple of algarvian constables strode past ealstan their height and red hair separated them from the forthwegians their kingdom had overcome so did the pleated kilts they wore and so did their swagger no matter what had happened to their countrymen down in sulingen they showed no dismay but a forthwegian behind ealstan shouted get out of here you whoresons go home both algarvians jerked as if stuck with pins the shout had been in forthwegian but theyd understood they whirled one grabbing for his club the other for his stick for a dreadful moment ealstan thought they thought hed yelled then to his vast relief he saw they were looking past him not at him one of them pointed toward a forthwegian whose black beard was streaked with gray they both strode purposefully by ealstan and toward the older man he stared this way and that as if wondering whether flight or holding still was more dangerous before he had to find an answer someone from farther up the street someone behind the constables now someone they couldnt see cried out aye bugger off again the algarvians spun again they hurried past ealstan again they seized no one for more insults rained down on them whenever they turned their backs algarvians often had tempers that burst like eggs these redheads proved no exception one of them shook his fist and shouted in pretty fluent forthwegian you fornicating bigmouths you yell much more we treat you all like stinking kaunians to leave no doubt about what he meant his partner stuck his chin in the air and drew a forefinger across his throat shame ealstan yelled that might have got him into trouble but other forthwegians were also yelling and yelling worse things as ealstan knew too well most of them cared little about what happened to the kaunian minority in forthweg but they all cared about what happened to them the constable whod shouted the threat was the one whod taken the stick off his belt cursing now in his own language he blazed between a couple of forthwegians standing not far from him his beam missed them both but bit into the wooden wall of the wineshop behind them the wall began to smolder the forthwegians fled so did everyone else on the street ealstan wasted no time ducking around the first corner he came to he kept on running after that too the hem of his long wool tunic flapping just below his knees those bastards have gone daft another man making himself scarce said whats daft about it ealstan returned bitterly they probably get a bonus for anybody they blaze when the other fellow didnt argue with him he decided hed made his point having made it he went right on trotting he didnt know whether a new round of rioting was about to flare up in eoforwic and didnt care to stay around to find out that was the trouble with people feeling feisty no matter how much trouble they stirred up they still couldnt get rid of the algarvians one of these days though ealstan murmured aye one of these days he heard the longing in his own voice mezentios men had been sitting on forthweg for three and a half years now he smiled when he passed another scribbled sulingen surely they couldnt hold down his kingdom forever his own block of flats lay in a poor part of town one already scarred again and again by rioting he wouldnt have minded seeing another round of that if it meant throwing mezentios men out of eoforwic since he didnt think it would he was glad things seemed quiet the stairwell smelled of stale cabbage and staler piss he sighed as he trudged up toward his flat hed been used to better in gromheort before he had to flee the eastern town and come to the capital as a matter of fact he could afford better here but staying in a district where no one cared about you or what you were and no one expected you to be anybody much had advantages too he walked down the hall and knocked on the door to his flat once twice once a scraping noise came from inside as vanai lifted the bar that held the door closed his wife worked the latch and let him in he gave her a hug and kissed her the magecraft that hid her kaunianity and made her look forthwegian made her look astonishingly like a particular forthwegian his older sister conberge hed needed a while before that stopped bothering him we could stop using the coded knock you know he said now that you dont look kaunian anymore theres not much point to it i still like to know its you at the door she answered that made ealstan smile all right he said and sniffed what smells good nothing very exciting vanai told him just barley porridge with a little cheese and some of those dried mushrooms i got from the grocer the other day must be the mushrooms ealstan said which made vanai smile and nod in turn both forthwegians and the kaunian minority in forthweg were mad for mushrooms ealstan reached out and stroked her hair you must be glad to be able to go to the grocers yourself you have no idea vanai said ealstan couldnt argue with her until she no longer looked like what she was shed had to stay holed up inside the flat had an algarvian spotted her on the street or had a forthwegian betrayed her to the redheads she would have been taken off to the kaunian district and then all too likely shipped west so her life energy could help power the sorceries the algarvians used in their war against unkerlant ealstan went into the kitchen pulled the stopper from a jar of wine and filled two cups he carried one of them back to vanai and raised the other in salute to freedom he said or something close to it anyhow vanai answered but she did drink to the toast aye something close to it ealstan agreed maybe something getting closer too he told her how the forthwegians had given the algarvian constables a hard time good she said i wish id been there after a moment the fierce smile slipped from her face of course if id been there looking the way i really do theyd have been just as happy to throw rocks at me and yell dirty kaunian her eyes held ealstans as if challenging him to deny it he looked away he had to look away the most he could do was mumble were not all like that vanais gaze softened of course not if you were like that id be dead now but too many forthwegians are she shrugged nothing to be done about it or nothing i can see come on supper should be ready after supper ealstan read a book while vanai cleaned the dishes and silverware hed brought a lot of books home while she was trapped in the flat reading was almost the only thing shed been able to do while he went out and cast accounts and got them enough money to keep going he read them too some the classics hed had to study in his academy in gromheort proved much more interesting when he read them because he wanted to than when they were forced down his throat when vanai came out of the kitchen she sat down on the sofa beside him she had a book waiting on the rickety table in front of the sofa they read side by side for a while in companionable silence presently ealstan slipped his arm over vanais shoulder if shed gone on reading he would have left it there for a while and then withdrawn it one thing hed learned was that she didnt care to have affection forced on her but she smiled set down her book a forthwegian history of the glory days of the kaunian empire and snuggled against him before long they went back to the bedchamber together making love was the other thing theyd been able to do freely when vanai was trapped in the flat and because ealstan was only eighteen even now theyd been able to do it pretty often afterwards they lay side by side lazy and happy and soon to be ready to sleep ealstan reached out and ran his fingers through vanais hair some people hed heard eventually grew bored with making love maybe that was true he pitied those people if so when he woke the next morning rain was drumming against the bedchamber windows winter was the rainy season in forthweg as in most northerly lands yawning ealstan opened one eye rain sure enough he opened the other eye and glanced over at vanai he frowned her features had changed her hair remained dark it would she regularly dyed it but it looked straight now not wavy her face was longer her nose straight not proudly hooked her skin had matched the swarthy tone of his now it was fairer so the blood underneath showed through pink before long the rain woke her too as soon as her eyes opened ealstan said your spells worn off those eyes should have seemed dark brown but they were their true grayish blue again vanai nodded ill fix it after breakfast i dont think anyone will come bursting in to catch me looking like a kaunian till then all right ealstan said dont forget she laughed at him im not likely to you know and she didnt after theyd washed down barley bread and olive oil with more red wine vanai took a length of yellow yarn and a length of dark brown twisted them together and began to chant in classical kaunian the spell was of her own devising an adaptation of a forthwegian charm in a little book called you too can be a mage that hadnt worked as it should have thanks to the training shed had from her scholarly grandfather the one shed made did as soon as she spoke the last word of the charm her face indeed her whole body returned to its forthwegian appearance kaunians in eoforwic and throughout forthweg used that same spell now a lot of them had escaped from the districts in which the redheads had sealed them so theyd be handy when algarve needed the life energy they could give mezentios men werent happy about that ealstan was he kissed vanai and said if these were imperial times youd come down in history as a great heroine she answered in kaunian something she seldom did since taking on a forthwegian seeming if these were imperial times i wouldnt need such sorcery her voice was bleak ealstan wished he could disagree with her since he couldnt he did the next best thing he kissed her again whether you are remembered or not you are still a heroine he said and had a demon of a time understanding why she suddenly started to weep bembo cursed under his breath as he prowled through the streets of gromheort oraste his partner didnt bother keeping his voice down gromheort lay in eastern forthweg not far from the border with algarve and a good many locals understood algarvian the constable kept cursing anyway miserable kaunians he growled powers below eat them every stinking one they ought to have their throats cut the filthy buggers what with all the extra work theyve piled on our backs aye curse them bembo agreed he was tubbier than he should have been no braver than he had to be and heartily disapproved of anything resembling work especially work hed have to do oraste for his part disapproved of almost everything theyre liable to cost us the war the lousy stinking whoresons how are we supposed to scoop em up and send em west when they start looking like everybody else in this fornicating kingdom the way things are going over in unkerlant we need all the help we can get aye bembo repeated but on a less certain note the idea of rounding up kaunians and sending them toward the battlefront to be killed made his stomach turn unhappy flipflops he did it what choice did he have but to obey the sergeants and officers set over him but he had trouble believing it was the right thing to do oraste had no doubts oraste as far as bembo could see never had any doubts about anything he waved now not the usual extravagant algarvian gesture but a functional one one that took in the street ahead and the people on it any of these bastards any of em by the powers above could be a kaunian wrapped in magic cloaking and what can we do about it what can we do about it i ask you nothing much bembo answered mournfully if we start using forthwegians the way we use the kaunians here this whole kingdomll go up in smoke we havent got the men to hold it down not if we want to go on fighting the unkerlanters too its war oraste said you do what you have to do if we need forthwegians well take em we can sell it to the ones we dont take if the kaunians werent wolves in sheeps clothing we can say we wouldnt have to do this the forthwegiansll buy it or enough of em will they hate the blonds as much as we do i suppose so bembo didnt particularly hate anybody save perhaps people who made him work more than he cared to those people included sergeant pesaro his boss as well as the miscreants he all too often failed to run to earth look at em oraste waved again this time with a sort of animal frustration any one of them could be a kaunian any one i tell you you think i like the notion of those lousy blonds laughing at me not on your life pal he folded his beefy hands into fists when he didnt like something his notion of what to do next was pound it to pieces and whenever he got into that kind of mood hed sometimes lash out at his partner too he wasnt always fussy about whom or what he hurt so long as he was hurting someone or something to try to placate him bembo pointed to a man whose beard was going gray there that fellows a genuine forthwegian no doubt about it how dyou know brooding suspicion filled orastes voice dont you remember hes the one who had a son disappear off to powers above know where and his nephew murdered his other son he couldnt get anybody to do anything about it because the nephew was in plegmunds brigade oh him aye the fire in orastes hazel eyes faded a little well i cant say youre wrong this time bembo swept off his plumed hat and bowed as deeply as his belly would permit your servant he said my arse oraste said he pointed to the man with whom the assuredly genuine forthwegian was speaking how about him you going to tell me you know for sure hes no kaunian too how can i do that bembo asked reasonably as he and oraste came up to the two men the other fellow certainly looked like a forthwegian a whitehaired whitebearded rather dissoluteseeming old forthwegian but what else is he likely to be hes a blowhard ill tell you that sure enough the old man was doing most of the talking his companion mostly listening and then trying to get a word or two in edgewise as bembo and oraste came up to them the geezer waved his forefinger in the other mans face and spoke in impassioned forthwegian bembo couldnt understand more than one word in four but he knew an irate hectoring tone when he heard one the fellow the old man was talking to looked as if he wished he were elsewhere oraste rolled his eyes blowhard nothing hes a stinking windbag is what he is aye thats the truth instead of walking past the windbag bembo slowed and cocked his head to one side frowning and listening hard are you daft oraste said come on shut up bembo was usually a little afraid of his partner and wouldnt have dared speak to him like that most of the time but a moment later he gave a decisive nod it is by the powers above it is is what oraste asked bembo started to point then thought better of it that old forthwegian hes not a forthwegian or ill eat my club remember that noisy smartmouthed old kaunian whoreson we first ran into in oyngestun weve bumped into him a few times here in gromheort too after another couple of paces oraste nodded aye i do hes the one with the goodlooking granddaughter or he said she was his granddaughter anyway thats the one and thats him bembo said i recognize his voice whatever magecraft hes using it doesnt change that oraste took one more step then spun on his heel lets snag the son of a whore had bembo seen two constables bearing down on him he would have made himself scarce maybe the sorcerously disguised kaunian didnt see him and oraste the fellow was still doing his best to talk the other mans ear off he looked absurdly astonished when the algarvians laid hold of him what is the meaning of this he demanded in good algarvian that made bembo beam that smartmouthed kaunian spoke algarvian he was supposed to be some sort of scholar bembo said youre under arrest on suspicion of being a kaunian do i look like a kaunian the old man said not now bembo answered well take you back throw you in a cell and wait and see if the magic wears off if you still look ugly this same way tomorrow well turn you loose how much you want to bet we dont have to to his surprise the other forthwegian the genuine forthwegian tapped his belt pouch coins rang in there gentlemen he said also in fluent algarvian ill make it worth your while if you forget you ever saw this fellow no oraste spoke before bembo could bembo like a lot of algarvians didnt mind making some money on the side his constables salary didnt go very far but he nodded now he didnt want money no that wasnt quite true he wanted money but he wanted this old kaunians head more and so he too said no were going to take this fellow in and deal with him you are making a serious mistake the old man said i tell you i am as much a forthwegian as hestan here hestan there didnt say another word he didnt call the old man who looked like a forthwegian a liar but he didnt claim he was telling the truth either oraste started hauling the fellow off toward gromheorts gaol which was more crowded now than it had been when forthweg ruled the city what have we got here an algarvian gaoler asked when the constables frogmarched their prisoner into the building you catch him filching somebodys false teeth he laughed at his own wit bembo said suspicion of kaunianity lock him up and see if he still looks the same tomorrow the magic isnt even good for a day at a time from everything ive heard aha one of those the gaoler brightened howd you catch him cant tell much by his hair id say whites still white i recognized his voice bembo said proudly id run into him before when he looked like what he really is he made himself enough of a nuisance that he stuck in my mind i am a forthwegian the old man said i am not a kaunian shut up the gaoler told him well find out what you are he turned to a couple of his assistants who looked to have been shooting dice before bembo and oraste came in with their captive strip him dont leave him anything he can use to make more magic and make more work for us then throw him in a cell like the constable says well find out what he is aye one of his assistants said they did as they were told the old man squawked protests and tried to fight back but he might have been a threeyearold for all the good it did him the assistant gaolers led him away even though he was naked he kept on squawking now the gaoler reached into a desk drawer and pulled out some forms the paperwork if he really is a kaunian youll get the credit if hes not youll get the blame blame for what bembo clapped a hand to his forehead in melodramatic disbelief for bothering a miserable forthwegian wheres the blame in that theres no blame for bothering a forthwegian the gaoler agreed but if that old bugger turns out not to be a kaunian you get the blame for bothering me he favored the constables with a singularly unpleasant smile the sort of smile that made them scurry out of the gaol in a hurry once theyd got outside oraste gave bembo the same kind of smile youd better not be wrong he said bembo wanted to scurry away from his partner too but he couldnt he had to smile himself and nod and go on with his shift as soon as they came on duty the next day they hurried to the gaol the gaoler didnt start cursing the moment he set eyes on them which bembo took for a good sign well you boys got it straight the gaoler said he was a kaunian oraste thumped bembo on the shoulder hard enough to stagger him bembo heard something oraste missed was he asked aye the gaoler looked sour sometime during the night somebody gave him drawers and a tunic so he wouldnt freeze he twisted em up and hanged himself with em that killed the spell along with him like i say he was a kaunian all right filthy bastard oraste said we could have got some use out of his life energy thats right bembo said killing yourself like that ought to be punishable by death he laughed after a moment oraste and the gaoler did too ive sent the forms off to the constabulary barracks the gaoler said you deserve the credit like i told you yesterday that turned out to be a nice bit of work bembo beamed and preened and strutted he hadnt much minded hearing that the longwinded old kaunian was dead now that he knew hed get the credit for capturing him he didnt mind at all back in the days when he was a peasant like any other peasant in the unkerlanter duchy of grelz garivald had looked forward to winter with snowdrifts covering the fields hed spent most of his time indoors and a lot of that time drunk aside from taking care of the livestock that always shared the hut with his family and him what else was there to do but drink but he had no home now only a miserable little shelter not even worth dignifying with the name of hut in the middle of the forest west of herborn the capital of grelz munderics band of irregulars still held the woods still held away the algarvians whod overrun grelz and the grelzer puppets who served them but irregulars had a harder time of it in winter than they did in summer garivald came out of his shelter to look up through the pines and the barebranched birches to the sullen gray sky overhead it had snowed the day before he thought it was done for a while but you never could tell he took a couple of steps at each one his felt boots left a clear track in the snow footprints he growled vapor puffing from his mouth at the word i wish there were a magic to make footprints go away dont say things like that obilot exclaimed she was one of a handful of women in munderics band the women who ran off to fight the redheads and their local catspaws commonly had reasons much more urgent than those of their male counterparts obilot went on sadocs liable to get wind of it and try to cast a spell to be rid of them that might not be so bad garivald said odds are whatever magecraft he tried wouldnt do anything aye but it might go wrong so badly itd bring the algarvians down on our heads obilot said neither of them spoke of the benefits that would follow if sadocs spell succeeded neither of them thought sadocs spell if he made one would succeed he was the closest thing to a mage munderics band boasted as far as garivald was concerned he wasnt close enough he had no training whatever he was just a peasant whod fiddled around with a few charms if only he knew when to try and when not to garivald said mournfully he might be good enough for little things but he wont stay with those he wont even take a blaze at them if it isnt huge he doesnt want to bother with it who doesnt want to bother with what munderic asked the leader of the irregulars was a big hardfaced burly man he looked the part he played his temper suited him to it too scowling he went on who doesnt curse it we all have to do whatever we can obilot and garivald looked at each other garivald owed munderic his life if the irregulars hadnt plucked him from algarvian hands mezentios men would have boiled him alive for making songs that mocked them even so he didnt want to give munderic this particular idea and neither evidently did obilot munderic saw as much too his bushy eyebrows formed a dark bar over his eyes as he scowled who doesnt want to bother with what he repeated an angry rumble in his voice youd better tell me what you were talking about or youll be sorry it wasnt anything really garivald didnt want to antagonize munderic either theyd already had a couple of runins to his relief obilot nodded agreement but they didnt satisfy their leader come on out with it he barked if were going to make the invaders and the traitors howl weve got to do everything we can his glare was so fierce garivald reluctantly told him what he and obilot had been talking about to his dismay munderic beamed aye thatd be just what we need footprints in the snow make it hard for us to raid without giving ourselves away ill talk to sadoc theres no guarantee hell be able to do anything like that you know obilot said this time garivald was the one who nodded ill talk to him munderic said again well see what he can do if weve got a mage here we bloody well ought to get some use out of him dont you think he stamped away without waiting for an answer if we had a mage we could get some use out of him garivald said after the irregulars leader was out of earshot but weve got sadoc instead i know obilot said they exchanged wry smiles garivald knew a certain amount of relief hed quarreled with obilot not so long before too i never wanted to quarrel with anybody he thought i just wanted to live out my life back in zossen with my wife and my son and my daughter but zossen lay a long long way to the west fifty miles maybe even sixty he didnt know if hed ever see his family again obilot was no great beauty but she wasnt homely either he didnt want her angry at him hed been away from annore for most of a year now had obilot decided to slip under the blankets with him he wouldnt have thrown her out but she hadnt she didnt slip under the blankets with anyone and shed knifed a man who tried too persistently to slip under the blankets with her the other women in the band of irregulars acted much the same way garivald looked toward her but glanced away before their eyes met whatll you do next he thought sourly start coming up with love songs obilot said maybe nothingll come of it she didnt sound as if she believed that aye maybe garivald didnt sound as if he believed it either a couple of days later munderic gathered the irregulars together in the clearing at the heart of their forest fastness weve got to go out and sabotage a ley line he said theres heavy fighting around durrwangen south and west of here if the regular army can take it back they strike the algarvians a heavy blow and the redheads know it curse em they want to keep durrwangen same as they wanted to keep sulingen but theyve got real supply lines into this place the more we can do to keep men and behemoths and eggs from getting there the better we serve unkerlant have you got that aye the irregulars chorused garivald among them weve found a stretch of ley line the grelzer traitors dont guard well munderic went on well plant our eggs there and weve got a new way of making sure the bastards who call mezentios precious cousin raniero king of grelz cant follow us sadoc will hide our tracks in the snow he waved to the man who would be a mage thats right sadoc said he was a bruiser himself maybe as much a bruiser as munderic im sure itll work he stared from one of his comrades to another challenging them to disagree with him nobody said anything garivald wanted to but sadoc already knew what he thought of his magecraft maybe he wont make a hash of it this time garivald thought his mind almost echoing obilots words unfortunately it also echoed his own mournful coda aye maybe when night came the irregulars left the forest and crossed the farm country around it garivald hoped munderic was right when he said he knew about a length of ley line that wasnt well guarded some of the men supposed to be serving king raniero really stayed loyal to king swemmel of unkerlant and aided them when and as they could but others hated swemmel worse than the algarvians those grelzers as hed found to his dismay made fierce determined foes clouds scudded across the sky every so often he got a glimpse of the moon riding high in the northeast stars appeared twinkled for a moment and then vanished again obilot came up alongside garivald sadoc had better be able to hide our trail she said in a low voice if he cant the traitors will follow us home garivald nodded the earflaps on his fur cap bobbed up and down ive been thinking the same thing i wish i hadnt sometimes the snow was deep drifted the irregulars had to bull through the drifts or else find a way around them garivald kept muttering under his breath even if sadoc could sorcerously erase footprints could he get rid of these signs of passage too had munderic thought about that had munderic thought about anything but hitting the algarvians a good lick garivald doubted it if a grelzer company on patrol caught them out here in the open theyd get slaughtered he hung on to his stick which had once belonged to a redhead who now had no further use for it and hoped that wouldnt happen after what seemed like forever but the moon insisted was well before midnight the irregulars came to the lines of shrubbery that marked the path of the invisible ley line the shrubs kept men and animals from blundering into the path of an oncoming caravan garivalds heart thudded as the irregulars pushed through them this time no grelzer guards shouted a challenge munderic had known whereof he spoke there anyhow some of the irregulars carried picks and spades as well as their sticks they started digging a hole in which to conceal the egg theyd brought to destroy the caravan the ground was frozen hard they had a demon of a time excavating garivald could have told them they would they probably knew it for themselves too but had to do the best they could they planted the egg and heaped snow over it with luck the algarvians in the lead caravan car wouldnt see it till too late lets go munderic said when the job was done well enough and when he didnt feel like waiting anymore back the way we came as near as we can sadoc added ill get rid of all the footprints at once hed better garivald murmured to obilot as they started off toward the forest were in trouble if he doesnt unless a blizzard blows up and sweeps our tracks away i dont think ones coming she said this isnt a hard winter the way last years was just cold garivald nodded it felt the same way to him that didnt mean he couldnt freeze to death out here only that freezing would take longer he was weary by the time the irregulars got back to the edge of the woods twilight hadnt touched the edge of the sky but couldnt be far away he hadnt heard the egg burst neither had munderic who was unhappy about it somethings gone wrong the leader of the band kept saying powers below eat me if something hasnt gone wrong maybe the caravan got stuck in a snowdrift someone suggested no im sure somethings buggered up somewhere munderic said fretfully garivald feared he was right munderic rounded on sadoc even if it didnt work we dont want the foe to know weve been out get rid of those tracks like you said aye sadoc nodded he stooped in the snow and began to chant the tune was one children used in a hideandseek game did that mean sadoc was a fool or that he truly could hide the footprints garivald waited and hoped sadoc chanted and made passes with a last dramatic one he cried out in a loud commanding voice hed gathered power to him garivald could feel it in the air as if lightning were building all at once it was released and every footprint all the way back to the ley line or at least as far as the eye could reach began to glow with a soft shimmering iridescence munderic stared then howled like a wolf you idiot he roared you dunderhead you turdwitted son of a poxed sow you he leaped at sadoc the only thing that kept him from murdering the inept mage was realizing after hed been pulled off that glowing tracks in the snow werent too much more visible than ordinary ones the irregulars fled for their shelters in the clearing their new tracks didnt glow for which garivald thanked the powers above he didnt think sadoc would be working more magic any time soon he thanked the powers above for that too krastas foot came down on an icy patch on the sidewalk of the avenue of equestrians she sat down on the pavement suddenly and very hard an elderly valmieran man started toward her to help her up but she was cursing so foully he beat a hasty embarrassed retreat her curses didnt bother a couple of algarvian soldiers on leave in priekule the kilted redheads hurried over to her and hauled her to her feet you being all right lady one of them asked in valmieran with a trilling algarvian accent i am very well and i thank you krasta was very conscious even smugly conscious of her own good looks she was also very conscious that the redheads given an inch would cheerfully take a mile if she were old and homely they might well have walked right past her giving them her most haughty stare she went on i am the marchioness krasta and the companion to colonel lurcanio her own rank probably meant very little to the soldiers in kilts the algarvian colonels rank meant they couldnt take any liberties they werent too drunk to realize it either you being careful milady one of them said they both bowed sweeping off their broadbrimmed hats in unison and then they went away perhaps in search of a woman who had no way polite or otherwise to tell them no they probably wouldnt have to search too far rubbing her tailbone krasta walked on in the opposite direction the avenue of equestrians had always been priekules main shopping thoroughfare with shops of all sorts catering to the most fastidious and expensive tastes it still was but now only a shadow of its former self the algarvian occupiers had methodically plundered valmiera for more than two and half years it showed theyd been methodically doing other things for more than two and a half years too another algarvian soldier came by his arm around the waist of a blond valmieran girl he of course wore a kilt but so did she one that didnt come close to reaching her knees a lot of valmieran women and a fair number of valmieran men had adopted their conquerors fashions krasta sniffed she kept right on wearing trousers shed occasionally worn kilts before the war as much to shock as for any other reason but never since despite the algarvians who used the west wing of her mansion as their own despite an algarvian lover in some ways she felt her kaunian blood more acutely these days than ever before that was odd especially since shed long been convinced algarve would win the derlavaian war from behind her someone called congratulations on still having any money to spend milady she turned up the street toward her came viscount valnu he was strikingly handsome and would have been even more so had he not looked quite so much like a genial skull he was one of the first men krasta knew whod started wearing kilts she looked him up and down then shook her head youve got knobby knees she said in the tones of one passing sentence nothing fazed valnu his grin grew more impudent yet ive got a babys arm holding an apple too sweetheart in your dreams krasta said with a snort she knew the truth there she waited for valnu to come up to her and what are you doing here if you havent got any money nobody came to the avenue of equestrians without money the street offered poor folk nothing valnu patted her on the backside she couldnt decide whether to slap him or start laughing in the end she didnt do anything the viscount made outrageousness part of his stock in trade blue eyes flashing he answered oh i manage to scrape a couple of coppers together every now and then i have my ways so i do he might have meant he was a gigolo he might have meant he was something with a harsher name everyone who knew him knew his versatility but he might just have meant hed had a good run at dice or that some rents from properties out in the provinces had come in you never could tell with valnu needling him a little krasta asked and whats new with the algarvians how should i know darling he said you see more of them than i do that house of yours is swarming with beefy redheads in kilts do you like their legs better than mine or will lurcanio fling you in a dungeon if you even look at anyone but him he bared his teeth in happy even friendly malice since she couldnt tell what colonel lurcanio might do she was usually circumspect when she looked at anyone but him i dont invite them to grand gruesome orgies at my mansion she said you dont need to theyre screwing all the maidservants anyhow valnu answered krastas chief serving woman had had a baby by lurcanios former adjutant so she couldnt very well deny that at least valnu hadnt come right out and said that lurcanio was screwing her from him that was unusual delicacy krasta had trouble holding her thoughts on any one thing her wave encompassed the avenue of equestrians and the whole city im so sick of dreariness she burst out things could be better valnu agreed he waited till a couple of more plump staring algarvian soldiers enjoying leave in the captured capital of valmiera went by and got safely out of earshot before adding things could be worse too those fellows are probably in from unkerlant for instance its a lot worse there unkerlant to krasta might as well have been a mile beyond the moon im talking about places where civilized people go she said with a sneer kaunians go to unkerlant the same as algarvians do valnu said in a low voice almost a whisper the difference is some algarvians come out again the ice that ran through krasta had nothing to do with the patch that had made her slip i saw that news sheet broadsheet whatever you want to call it she shuddered i believe it i believe everything it says one of the reasons she believed the horrors the sheet described was that it was written in her brothers hand she hadnt told valnu about that nor lurcanio either a lifetime of cattiness had taught her the importance of keeping some things secret lurcanio was after skarnu as things were and you still let him sleep with you she wondered as she did every so often but algarve was stronger than valmiera and lurcanio had proved himself stronger than she was a shock that still lingered what choice had she had none shed seen then none she saw now as if to rub salt in the wound valnu said the redheads keep on falling back in southern unkerlant i dont think durrwangen will hold where did you hear that krasta asked its not in any of the news sheets of course its not valnu bared his teeth mocking her naпvetй the algarvians arent fools they dont want anybody here finding out things arent going quite so well but they know and they talk among themselves and sometimes they talk where other people can listen me for instance he struck a pose so absurd krasta couldnt help laughing but that laugh congealed on her face as a couple of constables came up the avenue of equestrians toward valnu and her they werent algarvians they were the same valmierans whod patrolled the city before the kingdom fell they wore almost the same dark green uniforms they had then their cap badges though were crossed axes and crossed axes were also stamped on the brass buttons that held their tunics closed something seemed stamped on their features too a hard contempt for their own kind they glared at her as they tramped past she glared too but only at their backs turning to valnu she complained they have no respect for rank however angry her words she didnt speak very loud she didnt want those grimlooking men to hear youre wrong my sweet valnu said and krasta gave him a sour look as well he blithely ignored it as he blithely ignored so many things wagging a finger in her face he went on they do indeed respect rank as far as theyre concerned the algarvians have it and everyone else is scum the algarvians agree with them of course of course krasta said dully that wasnt too far removed from her own thoughts of a moment before the algarvians had strength and if strength didnt give rank what did blood she thought but the redheads had the strength to ignore that if they chose they will win the war in spite of everything she murmured now her glance toward valnu was almost beseeching she wanted him to tell her she was wrong he didnt he said they may they may very well theyve already taken more knocks than they ever expected but theyre still strong too and their mages dont care what they do we know about that if they win theres liable not to be a kaunian left alive in forthweg by the time theyre through before the war krasta hadnt thought much about the kaunians in forthweg when she did think of them it was as backwoods bumpkins in a distant backward kingdom they were blood of her blood aye but distant cousins she would just as soon have forgotten poor relations but the algarvians seemed bound and determined to teach the lesson that even poor relations were relations after all something crossed krastas mind she didnt like thinking about these things truth to tell she didnt like thinking at all but she couldnt help it and she blurted forth the horrid notion as if to exorcise it what if they run out valnu patted her on the head my occasionally dear you must not say these things lest you risk losing your proud reputation as a featherbrain she let out an indignant squawk he ignored her and leaned forward so that his mouth was right by her ear he teased her earlobe with his tongue for a moment then whispered three words night and fog what the teasing tongue distracted her she was easily distracted whats that got to do with anything shed seen night and fog painted on the windows or doors of shops that suddenly closed for no reason anyone could find but found no connection between the phrase and her own frightened question viscount valnu patted her again and gave her a sweet smile as if she were a child i take it back he said fond indulgence in his voice you really are a featherbrain i ought to slap your face she snapped she didnt know why she didnt had anyone else spoken to her so except colonel lurcanio who hit back she would have but valnu made a habit of saying and doing preposterous things to her and to everyone he knew his panache had kept him out of trouble so far and kept him out of trouble now he said here lets do something thats more fun instead took her in his arms and gave her a thoroughly competent kiss then bowing as extravagantly as an algarvian he turned and sauntered up the avenue of equestrians as if he had not a care in the world knees aside he looked better in a kilt than most redheads krasta hadnt bought anything a shockingly unusual trip to the avenue of equestrians even so she went back to her carriage which waited in a side street her driver surprised at her coming back so soon hastily hid a flask take me home she told him but would she find any shelter there either three winter was the rainy season in bishah the capital of zuwayza rarely got much in the way of rain but what it got it got in winter sometimes at this season it also got cool enough at night to make hajjaj think wearing clothes might not be the worst idea in the world the zuwayzi foreign ministers senior wife patted his hand when he presumed to say that out loud if you want to put on a robe put on a robe kolthoum told him no one here will mind if you do her tone suggested than anyone living in hajjajs home who did mind any eccentricity he happened to show would answer to her and would not enjoy doing it but he shook his head my thanks but no he said no for two reasons first the servants would be scandalized no matter what they said im an old man now ive been through too many scandals to invite another one youre not so old as all that kolthoum said hajjaj was far too courteous to laugh at his senior wife but he knew better his hair having gone from black to gray was now going from gray to white so was kolthoums theyd been yoked together for almost fifty years hajjaj didnt notice it in her for he saw her through the eyesight of a shared lifetime where today and the lost time before the six years war could blur into each other at a blink his dark brown skin had grown wrinkled and leathery when it did rain here his bones would ache he went on the second reason is even more compelling so far as i know we havent got any clothes here i have this style and that short tunics and long ones and kilts and trousers and who knows what useless fripperies in a closet next to my office down in the city but i dont need to bother with such foreign nonsense in my own home if youre feeling chilly it isnt nonsense kolthoum said im sure we could have a maidservant fix you something out of a blanket or curtains or whatever would suit you im fine hajjaj insisted his senior wife looked eloquently unconvinced but stopped arguing one of the reasons theyd got on so well for so long was that theyd learned not to push each other too far tewfik the majordomo walked into the chamber where they were sitting next to him hajjaj truly wasnt so old as all that tewfik had served his father before him bowing the clan retainer said sorry to disturb you lad he was the only man hajjaj knew who could call him that but a messenger from the palace just brought you this he handed hajjaj a roll of paper sealed with king shazlis seal i thank you tewfik hajjaj replied and the majordomo bowed again hajjaj wasnt upset that he hadnt heard the messenger arrive sheltering behind thick sandstone walls his home like any clanfathers was a compound well on its way to being a little village he put on his spectacles broke the royal seal unrolled the paper and read can you speak of it kolthoum asked oh aye he said his majesty summons me to his audience chamber tomorrow morning thats all but youd see him tomorrow anyhow his senior wife observed why does he need to summon you i dont know hajjaj admitted by tomorrow morning though i should find out dont you think kolthoum sighed i suppose so she reached out and patted her husband on the thigh a gesture having more to do with sympathy than with desire it had been a long time since theyd made love hajjaj couldnt remember just how long in fact but their companionship hardly needed physical intimacy anymore one of these days he would have to wed a new junior wife if he sought such amusements lalla recently divorced had been more expensive and more temperamental than she was worth one of these days as he neared seventy lovemaking seemed less urgent than it had a couple of decades earlier he fortified himself with strong tea the next morning before his driver took the carriage down from the foothills and into bishah proper it hadnt rained lately which meant the road wasnt muddy it also wasnt dusty a more common annoyance men shouted back and forth on the roof of the royal palace they werent guards the zuwayzin liked king shazli well they were roofers when the rains came even the royal roof leaked unlike his citizens shazli didnt have to wait his turn to get things set right as hed said he would the king awaited his foreign minister in the audience chamber a less formal setting than the throneroom shazli was about half hajjajs age hajjaj thought well of him for a man so young he was no fool only a gold circlet showed the kings rank the zuwayzi custom of nudity made display harder bowing hajjaj said how may i serve your majesty before we talk business we can take refreshment shazli answered by which hajjaj knew the business wasnt a desperate emergency the king unlike his subjects could put aside the rules of hospitality if he chose shazli clapped his hands a serving woman brought in tea and date wine and honey cakes enlivened with chopped pistachios while they nibbled and sipped shazli and hajjaj were limited to polite small talk presently the wine drunk and the cakes diminished the maidservant came back and carried off the silver tray on which shed fetched them hajjaj watched her swaying backside with appreciation but without urgency that wasnt just his years hed seen so much bare flesh it didnt inflame him as it did most derlavaian folk you will be wondering why i summoned you rituals completed shazli could with propriety get down to business so i will your majesty hajjaj agreed as always though i expect you will enlighten me always the optimist king shazli said hajjaj raised an eyebrow hed been his kingdoms foreign minister since zuwayza regained her freedom from an unkerlant embroiled in the twinkings war after the earlier ravages of the six years war few men whod spent their whole careers as diplomatists retained much in the way of optimism by the time they got old shazlis wry chuckle said he did know that he reached under a pillow next to the one against which he reclined and pulled out a sheet of paper passing it to hajjaj he said this was brought to our line under flag of truce and once its import was recognized flown straight here by dragon like any zuwayzi hajjaj carried a large leather wallet to make up for his dearth of pockets as he had for shazlis summons he took out his spectacles so he could read the document when he was through he peered over the lenses at his sovereign unkerlant has never been a kingdom renowned for subtlety he remarked the unkerlanters would always sooner order than persuade and they would sooner threaten than order as we see here as we see here the king agreed allout war against us war to the knife was the phrase they used wasnt it unless we leave off fighting them and go over to their side against algarve they graciously allow us three days time before our reply is due hajjaj read the document again shazli had accurately summarized it inclining his head the foreign minister inquired and what would you have of me in aid of this your majesty can swemmel do as he threatens shazli demanded if he can can we hope to withstand him if he hurls everything he has against us i hope you are also asking general ikhshid these same questions hajjaj said i am not a soldier nor do i pretend to be i am consulting ikhshid aye king shazli nodded and i have some notion of what you are and what you are not your excellency id better after all these years i want your view not as a man of war but as a man of the world reclining against cushions didnt make even a seated bow easy but hajjaj managed you do me too much credit he murmured thinking nothing of the sort after a few seconds he shook his head i dont believe king swemmel can do it he said aye the unkerlanters crushed algarve at sulingen but theyre still locked with mezentios men from the narrow sea in the south to the garelian ocean here in the tropic north if they pull enough men from their lines to be sure of crushing us the algarvians are bound to find a way to make them pay algarve can hurt them worse than wed ever dream of doing ikhshid said the same thing when i asked him last night which does somewhat relieve my mind shazli said still my next question is is swemmel so mad for revenge against us that hed do anything to harm us not caring what might happen to his own kingdom hajjaj clicked his tongue between his teeth and sucked in a long thoughtful breath no his sovereign was no fool far from it though a rational man himself shazli knew swemmel of unkerlant wasnt or wasnt always swemmel did some unbelievably foolish things but he also did some unexpectedly clever ones not least because nobody else could think along with him after a second longish pause hajjaj said i dont believe swemmel will forget the war against algarve just to punish us i would not swear by the powers above but i dont believe so the algarvians over the past year and a half have made themselves very hard for any unkerlanter to forget this is also general ikhshids view king shazli said i am glad the two of you speak with a single voice here very glad indeed if you disagreed i would have more hesitation about rejecting the unkerlanter demands out of hand oh your majesty you mustnt do that hajjaj exclaimed how not shazli asked will you tell me i misunderstood you and that you want zuwayza to bow down to unkerlant after all if you will tell me that i shall have certain things to tell you of that you may rest assured by no means hajjaj said all i ask is that you not send swemmel a paper as hot as the ultimatum he has given you in fact you might be wisest not to send him any reply at all aye i believe thats best do nothing to inflame him and our kingdom will stay safe by the nature of things zuwayza would never be a great power in derlavai the kingdom had not enough people not enough land and much of the land it did have was sunblasted desert in which thornbushes and lizards and camels might flourish but nothing else did hajjajs ancestors had been nomads who roamed that desert waste and fought other zuwayzi clans for the sport of it though generations removed from a camelhair tent hed learned the old songs the brave songs as a boy counseling prudence came hard but he reminded himself he was no barbarian but a civilized man he did what needed doing and king shazli nodded aye what you say makes good sense very well then if you will be so kind as to let me have that hajjaj passed the paper back to the king shazli tore it to pieces saying now we rely on the algarvians to keep unkerlant too busy to worry about the likes of us i think we may safely do that hajjaj replied after all the algarvians have the strongest incentive to fight hard if they lose theyre likely to get boiled alive colonel sabrino shook his head like a wild beast trying to get the snow off his goggles how was he supposed to see down to the ground if he couldnt see past the end of his nose the algarvian officer was tempted to take off the goggles and just use his eyes as he did in good weather but even then his dragon could fly fast enough to make tears stream from his eyes and ruin his vision the goggles would have to stay the dragon sensing him distracted let out a sharp screech and tried to fly where it wanted to go not where he wanted it to he whacked it with his long ironshod goad it screeched again this time in fury and twisted its long snaky neck so that it could glare back at him its yellow eyes blazed with hatred he whacked it again you do what i tell you you stupid stinking thing he shouted dragons were trained from hatchlinghood never to flame their riders off them as far as humans were concerned that was the most important lesson the great beasts ever learned but dragonfliers knew how truly brainless their charges were every once in a while a dragon forgot its lessons this one didnt after another hideous screech it resigned itself to doing as sabrino commanded he peered down through scattered quickscudding clouds at the fight around durrwangen what he saw made him curse even more harshly than he had at his dragon the unkerlanters had almost completed their ring around the city if they did he saw nothing that would keep them from serving the algarvian garrison inside as theyd served the algarvian army that reached but did not come out of sulingen could algarve withstand two great disasters in the southwest sabrino didnt know and didnt want to have to find out he spoke into his crystal to the squadron leaders he commanded all right lads lets give swemmels men the presents theyve been waiting for aye my lord count that was captain domiziano who still seemed younger and more cheerful than he had any business being in the fourth year of a war that looked no closer to an end than it had the day it started further from an end perhaps aye captain orosio didnt waste words he never had the other two squadron commanders also acknowledged the order sabrinos laugh was bitter he should have led sixtyfour dragonfliers each of his squadron commanders should have had charge of sixteen including himself when the fight against unkerlant began the wing had been at full strength now sabrino commanded twentyfive men and there were plenty of other colonels of dragonfliers who would have envied him for having so many back in headquarters far from the fighting generals wrote orders a full wing would have had trouble meeting they always got irate when the battered bands of dragonfliers they had in the field failed to carry out those orders in full sabrino got irate too at them not that it did him any good all he could do was all he could do having spoken through the crystal he used hand signals too then he whacked his dragon with the goad again it dove on a large concentration of unkerlanters below the dragonfliers in the wing followed him without hesitation they always had since the first clashes with the forthwegians good men one and all he thought a few of the unkerlanters blazed up at the diving dragons a few tried to run though running in snowshoes wouldnt get them very far very fast most just kept on with what they were doing unkerlanters were a stolid lot and seemed all the more so to the excitable algarvians sabrinos dragon carried two eggs slung beneath its belly he released them and let them fall on the foe the other dragonfliers in his wing were doing the same bursts of suddenly released sorcerous energy flung snow and unkerlanters and behemoths in all directions whooping sabrino ordered his dragon high into the air once more thats the way to do it boys he said we can still hit em a good lick every now and again curse me if we cant he knew a moments pity for the unkerlanter footsoldiers hed been a footsoldier toward the end of the dreadful slaughters of the six years war a generation before having somehow come through alive hed vowed he would never fight on the ground again dragonfliers knew terror too but they rarely knew squalor captain domizianos smiling face appeared in sabrinos crystal shall we go down and flame some of those whoresons too the squadron leader asked reluctantly sabrino shook his head lets go back to the dragon farm and load up on eggs again instead he answered its not like flying down to sulingen was we can get back here again pretty fast and thatll save on cinnabar along with brimstone the quicksilver in cinnabar helped dragons flame farther and fiercer brimstone was easy to come by quicksilver sabrino sighed algarve didnt have enough algarve had never had enough her own sorcery had turned and bit her helping lagoas and kuusamo drive her from the land of the ice people from which shed imported the vital mineral there were quicksilver mines aplenty in the mamming hills south and west of sulingen but the algarvians had never got to them and so and so as reluctantly domiziano nodded aye sir makes sense i suppose well save the dragonfire weve got for fighting with unkerlanter beasts in the air my thought exactly sabrino agreed we dont always get to do what we want to do sometimes we do what we have to do surely king mezentio had been doing what he wanted to do when he launched the algarvian armies against unkerlant until then algarve had gone from one triumph to another over forthweg over sibiu over valmiera over jelgava sabrino sighed again the first summers campaigns against the unkerlanters had been triumphant too but cottbus hadnt quite fallen a year later sulingen hadnt quite fallen and neither had the quicksilver mines in the mamming hills and now mezentios men did what they had to do in unkerlant not what they wanted to do no sooner had that gloomy thought crossed sabrinos mind than dour captain orosios face replaced domizianos in the crystal look down sir orosio said curse me if our soldiers arent pulling out of durrwangen what sabrino exclaimed they cant do that theyve got orders to hold that town against everything the unkerlanters can do you know that sir orosio answered i know that but if they know that they dont know they know it if you know what i mean and he was right durrwangen was an important town and the algarvians had put a sizable army into it to make sure it didnt fall back into unkerlanter hands and now that army men and behemoths horse and unicorn cavalry was streaming out of durrwangen through the one hole in the unkerlanter ring around it tramping north and east along whatever roads the soldiers and animals could find or make in the snow have they gone mad sabrino wondered their commanders head will go on the block for something like this i was thinking the same thing sir but orosio hesitated and then added at least they wont be thrown away like the men down in sulingen were what i didnt hear that but sabrino was arch hed heard perfectly well and he could hardly deny that his squadron commander had a point so far as he knew not a man had come out of sulingen the algarvians down here would live to fight another day but they were supposed to have been fighting in durrwangen what do we do sir orosio asked sabrino hesitated that needed thought at last he answered we do what we would have done even if theyd stayed in the city we go back get more eggs and then come and give them whatever help we can i dont see what else we can do if youve got a better answer let me hear it by the powers above but orosio only shook his head no sir all right then sabrino said well do that news of the algarvians retreat from durrwangen had already reached the dragon farm by the time sabrinos wing got back to it some of the dragon handlers said the commander in durrwangen hadnt bothered asking for permission before pulling out others claimed he had asked for permission been refused and pulled out anyway they were all sure of one thing his head will roll said the fellow who tossed meat covered with powdered brimstone and cinnabar to sabrinos dragon he sounded quite cheerful about the prospect and sabrino could only nod his head bloody well deserves to roll he said you cant go around disobeying orders oh aye the dragon handler agreed but then after a pause he went on still and all though thats a lot of boys who can do a lot of fighting somewhere else everybody thinks hes a general sabrino said with a snort the dragon handler tossed his mount another big gobbet of meat the beast snatched it out of the air and gulped it down its yellow eyes followed the handler as he took yet another piece of meat from the cart the dragon was far fonder of the man who fed it than of the man who flew it despite his snort sabrino remained thoughtful he and orosio had said about the same thing as the dragon handler had did that mean they were on to something or were they all daft the same way in the end it probably wouldnt matter regardless of whether his move proved foolish or brilliant the general in charge of the algarvian forces breaking out from durrwangen would be in trouble with his superiors being right was rarely an excuse for disobeying orders as soon as his beasts were fed and had fresh eggs slung beneath them sabrino ordered them into the air once more he hoped they wouldnt meet unkerlanter dragons theyd been flying too much lately they were tired and far from at their best he wished they could have had more time to recover between flights but there were too many miles of fighting and not enough dragons to cover them the ones algarve had needed to do all they could as if drawn by a lodestone sabrino led his dragonfliers back toward the algarvian soldiers breaking out of durrwangen they were doing better than hed thought they would be their retreat plainly had caught the unkerlanters by surprise swemmels men were swarming into the city theyd lost the summer before most of them seemed willing to let the soldiers whod defended it go sabrino and his dragonfliers punished the unkerlanters who did attack the retreating algarvians corpses some in long rockgray tunics others in the white smocks that made them harder to see against the snow sprawled in unlovely death sabrino snorted at that this time mocking what passed for poetry in his mind hed seen too much fighting in two different wars and the next lovely death he found would be the first down below the algarvian army kept falling back it retreated in excellent order without the slightest sign of disarray from the men but if they were in such good spirits why had their leader ordered them out of durrwangen in the first place couldnt they have held the important town a good deal longer sabrino had plenty of questions but no good answers to go with them on the defensive sergeant istvan didnt like the phrase gyongyosians were by training and they said by birth a warrior race warriors by the nature of their calling boldly stormed forward and overwhelmed the foe they didnt sit and wait inside fieldworks for the foe to storm forward and try to overwhelm them so said most of the men in istvans squad at any rate theyd come into the army to force their way through the passes of the ilszung mounts and through the endless trackless forests of western unkerlant theyd done a good job of it too unkerlant was distracted by her bigger fight with algarve thousands of miles to the east and never had put enough men into the defense against gyongyos never till recently anyhow now we just have to wait and see if we can build up reinforcements faster than those stinking whoresons thats all istvan said if you havent got the men you cant do the things you could if you did aye hes right corporal kun agreed kun always looked more like what he had been a mages apprentice than a proper soldier he was thin downright scrawny for a gyongyosian and his spectacles gave him a studious seeming he went on istvan and i had to put up with this same kind of nonsense of obuda out in the bothnian ocean when the kuusamans had enough men to get the jump on us and me szonyi said dont forget about me and you istvan agreed theyd all been on obuda together istvan went on weve seen the kinds of things you have to do when you havent got enough men to do everything you want you sit and you wait for the other bugger to make a mistake and then you try and kick him in the balls when he does kun and szonyi nodded the two of them weedy corporal and burly common soldier with tawny hair and curly beard that made him look like a lion understood how to play the game so did istvan the rest of the men in the squad he wasnt so sure of them they listened they nodded in all the right places did they really know what he was talking about he doubted it we are a warrior race we shall prevail no matter what the accursed unkerlanters do that was lajos one of the new men he was as burly as szonyi a little burlier than istvan in the small bits of action hed seen since coming up to the front hed fought as bravely as anyone could want he was nineteen and sure he knew everything who was there to tell him he might be wrong would he believe anyone not likely istvan took off his gloves and looked at his hands his nails were raggedly trimmed with black dirt ground under them and into the folds of skin at his knuckles he turned his hands over thick calluses also dark with groundin dirt creased his palms scars seamed his hands too his eyes went as they always did to one in particular a puckered line between the second and third fingers of his left hand kun had a scar as near identical to that one as made no difference so did szonyi so did several other squadmates the men whod served under istvan for a while captain tivadar had cut them all the company commander would have been within his rights to kill them all theyd eaten goat stew they hadnt known it was goat theyd killed the unkerlanters whod been cooking it but knowledge didnt matter theyd sinned istvan still didnt know if his expiation was enough or if the curse on those who ate of forbidden flesh still lingered someone approached the timberreinforced redoubt in which istvan and his squad waited who comes he called softly the fairy frog in the fable to gulp you all down with a chuckle istvan said come ahead captain tivadar did slipping from tree to tree so he didnt show himself to any unkerlanter snipers who might be lurking nearby nodding to istvan he slid down into the redoubt anything that looks like trouble he asked no sir istvan answered at once everythings been real quiet the past couple of days thats good tivadar checked he wasnt much older than istvan he couldnt have been thirty but he thought of everything or as close to everything as he could i hope thats good anyhow maybe swemmels boys are brewing up something nasty out of sight he turned to kun anything that feels like trouble corporal kun shook his head nothing i can sense captain i dont know how much thats worth though i was only an apprentice after all not a mage myself in the squad he put on airs about the small spells he did know putting on airs with the company commander didnt pay all right tivadar said the last time they struck us with sorcery even our best mages didnt know what theyd do till they did it curse them he was all business having purified istvan kun szonyi and the rest he acted as if they were ritually pure and never mentioned that dreadful night neither did any of them not where anybody not of their number might hear the shame was too great for that istvan thought it always would be kun usually mocked whenever he saw the chance he was a city man and his ways often seemed strange and slick and rather repellent to istvan who like most gyongyosians came from a mountain valley where the people were at feud with some neighboring valley when they werent at feud among themselves but kun didnt mock now in tones unwontedly serious he said that was an abomination the stars will not shine on men who murder their own to power their magecraft aye youre right lajos boomed the unkerlanters fight filthy its worse than eating goats flesh if you ask me he waited for everyone to nod and agree with him in most squads everybody would have here the agreement was slow and halfhearted it was badly acted by men who wanted to seem normal gyongyosians but had trouble doing so lajos didnt realize that istvan hoped the motions of the stars would grant that he never did the young trooper grunted and shifted uncomfortably knowing things had gone wrong and not understanding why szonyi said captain when can we take the fight to swemmels men again we drove em through the mountains and we drove em through the woods we can still do it any time we get the orders tivadar answered if the men set over me tell me to go forward go forward i shall unless i should die serving gyongyos in which case the stars will cherish my spirit forevermore but if the men set over me tell me to wait in place wait in place i shall and if the men set over you trooper if they tell you to wait in place wait in place you will and they do i do aye sir szonyi dipped his head in reluctant acquiescence he was a man of his kingdom and like istvan a man of the countryside given his way he would go straight at a foe without subtlety but without hesitation and keep going till one or the other of them couldnt stand up anymore remember boys you have to stay alert all the time tivadar warned the unkerlanters are better in the forest than we are we couldnt have come so far against em if we didnt have em outnumbered they dont always need magic to have a go at us sometimes sneakiness serves em just as well he climbed out of the redoubt and headed off along the line to the next gyongyosian strongpoint istvan wished his countrymen had enough men to cover all the line through the forest they held they didnt especially in winter where staying out alone might so easily lead to freezing to death the captain is a pretty good officer lajos said aye he is istvan agreed and all the other veterans in the squad chimed in too lajos let out a small sigh of relief not everyone thought he was an idiot all the time anyhow kun said if we can keep what we hold now when the war is over well have won the greatest victory against unkerlant in almost three hundred years is that a fact istvan said and kun nodded in a way that proclaimed it was not only a fact it was a fact anyone this side of feeblemindedness should have known istvan sent his corporal a look a little less than warm kun returned it not quite so openly this time for istvan outranked him but unmistakably nonetheless szonyi sniffed for all the world like a hound taking a scent more snow coming he said wont be long either you can taste the wind istvan had plenty of practice gauging the weather himself he opened and closed his mouth a couple of times as if he were taking bites out of the air the chill of the wind a wind that had suddenly picked up the feel of the moisture it carried he nodded aye were for it coming out of the west from behind us blowing right into the unkerlanters faces szonyi said seems a shame not to hit em when weve got that kind of edge we could be like mountain apes gone before they even knew we were there aye i see the resemblance all right kun planted the barb with a selfsatisfied smirk szonyi glowered at him istvan kept the two of them from quarreling any worse than they usually did whether right about striking or not szonyi was right about the storm it blew in that night snow swirling around the trees and through their branches till lajos on sentrygo complained how am i supposed to see anything king swemmel and his whole court could be out there drinking tea by the stars and i wouldnt know it unless they invited me to have some if swemmel was out there hed be drinking spirits istvan spoke with great conviction and the son of a whore wouldnt invite anybody to share but he could see no farther than lajos if the unkerlanters were gathering in the forest not far away he might not know it till too late he might not but kun would he shook the onetime mages apprentice out of his bedroll what do you want kun asked irritably yawning in his face youve got that little magic that tells when somebodys moving toward you istvan answered dont you think this would be a good time to use it kun eyed the snowstorm and nodded though he warned the spell wont say whether the men it spies are friends or foes just work it istvan said impatiently if theyre coming toward us from out of the east theyre no friends of ours well youre bound to be right about that kun admitted and worked the tiny spell a moment later he turned back to istvan nothing sergeant remember the snow gives the unkerlanters as much trouble as it gives us all right istvan used a brisk nod to hide his relief he knew he shouldnt have been so relieved it wasnt proper for a man from a warrior race but even a man of a warrior race might have been excused for being unwilling to wait and receive a blow from the enemy kun said well get through another day that will do he sounded none too fierce himself but istvan didnt reprove him now that vanai dared go out onto the streets of eoforwic once more she wished she could find some books written in classical kaunian but theyd long since vanished from all the booksellers shops those dealing in new and secondhand volumes alike the algarvians forbade them the redheads had aimed to destroy kaunianity even before theyd started destroying kaunians vanai suspected she might have been able to get her hands on some had she known which booksellers to trust but she didnt and she didnt care to ask questions that might draw notice to herself she made do with forthwegian books my magecraft makes me look like a forthwegian she thought even ealstan sees me this way almost all the time i speak forthwegian almost all the time people call me thelberge as if i really were a forthwegian am i still vanai whenever she looked in a mirror her old familiar features looked back at her her sorcery didnt change the way she saw herself in the mirror she still had fair skin a long face with a straight nose and grayblue eyes but even in the mirror her hair was black like any kaunian with a grain of sense shed dyed it to make it harder for the algarvians to penetrate her disguise am i still vanai if the world knows me as thelberge if the world knows me as thelberge for long enough will the vanai inside me start to die if algarve wins the derlavaian war will i have to go on being thelberge for the rest of my life she didnt want to think about things like that but how could she help it if the algarvians won the war would eoforwic stay shabby and battered its people even real forthwegians scrawny for the rest of her life she didnt want to think about that either but it looked like being true a lot of the graffiti that said sulingen had been painted over but vanai knew what rectangles of fresh whitewash meant she smiled fiercely every time she saw one the algarvians had pasted recruiting broadsheets for plegmunds brigade everywhere they could as if to mask the importance of the defeat theyd suffered from the forthwegians and maybe from themselves up on the hill at the heart of the city stood the royal palace vanai hadnt thought about king penda very often back in the days before the war she hadnt thought much of him either but that was a different story like most kaunians in forthweg she hadnt been enamored of the rule of a man not of her blood and a man who strongly preferred those who were of his own blood these days a large algarvian flag red green and white flew about the palace an algarvian governor ruled forthweg in pendas stead things surely had been less than ideal before the war now they were a great deal worse than that vanai shook her head who could have imagined such a thing eoforwic had several market squares it needed them to keep so many people fed the one closest to her block of flats was perhaps the smallest and meanest in the city which meant it was larger than the one in gromheort and dwarfed the tiny square back in oyngestun vanai bought barley and beans and turnips food for hard times food that would keep people going when nothing better was to be had even the beans and barley were in short supply and more expensive than they should have been if ealstan hadnt brought home good money from casting accounts the two of them might have gone hungry by the pinched and anxious looks on the faces of a lot of people in the square hunger was already loose in eoforwic she stayed watchful and wary as she carried her purchases back toward her flat shed heard stories of people knocked on the head for the sake of a sack of grain she didnt intend to be one of them a blocky forthwegian man stood in the middle of the sidewalk staring east and pointing up into the sky vanai had to stop there was no polite way around him but she didnt turn and look for all she knew hed come up with a new way to distract people and then steal from them if that did him an injustice then it did better safe than sorry ran through her mind then the forthwegian shouted something that made her change her mind dragons unkerlanter dragons she was just starting to whirl when the first eggs fell on eoforwic get down screamed somebody who must have gone through such horror before vanai hadnt the algarvians hadnt reckoned oyngestun important enough to waste eggs on it but she wasted no time in throwing herself flat on the slates of the sidewalk and on top of the precious food shed bought even with dragons overhead she couldnt afford to lose that more eggs burst seemingly at random some far away others only a couple of blocks off along with the roars from the bursts came the almost musical tinkling of shattered glass hitting walls and pavements and shattering further and the screams of men and women either wounded or terrified now vanai did look up the dragons were hard to see it was a cloudy day and their bellies were painted a gray that made them look like nothing so much as moving bits of cloud themselves the eggs their dragonfliers released were easier to spy they were darker and fell straight and swift one seemed to fall straight toward vanai it got bigger and bigger and burst only half a block away close enough to pick her up and slam her back down to the ground with shocking and painful force her ears were stunned deafened she hoped not forever a tiny sliver of glass tore a cut in the back of her left hand but a fullthroated scream drowned out her yelp the man whod warned of the unkerlanter dragons lay writhing on the sidewalk his hands clutched at his belly from which blood poured a flood a torrent a deluge of blood vanai stared in helpless dreadful fascination how much blood did a living man hold more to the point how much could he lose before he stopped being a living man his shrieks faded his hands relaxed the blood poured off the edge of the sidewalk into the gutter vanai gulped fighting sickness almost as soon as it began the unkerlanter attack ended the dragons had flown a long way they couldnt carry very many eggs or very heavy ones as soon as theyd dropped what cargo of death they could bring their dragonfliers guided them back toward the west once more vanai picked up her groceries and hurried past the stocky mans corpse toward her block of flats a couple of other bodies lay beyond that one she tried not to look at them either a wounded woman cried out but someone was already tending to her vanai went on without feeling the bite of conscience eoforwic boiled like an anthill stirred by a stick people whod been inside their homes and shops when the eggs started falling came rushing out to see if loved ones and friends were all right or simply to see what had happened people whod been on the street rushed toward their homes and shops to make sure those were still standing here and there physicians and mages and firefighting crews had to push their way through the chaos to do their duty all things considered the algarvian constables on the streets did a pretty good job of opening the way so help could get where it was going they werent subtle or gentle about it they screamed abuse in their language and in broken forthwegian and kaunian and they used their bludgeons to wallop anyone who proved even a split second slow in grasping what they meant but vanai didnt think forthwegian constables would have acted differently they did what needed doing on the spur of the moment whys and wherefores could wait vanai let out a great sigh of relief when she found her block of flats undamaged but for a couple of broken windows and no fires burning anywhere close by she carried the barley and turnips and beans up to her flat set down the sacks in the kitchen and poured herself a large cup of wine shed got halfway down it a warm glow beginning to spread through her when she started worrying about ealstan what if he didnt come back what if he couldnt come back what if he were injured what if he were she wouldnt even think the word she gulped down the rest of the wine instead hour followed hour ealstan didnt come theres no reason for him to come vanai told herself over and over again hes doing what he has to do thats all that made perfect sense eoforwic was a big city the unkerlanter raid had killed or wounded a relative handful of people the odds that ealstan was one of them were vanishingly small aye it all made perfect logical sense it didnt stop her heart from racing or her breath from whistling in her throat with anxiety and it didnt stop her from leaping in the air when she heard the coded knock at the door or from crying out where were you when ealstan came inside casting accounts where else would i be he answered vanais expression must have been eloquent for he added none of the eggs fell anywhere near me see im right as rain maybe he was telling the truth maybe he just didnt want her to worry she didnt say anything about the cut on her hand for fear he would worry what she did say was powers above be praised that youre safe she squeezed the breath out of him oh aye im fine all things considered it wasnt much of a raid i wonder if any of those dragons will get home again ealstan sounded dispassionate but his arms tightened around her she squeezed him again why did the unkerlanters bother if they didnt do eoforwic any harm oh i didnt say that ealstan answered havent you heard heard what now vanai wanted to shake him i was bringing groceries home when it happened and i came straight here afterwards how could i have heard anything all right all right ill talk ealstan said as if she were a constable pounding the truth out of him most of their eggs fell around the leyline caravan depot and a couple of them smashed it up pretty well the algarvians will have some trouble moving soldiers through there for a while soldiers or anybody else vanai said slowly she couldnt bring herself to come out and mention by name the kaunians the algarvians sent west to be sacrificed so their life energy could power the redheads sorceries aye or anybody else ealstan understood what she meant he set a hand on her shoulder with that sorcery you worked out youve done more to make that hard for mezentios men than all the unkerlanter dragons put together have i vanai considered that it was a pretty big thought maybe i have she said at last but even if i have its still not enough the algarvians shouldnt have been able to do what they did in the first place ealstan nodded i know that anybody with any brains knows it they never would have been able to either if so many forthwegians didnt hate kaunians he gave vanai a quick kiss you need to remember that not all forthwegians do she smiled i already knew that im always glad to hear it again though and to see proof this time she kissed him one thing led to another they ended up eating supper later than theyd intended to they were both young enough to take that kind of thing for granted even to laugh about it vanai never stopped to wonder how rare and fortunate it was commander cornelu guided his leviathan out of the harbor at setubal and into the strait of valmiera the leviathan was a fine frisky beast cornelu patted its smooth slick skin you may be as good as eforiel he said aye you just may the leviathan wriggled its long slim body beneath him it was far more sinuous far more graceful than its blocky cousins the whales it didnt understand what hed said he didnt think it would have understood even if hed spoken lagoan rather than his native sibian but it liked to hear him speak he patted it again do you know what kind of compliments im paying you he asked since the leviathan couldnt answer he did no of course you dont but if you did youd be flattered believe me hed ridden eforiel from sibiu to lagoas after the algarvians overran his island going into exile in lagoas was vastly preferable to yielding to the invaders without false modesty he knew sibiantrained leviathans were the best in the world eforiel could do things no lagoan leviathanrider could hope to get his mount to match but eforiel was dead slain off his home island of tirgoviste after making his way back to lagoas again hed had this new beast for a while and hed worked hard to train it up to sibian standards it was getting there it might even have already arrived the leviathan darted to the left its jaws opened for a moment then closed on a mackerel a gulp and the fish was gone those great tooth jaws wouldnt have made more than two bites of a man maybe only one like dragonfliers leviathanriders had and needed to have great respect for the beasts they took to war unlike dragonfliers they got respect and affection in return cornelu wouldnt have wanted anything to do with dragons nasty stupid badtempered beasts he told the leviathan nothing like you no nothing like you with a flick of its tail the leviathan dove below the surface magecraft grease and a rubber suit protected cornelu from the chill of the sea more magecraft let him breathe underwater without that spell leviathanriding would have been impossible his mount could stay submerged far longer than he could veterinary mages kept promising a spell to let leviathans breathe underwater too that would have changed warfare on the sea despite endless promises though the spell had yet to make an appearance cornelu didnt expect it during this war or indeed during his lifetime one stretch of ocean looked very much like another cornelu thanked the powers above that the day was clear he had no trouble guiding his leviathan north toward the coast of valmiera along with him the beasts carried two eggs hung under its belly the algarvians thought they could ship more or less safely in the waters off valmiera his job was to show them they were wrong every so often he glanced up at the sky ever since mezentios men seized valmiera their dragons and the lagoans had clashed above the strait that separated the island from the mainland now one side seized the upper hand now the other hed had too many algarvian dragonfliers attack him to want to let another one see him before he spied the enemy dragon each time he looked today the sky was empty the lagoans said a lot of algarvian dragons had flown out of valmiera lately headed west maybe they were right though cornelu had trouble trusting them a great deal further than he trusted mezentios men if they were the war in unkerlant was making the algarvians forget about everything else toward evening the derlavaian mainland rose up out of the sea ahead of cornelu he tapped his leviathan in a particular way as it had been trained to do it lifted its head out of the sea standing on its tail with powerful beats of its flukes cornelu rose with the leviathans head and could see much farther than he could while closer to the surface seeing farther however didnt mean seeing more here no algarvian freighters or warships glided along the ley lines no valmieran fishing boats used the ley lines either nor did any sailboats scud along without the power bigger vessels drew from the earths grid of sorcerous energy cornelu cursed under his breath hed sunk an algarvian leyline cruiser along with other smaller craft he wanted more with the algarvians holding down his kingdom with a hand of iron he hungered for more the sibian exiles fighting out of lagoas were among the fiercest most determined foes the algarvians had but what a man wanted and what he got were not always or even very often one and the same cornelu had learned that painful lesson all too well for this foray he carried not one but two crystals making sure hed chosen the one attuned to the lagoan admiralty he murmured the activating charm hed learned by rote and spoke into it off the coast of valmiera no vessels visible proceeding with second plan hed also learned the phrases by rote lagoan was related to sibian but not too closely its grammar was simplified and it had borrowed far more words from kuusaman and classical kaunian than had his native tongue in the crystal he saw the image of a lagoan naval officer lagoan uniforms were darker more somber than the seagreen hed worn while serving sibiu the lagoan said good luck with second plan good hunting with first hed evidently been briefed that sibiu spoke his language imperfectly after a small flare of light the crystal returned to blankness the leviathan twisted in the water to catch a squid cornelu didnt let the motion disturb him as he replaced the first crystal in its oiledleather case and drew out the second one from its again he murmured an activation charm he spoke this one with much more confidence it was in algarvian and algarvian and sibian were as closely related to each other as a couple of brothers closer even than valmieran and jelgavan he didnt know how the lagoans had come by an algarvian crystal taken it from a captured dragonflier perhaps or brought it back from the land of the ice people from which mezentios men had been expelled however theyd got it he had it now he didnt speak into it as he had into the one attuned to the admiralty all he did was listen to see what emanations it would pick up from other algarvian crystals aboard nearby ships or on the mainland for a while he heard nothing he cursed again this time not under his breath he hated the idea of going back to setubal without having accomplished anything hed done it before but he still hated it it seemed a waste of an important part of his life and then faint in the distance he caught one algarvian talking to another cursed son of a whore slipped through our fingers again do you suppose his sister really is tipping him not a chance you think shes not watched the second algarvian replied no somebody slipped up thats all and wont admit it maybe maybe but the first algarvian didnt sound convinced along with the crystals cornelu had along a slate and a grease pencil he scribbled notes on the conversation he had no idea what it meant someone back in setubal might after sunset sea and sky and land went dark as the lagoans doused lamps to keep algarvian dragons from finding targets so mezentios men made sure valmiera offered nothing to beasts flying up from the south cornelu found himself yawning he didnt want to sleep hed have to orient himself again when he woke for his leviathan would surely go wandering after food a fish leaped out of the sea and splashed back into the water the tiny creatures on which fish fed glowed in alarm for a moment then faded cornelu yawned again he wondered why people and other animals slept what earthly good did it do nothing he could see his captured algarvian crystal started picking up emanations again a couple of mezentios soldiers cornelu gradually realized they were brothers or close cousins were comparing notes about their valmieran girlfriends they went into richly obscene detail after listening for a while cornelu wasnt sleepy anymore he didnt take notes on this conversation he doubted the lagoan officers who eventually got his slate would be amused oh aye she aims her toes right at the ceiling she does one of the algarvians said the other one laughed cornelu started to laugh too but choked on his own mirth back in tirgoviste town some algarvian whorehounds like these two had seduced his wife he wondered if costache would present him with a bastard to go with his own daughter if he ever got back there again then he wondered how he would ever get back to tirgoviste or why he would want to along with frustrated lust frustrated fury made sure he wouldnt fall asleep right away at last to his relief the two algarvians shut up he lay atop his leviathans back rocking gently on the waves the leviathan might have been dozing or so he thought till it chased town and caught a goodsized tunny he liked tunnys flesh himself but baked in a pie with cheese not raw and wriggling maybe the chase changed the emanations that reached his crystal in any case a new algarvian voice spoke out of it everything ready with this new shipment all the ley lines south cleared aye another algarvian answered weve been leaning on the cursed bandits who make life such a joy nothing will go wrong this time it had better not the first voice said we havent got any kaunians to spare we havent got anything to spare not here we dont everything gets sucked west over to unkerlant if we dont bring this off now powers above only know when well get another chance if we ever do cornelu wrote furiously he wondered if the lagoans back in setubal would be able to read his scrawl it didnt matter too much as long as he was there along with the notes mezentios men were planning murder somewhere along the southern coast of valmiera murder doubtless aimed across the strait of valmiera at a lagoan or kuusaman coastal city then a new voice interrupted the algarvians shut up you cursed fools the emanations from your crystals are leaking and someone aye someone is listening to them if that wasnt a mage cornelu had never heard one and the fellow would be doing everything he could to learn who and even more important where the eavesdropper was quickly cornelu murmured the charm that took the crystal down to dormancy again that would make the algarvian mages work harder for him cornelu was tempted to throw the crystal into the sea too but refrained he did rouse the leviathan and send it swimming south again as fast as it would go the sooner he got away from the valmieran coast the tougher the time mezentios minions would have finding him and running him down he glanced up at the sky again he would have trouble spotting dragons but dragonfliers wouldnt enjoy looking for his leviathan either after a while he activated the crystal that linked him to lagoas the same officer as before appeared in it cornelu spoke rapidly outlining what hed learned who could guess when the algarvians might start slaying the lagoan heard him out then said well commander i daresay youve earned your days pay a sibian officer would have kissed him on both cheeks even if he was only an image in a crystal somehow though he didnt mind this understated praise not tonight skarnu had got out of the habit of sleeping in barns but having escaped the latest algarvian attempt to grab him in ventspils hed gone out into the country again a farmer risked his own neck by putting up a fugitive from what the redheads called justice ill help with the chores if you like he told the man whose name he deliberately did not learn the next morning will you the farmer gave him an appraising look you know what youre doing you talk like a city man try me skarnu answered i feel guilty sitting here eating your food and not helping you get more well all right the farmer chuckled well see if you still talk the same way at the end of the day by the end of that day skarnu had tended to a flock of chickens mucked out a cow barn weeded a vegetable plot and an herb garden chopped firewood and mended a fence he felt worn to a nub farmwork always wore him to the nub how did i do he asked the man who was putting him up ive seen worse the fellow allowed he glanced at skarnu out of the corner of his eye youve done this before a time or two i do believe who me skarnu said as innocently as he could im just a city man you said so yourself i said you talked like one the farmer answered and you cursed well do but ill shit a brick if you havent spent some time behind a plow he waved a hand dont tell me about it i dont want to hear the less i know the better on account of the stinking algarvians cant rip it out of me if its not there to begin with skarnu nodded hed learned that lesson as a captain in the valmieran army all the stubborn men and women who kept up the fight against algarve in occupied valmiera had learned it somewhere the ones who couldnt learn it were mostly dead now and too many of their friends with them supper was black bread and hard cheese and sour cabbage and ale in priekule before the war skarnu would have turned up his nose at such simple fare now with the relish of hunger he ate enormously and with the relish of exhaustion he had no trouble falling asleep in the barn lanternlight in his face woke him in the middle of the night he started to spring to his feet grabbing for the knife at his belt easy the farmer said from behind the lantern its not the stinking redheads its a friend without letting go of the knife skarnu peered at the man with the farmer slowly he nodded hed seen that face before in a tavern where irregulars gathered youre zarasai he said naming not the man but the southern town from which hed come aye zarasai nodded and youre pavilosta that was the village nearest the farm where skarnu had dwelt with the widow merkela whats so important it wont wait till sunup skarnu asked are the algarvians a jump and a half behind you hot on my trail again no or theyd better not be zarasai answered its more important than that more important than my neck skarnu thought whats more important to me than my neck youd better tell me he said and zarasai did the algarvians powers below eat them are shipping a caravanload maybe more than one caravanload i dont know for sure of kaunians from forthweg to the shore of the strait of valmiera you know what that means slaughter skarnus stomach did a slow lurch slaughter life energy magic aimed at lagoas kuusamo we dont know answered the other leader of valmieran resistance against one of them or the other thats sure what can we do to stop it skarnu asked i dont know that either zarasai replied thats why i came for you youre the one who managed to get an egg under a leyline caravan full of kaunians from forthweg one of the other times the stinking algarvians tried this maybe you can help us do it again powers above i hope so ill do whatever i can skarnu told him when hed buried that egg on the ley line not far from pavilosta he hadnt even known the algarvians would be shipping a caravanload of captives to sacrifice but the egg had burst regardless of whether hed known that particular caravan was coming down the ley line now his fellows in the shadow fight against king mezentio thought he could work magic twice when he hadnt really done it once ill try i have to try come on then the irregular told him lets get moving we have no time to waste if the redheads get them to a captives camp weve lost skarnu paused only to pull on his boots im ready he said and bowed to the farmer thanks for putting me up now forget you ever saw me saw who the farmer said with a dry chuckle i never saw nobody a carriage waited outside the barn skarnu climbed up into it picking bits of straw off himself and yawning again and again zarasai took the reins he drove with practiced assurance skarnu asked which ley line will the redheads be using sounding slightly embarrassed the other man replied we dont quite know theyve been acting busy at three or four different places down along the coast running a caravan to this one then another to that one and so on theyre getting sneakier than they used to be the miserable stinking whoresons weve caused em enough trouble to make em realize they have to be sneaky skarnu observed its a compliment if you like he yawned again trying to flog his sleepy wits to work whatever theyre doing with this sacrifice they think its important theyve never put this much work into trying to fool us before zarasai grunted im glad i came for you i hadnt thought of it like that i dont think anybodys thought of it like that he flicked the reins to make the horse move a little faster doesnt mean i think youre wrong on account of i think youre right powers below eat the algarvians maybe they already have skarnu said which kept his companion thoughtfully silent for quite a while had an algarvian patrol come across the carriage it would have gone hard for the two irregulars who were traveling far past the curfew hour but mezentios men and even the valmierans who helped them run the occupied kingdom were spread thin dawn was making the eastern sky blush when zarasai drove into a village that made pavilosta look like a city beside it three or four houses a tavern and a blacksmiths shop he tied the horse in front of one of the houses and got down from the carriage skarnu followed him to the front door it opened even before zarasai knocked come in a woman hissed quick dont waste any time well get the carriage out of sight fancier than a farmhouse the place boasted a parlor the furniture would have been stylish in the capital just before the six years war maybe it was still stylish here in the middle of nowhere skarnu didnt know about that he didnt have much of a chance to wonder either for his eye was drawn like iron to a lodestone in the direction of the half dozen crystals on the elaborately carven table in the middle of that parlor we can talk almost anywhere in the kingdom the woman said not without pride good skarnu said just dont do too much of it or youll have the algarvians listening in the woman nodded despite his words skarnu was impressed down on the farm near pavilosta hed often wondered if his pinpricks meant anything to the algarvians and if anyone else in valmiera was doing anything against them seeing with his own eyes how resistance spread across the whole kingdom felt very fine indeed zarasai went back into the kitchen and returned with a couple of steaming mugs of tea he passed one on to skarnu waited till hed sipped and then said all right youre in charge tell us what to do and well do it maybe having served as a captain fitted skarnu to the role thrust on him having wrecked the one caravan didnt as he knew too well doing his best to think like a soldier he said have you got a map with ley lines marked i want to see the possibilities aye the woman said matteroffactly and pulled one from the bureau drawer skarnu studied it if theyre after setubal again theyll send the captives to the camp by dukstas the one they used before when the lagoans raided them the irregular from zarasai nodded we figure that ones the most likely theyd dearly love to serve setubal as they served yliharma all these other camps are smaller and farther east setubals the best target theyve got i dont see that theyd want to hit kuusamo again and leave lagoas untouched no i wouldnt think so either skarnu agreed but he frowned dukstas is the obvious place to send the captives of course it is zarasai said thats why theyre doing all these dances isnt it to keep us from seeing whats obvious i mean maybe skarnu shrugged it could be aye but i just dont know he cursed under his breath can we try to sabotage the ley lines into all of these camps we can try doing them all the other irregular sounded dubious and explained why odds are some of the people we send in will get caught theyve got lots of soldiers and lots of cursed valmieran traitors guarding the ley lines they want to get these captives through thats plain that means something really big skarnu said setubal or something else his frown turned into a scowl what could be bigger than setubal if they can bring it off but setubal doesnt feel right to me do you know what i mean its your call the man from zarasai answered thats why youre here all right skarnu nodded to the woman who did duty for a crystallomancer as much in the way of sabotage on every ley line we can reach that leads to one of those camps im not convinced the captives are going to dukstas maybe well see where they are going when we seen which ley lines the redheads defend hardest sabotage all the ley lines we can the woman repeated i shall pass the word pass it she did one crystal at a time having given his orders skarnu could only wait to see how things far away turned out that was new for him hed been a captain before aye but never a general reports started coming back around midday some from raiders who had planted eggs others from bands that failed because their stretch of ley line was too strongly protected a couple of bands never reported back at all skarnu worried about that eyeing the map zarasai said well the buggers wont ship em into dukstas and thats flat so it is skarnu felt a certain satisfaction himself a few hours later word came that the algarvians had succeeded in moving the kaunian captives into a seaside camp but one far far to the east he cursed but made the best of things they may manage something but we kept them from doing their worst four from the dining room of the hostel that had been run up in the wilderness of southeastern kuusamo pekka looked out on bright sunlight shining off snow she took another bite of a grilled and salted mackerel finally she said in classical kaunian decent weather for more experiments ive seen bad weather ilmarinen said i dont know that ive ever seen indecent weather might be interesting even in the classical language he liked to twist words back on themselves to see what happened pekka gave him a sweet smile any weather with you out in it master would soon become indecent siuntio coughed fernao chuckled ilmarinen guffawed that all depends on whether the experiment goes up or down he said siuntio coughed again more sharply this time let us please remember the high seriousness of the work in which we are engaged he said why ilmarinen asked the work will go on just the same either way well have more fun if we have more fun though we are also more likely to make a mistake if we take things lightly siuntio said considering the forces we are trying to manipulate a mistake would be something less than desirable enough pekka said before the elderly and distinguished mages could get any further into their schoolboy bickering one of the mistakes we make is arguing among ourselves quite right siuntio nodded then shook a finger in ilmarinens direction you should pay attention to mistress pekkas wisdom for she now fernao coughed it pains me to tell you this master siuntio he said in his careful kaunian but you are still arguing i am siuntio sounded astonished then he seemed to consider why so i am he dipped his head to fernao my thanks for pointing it out i confess i hadnt noticed pekka believed him he was just the sort of man who might do such a thing without paying much attention to what he was doing she said when we go out today or tomorrow if we do not get the chance to do it today we have to remind the secondary sorcerers to bend every effort to keeping all the animals hale while we perform the primary incantations having one of the rats in the younger group die before the spell was complete ruined a days work and more as opposed to ruining a good part of the landscape ilmarinen said we have already done that pekka said even after the blizzards come and pour snow over the latest hole in the ground you can still see the scars of what we have done she shook her head and to think all this started with an acorn disappearing more than an acorn disappearing nowadays fernao said but that will be the experiment the textbooks of the future mention textbooks ilmarinen said with the scorn of a man whod written a good many the permanent written record of what the world doesnt remember quite the right way i want to go out to the site pekka said i want to go into the blockhouse and cast the spells we have come so far now we need to go on we need to pluck more fresh green grass from the latest crater ilmarinen said throwing oil on the fire we need to see what we can do about that and we need to see if anything smarter than a blade of grass can come through unchanged he eyed fernao then shook his head no you wouldnt make a proper experimental subject there true fernao agreed imperturbably i am not green ilmarinen looked wounded at having provoked no warmer response pekka pushed her plate toward the center of the table and stood up let us go out to the blockhouse she said let us see if we can keep from snapping one anothers heads off while we go as usual she rode in the sleigh with fernao part of that was deference to the two senior sorcerers part of it was that the two younger mages had more in common with each other than either did with siuntio or ilmarinen some small part of it was slowly growing pleasure in each others company the blockhouse had had new work done on it since the experiments began to make it stronger and better able to withstand the energies the mages released even so the secondary sorcerers set up the rows of animal cages more than twice as far from the little reinforced hut as they had when the series of spells started well lets get on with it ilmarinen said when they were assembled in the blockhouse with any luck at all we can drop this whole corner of the island into the sea in a few weeks who knows maybe well manage the whole island one of the secondary sorcerers said may it please you masters mistress the animals are ready he spoke in kuusaman when he started to repeat himself in classical kaunian for fernaos benefit the lagoan mage said never mind i understand in kaunian pekka said your kuusaman has a noticeable kajaani accent does it fernao said i wonder why that would be they smiled at each other to business if you please siuntio said aye to business pekka agreed she took a deep breath then intoned the words with which a mage of her blood prefaced every major sorcerous operation before the kaunians came we of kuusamo were here before the lagoans came we of kuusamo were here after the kaunians departed we of kuusamo were here we of kuusamo are here after the lagoans depart we of kuusamo shall be here siuntio and ilmarinen both nodded theyd used that ritual far longer than shed been alive one of fernaos eyebrows rose he had to know what the words were what they meant did he believe them as the kuusaman sorcerers did that was bound to be a different question ritual complete pekka glanced to the secondary sorcerers they nodded they were ready to support the experimental animals and to transmit the magecraft so it had its proper effect pekka took another deep breath i begin she had not got more than half a dozen lines into the newly revised and strengthened spell not nearly far enough to land in serious trouble for stopping when her head suddenly came up and she looked away from the text shed been reading somethings wrong she said first in her own language then in classical kaunian siuntio and fernao both frowned whatever it was that had disturbed her they didnt sense it but ilmarinens head was up and swinging this way and that too the expression on his face one that might have been a wolfs when it feared a hunter close by and then as that wary old wolf might have he took a scent the algarvians he said harshly another slaughter this time siuntio nodded his eyes went very wide wider than pekka had ever seen them wider than shed thought a kuusamans eyes could get white showed all around his irises he said the three worst words pekka could imagine just then aimed at us pekka gasped she felt it too the horrid sense of potent murderpowered magic not so far away she and siuntio and ilmarinen had been in yliharma when mezentios mages attacked the capital of kuusamo that had been bad very bad she hadnt thought anything could be much worse but shed been wrong now she found out how wrong as he usually did siuntio had the right of it this time the stolen life energy of those kaunian captives was hurled straight at the blockhouse a deadly dart of sorcerous force the lamps flickered in a strange rhythmic pattern then the walls started to shake in the same rhythm and then the floor beneath pekkas feet the air felt hot and thick in her lungs it tasted of blood the paper on which her cantrip was written burst into flames one of the secondary sorcerers screamed her hair had burst into flames too a comrade swaddled her head with a blanket but the flames did not want to go out no siuntio shouted a battle cry that might have burst from the throat of a man half his age by the powers above no you shall not have us you shall not he began what had to be a counterspell pekka had never imagined such a thing one determined mage all alone trying to withstand the massed might of many a might magnified by murder ilmarinens voice joined siuntios a moment later they were the finest sorcerers of their generation for an instant just for an instant pekka marshaling in her mind what she could do to aid their magecraft thought they might have fought the algarvians to a standstill but then the lamps went out altogether plunging the blockhouse into darkness with a shriek of bursting timbers the roof fell in something hit pekka in the side of the head the dark went black shot with scarlet she couldnt have stayed senseless long when she woke she was lying in the snow outside the blockhouse the burning blockhouse for flames crackled and smoke poured from it she tried to sit up but the pounding pain in her head got worse her eyes didnt want to focus the world seemed to spin so did her guts she leaned over and was violently sick in the snow somewhere not far away ilmarinen let out a string of horrible curses in kuusaman kaunian and lagoan all mixed together go after him you fools he bellowed go after him go on powers below eat you all hes worth more than the lot of you put together get him out of there pekka tried again to sit this time moving ever so slowly and carefully she managed it ilmarinen and fernao both stood by the blockhouse fernao was shouting too in kaunian when he remembered and in incomprehensible lagoan when he didnt ilmarinen tried to run into the burning building one of the secondary sorcerers grabbed him and pulled him back he stuck an elbow into the mans belly and broke free but two other men seized him before he could do what he so plainly wanted to fernao turned to him and said something pekka didnt catch ilmarinens shoulders sagged he seemed to shrink in on himself in that moment for the very first time he looked his age with another twenty years tacked on besides pekka grubbed up some snow well away from where shed vomited and used it to rinse the vile taste from her mouth the motion drew the notice of the other two theoretical sorcerers they both came over to her fernao making slow going of it with the one stick hed managed to bring out into the open what what happened the banality of the question shamed pekka but it was the best she could do the algarvians must have noticed the sorcerous energy we were releasing in our experiments fernao answered they decided to put a stop to them he had a cut above one eye a shiner and another cut on his cheek and appeared to notice none of them ilmarinen added rather like stepping on a cockroach with a mountain powers above theyre strong when they want to be curse them all curse them forever tears froze halfway down his cheeks trying to make her battered brains think at all pekka asked wheres master siuntio neither mage answered fernao looked back toward the burning blockhouse ilmarinen started cursing again more tears flowed and froze pekka gulped a heartsickness far worse than the pounding her body had taken siuntio gone now when they needed him more than ever grimly ilmarinen said there shall be a reckoning aye by the powers above there shall be a reckoning indeed fernao sat in the dining room of the small hostel in the kuusaman wilderness when he lifted a finger a serving woman brought him a new glass of brandy glasses hed already emptied crowded the table in front of him no one said a word about it kuusamans often mourned their dead with spirits if a foreigner wanted to do likewise they would let him presently i shall fall asleep fernao thought with the false clarity of a man already drunk and getting drunker then they will carry me upstairs the way they carried ilmarinen upstairs half an hour ago he was surprised and proud hed outlasted the kuusaman mage but ilmarinen had thrown himself into his binge with a frightening enthusiasm as if he didnt care whether he came out the other side hed known siuntio for more than fifty years in their minds theyd both gone places no one else in the world could reach till they showed the way no wonder ilmarinen drank as if hed lost a brother maybe a twin fernao reached for the new glass reached for it and missed hold still he told it and tried again this time he not only captured it he raised it to his mouth even if his body didnt want to obey him his wits still worked after a fashion what will i be like tomorrow morning he wondered a truly frightening thought he drank some more to drown it part of him knew that wouldnt help he drank anyway hed almost emptied the glass when pekka stepped into the dining room seeing him she came his way she walked slowly and carefully shed taken a nasty whack when the blockhouse came down in ruin and her head had to hurt even more now than his would come morning may i join you she asked aye please do i am honored fernao remembered to answer in classical kaunian not lagoan which she didnt speak he stopped just before he ran through the whole passive conjugation of the verb to honor you are honored hesheit is honored we i wondered if i would see master ilmarinen here pekka said he went bellyup a while ago fernao answered ah pekka nodded they understood each other those two i wonder if anyone else did that so closely paralleled fernaos thought he tried to tell her of it his tongue tripped over itself and wouldnt let him i am sorry milady he said you see me not at my best he knocked back his brandy and signaled for another you need not apologize not here not now pekka said i would drink to the dead too but the healers gave me a decoction of poppy juice and told me i must not take spirits with it the serving woman brought fernao a fresh brandy then glanced a question at pekka ever so slightly the kuusaman mage shook her head the serving woman went away which decoction fernao asked what with his injuries down in the land of the ice people hed become something of an expert on the anodynes made from poppy sap it was yellow and tasted nasty pekka answered ah the yellow one part of fernaos nod was drunken gravity part remembering aye compared to some of the others it leaves your wits fairly clear then the others must be ferocious pekka said i thought my head would float away considering how it felt i hoped my head would float away some of the drug has worn off since her grimace showed she wished it hadnt she brightened when she added i can take more soon for fernao the yellow decoction had been a long and welcome step back toward the real world hed been taking more potent mixtures before for pekka plainly it was a long and welcome step out of the real world after a little while she said one of the secondary sorcerers told me you dragged me out of the blockhouse thank you i wish i could have carried you abrupt fury filled fernaos voice if i could have moved faster i might have got you out and then gone back in and got siuntio too before the fire spread too badly if he knocked back the brandy in spite of it his hand shook as he set down the empty glass pekka said had you been standing closer to him than to me you would have taken him first and then you would have tried to come back for me she reached into her belt pouch and took out a bottle full of the yellow decoction and a spoon it is not quite time for my dose yet but i do not care i do not wish to think about that fernao would have taken more but he was bigger than she the serving woman appeared at his elbow he hadnt noticed her come up there were a good many things he wasnt noticing right now will i get you another sir she asked no thank you he said and she went away again how badly are we set back pekka said fernao shrugged i think they are still sorting things out sooner or later we shall have answers answers of a sort pekka said but we shall never again have master siuntios answers and there are none better she sighed but then her painand grieflined face softened the decoction works quickly i can forget for a little while that my head belongs to me i know about that fernao said believe me i know about that he also knew he would wish for some of the yellow liquid or maybe one of the stronger ones in the morning he would wish for it but he wouldnt borrow any from pekka after so long taking decoctions of one color or another hed had to get over a craving for poppy juice he didnt want to bring it back to life he hoped he would remember that when he went from drunk to hung over pekka said what will we do without siuntio how can we go on without him he made this field what it is today everyone else walks in his footsteps except ilmarinen who walks around them and pisses in them whenever he sees the chance fernao would have laughed at that even sober drunk he thought it the funniest thing hed ever heard he laughed and laughed he laughed so hard he had to put his head down on the table that proved a mistake or at least the end of his evening he never heard himself starting to snore he never knew how he got into his bed either most likely the servitors carried him up as theyd carried up ilmarinen fernao couldnt have proved it for all he could prove it might as readily have been cockroaches or dragons whoever had done it he wished theyd thrown him on the rubbish heap instead his head pounded even worse than hed thought it would the wan sunshine of winter in southern kuusamo seemed as bright as the zuwayzi desert he had to squint to see at all by the taste in his mouth hed been sleeping in a latrine trench he felt of himself and made at least one happy discovery powers above be praised i didnt piss the bed he said then he winced again his voice might have been a ravens a very loud ravens harsh croak holding his head with his free hand he limped into the commode with one crutch along with a water closet it also boasted a coldwater tap he splashed water on his face he cleaned his teeth after rinsing his mouth he took a couple of sips of water even that was almost too much for his poor abused stomach he thought hed be sick right there somehow he wasnt groaning and trying not to groan because the noise hurt his head he limped back to bed he felt better than he had before he got up which meant he was no longer actively wishing he were dead he lay there for a while quiet and with his eyes closed he did his best to wait out the hangover again he didnt notice drifting off this time he fell into something close to real sleep not sodden unconsciousness he would have slept longer but someone tapped on his door the taps werent very loud except to his ears he sat up and winced who is it he asked and winced again i pekkas voice came through the door may i come in i suppose so fernao answered the door opened pekka carried a tray to his bedside here she said briskly half a raw cabbage chopped and a mug of cranberry juice with a slug a small slug of spirits mixed in eat drink you will be better for it will i fernao said dubiously his own countrymen used fruit juice laced with spirits to fight the morning after but cabbage was a remedy new to him he didnt much feel like eating or drinking anything but had to admit himself improved after he did pekka saw as much you will do she said ilmarinen is worse but he will do too in an odd way fernao found himself agreeing with her he would do how are you he asked knowing sudden shame that hed let her serve him you are the one who is truly hurt this he patted his own forehead this will be nothing at all in a few hours but you have real injuries my head hurts pekka said matteroffactly i have a little trouble remembering things i would not want to try to work magic right now i do not think it is the yellow decoction i think you are right i think it is the blow to the head as with you time will set it right with the yellow liquid it is not too bad he suspected she was making light of what had happened to her if she wanted to do that he wouldnt challenge her he honored her courage there was something hed meant to tell her the night before he was surprised he recalled it he was surprised he recalled anything from the night before but he realized now that it didnt matter he couldnt say what hed meant to anyhow pekka went on alkio and raahe and piilis will be coming here now you will know of them if you do not know them i met them in yliharma fernao said good theoretical sorcerers all three aye pekka nodded carefully and the first two husband and wife work very well together add up the three of them and they are not too far from siuntio may it be so fernao wondered if three good mages could match one towering genius and now the seven princes will give us everything we need or might need or imagine we need pekka said if we have done enough to alarm the algarvians to make them strike at us we must be doing something worthwhile or so the princes think this assault may prove the greatest mistake mezentios mages ever made may it be so fernao repeated and siuntio saved us pekka said he and ilmarinen had they not resisted as best they could we would all have died in the blockhouse fernao could only nod at that pekka rose and picked up the tray i will not disturb you anymore i hope you feel better soon and you he called as she left the room no he couldnt very well tell her shed made one small mistake when the algarvians assailed the blockhouse out in the wilderness hed been several strides closer to siuntio than to her but hed turned one way done one thing and not the other and now he and everyone else everyone save poor siuntio would have to live with the consequences of that before hed got blazed major spinello had served in southern unkerlant now hed been sent to the north of king swemmels realm he found he loathed this part of the kingdom at least as much as hed despised the other blizzards seemed less common here but cold driving rain went a long way toward making up for them most of his regiment was holed up in a little town called wriezen with the rest on a picket line west of the place nothing would be coming at them quickly not today and not tomorrow or the next day either here in the north the muddy season lasted most of the winter naturally spinello had commandeered the finest house in wriezen as his own it had probably belonged to the firstman of the place but hed long since fled spinello turned to his seniormost company commander a dour captain named turpino and said how do we give the unkerlanters a good boot in the balls we wait till the ground dries out and then we outmaneuver them turpino answered sir spinello hopped in the air in annoyance no no no he exclaimed that isnt what i meant how do we boot em in the balls now turpino who was several inches taller than he looked down his nose at him we dont he said sir spinello carefully didnt notice how slow turpino was with the title of respect do swemmels men think we cant do anything in this mess too he demanded of course they do turpino answered theyre no fools by his tone he wasnt sure the same applied to his superior officer if they think it cant be done thats the best argument in the world for doing it spinello said now we have to consider ways and means excellent turpino gave him a stiff bow if you transform our soldiers into worms they can crawl through the mud and take the unkerlanters by surprise coming at them from behind if i transform my troopers into worms youll be a bloodsucking leech spinello thought resentfully with the south in chaos we ought to keep moving forward here in the north if the moves serve some strategic purpose certainly turpino said spinello snapped his fingers to show what he thought of strategic purpose part of him knew the gloomy captain had a point of sorts the rest the bigger part craved action especially after so long flat on his back he said anything that throws the foe into confusion and either forces him back or forces him to shift troops here serves a strategic purpose would you not agree captain turpinos face was a closed book i would rather answer a specific question than a hypothetical one it was as polite a way of saying you wont ask me a specific question because you havent got a real plan as any spinello had heard if turpino hadnt irked him he might have admired the other officer instead snapping his fingers again he said what are the dominant features of the terrain at the present time captain rain turpino answered at once mud very good spinello bowed and made as if to applaud and how do we get around in the mud pray mostly we dont turpinos responses were getting shorter and shorter with another bow sooner or later turpino would have to lose his temper spinello said let me try a different question how do the unkerlanters get around in the rain he held up a forefinger you neednt answer i already know they have those highwheeled wagons with the round bottoms that might almost be boats if anything moves those wagons do miserable little things turpinos lip curled they dont hold much but what they do hold moves spinello said if we can get our hands on a hundred of them captain we can move too and the unkerlanters will never expect us to use those miserable little things he didnt quite mimic turpinos tone but he came close what do you think turpino grunted aye we might move he said at last if we could lay hold of a hundred of them sir by the way he sounded he didnt think the regiment could do it spinello grinned at him you will provide the wagons for the regiment captain you have four days gather them here and we shall go west otherwise we hold in place this time turpino didnt say anything of course he didnt spinello had given him an order he disliked if he failed to carry it out nothing much would happen to the regiment or to him spinellos grin got wider if that attack goes in my dear fellow i intend to lead it in person if i fall the regiment is yours at least for the time being i cant promise you a pretty blond kaunian popsy like the one i enjoyed back in forthweg but isnt that the next best thing turpino still didnt smile he was far more staid than most of his countrymen all he said was ill see what i can do four days later wagons clogged the muddy streets of wriezen commendable initiative captain spinello remarked incentive turpino replied sir now lads spinello raised his voice to be heard through the rain swemmels men dont expect us to do a thing in this weather and when we do things the unkerlanters dont expect they break youve seen it ive seen it weve all seen it so lets go give them a surprise shall we he blew his whistle forward where anything else would have bogged down in the thick mud the wagons did go forward along with commandeering them from the countryside captain turpino had also made sure the regiment had plenty of horses and mules to draw them he wanted the attack to go in after all if it failed and maybe even if it succeeded the regiment would be his the rain hadnt eased that cut spinellos visibility down to yards but he didnt mind if anything it cheered him he knew where the unkerlanters were this way they wouldnt be able to see his men and him coming a few eggs not many burst out in front of the wagons here in the north not enough eggtossers were stretched too thin along too many miles of battle line spinello hadnt even tried to get turpino to gather them as hed gathered the wagons no one cared about funnylooking unkerlanter wagons but every algarvian officer jealously clutched to his bosom all the eggtossers he had one slow step after another the horse pulled spinellos wagon forward the rest of the wagons churned their way west along the road and through the fields to either side with their tall wheels they found bottom where any algarvian vehicle this side of a leyline caravan would have bogged down mucky wakes streamed out behind those wheels and sometimes behind the wagons too as if they were on a river rather than what was supposed to be dry land somebody up ahead shouted something at spinello in a language he didnt understand if it wasnt unkerlanter he would have been mightily surprised he shouted back not in algarvian but in classical kaunian in which he was quite fluent the odd sounds confused the fellow whod challenged him the stranger shouted again this time with a questioning note in his voice by then spinellos wagon had got close enough to let him see the other man an unkerlanter sure enough it had also got close enough to let him blaze the fellow in spite of the way the driving rain degraded his beams performance his stick went to his shoulder his finger found the touchhole the unkerlanter had been about to blaze at him too instead he crumpled back into his hole in the ground spinello whooped with glee he blew his whistle again a long piercing blast forward he shouted forward they went they knocked over a few more pickets and then rolled toward a peasant village about a quarter the size of wriezen a couple of unkerlanter soldiers came out of the thatchroofed huts and waved to them as they came up spinello laughed out loud swemmels men thought they were the only ones who knew what those wagons were good for they soon discovered their mistake the algarvians swarmed out of the wagons and through the village making short work of the little unkerlanter garrison there before long some highpitched screams rang out that meant theyd found women and were making a different sort of short work of them spinello let them have their fun for a little while but only for a little while then he started blowing his whistle again come on my dears he shouted finish them off and lets get back to work theyre only ugly unkerlanters after all theyre not worth keeping once his men or most of them were back in the wagons the advance slashed forward again not far west of the village they came upon three batteries of unkerlanter eggtossers again they overran them without much trouble the enemy didnt realize he was in danger till too late turn them around boys turn them around spinello said and his soldiers fell to work with a will lets drop some eggs on the heads of our dear friends farther west captain turpino squelched up to him youre not advancing any more he asked i hadnt planned to spinello answered weve done what we came to do after all go too far and swemmels men will bite back to his surprise turpino swept off his hat and bowed low command me sir he exclaimed his voice more friendly more respectful than spinello had ever heard it youve proved you know what youre doing have i spinello said and turpino still bareheaded nodded spinello went on well then put your hat back on before you drown turpino laughed another first and obeyed spinello asked him do you know anything about serving eggtossers aye somewhat the other officer replied good you take charge of that business spinello said ill make sure the unkerlanters wont have an easy time throwing us back i was down in sulingen i know all about field fortifications by the powers above mm turpino grunted again aye you would down there howd you get out before spinello could answer the captain pointed to the wound badge on his chest is that when you picked up your trinket spinello nodded sniper got me a month or so before the unkerlanters cut us off so they were able to fly me out and patch me up his wave encompassed the ground the regiment had taken now well patch this place up and hold onto it as long as we can or else move forward again if we see the chance would turpino argue again no the senior captain just saluted if he was happy the rest of the officers in the regiment would be to spinello that mattered almost as much as taking a worthless village and some eggtossers away from king swemmels men hed made the regiment his from here on out it would follow wherever he led cockroaches scuttled across the floor of talsus cell hed given up stomping them not long after his captors put him in there he could have stomped night and day and not killed them all this one prison probably held as many of them as jelgava held people his stomach growled these past few days hed started getting tempted to kill them again rather than doing his best to ignore them they were food or they could be food if a man were desperate enough talsu didnt want to think he was that desperate but the bowls of mush his captors doled out didnt come close to keeping him fed his body was consuming itself he didnt want to take off his tunic his cell was anything but warm but when he ran a hand along his ribs he found them easier to feel every day as the flesh melted off him more and more he found himself wondering what the roaches tasted like and whether he could get them down without heaving them up again a moment later one day the door to his cell came open at an hour when it usually stayed closed three guards stood outside all of them with their sticks pointed at him come along with us one of them said why talsu asked moving at all seemed more trouble than it was worth but the guard strode in and backhanded him across the face because i say so you stinking turd he said you dont ask questions here curse you we ask questions he slapped talsu again now come along tasting blood from a split lip talsu came he feared he knew where they were going after theyd taken two turns he knew he was right the jelgavan constabulary captain hadnt grilled him for a while he wondered what sort of torments he would have to go through this time and whether he would be able to endure them without starting to name names for the algarvians hound he was still half a corridor away from the captains office when his nose twitched his head came up it had been a long time since hed smelled roast mutton rather than the usual prison stinks spit flooded into his mouth he muttered under his breath being careful not to say anything loud enough to draw the notice and anger of the guards hed only thought he knew how hungry he was here he is sir the guards shoved him into the office talsu son of traku the constabulary captain exclaimed as if greeting an old friend how are you today sit down why dont you astonishingly a chair waited for talsu in front of the captains desk he hadnt noticed it till the captain invited him to sit he hadnt noticed it because all his attention focused on the desk itself and on the lovely leg of mutton sitting there along with olives and white bread and butter and green beans cooked with little bits of bacon and a big carafe of wine red as blood how are you today the constabulary captain asked again as talsu like a man in a dream took his seat hungry talsu murmured he could hardly talk powers above he could hardly think staring at all that wonderful food so hungry isnt that interesting the jelgavan in algarvian service replied and here i was just sitting down to supper he gestured to the guard whod slapped talsu around pour this fellow some wine will you and some for me too while youre at it sure enough two glasses stood by that carafe the guard filled them both talsu waited till he saw the constabulary captain drink before raising his own glass to his lips he realized that might not help if the wine was drugged the captain might already have taken an antidote but talsu couldnt resist the temptation he took a long pull at the glass ahh he said when he set it down he might almost have been sighing with longing for gailisa his wife he smacked his lips savoring the sweetness of the grape cut with the juices of lemon and lime and orange in the usual jelgavan fashion slowly deliberately the constabulary captain cut a slice from the leg of mutton and set the meat on his plate he took a bite chewed with appetite and swallowed then he looked up his blue eyes mild and frank met talsus would you like to join me for supper he asked aye the word was out of talsus mouth before he could call it back he wished he hadnt said it but the constable would have known he was thinking it even so pour him some more wine the captain said as the guard obeyed the officer helped himself to green beans ate an olive and spat the pit into the wastepaper basket and tore off a chunk of that lovely white loaf and spread butter over it he smiled at talsu its all very good talsu didnt dare speak he also didnt dare hurl himself at the food on the constabulary captains desk without permission no matter how hungry he was he feared what the guards would do to him but he had permission to drink the wine after the stale musty water hed been getting how fine it tasted half starved as he was it mounted straight to his head back in skrunda a couple of glasses of wine wouldnt have mattered much back in skrunda though he would have had enough to eat he wouldnt have poured them down on an empty an ever so empty stomach now then the constabulary captain said suppose you tell me the names of the others who conspired with you against king mainardo back in skrunda he took another bite of pink juicy mutton if you want us to cooperate with you after all you have to cooperate with us my friend he swallowed the bite hed never missed a meal constabulary captains never did cooperate talsu could hear how his own voice slurred instead of naming names he said what was uppermost in his mind feed me all in good time my friend all in good time the constable took a bit of bread butter left his lips greasy shiny till he gently blotted them on a snowy linen napkin at his gesture the guard put an identical napkin on talsus lap then the fellow poured talsus wineglass full once more i dont want but talsu couldnt say that he couldnt come close to saying that he did want the wine he wanted it with all his soul even it made him feel less empty inside he drank quickly fearful lest the guard snatch the glass from his hand when the glass was empty again he stared owlishly at the food its very good the constabulary captain remarked tell us a few names whats so hard about that once youve done it you can eat your fill feed me first talsu whispered it wasnt bargaining at least he didnt think of it as bargaining it was much more like pleading the captain nodded to the guard but it wasnt the sort of nod talsu had hoped for the guard slapped him again hard enough to make his head ring he dropped the wineglass it fell on the floor and broke you dont tell us what to do the captain said in a voice like iron we tell you what to do have you got that the guard belted him again through swollen lips now bleeding freely talsu mumbled aye well good the interrogators tone softened i try to give you something you might want and what thanks do i get what cooperation do i get i must say youve disappointed me talsu son of traku im sure you dont disappoint the algarvians talsu said he hurt already he didnt think theyd make him hurt too much worse they were about to do their best the guards whod brought him from the cell growled and raised their arms to strike but the constabulary captain raised his arm too hand open palm out wait he said and the guards stopped his gaze swung back to talsu i do my duty i serve my king whoever he may be i served king donalitu now i serve king mainardo should king donalitu return which i do not expect i would serve him again and he would want my services for i am good at what i do i dont understand talsu muttered his notion of duty was loyalty to the kingdom his interrogator seemed to think it meant going on with his job no matter whom it benefited that the work was an end in itself not a means to serving jelgava talsu wished he thought the captain a hypocrite unfortunately he was convinced the man meant every word he said you dont need to understand the constabulary captain told him all you need to do is give me the names of others in skrunda who are not favorably inclined to the present authorities ive told you before kugu the silversmith is the only one who ever said anything like that to me talsu answered ill gladly denounce him that i fear is not an adequate offer the interrogator cut a bite of mutton and offered it to talsu on the tip of his knife here maybe this will make you change your mind talsu leaned forward he more than half expected the officer to withdraw the meat as he did so but the man held it steady he took the bite off the knife it was as good as hed thought it would be he chewed it as long as he could and then a little longer than that but at last he had to swallow when he did the constabulary captain handed him an olive he ate it with the same loving care hed given the mutton to show his thanks he didnt spit the pit back at the interrogator but down on the floor by his chair now the officer said with the air of a man getting down to business do you suppose you can come up with any more names for me it would be a shame to make me eat this whole lovely supper by myself talsus belly screamed for food screamed all the louder now that it had a tiny bit inside it wine made his tongue freer as the constabulary captain must have planned but the wine didnt make his tongue run along the ley line for which the interrogator had hoped he said when the algarvians ship you west to cut your throat do you think theyll care what you did for them that blaze got home just for a moment talsu saw fury in the constables eyes fury and fear whatever it was didnt stay there long the interrogator nodded to the guards you may as well go ahead boys it seems ive kept you waiting too long already the guards did go ahead and with a will they had to manhandle talsu back to his cell by the time theyd finished he couldnt put one foot in front of the other when they let go of him he lay on the floor while the door slammed shut behind him only later did he find the strength to crawl to his cot a cockroach scuttled over him and then another he lacked the energy to try to mash them or to catch them maybe i should have made up some names he thought they hadnt beat him up so badly the time before but then theyd own you the way they own kugu that was doubtless true the way he hurt now he had a hard time caring durrwangen was less battered than sulingen had been that was about as much as marshal rathar would say for the city down in sulingen the algarvians had fought till they couldnt fight anymore here theyd pulled out just before his armies surrounded them that meant some buildings remained intact he made his headquarters in one of those it had been a bank by the time he took possession of it though the vaults were empty someone algarvian or unkerlanter was richer than he had been if hed lived to enjoy his wealth along with general vatran rathar studied a map tacked to the wall vatran was in high spirits as high as rathar had ever seen him show weve got the whoresons vatran boomed by the powers above theyre on the run now i never thought id see the day but i believe i do it could be rathar said aye it could be that was as large a display of high spirits as he would allow himself no not quite when he reached out and touched the map he might have been caressing the soft warm flesh of his beloved and he had reason to caress that map three unkerlanter columns pushed out from durrwangen one to the east one to the northeast toward the border of the duchy of grelz and one due north the algarvians werent managing much more than a rearguard fight against any of them did i hear right vatran asked did the redheads cashier the general who pulled their soldiers out of here without orders thats what captives say rather answered id be amazed if they were wrong vatrans chuckle was wheezy oh aye lord marshal so would i his bushy white eyebrows flew upwards if one of our generals had done such a thing if one of our generals had done such a thing hed count himself lucky to get cashiered hed count himself lucky just to lose his head he would sure as sure king swemmeld be pouring the water into a great big pot and stoking the fire underneath it rathar nodded a good many officers whod failed to meet king swemmels exacting requirements were no longer among those present rathar had come close to seeing the inside of a stew pot a couple of times himself but when he looked at the map he made a discontented noise that was a stupid order the one to hold durrwangen at all costs i mean the redhead may have paid with his job but he saved an army the algarvians will be able to use against us somewhere else would you have disobeyed vatrans voice was sly dont ask me things like that rathar said irritably im not an algarvian and im cursed glad im not too but he kept worrying at the question as he might have at a bit of gristle stuck between two back teeth mezentio gave his officers more freedom to use their judgment than did swemmel who trusted no ones judgment but his own not even the algarvians though tolerated direct disobedience the man whod retreat from durrwangen had got the sack and yet rathar studied the map one more time trying to remember how things had been a few weeks before he couldnt make himself believe that redhead had been wrong a commotion in the street outside the plundered bank distracted him or rather he let it distract him not something he usually did vatran now vatran liked excitement lets see whats going on he said and rathar followed him out men and women pointed and hooted at three men led up the street by soldiers carrying sticks youre going to get it somebody shouted at the glumlooking men somebody else added aye and youll deserve it too oh is this all vatran looked and sounded disappointed aye collaborators the word left a sour nasty taste in rathars mouth hed seen and heard of too many men and women willing even eager to go along with the algarvian invaders things werent so bad here as they were over in grelz but they were bad enough but when the unkerlanters retook a town people sometimes settled scores with enemies by calling them collaborators hed seen and heard of too much of that too none of these men was crying out that hed been wrongly accused even the guilty often did that the silence here said these fellows had no hope of being believed which meant they must have been in bed with the redheads vatran must have been thinking along similar lines for he said good riddance to bad rubbish we might as well get back to work fair enough no one ever had to urge rathar back to work twice when they returned vatran pointed to the map and said the more i look at it the worse the trouble mezentios men are in heres hoping youre right rathar tapped the pins that showed how far the columns advancing out of durrwangen had got what we have to do is we have to make sure we push the algarvians back as far as we can before the spring thaw gets this far south then well be properly set up for the battles this summer for two summers in a row king swemmel had wanted to hit the algarvians before they hit him the first year hed flatout failed king mezentio beat him to the punch the second year vatran had launched an attack against the redheads south of aspang right into the teeth of their own building force attack all too soon became retreat this coming summer rathar dared look ahead to the battles of this coming summer with something approaching optimism and then vatran said the other thing i wonder is what new sorceries the algarvian mages will come up with that sank rathars optimism as if it were an egg bursting on a fishing boat with an angry grunt the marshal answered those whoresonsll fight the war to the very last kaunian there will be a reckoning for that by the powers above there will be vatran grunted too oh theres a reckoning all right every time they slaughter their kaunian captives to power magecraft against us we have to reckon how many of our own peasants weve got to kill to block their sorcery and to make matching magics of our own aye a lot of kingdoms rathar suspected would have folded up and yielded when the algarvians started aiming murderpowered magecraft at them hed been horrified himself no one had fought wars like that for centuries the twinkings war had been as savage a struggle as any in the world but neither swemmel nor kyot had started massacring people for the sake of potent sorcery but swemmel hadnt hesitated here not for a heartbeat as soon as hed learned what the algarvians were doing hed ordered his own archmage to match mezentios men murder for murder hed come right out and said that he didnt care if he ended up with only one subject so long as no algarvians were left by then in a way marshal rathar had to admire such ruthless determination without it the algarvians probably would have taken cottbus and who could guess whether unkerlant would have been able to continue the fight without its capital cottbus had held sulingen had held and now rathars men were moving forward in another way though swemmels complete indifference to what happened to his kingdom as long as he held the throne chilled the marshal to the marrow if rathar failed he might end up in a camp with his throat slit to fuel the magic backing the attack some other marshal would make before he could go on with that gloomy thought a dowser rushed into the headquarters and cried dragons dragons heading this way out of the north how many rathar rapped out how soon i dont know lord marshal the man answered theyre throwing out those cursed strips of paper again dowsers had a sorcerous gift sometimes the only sorcerous gift they had for sensing motion water through ground ships on water dragons through the air but algarvian dragonfliers had taken to throwing out bits of paper as they flew the motion of those scraps helped mask the motion of the dragons themselves wont be long vatran predicted gloomily rathar could only nod because he thought the general was right vatran went on well whatll it be when they do get here will they go after the ley lines again or will they try and drop those eggs on our heads place your bets folks if they have any sense theyll go after the ley lines rathar replied if their eggs can smash up the depot or hit a line itself and overload it with energy that really hurts us but if they knock headquarters flat so what swemmel chooses a couple of new generals and the war goes on the same as it would have vatran chuckled you dont give yourself enough credit marshal or me either come to that before rathar could answer eggs started bursting not far away maybe the redheads are being stupid the marshal said in any case i move we adjourn ive heard worse ideas vatran admitted they both went down into what had been the vault a faint metallic smell lingered in the air a monument of coins now vanished in the meanwhile artisans attached to the unkerlanter army had further shored up the ceiling with crisscrossing timbers if an egg burst directly on top of it those timbers might not probably wouldnt hold out all the sorcerous energy otherwise the men down there were safe enough rathar cursed in a mild sort of way whats eating you now vatran asked when im down here i cant tell where the eggs are bursting rathar complained they all just sound like theyre up there somewhere you couldnt do much about them right this minute except maybe get caught by one vatran pointed out he was right too however little rathar cared to admit it after a while vatran went on i dont know where all those eggs are bursting but sounds like theres a lot of them aye it does rathar didnt like that either the algarvians shouldnt be able to put so many dragons in the air against durrwangen the algarvians shouldnt be able to do all sorts of things they end up doing vatran said he was right about that too however little rathar cared to acknowledge it we havent routed out as many of their dragon farms as we thought we had rathar said as if to underscore his words an egg burst somewhere close to the headquarters building close enough that plaster pattered down through the rows of crisscrossed timbers and into the cellar if wed wanted easy work we would have been headsmen not soldiers vatran observed the fellows wed deal with then wouldnt fight back another near miss shook the vault and sent more plaster down into it coughing a little at the dust in the air rathar said every now and again you know that doesnt sound so bad weve got the redheads on the run remember vatran said we were both sure of it just a little while ago oh aye rathar said you know it and i know it but do the redheads know it bembo was feeling more like a spy than a constable these days turning to oraste he said i told you that kaunian robber you blazed earlier this winter would turn out to be somebody important why you lying sack of guts oraste exclaimed you didnt think anything at all about him till i wondered why his pals and him knocked over that jewelers shop and what theyd do with the loot oh bembo had the grace to look shamefaced now that i think on it you may be right may i shit in my hat if im not oraste said took us long enough to get any leads to the dead whoresons pals bembo said thats suspicious all by itself you ask me well weve got em now only question is how much good theyll do us oraste spat on the sidewalk of gromheort cursed kaunian sorcery if a blond looks like a forthwegian all the time these days how do we go about hauling him in by figuring out which forthwegian he looks like bembo answered or by remembering that the magic doesnt change his voice thats how i bagged that longwinded foof of a brivibas if youll recall he strutted a couple of paces that had been his coup not orastes his partner grunted aye but youd heard that old cocksuckers voice before we dont know what these buggers sound like since bembo didnt feel like answering that he kept quiet the address theyd been given wasnt anywhere near gromheorts kaunian quarter even though both men they wanted were or before hair dye and sorcery would have been blonds powers below eat the kaunians bembo growled they make us work too cursed hard powers below eat the kaunians oraste said period he needed no special reason to hate them he just did after another half a block he snapped his fingers you know what we ought to do stop in a tavern and have some wine bembo suggested im thirsty oraste ignored him what we ought to do is we ought to go into the kaunian quarter and grab everybody whos got dark hair ship all those fornicators west we wouldnt even have to make up any new rules to let us do it owning black hair dyes already against the law after some thought bembo nodded thats not too bad but the real trouble is all the kaunians whove already snuck out of the quarter here and the one in eoforwic once theyre out they look like ordinary forthwegians as long as they can keep the magic up then they can go anywhere and do you know what else ive heard tell me oraste was a stolid specimen of an algarvian but not altogether immune to the lodestone of gossip some of the blonds are even dyeing their bushes to make it harder for us to tell whos what bembo said thats disgusting oraste said its also pretty sneaky a lot of algarvian constables would have spoken with a certain grudging admiration they admired clever criminals and admired them all the more when they didnt have to try to run them down but oraste wasted neither admiration nor sympathy on kaunians the two constables rounded the last corner and started toward the block of flats in which the robber gippias pals were alleged to be holed up bembo whistled well weve got company a good thing too if you ask me plenty of company oraste added see the powers that be dont like kaunians who knock over jewelers shops jewels mean money and blonds with real money are liable to mean real trouble you were right bembo admitted do you want a medal if we catch these buggers theyll pin one on you id rather have some leave or a pass to a brothel but ill take a medal if they give me one oraste was a relentless pragmatist i hope theyve got a mage here bembo said as they walked up to the other constables already assembled outside the building thatd make it a lot easier to tell whos a kaunian and whos nothing but a stupid forthwegian what other kind is there asked oraste who loved none of his kingdoms neighboring peoples he went on i almost hope there isnt a mage why bembo said in surprise because if there is he wont be any bloody good thats why oraste said the ones who know what theyre doing are either home ensorceling weapons or fighting the stinking unkerlanters the kind wed get here theyd be the whoresons who couldnt count to twentyone without reaching under their kilts that jerked a laugh out of bembo when he saw that the constables did have a mage with them and what sort of mage he was it stopped being funny bembo knew a drunk when he saw one hed dragged plenty of them out of the gutter aye and beaten a few whod provoked him too this fellow was standing up but looked as if hed fall over in a stiff breeze he also looked like a man with a monster hangover an expression with which bembo was intimately familiar listen to me you people shouted the algarvian constabulary captain who looked to be in charge of things we are going to get everybody out of this here building men women children everybody well clip em all top and bottom see bembo whispered to oraste his partner nodded the captain went on on account of that still might not tell us what we want these kaunians are demon sly they are weve got master gastable here with us he pointed to the mage who still seemed less than steady he can sniff out a blond like a dog can sniff out another dogs backside bembo said and missed whatever simile the officer used so well root em out if theyre in there the constabulary captain finished and if theyre not odds are well dig up some other nasty kaunians even so our soldiersll be able to use their life energy youd best believe that use their life energy that was a nice phrase bembo contemplated it and nodded you could say something like that and not have to think at all about actually killing people bembo approved he didnt like to think about killing people even kaunians sometimes it needed doing he knew that but he didnt like to think about it lets go the captain cried the constables swarmed into the block of flats and started pounding on doors the captain stayed out on the sidewalk it wasnt as if hed do any of the hard work himself he took a flask from his belt swigged and passed it to gastable the mage open up bembo shouted in front of the first door he and oraste came to the two of them waited a few heartbeats then oraste kicked in the door the constables burst into the flat sticks aimed and ready to blaze but there was nobody to blaze the place appeared to stand empty they quickly turned it upside down poking their noses everywhere someone might hide they found nobody whoever lives therell get a surprise when he comes home tonight oraste said cheerfully he and bembo didnt bother closing the door after themselves i wonder if hell have any stuff left by then no skin off my nose either way he pounded on the next door a forthwegian woman opened it bembo eyed her appreciatively she had a pretty face he thought it a pity she followed her countrys fashion by wearing such a long baggy tunic out he said and jerked a thumb toward the stairs leading down to the street anybody else in here with you she yammered at him in forthwegian which he didnt speak he tried again this time in his halting classical kaunian she understood that and turned out to speak kaunian a lot better and a lot more angrily than he did but when oraste pointed his stick at her face she quieted down and got moving in a hurry see oraste said you just have to know which language to use they went through the flat and found an old woman snoring in bed sound asleep despite the commotion when they shook her awake she cursed in forthwegian and kaunian oh shut up you horrible hag bembo said not bothering to waste politeness on anybody who wasnt goodlooking go downstairs he managed to put that into kaunian and the old woman still fuming went i hope she turns out to be a blond oraste said serve the noisy sow right shell be steamed enough when they flip up her tunic and trim her bush bembo shuddered checking her daughter would be fun but her im glad somebody elsell get stuck doing that along with the rest of the constables they went through the building like a dose of salts a few coins left too visible ended up in bembos belt pouch he didnt notice oraste making up for low pay but he wouldnt have been surprised once the constables had got up to the top floor a sergeant said all right lets go back down and make sure the whoresons we rousted dont give anybody any trouble when bembo got down to the sidewalk again women were screeching about getting clipped anywhere but on their heads a man and woman who hadnt thought to dye the hair on their private parts had been separated from their neighbors their faces were masks of dismay four or five algarvian constables pointed sticks at them gastable was making sorcerous passes and muttering to himself in front of a pair of men who looked like forthwegians they kept on looking like forthwegians once he finished his passes too did that mean they werent disguised or was he inept bembo had no answers he suspected gastable had no answers either he wasnt the only one with such suspicions oraste said i dont think this mage could tell a turd from a tulip i wouldnt be surprised if you were right bembo agreed of course who knows if those kaunian bandits were here to begin with no sooner had the words come from his lips than the next pair of men fetched before gastable suddenly seemed to writhe and change shape they werent forthwegians they were kaunians with dyed hair the constabulary captain spoke to bembo and oraste are these the men you saw with the perpetrator gippias the two constables looked at each other they both shrugged we dont know sir bembo said when we saw em they were in their sorcerous disguise and running like blazes around a corner how are we supposed to identify them if you bloody well cant the captain asked dont you still have hold of that forthwegian who told us the name of the one kaunian whoreson bembo asked by the way the captain set his hands on his hips he didnt by the way he glared at bembo and oraste he was ready even eager to blame them for what was obviously his failing but he seemed to realize he couldnt quite get away with that scowling he tried to make the best of it well well just have to see what we can squeeze out of them aye sir bembo said that actually made sense he pointed to the two discovered kaunians and spoke to oraste in a low voice by the time were through with them theyll wish theyd just been shipped west oraste considered after a moment he said good and the two of us are off the hook bembo added as far as he was concerned that was pretty good too five when ealstan came into the flat he shared with vanai she handed him an envelope here she said this came in the mornings post the rest was just advertising circulars i threw them away he kissed his wife then said all right what have we got here he thought he knew the hand that had addressed the envelope looked familiar when he opened it and extracted the note inside he nodded ethelhelm is back in eoforwic he told vanai and hell want you to reckon up the accounts for the bands tour in the provinces she asked thats right ealstan sighed i wonder if hell have any money left what with the squeeze the redheads take from him ethelhelm was half kaunian if he hadnt been the most popular singer and band leader in forthweg he might well have been shipped west as things were the algarvians preferred to let him go on playing but to make him pay heavily for the privilege of staying free it was a highly unofficial form of taxation but that didnt mean it wasnt lucrative ethelhelm played forthwegianstyle music ealstan knew vanai didnt much care for it her tastes along those lines were purely kaunian which meant she liked a thumping beat to every song and her thoughts here werent strictly on the music anyhow she said as long as the algarvians leave him enough money to keep paying you if they dont hell bloody well have to find himself another bookkeeper thats all ealstan sighed again he used to be my friend you know not just my client he used to write bold songs strong songs songs thatd make even a lackwit sit up and think about what mezentios men were doing to us then they got their hooks into him if he hadnt gone to sing for the men of plegmunds brigade when they were training outside of town here vanais voice trailed away aye he might have stayed free ealstan said of course the redheads might have flung him into a leyline caravan car and cut his throat too you cant know ethelhelm hadnt had the nerve to find out ealstan wondered what he would have done in the band leaders place he was glad he didnt know you can worry about ethelhelm later vanai said for now you can sit down to supper i found some nice sausage at the butchers probably half horsemeat and half dog ealstan said vanai made a horrible face at him shrugging he went on i dont care ill eat it anyway as long as it doesnt bark when i stick a fork in it enough garlic and pepper and oregano and mint spiced the sausage to make it impossible to tell what the meat had been before it was ground up and stuffed into a casing whatever it was it went well with salted olives and crumbly white cheese and bread and honey and filled the hole in ealstans belly walking over to ethelhelms block of flats the next morning reminded ealstan of the distance between the wealthy entertainer and the fellow who kept books for him actually ealstan could have afforded a better flat for himself but clung to the neighborhood into which hed moved when he first came to eoforwic because it let him and more important vanai stay nearly invisible to the algarvian occupiers ethelhelms building boasted a doorman ealstan was glad his building boasted a sturdy front door the doorman opened the door from inside the lobby nodding to ealstan he said master ethelhelm told me i was to expect you sir go right on up thanks ealstan said and did ethelhelms building also boasted carpeting on the stairs nobodyd pissed in the stairwell either and yet when ealstan rapped on ethelhelms door he knew he would rather have worn his own shoes than the band leaders ethelhelm looked worn to a nub ealstan had seen that before on his face when he came back from a tour but ethelhelm had never seemed quite so frazzled till now hard trip ealstan asked hoping that accounted for the musicians state you might say so ethelhelm answered aye you just might say so a glass of brandy rested on the arm of a chair pointing to it ethelhelm asked will you join me he didnt bother to wait for an answer but went into the kitchen to pour another glass brought it back and thrust it into ealstans hand he pointed to another chair sit if you care to ealstan sat the chair at a guess was worth more than all the furniture in his flat he raised the glass ethelhelm had given him and asked to what shall we drink ive been drinking for a while the band leader said ive been drinking to being able to drink will that do for you or do i have to come up with something fancier he knocked back his glass of brandy at a gulp more cautiously ealstan drank too as bad as that he asked worse ethelhelm said eventually you can go through all the receipts and see how much money i lost it could have been worse i could have stayed here and lost even more aye as bad as that why did they let you go then if all they were going to do was steal from you ealstan didnt usually drink brandy in the morning but made an exception today he thought he would need lubricating to hear the band leaders story why ethelhelms laugh had nothing to do with honest mirth it seemed more a howl of pain ill tell you why so they would have more to steal thats why he disappeared into the kitchen again and returned with his glass newly full but i never thought when i set out that theyd steal so bloody much theyre algarvians ealstan said as if that explained everything but ethelhelm only laughed that raw wounded laugh again even algarvians have limits most of the time they dont have any limits with me none at all look he rose again ealstan had hardly any choice but to look at him the band leader was swarthy like a proper forthwegian but he overtopped ealstan who was of good size by forthwegian standards by half a head his face was longer than a forthwegians should have been too kaunian blood sure as sure if i dont do what they tell me if i dont pay whatever they ask of me his voice faded out theyd just as soon kill me as waste their time dickering you cant pick your ancestors thats what everybody says and its not a lie but oh by the powers above how i wish it were maybe you ought to quit singing and find quiet work where they wont pay any attention to you ealstan said slowly ethelhelm glared why dont you ask me to cut my leg off too while im at it if its in a trap sometimes you have to ealstan answered he knew all about that hed had to flee gromheort after stunning his cousin sidroc when sidroc found out hed been seeing vanai at the time he hadnt known whether sidroc would live or die hed lived lived and gone on to kill ealstans brother leofsig so ealstan wished hed killed him ethelhelm was shaking his head back and forth he looked trapped i cant curse it he said ask me to live without my music and you might as well ask me not to live at all patiently ealstan said im not asking you to live without your music make all you want for yourself and for whatever friends you make after you disappear from eoforwic just dont make a big enough splash with it to draw the redheads notice its not just making the music the band leader shook his head i think im trying to explain color to a blind man you dont know what its like to get up there on a stage and have thousands of people clapping and yelling out your name he waved at the elegant flat you dont know what its like to have all this stuff either ethelhelm didnt know that ealstans father was welltodo ealstan didnt know how much like his father he sounded when he said if these things are more important to you than staying alive you havent got them theyve got you same goes for getting up on stage now ethelhelm stared at him youre not my mother you know you cant tell me what to do im not telling you what to do ealstan said im just a bookkeeper so i cant but i cant help seeing how things add up either and thats what im telling you you dont have to listen to me ethelhelm kept shaking his head you dont have any idea how hard ive worked to get where i am and where is that exactly ealstan returned under the algarvians eye thats where under their thumb too curse you the band leader snarled who told you you could come here and mock me ealstan got to his feet and gave ethelhelm a courteous bow almost an algarvianstyle bow good day he said politely im sure youll have no trouble finding someone else to keep your books in order for you or you can always do it yourself he had a good deal of his fathers quiet but touchy pride too wait ethelhelm said as if he were a superior entitled to give orders ealstan kept walking toward the door wait ethelhelm said again this time with a different kind of urgency do you know any people who could help me disappear out from under the redheads noses no ealstan said and set his hand on the latch it was true he wished he did know people of that sort he would gladly have joined their ranks even if he had known them though he wouldnt have admitted it to ethelhelm the musician might have used their services but he might also have betrayed them to mezentios men to buy favor for himself ealstan opened the door then turned back and bowed again good luck powers above keep you safe walking home he wondered how hed make up the hole in his income hed just created for himself he thought he would be able to manage it hed been in eoforwic a year and a half now people who needed their accounts reckoned up were getting to know he was in business and that he was good men were pasting up new broadsheets in his neighborhood they showed a dragon with king swemmels face flaming eastern derlavai the slogan beneath reading slay the beast the algarvians used good artists ealstan still wondered if anyone took the broadsheets seriously the postman was putting mail in boxes when he went into his building one for you here the fellow said and thrust an envelope into his hand thanks ealstan replied and then said thanks again in a different tone of voice when he recognized his fathers handwriting he didnt hear from gromheort nearly often enough though he understood why he might still be sought and writing carried risk he was smiling when he opened the envelope and stepped into the stairwell hed read the letter on the way up by the time he got to the top he wasnt smiling anymore when vanai opened the door to let him in he thrust the letter into her hand she quickly read it then let out a long sigh i wish i were sorrier to hear theyd caught my grandfather she said at last he was a fine scholar is that all you have to say ealstan asked its bad luck to speak ill of the dead she answered so i said what good i could brivibas had raised vanai from the time she was small ealstan knew as much he didnt know what had estranged them and wondered if he ever would later that evening he found his fathers letter a balledup wad of paper in the wastebasket whatever her reasons vanai meant them lieutenant recareds whistle squealed forward the young officer shouted forward sergeant leudast echoed though without the accompaniment of the whistle urra the unkerlanter soldiers shouted and forward they went theyd been going forward ever since they cut off the redheads down in sulingen and leudast saw no reason they shouldnt keep right on going forward till they ran king mezentio out of his palace in trapani he had no sure notion of where trapani was until swemmels impressers hauled him into the army hed known only his own village not too far west of the border with forthweg and the nearby market town hed seen a lot more of the world since but few pleasant places in it the village ahead didnt look very pleasant it did have one thing in common with trapani wherever trapani was it was full of algarvians mezentios soldiers had never quit fighting through their long hard retreat from southern unkerlant they simply hadnt had the manpower to hold back the unkerlanters over a broad front in any one skirmish though there was no guarantee leudast and his countrymen would come out on top that thought crossed leudasts mind even before eggs started bursting among the advancing unkerlanters he threw himself down in the snow cursing as he dove nobody had told him the algarvians had a couple of eggtossers in the village some of his men dove for cover too some the new recruits mostly kept running forward in spite of the eggs a lot of them went down too as if a scythe had sliced through them at harvest time their shrieks and wails rose above the roar of the bursting eggs algarvian pickets in carefully chosen hideyholes in front of the village blazed at leudast and his comrades sir he shouted to lieutenant recared who sprawled behind a rock not far away i dont know if we can pry them out of there by ourselves at the start of the winter campaign recared would have called him a coward and might have had him blazed theyd been ordered to take the village and orders to recared might have been handed down by the powers above but action had taught the company commander a couple of things he pointed off to the left to the west we dont have to do it by ourselves weve got behemoths for company leudast yelled himself hoarse as the big beasts lumbered forward hed hated it when the algarvians threw behemoths at him and loved unkerlanter revenge in equal measure eggs from the tossers mounted on the behemoths back started bursting in the village the redheads there stopped pounding the unkerlanter footsoldiers and swung their eggtossers toward the behemoths forward recared yelled again to take advantage of the enemys distraction but even though the tossers werent aimed at the footsoldiers eggs kept bursting under them anyhow as they got closer to the village theyve buried them under the snow leudast shouted we burst them as we run over them hed seen the algarvians do that before but not since the fighting in the ruins of sulingen where theyd had plenty of time to dig in no sooner had that thought crossed his mind than an unkerlanter behemoth trod on a buried egg the burst of sorcerous energy killed the beast at once its body shielded the crew who rode it from the worst of the energies but as it toppled over onto its side it crushed a couple of men beneath it recareds whistle squealed again the shrill squeak reminded leudast of the noise a pig made in the moment it was castrated forward the young lieutenant yelled once more look behind you were not in this alone weve got reinforcements coming up to give us a hand too leudast risked a quick glance over his shoulder sure enough a fresh wave of soldiers in white smocks worn over long gray tunics stormed toward the village on the heels of recareds regiment that was plenty to make him shout urra and scramble toward the huts himself this winter for the first time his kingdom seemed able to put men where they were needed when they were needed there up till very recently far too many attacks had gone in either late or in the wrong place an algarvian picket popped up out of his hole to blaze at the onrushing unkerlanters leudast raised his own stick to his shoulder and blazed the redhead the enemy soldier went down with a screech an unkerlanter closer to that hole than leudast was jumped down into it a moment later he scrambled out again and ran on toward the village the algarvian didnt come up again as king swemmels men pushed forward a couple of enemy pickets tried to run back into the village themselves one fell before he could take half a dozen steps the other might have blazed leudast if he hadnt been more interested in trying to get away surrender leudast shouted in algarvian hands high that was about all of the language he knew all a soldier needed to know the soldier took a couple more steps leudast raised his stick ready and more than ready to blaze then the redhead seemed to realize he couldnt get away he threw his stick down in the snow and raised his hands over his head the smile he aimed at leudast was was half cheerful half fearful he loosed a torrent of speech in his own language shut up barked leudast who understood not a word he strode forward and relieved the algarvian of money and rations then gestured with his stick go to the rear hands still high the redhead obeyed maybe hed end up in a captives camp maybe the other unkerlanters would kill him before he got off the battlefield leudast didnt look back to find out sticks or bursting eggs had started fires in a couple of the peasant huts at the southern end of the village leudast welcomed the smoke it made the algarvians have a tougher time seeing him and it might attenuate their beams too more eggs churned up the ground in front of him as the behemoth crews did all they could to help the footsoldiers getting through the houses in the southern half of the village proved easier than leudast had expected once the unkerlanters reached those houses the enemy fought only a rearguard action against them that surprised leudast till he got to the edge of the market square as in most unkerlanter peasant villages the square was good and wide in happier times people would buy and sell things there or else just stand around and gossip now now the algarvians had dug themselves in on the far side of the square if the unkerlanters wanted to come at them they would have to charge across that open space it might be possible it wouldnt be easy or cheap an algarvian beam seared the timbers of the hut behind which leudast crouched he pulled back in a hurry smoke scraped his throat as he breathed in he hoped the hut wouldnt catch a couple of men both new recruits tried to rush across the square almost contemptuously the algarvians let them run for four or five strides before knocking them over one crumpled and lay still the other moaning and dragging a useless leg crawled back toward cover beams boiled snow into puffs of steam all around him hed nearly made it to safety when one struck home his moans turned to shrieks a moment later another beam bit he fell silent can we do it sergeant a soldier asked leudast he shook his head he wouldnt order a charge across the square if recared did hed try to talk the regimental commander out of it if he couldnt hed sprint across the square along with his comrades and see how far he got somewhere a few houses over lieutenant recared was speaking to some other soldiers well have to be quick aye and well have to be bold too the algarvians cant have that many men on the other side of the square leudasts heart sank he saw no reason why the redheads couldnt have that many men and more in the northern part of the village but it turned out not to matter he didnt know where the dragons came from maybe they were returning from another raid when some of their dragonfliers looked down and saw the fighting or maybe the other regiment had a crystallomancer with better connections than recareds the algarvians in the village were surely ready for an attack on the ground they were just as surely not ready for the death that swooped on them from the sky when leudast heard the thunder of great wings overhead he threw himself flat in the muddy snow not that that was likely to save him but the attacking dragons were painted rockgray and they flamed the half of the village mezentios men still held even from across the market square he could feel the heat as houses and barricades and soldiers caught fire soldiers burned not quite to death screamed a couple of minutes later the unkerlanter dragons flamed the algarvians again then they flew off toward the south even before lieutenant recared blew his precious officers whistle unkerlanters started rushing across the square a few of them fell the dragons hadnt killed all the redheads but they had flamed the heart out of the enemys position some of the algarvians fought on anyhow and made swemmels men pay a price for killing them the rest more than usual in this kind of fight surrendered they seemed dazed astonished to be alive another village down recared said proudly little by little we take back our kingdom a village down is right sir leudast answered coughing a little and then more than a little itll be a while before the peasants move back here recared opened his mouth in surprise as if the people whod once lived in the village hadnt crossed his mind they probably hadnt he was leudast knew a city man after a moment he did find a reply they werent serving the kingdom with the algarvians holding this place since that was true leudast nodded he couldnt prove recared had missed the point with what light remained to the day the unkerlanters pushed north again leudast approved of that without reservation he approved of it even more because it didnt involve fighting somewhere up ahead algarvians would be holed up in the next village when he came to them hed do whatever he had to do till then he enjoyed the respite he didnt enjoy having recared shake him awake in the middle of the night whats gone wrong sir he asked assuming something had only faint glowing embers illuminated the young lieutenants face in that dim bloody light recared looked for once far older than his years our crystallomancer just got the order he said we have to countermarch head back south what leudast exclaimed powers above why i dont know curse it the order didnt explain recared sounded as harassed as an ordinary soldier but youre bound to be right sergeant somethings gone wrong somewhere hajjaj hoped no one knew hed left bishah he did manage to sneak out of the capital every now and again so far hed managed to keep the secret from those who would have been most interested in learning it chief among them marquis balastro the algarvian minister to zuwayza balastro knew zuwayza was imperfectly happy in her role as algarves ally hajjaj worked hard to keep him from knowing just how unhappy his kingdom was not least since zuwayza would have been even unhappier without algarve as the leyline caravan glided east out of the zuwayzi capital hajjaj smiled at his secretary and said isnt it astonishing how quickly ive recovered from the indisposition everyone thinks i have qutuz smiled too astonishing indeed your excellency and i am very glad to see you looking so well i thank you my dear fellow though i think i ought to ask whether you need new spectacles hajjaj said i dont look particularly well what i look is old he paused a moment in thought of course a man my age who does not look well is liable to look dead may you live to a hundred and twenty qutuz replied a polite commonplace among the zuwayzin ive been over halfway there for a while now but i dont think my private ley line will stretch quite so far hajjaj said tewfik now tewfik seems bound and determined to take the proverb literally i hope he makes it someone does every now and then or so they say his secretary answered they say all sorts of things hajjaj observed every now and then what they say is even true but dont count on it as foreign minister of a kingdom with a large unfriendly neighbor and an arrogant cobelligerent hajjaj didnt see the advisability of counting on much of anything qutuz leaned back in his seat king shazli had laid on a firstclass caravan car for hajjaj and his secretary and remarked the scenery is prettier than usual anyhow well so it is hajjaj agreed it was high summer the last time i traveled to najran and the sun had baked the life out of everything gray rock yellow rock brown thornbushes you know what its like most of the year dont we all qutuz spoke with a certain somber pride in high summer the sun of northern zuwayza stood right at the zenith or even a little south of it something seen nowhere else on the mainland of derlavai except at oases and along the banks of the few streams that flowed down from the mountains the year around life seemed to cease qutuzs wave urged hajjaj to look out the window certainly not like that now your excellency no it isnt as his secretary had said hajjaj could for once enjoy peering through the glass late winter was the time for that in zuwayza if ever there was such a time some years there wasnt but by zuwayzi standards this had been a wet winter the thornbushes were green now flowers of all sorts carpeted the usually barren hills and splashed them with crimson and gold and azure had the leyline caravan halted hajjaj would have been able to spy butterflies moving bits of color toads would be croaking and creeping in the wadis the dry riverbeds that werent quite dry now had hajjaj been lucky he might have spotted a small herd of antelope grazing on greenery whose like they wouldnt see again for months he sighed it wont last it never does with another sigh he added and if thats not a lesson for anyone daft enough to want to be a diplomat curse me if i know what would be the leyline caravan got into najran late in the afternoon gliding up over a last little rise before revealing the almost painfully blue sea ahead the ley line that ran from bishah to najran continued on out into the bay of ajlun if it hadnt najran would have had no reason for being as things were its harbor was too small and too open to the elements to let it become a great port or even a moderately important one it was nondescript isolated a perfect home for the kaunian refugees whod fled west across the sea from forthweg their tents these days considerably outnumbered the ramshackle houses of the fishermen and boatbuilders and netmakers and the handful of merchants who called najran home without the ley line the zuwayzin could never have kept them fed paleskinned men and women in tunics and trousers were more common on the streets than naked dark brown locals but the kaunians had universally adapted the widebrimmed straw hats the zuwayzin wore if they hadnt their brains would have baked in their skulls hajjaj had thought about putting on tunic and trousers himself when he came to visit the refugees in the end hed decided not to they were guests in his kingdom after all so he didnt feel the need to go against his own usages as he did when meeting diplomats from other chillier lands a carriage waited for him at the caravan depot much the largest building in najran as he and qutuz climbed in he told the driver the tent city aye your excellency the man said touching the brim of his own big hat he flicked the reins and clucked to the horses they were sad skinny beasts and didnt seem in a hurry to get anywhere they would pause to graze whenever they passed anything green and growing fellow ought to take a whip to them qutuz grumbled never mind hajjaj said were not going far and im not in that big a hurry the truth was he didnt have the heart to watch the horses beaten blond men and women a lot of them sunburned despite their hats greeted the carriage as it approached hajjaj heard his own name spoken some of the people in the growing crowd recognized him from his earlier visit they started taking off their hats and bowing not theatrically as algarvians would have but with great sincerity powers above bless you sir someone called to hajjaj and a moment later everyone took up the cry irony smote hed learned classical kaunian in algarve before the six years war he stood up in the carriage and bowed to the refugees in return letting them stay in zuwayza sometimes felt like the single most worthwhile thing hed done in the war had he given them to the algarvians they would surely be dead now a couple of blond men pushed their way through the cheering crowd they too bowed to hajjaj who returned the courtesy thank you for coming your excellency one of them said were grateful to you once more which of you is nemunas and which vitols hajjaj asked im vitols said the man whod spoken before and im nemunas the other one added he was a couple of years older than vitols and had a nasty scar on the back of one hand theyd both been sergeants in king pendas army before the algarvians crushed forthweg now they led the kaunian refugees in zuwayza vitols pointed to a tent not far away we can talk there if that suits you as good a place as any hajjaj said this gentlemen with me is my secretary qutuz he knows what well be discussing the kaunians bowed to qutuz too he bowed back in the tent waited tea and wine and cakes hajjaj was touched again that the blonds favored him with a zuwayzi ritual he and qutuz sipped and ate and made small talk as hosts vitols and nemunas were the ones to say when to get down to serious business nemunas didnt wait long will you let us sail back to forthweg like we asked in our letter he said now that theres a magic to let us look like forthwegians we can go back there and take proper revenge on the redheads he and vitols leaned toward hajjaj waiting on his reply he didnt leave them waiting long no he said i will not permit it i will not encourage it if zuwayzi ships see kaunians sailing east they will sink them if they can but why your excellency nemunas sounded astonished you know what the algarvians are doing to our people there youd never have let us stay here if you didnt every word of that is true hajjaj clamped his jaws shut tight after he finished speaking hed known this would be hard brutally hard and it was well then vitols said as if he expected the zuwayzi foreign minister to change his mind on the instant and give his blessing to the kaunians who wanted to go back to forthweg and cause trouble for algarve there but hajjaj did not intend to change his mind no he repeated why vitols and nemunas spoke together neither sounded as if he believed his ears i will tell you why hajjaj replied because if you go back to your homeland and harass my cobelligerents you make them more likely to lose the war both kaunian refugee leaders spoke several pungent phrases of a sort hajjajs language master had never taught him he understood the sentiment if not the precise meaning of those phrases at last the kaunians grew more coherent of course we want to make them lose the war vitols said why wouldnt we nemunas added theyre murdering us why wont you let us strike back at them vitols demanded why dont you want them to lose the war why dont you curse them the way we curse them because if algarve loses the war zuwayza loses the war too hajjaj said and if zuwayza loses the war king swemmel is all too likely to serve my people as king mezentio is serving yours he wouldnt vitols said you might lose you might even have to go back under unkerlanter rule again but you wouldnt get slaughtered it is possible that you are right hajjaj admitted on the other hand it is also possible that you are wrong knowing swemmel knowing the affront zuwayza has given him i must tell you that i do not care to take the chance the things my cobelligerents have done horrify me the things my foes could do if they get the chance horrify me more i am sorry gentlemen but you cannot ask me to risk my people for the sake of yours nemunas and vitols put their heads together for a couple of minutes muttering in low voices when they were done they both bowed to hajjaj vitols spoke for them very well your excellency we understand your reasons we dont agree mind but we understand well obey we wouldnt endanger your folk after you saved ours i thank you hajjaj bowed in return i also require that obedience youll have it vitols said and nemunas nodded the meeting ended a few minutes later on the way back to the leyline caravan depot qutuz remarked theyre lying i know hajjaj said calmly but his secretary said ive done what i had to do hajjaj said ive warned them our ships will sink some of them that will make the algarvians happy and if some do get back to forthweg and raise trouble that wont make me altogether unhappy he smiled at qutuz the carriage rolled on toward najran krasta had been to a good many entertainments since joining herself with colonel lurcanio having a companion from among the victorious algarvians with whom to go to entertainments had been one of the reasons and not perhaps the least of them why shed let lurcanio into her bed but this one at a wealthy cheese merchants house in priekule struck her as the strangest of any of them after looking around at the other guests she stuck her nose in the air ostentatiously enough for lurcanio to notice is something troubling you my sweet he asked concern mostly masking the faint scorn in his voice something aye something krasta struggled to put what she felt into words except when inspired by spite she wasnt usually very articulate what she came up with now was a horrified fourword outburst who are these people friends of algarve of course lurcanio said powers above help you in that case as soon as she spoke krasta realized she might have gone too far she cared lurcanio when annoyed made life unpleasant for her but only to a point the trouble was shed spoken altogether too much truth most gatherings since the redheads overran valmiera featured mixed crowds krasta had grown to accept that some nobles like her made the best of things others chose not to appear with the occupiers not all the female companions the algarvians found for themselves were noblewomen or even ladies and a lot of the valmieran men who worked hand in glove with algarve conspicuously lacked noble blood but tonights crowd except for lurcanio possibly except for lurcanio krasta thought with a sweet dash of spite the algarvian officers were boors busy getting drunk as fast as they could the women with them were sluts half of them were making plays for men of higher rank than the ones whod brought them one of them in too much powder and paint and not enough clothes sidled up to lurcanio who didnt bother pretending he didnt notice her go away krasta hissed at her youll give him a disease he already has one the tart retorted youre here whats your name krasta asked sweetly do you dare tell it if they look in the constabulary records how many solicitation charges will they find she hadnt meant to be anything but bitchy but the other woman instead of going on with the row turned pale under her thick makeup and found something else to do in a hurry i have better taste than that i assure you lurcanio said maybe you do krastas eyes left her algarvian lovers face and slid down to the front of his kilt im not so sure about him lurcanio threw back his head and laughed for all the world as if she were joking she didnt enjoy her little triumph long it oozed away as she went back to contemplating the company she was keeping the algarvian officers were bad the valmieran women were worse but the valmieran men were worst of all even the handful of nobles depressed her backwoods counts and viscounts theyd never shown their faces in priekule before the algarvians came and there were good reasons why they hadnt krasta knew a couple of them by reputation the valmieran nobility was and always had been reactionary krasta despised commoners and was proud of it but even by her standards that count over there the one who belted his trousers with a short nasty whip went too far she had little use for the commoners in the crowd either some people came from families that had been prominent for generations even if they werent noble you could rely on folk like that the ones here at the cheese merchants krasta hadnt heard of any of them before the algarvians took priekule and wished she hadnt heard of most of them since we shall prevail one of them told another not far away oh aye of course we shall the other man answered well grind swemmel into the dust plenty of time after that to settle with treacherous lagoas both men wore kilts and tunics not merely algarvian in style but modeled after those of algarvian soldiers theyd grown side whiskers and little strips of chin beard too one of them waxed his mustaches so that they stuck out like horns but for being blond and speaking valmieran they might have been born in mezentios kingdom krasta nudged lurcanio and pointed to the two men buy them some hair dye and you could have a couple of new algarvians to throw into the fighting against unkerlant he surprised her by taking her seriously weve thought about that but in forthweg and in algarve hair dye has caused us more problems than its solved so we probably wont what kind of trouble krasta asked people masquerading as things they arent the algarvian colonel said weve pretty much put a stop to that by now and about time too if you ask me people masquerading krasta echoed the folk here are masquerading as things they arent as important people i mean oh but they are important lurcanio said they are very important indeed without them how could we run valmiera with your own men of course krasta answered if you dont run valmiera with your own men why have you taken half my mansion do you know what the algarvians in your mansion do lurcanio asked have you any idea krasta didnt like his sardonic tone she returned it with venomous interest you mean besides seducing the serving women they run priekule for your king spoken baldly like that it seemed less shameful that algarve should run a city that had never been hers lurcanio clicked his heels and bowed you are correct we run priekule and do you know how we run priekule nine times out of ten we go to some valmieran and say do thus and so and he will bow and say aye your excellency and lo and behold thus and so will be done we have not the men to do all the thus and sos ourselves we never did with the war in the west drawing so many thither having so many algarvians here grows more impossible by the day and so as i say we rule this kingdom and your countrymen run it for us valmieran constables valmieran caravan conductors valmieran tax collectors even krasta supposed valmieran mages and every one of them in the service not of poor drunken king gainibu but of redheaded king mezentio and the algarvian occupiers she shuddered before she thought nothing new for her she said it reminds me of sheep leading other sheep to the slaughter lurcanio started to reply then checked himself there are times when i do believe that given education and application you could be formidable he bowed to krasta who wasnt sure whether that constituted praise or dismissal when she didnt say anything he went on as for your metaphor well what do you think a bell wether is sometimes called upon to do and what do you think happens to a ram when he is made into a wether i dont know krasta said irritable again all i know is youre confusing me am i lurcanios smile turned smug again well this isnt the first time and i doubt it will be the last krasta found one question more one question too many probably what will happen to all these people if algarve loses the war the smug smile slipped you may rest assured my poppet that will not happen life is not so easy as we wished it would be but it is not so hard as our enemies wish it were either we struck kuusamo a heavy blow not long ago struck it from here in valmiera in fact lurcanio seemed on the point of saying more but turned the subject instead but i will answer you in a hypothetical sense what would happen to them not what will mind you but what would it should be obvious even to you whatever the victors wanted if algarve somehow lost the war what would the victors do with those who had taken her side krasta couldnt stay on that high philosophical plane for long as usual her thoughts descended to the personal if algarve somehow lost what would the victors do to her she shuddered again that might have some distinctly nasty answers shed made her bed made it and lain down in it and invited lurcanio into it to keep her warm clasping his arm in sudden fright she said take me home you listened to a ghost story and frightened yourself lurcanio said that was likely to be true krasta hoped it was she would have held that hope even more strongly were lurcanio not pursuing her brother and had skarnu not penned that sheet claiming all sorts of horrors in the west but shed chosen her side and she had no idea how to unchoose it take me home she repeated lurcanio sighed oh very well he said let me apologize to our gracious host he couldnt say that with a straight face try as he would for leaving the festivities so early a chilly rain had begun to fall they both put up the hoods to their cloaks as they hurried out to lurcanios carriage he spoke to his driver in algarvian the driver already hooded against the rain nodded and got the horses moving the carriage rolled away from the cheese merchants house i hope he can find his way back krasta said its very dark i can hardly see across the street i expect he will manage lurcanio answered he used to have trouble i know but by now he has been here long enough to learn his way around that was another way of saying valmiera had been in algarvian hands for quite a while krasta sighed and snuggled against lurcanio partly for warmth partly to keep from thinking about the choices shed made and the choices she might have made they hadnt gone far before a dull roar sounded off to the north and then another and another the lagoans krasta said theyre dropping eggs on us again yet another burst of sorcerous energy echoed through priekule this one quite a bit closer well so they are lurcanio answered dropping them at random too in this weather charming people there on the other side of the strait if he knew he was in danger he gave no sign of it hed never lacked for courage should we find a shelter krasta asked she felt rather than seeing lurcanio shrug if you like he said i think the odds favor us though he spoke in algarvian to the driver who laughed and replied in the same language lurcanio also laughed and translated he says he is fated to be blazed by an outraged husband at the age of a hundred and three and so he is not worried about lagoan eggs that made krasta laugh too then an egg burst close enough for her to see its flash close enough that a piece of its thin metal casing whined through the air past the carriage it had certainly come down on somebodys head krasta knew she could have been that somebody and she unlike lurcanio and his driver had no algarvian bravado to sustain her she cursed the lagoans all the way back to her mansion did they care about the valmierans one bit more than mezentios men did if so she wished they would have found a different way to show it things could have been worse a few weeks before watching algarvian soldiers stream out of durrwangen without orders against orders colonel sabrino would have had a hard time saying that now now it looked as if something might be salvaged in the southwest after all the colonel of dragonfliers wasnt the only one with that thought at supper one evening at the wings dragon farm captain domiziano raised a glass of ferocious unkerlanter spirits in salute and said heres to general solino looks like he really did know what he was doing he knocked back the spirits coughing a little as he did so along with the rest of the officers sabrino also drank to the toast captain orosio said aye turns out were better off with that army loose and able to hit back than we would have been if wed pissed it away like the one down in sulingen pity solinos head had to roll domiziano said doesnt seem fair orosio shrugged the price you pay for being right aye thats how things work sabrino agreed if you advance against orders to hold and something good comes of it youre a hero if you retreat against orders to hold theyll reckon you a coward no matter what happens even if you were right theyll figure youre liable to run away the next time too he pointed to the big plate of pork ribs in the middle of the table pass me a couple more of those somebody if you please once he had the ribs he smeared them with horseradish sauce and gnawed all the meat off the bones like his own glass of spirits the sauce gave the illusion of warmth in an unkerlanter winter even the illusion was not to be despised domiziano also spread the sauce over another rib in between bites he sighed and said this cursed war is jading my palate so ill never properly appreciate a delicate sauce again sabrino chuckled at that there are worse problems to have i was in the trenches in the six years war and i know domiziano had been making messes in his drawers during the six years war if hed been born at all he looked at sabrino as if hed started speaking gyongyosian orosio was only a little older but he understood such things his nod and even more his knowing expression said as much a dragon handler stuck his head into sabrinos tent and said sir that new wing is starting to land at the farm the one that had been flying against lagoas sabrino asked and the handler nodded mischief glinting in his eyes sabrino turned back to his squadron commanders well gentlemen shall we help them settle in im sure theyll be delighted at the accommodations they find waiting for them here even domiziano recognized the irony there well enough to chuckle orosio laughed out loud sabrino got to his feet his subordinates followed him out cold bit at his nose and cheeks he ignored it hed known worse sure enough dragons spiraled down out of the cloudy sky along with the occasional snowflake many many dragons powers above sabrino said softly if thats not a fullstrength wing then im a naked black zuwayzi wings with their full complement of sixtyfour dragons and dragonfliers simply didnt exist in the war against unkerlant whenever he got his up over half strength he counted himself lucky accompanied by a dragon handler an officer hed never seen before came up you are colonel sabrino the newcomer asked and sabrino admitted he was after bows and an embrace and kisses on both cheeks the other officer continued i am colonel ambaldo and i was told you would arrange for the wellbeing of my dragons and my men my handlers will do what they can and well see what we can scrounge up in the way of extra tents and extra rations sabrino answered anything you brought and anything you can steal will help a lot though ambaldo stared at him is that a joke my dear sir not even close to one sabrino answered let me guess youve spent the whole war up till now in valmiera at some pretty little peasant village with pretty blond women to darn your socks and warm your beds its not like that here my dear sir i have been fighting too ambaldo said stiffly fighting against the vile air pirates of lagoas and kuusamo you will please remember this fact sabrino bowed again i didnt say you havent been fighting but i meant what i did say its not like that here its nothing like that here the unkerlanters really and truly hate us or most of them do anyway we havent got enough of anything to go around not enough men not enough dragons not enough supplies nothing the current strength of my wing is thirtyone ive just been reinforced thirtyone ambaldos eyes looked as if theyd pop out of his head where are the rest by the powers above where do you think sabrino said dead or wounded and a lot of the replacements that could have got sent to me went to some other wing instead do your superiors hate you so ambaldo asked no no no sabrino wondered if he could ever get through to this poor naive soul they went to other wings because those were even further under strength than mine orosio spoke up colonel ambaldo sir if you want to look good in your uniform you can do that anywhere if you want to fight a war and hurt the kingdoms enemies this is the place who is this insolent man ambaldo demanded of sabrino i ask you understand so that my friends may speak to him we dont duel on this front sabrino said oh theres no law or kings command against it but we dont the unkerlanters kill too many of us we dont make things easier for them by killing each other ambaldos eyebrows shot upwards truly i have come to a barbarous country some of his officers walked up behind him they were staring around in amazement at the landscape in which they found themselves sabrino had a hard time blaming them had he been jerked out of a pleasant billet in valmiera and plopped down in the wilds of unkerlant he would have been amazed too and not with delight come on gentlemen he said well do what we can for you we have to work together after all the newcomers had brought some tents sabrino shoehorned the rest of their dragonfliers in with his men he shoehorned colonel ambaldo in with himself getting enough meat for the new dragons would have been impossible if his dragon handlers hadnt come across the bodies of a couple of behemoths brimstone was not a problem brimstone had never been a problem quicksilver he didnt have and couldnt get enough quicksilver to give his own dragons all they needed he shared what he had with the new arrived wing horseradish and raw unkerlanter spirits did nothing to improve ambaldos mood he kept muttering things like what did we do to deserve this since sabrino didnt know whom ambaldo might have offended he couldnt very well answer that at last to his relief the other wing commander pulled himself together and asked what is to be done here sabrino pointed to a map the unkerlanters have failed to concentrate their forces as they should have instead of one large attack advancing from durrwangen to some other point that could anchor their whole line theyve sent columns out in several directions none of them with its far end secured by a river or mountains or anything we cant maneuver around and so were going to cut those columns off and then cut them up he showed what he meant with several quick gestures ambaldo studied the map do we have the force here to bring this off good sabrino thought with more relief hes not a fool on paper the unkerlanters always have more than we do he answered but for one thing were better than they are no matter how much swemmel babbles about efficiency and for another he grimaced our mages work stronger magic killing kaunians than theirs do slaughtering their own peasants ambaldo didnt just grimace he reached for the jar of spirits poured his mug full and gulped it down they really do those things here then he said nobody in valmiera much wanted to talk about them we were living among blonds after all they do them sabrino answered grimly so do we by the end of this fight only one side will be left standing its as simple as that he hated that truth with all his soul but hating it made it no less a truth colonel ambaldo drank more spirits but ambaldo was ready to fly again the next day and so were his dragons in spite of their long journey from valmiera sabrino envied them their condition theyd eaten better and fought less than any wing here in the west and they proved professionally competent they plastered an unkerlanter strongpoint northeast of durrwangen with eggs and swooped low to attack a leyline caravan surely loaded with enemy soldiers they left the caravan a flaming wreck sabrino whose smaller more depleted wing accompanied and guided them on their attacks found nothing about which he could complain ambaldos image appeared in his crystal why didnt we win the war here long ago if this is the best the unkerlanters can do demanded the wing commander from out of the west before sabrino could reply the unkerlanters gave ambaldo an answer of their own dragons painted rockgray hurled themselves at the algarvians in the air as usual swemmels men flew with less skill than the algarvians they attacked and ambaldos dragonfliers showed they had as much skill aboard their mounts as any other algarvians but there were also as usual a demon of a lot of unkerlanters ambaldos wing had holes torn in it even though it gave better than it got so did sabrinos he was by now long since used to scraping by and making do with whatever replacements he happened to get if he happened to get any he wondered how ambaldos men would fare in a place where without scrounging and improvising they couldnt hope to keep going they hadnt had to do such things in valmiera that was plain from the abundance theyd brought west down on the ground algarvian troopers and behemoths were moving toward the places the dragons had pounded sabrino wondered if they included regiments and brigades plucked from occupation duty in valmiera or jelgava and carried across a good stretch of derlavai by leyline caravan so they could get into this fight he rather hoped so hed gone on peacetime holiday to the beaches of northern jelgava occupation duty there had to be a true hardship he rolled his eyes thinking of how dreadful patrolling beaches full of nearly naked bathers had to be a little frostbite would go a long way toward fixing the sunburn from which those troopers might be suffering and then the ground shook down below literally for he could see the ripples as it writhed like an animal in pain here and there purple flames shot up through the snow and stabbed toward the heavens what had been unkerlanter strongpoints were wrecked ruined ravaged sabrinos sardonic smile slipped how many kaunians had died to power that magecraft however many it was even troops plucked from pleasant occupation duty should have been able to exploit the holes it tore in the unkerlanter line garivald was on sentrygo when the grelzer company strode into the forest munderics band of irregulars reckoned all their own he didnt see the grelzers till they were quite close snow was falling fairly heavily cloaking things in the middle and far distance from his eyes when he did spy them he pulled the hood of his white snow smock down low on his forehead making sure it covered his dark hair then he slipped back through the barebranched woods toward the clearing where the irregulars had their headquarters he moved far faster than the soldiers whod chosen raniero the algarvian puppet rather than swemmel of unkerlant he knew where he was going while the grelzers couldnt be sure he hoped they couldnt be sure just where in the woods the irregulars lurked hed got about halfway to the clearing when a soft clear voice called a challenge who goes its me obilot garivald he answered she slid out from behind a birch her snow smock hardly lighter than its pale bark her stick didnt quite point at him but wouldnt have to move far to do so after she recognized that it was indeed he she demanded why arent you at your post because theres a great mob of grelzers not very far behind me he answered wed better get ready to beat them back if we can or to make sure they dont find us if we cant her mouth twisted fair enough she said and then can we make sure they dont find us its not like theyre algarvians or those mercenaries from up in forthweg i know garivald said unhappily except in their choice of a king the grelzers who favored raniero werent much different from the ones who still carried on the fight against him and against algarve some of them would have hunted in this forest in peacetime hunted or come here to gather mushrooms or honey they might not know where the irregulars denned but they would have some idea go on then obilot said you havent got time to waste garivald nodded and plunged on through the woods he got challenged once more before reaching the clearing munderic was not about to be taken by surprise the other irregular also passed him through after only a few words ranieros troopers hadnt come into the forest in force for quite a while when he trotted panting into the clearing he wanted to shout out his warning he didnt not knowing how far behind him the grelzer troopers were he didnt want to risk their hearing a wild cry of alarm instead he called out the news urgently but without panic or excitement in his voice that did what wanted doing the irregulars came boiling out of their makeshift shelters almost all of them clutching sticks what do we do garivald asked munderic do we fight them or do we try to get away munderic gnawed on his lower lip i dont know he answered i just dont know what kind of soldiers are they thats the rub if they just go forward till they bump into something and then run away thats one thing but if theyre like that bunch we ran into on the way to the ley line he scowled and shook his head those whoresons meant it powers below eat them lets fight em sadoc boomed if the makeshift mage favored fighting that in itself was to garivald a strong argument against it munderic had more confidence in sadocs sorcerous abilities than garivald thought wise any confidence in sadocs sorcerous abilities was more than garivald thought wise but the leader of the irregulars never had believed sadoc made much of a general munderic said no i think wed do better to pick the fight ourselves and not let those bastards do it for us lets slide into the woods off to the west and see if we cant give em the slip another irregular hurried into the clearing with word of the advancing grelzers that seemed to decide the men and the handful of women there against arguing with munderic they left the clearing by ones and twos slipping deeper into the woods munderic gestured to garivald who nodded they hurried out together weve played these games before munderic said remember the fun we had when the algarvians tried to chase us out of here oh aye garivald answered im not likely to forget i was part of it after all but befooling the algarvians in summer when trees in full leaf gave extra cover and when dirt didnt hold tracks so well was a business different from confusing grelzer soldiers here in winter where the trees were bare and when snow on the ground told trackers too much maybe munderic didnt want to think about that maybe he just didnt believe the irregulars could make a standup fight and maybe he was right not to believe that too if he was though what did that say about how much good the irregulars were doing in their fight against algarve and her puppets maybe garivald didnt want to think about that munderic pointed to a snowcovered boulder shall we flop down behind that and pot ourselves a couple of those grelzer traitors if they try and come after us aye why not garivald said i wondered if you intended to do any fighting oh ill fight now and again munderic answered not much put out ill fight when i can hurt the enemy and he cant do much to hurt me or ill fight when i havent got any other choice otherwise ill run like a rabbit im not doing this for the glory of it there he sounded very much like an unkerlanter peasant or perhaps like a soldier whod been in enough fights to realize he didnt want to be in a whole lot more garivald stretched out behind the boulder munderic had certainly been in enough fights to know good cover when he saw it garivald barely had to lift his head to have a perfect view of the route by which the pursuers would likely come and they would have a demon of a time spotting him by the happy grunt munderic let out from the other side of the boulder his position was just as good well sting them here so we will he said you could have sadoc make a great magic and sweep the grelzers to destruction garivald said unable to resist the gibe oh shut up the leader of the irregulars muttered he turned his head to glare at garivald all right curse you ill admit it hes a menace when he tries to do magecraft there are you happy happier anyhow but garivald didnt have long to celebrate his tiny triumph he spied motion through the dancing snow and flattened himself behind the rock theyre coming aye munderic must have seen it too his voice dropped to a thin thread of whisper well make them pay the grelzers advanced as confidently as if theyd taken lessons in arrogance from their algarvian overlords garivald thought munderic would tell him to wait not to hurry to let the enemy come close before he started blazing but munderic kept his mouth shut it wasnt because the grelzers were already so close hed give himself away they werent it was garivald realized after a long moments silence because he himself had turned into a veteran and could be trusted to do the right thing without being told he waited then he waited some more well know what kind of soldiers they are as soon as the blazing starts he thought that made him want to wait even longer not knowing he could imagine that the men who followed the algarvianimposed king of grelz were a pack of cowards whod run right away the last thing he cared to do was discover he was wrong at last he couldnt wait anymore a couple of soldiers with white smocks over the dark green of grelz were within ten or twelve paces of the boulder they were looking off into the trees farther west if they hadnt been they surely would have spotted munderic or him garivald slipped his finger out through the hole in his mitten and into the blazing hole on his stick the beam leaped forth it caught a grelzer square in the chest he stopped as abruptly as if hed walked into a stone wall then crumpled munderic blazed his companion not so neatly the second grelzer started howling like a dog a wagon had run over and tried to drag himself away munderic blazed him again he shuddered and lay still urra the irregulars in the rear guard shouted as they started blazing down the men whod invaded their forest king swemmel urra if they made as much noise as they could the grelzers might think they had more men than they really did they were blazing from ambush every one of them and took their foes by surprise a good many grelzers went down but the others dashed for cover with a speed that warned they had a good notion of what they were doing they raised shouts of their own raniero of grelz death to swemmel the tyrant grelz and freedom grelz and the algarvians cock up your arse garivald yelled back not a splendid song lyric but a fine insult a grelzer shouting with fury hopped up from behind the bush where he crouched garivald blazed him hed never been trained in the proper response to literary criticism but had considerable natural talent a beam sizzled snow not far from garivalds head one of the critics comrades protesting his sudden abridgement garivald blazed back making the grelzer keep his head down then he glanced over at munderic most of the band will have slid off to some other hideyholes dont you think its about time we did the same aye wed better munderic agreed otherwise theyll flank us out and rip us to pieces the redheads would and these whoresons have been taking lessons garivald scrambled back toward a pine more beams sent up gouts of steam as the grelzers tried to make sure hed sing no more songs but he made it to the tree scuttled behind it and started blazing at ranieros men again munderic had waited till garivald could cover him before retreating himself the leader of the irregulars dashed off toward a bush thickly covered with snow he never made it a beam caught him in the flank as he ran he let out a horrible scream and fell in the snow he crawled on for another few feet leaving a long trail of scarlet behind him then as if very tired he let his hands slip out from under him and sprawled at full length he might have been lying down to sleep but from this sleep he would not awaken cursing garivald blundered west through the forest blazing now and then but also doing his best to shake off the grelzers he finally did they werent cowards but the irregulars knew the routes theyd made through these woods better than they did munderics men had made false trails too and punished the grelzers from ambush when they came charging down them every time he came on some of his fellows garivald had to tell them munderic was dead it tore at him he hadnt had such a hard time speaking of a death since his own fathers at least near sundown the irregulars those who survived gathered in a clearing well to the west of the one theyd called their own garivald started to say something then he saw all of them looking straight at him not me he exclaimed but his comrades nodded as one man he never would have joined a band of irregulars on his own but now he led one six come on sergeant werferth shouted keep moving thats what weve got to do keep moving were calling the tune now not those unkerlanter barbarians shake a leg boys or youll be sorry slave driver sidroc muttered to ceorl as they tramped south and west over a field in southern unkerlant all he needs is a whip shut up boy the ruffian answered dont give him ideas but he didnt sound so sour as usual plegmunds brigade was moving forward for the first time in weeks and that made up for a multitude of failings there werferth pointed to a couple of troops of algarvian behemoths up ahead well form up with them if they dont try and blaze us or toss eggs at us first we will ceorl said and spat in the snow half the time these fornicating idiots think were unkerlanters our own selves he spat again as offended as any forthwegian would be to get mistaken for his cousins to the west sidroc made such excuses for the algarvians as he could some of these fellows were seeing here at the front dont look like they ever set eyes on an unkerlanter before let alone a forthwegian theyve been doing occupation duty somewhere off in the east powers below eat em for it too ceorl said theyve been eating and drinking and screwing themselves silly and weve been doing their fighting and dying for them about time they started earning their cursed keep aye thats so sidroc admitted it wont do us much good if they do decide were unkerlanters though for a moment it looked as if the behemoth crews would think the men shouting and waving and advancing on them belonged to the enemy only when the algarvian officers leading the forthwegians came out in front of them did the redheads on the behemoths relax a little plegmunds brigade one of them said as sidroc and his comrades approached what in the futtering blazes is plegmunds brigade sounds like a futtering disease thats what a couple of the other troopers on the behemoth laughed and nodded not bothering to keep his voice down sidroc asked werferth sergeant can we whale the stuffing out of these redheaded fools before we go on and deal with the unkerlanters with what looked like real regret werferth shook his head since sidroc had spoken in forthwegian the algarvians aboard the behemoth didnt know what hed said but one of the redheaded officers with the brigade said what amounted to the same thing well show you what we are by the powers above and said it in unmistakable algarvian sidroc stood very straight his chest swelling with pride but ceorl only grunted that means theyll spend us the way a rich whore spends coppers theyll throw us away to prove were brave bite your tongue curse it werferth exclaimed sidroc was scowling too ceorls words had a horrid feel of probability to them the soldiers of plegmunds brigade had to march hard to keep up with the advancing behemoths bastards would slow down a little for their own kind sidroc grumbled maybe werferth said but maybe not too getting there fast counts in this business war had already swept its redhot rake over the countryside swept it coming and going all the villages had been fought over most of them twice some by their look more often than that the unkerlanter soldiers based in the ruined villages seemed astonished to find king mezentios men moving forward once more astonished or not the unkerlanters fought hard from everything sidroc had seen they always did but footsoldiers without behemoths were at a great disadvantage facing footsoldiers with them sidroc had already had his nose rubbed in that lesson before long and at small cost they cleared several villages one after the other forward shouted the algarvian officers attached to plegmunds brigade forward shouted the officers who led the behemoths across the snowy fields sidroc saw algarvian footsoldiers moving forward too weve doubled back around the unkerlanters he said in considerable excitement if we can cut them off well give em a good kick in the arse thanks marshal sidroc ceorl said im sure youll be telling king mezentio where to go and what to do one fine day ill tell you where to go and what to do when the powers below drag you down there sidroc retorted and that was plenty to set ceorl off dont you talk to me like that you son of a whore he snarled you talk to me like that ill cut your fornicating heart out and eat it with onions back in the brigades training camp ceorl had frightened the whey out of sidroc he was a robber likely a murderer and sidroc had led a quiet prosperous life till the war turned everything on its head but a lot had changed since the brigade came to unkerlant sidroc had seen and done things every bit as dreadful as anything ceorl had done he looked at the ruffian and said come ahead ill give you all you want ceorl snarled again and grabbed for his knife stop that you stupid buggers or youll answer to the redheads sergeant werferth growled after we win the war you two can do whatever you want to each other and i wont care a farts worth till then youre stuck with each other sidroc kept his hand on his own knife hilt till he saw ceorl lower his as the forthwegians marched on he kept watching his countryman in spite of werferths order he didnt trust ceorl ceorl was watching him too the way he watched reassured sidroc it wasnt contemptuous but a look that said ceorl had something to worry about and knew it werferth was watching both of them powers above you lackwits show some sense he said after about half a mile whats the point in going after each other when the unkerlanters are liable to do worse to you than either one of you could dream of that held an unpleasant amount of sense sidroc saw as much at once for a wonder ceorl saw it too the frozen twisted corpses lying in the snow they passed made it easier for werferth to get his point across someone up ahead shouted and pointed there were more unkerlanters tramping south across the plains they had a few behemoths with them but only a few officers whistles squealed in plegmunds brigade and among the algarvians the same order rang out among them all forward swemmels men intent on their retreat didnt notice the attack developing against their flank till too late sidroc soon discovered why they were falling back under pursuit from the north eggs burst among them kicking up puffs of snow and knocking over footsoldiers and a couple of behemoths one of the behemoths to his disappointment scrambled back to its feet though without most of its crew his comrades and he flopped down in the snow and started blazing at the unkerlanters the algarvian behemoths plastered them with more eggs beams from heavy sticks seared three algarvian behemoths in quick succession they also sent up great gouts of steam when they bit into the snow forward the officers cried and the men of plegmunds brigade along with their algarvian allies got up again and rushed toward the enemy were going to get killed sidroc thought even as he slogged through the snow hed seen unkerlanter troops fierce in attack and stubborn in defense now for once he saw them taken by surprise and panicstricken a few of the men in rockgray tunics stood their ground and blazed at the algarvians and forthwegians but more simply fled quite a few threw their hands in the air and surrendered youre a grelzer one of those asked sidroc as sidroc stole his weapon and money and food unkerlanter and forthwegian were cousins sidroc had no great trouble understanding the question no plegmunds brigade he answered that didnt seem to mean anything to the captive well well make it mean something to these whoresons sidroc thought he gestured with his stick the unkerlanter hands still high headed north away from the fighting sooner or later someone would take charge of him he was far from the only captive who needed to be gathered in king swemmels soldiers kept running a few tried to make a stand in a little village in the path of plegmunds brigade but the forthwegians were so close behind them they got in among the houses at almost the same time as the unkerlanters did shrieks from a couple of peasant huts brought howls of delight from the men of the brigade women somebody yelled as if those screams needed to be identified either the local peasants had never left this place or theyd returned thinking men who fought for mezentio would never come so far again if that was what theyd thought theyd miscalculated theyd also given the forthwegians one more reason to finish off the enemy soldiers in the village as fast as they could the unkerlanters wouldnt have lasted long anyhow not when they were badly outnumbered and unable to form a defensive line as things were they vanished as if they had never been and then the other hunt was on by twos and threes the men of plegmunds brigade hammered down the door to every hut in the village only an ancient woman and an even more ancient man stared in horror as sidroc and ceorl and another trooper burst into the hut where theyd lived for most if not all of their lives ceorl stared in disgust youre no cursed good he exclaimed and blazed them both but screams and excited shouts from next door sent the men from plegmunds brigade rushing over there two of their comrades were holding a woman down while a third pumped between her legs one of the men holding her looked up and said wait your turn boys wont be long weve all gone without for a long time sidroc took his turn when it came back in gromheort there were laws against such things no law here only winners and losers the unkerlanter peasant woman had stopped screaming sidroc knelt and thrust and grunted as pleasure shot through him then he got to his feet fixed his drawers and picked up his stick which hed set down for a little while ceorl took his place he was glad hed gone before the ruffian it made him less likely to need a physicians services later on outside whistles were screeching algarvian officers were yelling forward come on you filthy cockhounds regretfully sidroc left the hut the chilly wind smote him sergeant werferth waved him south and west did you get any sidroc asked werferth nodded wouldnt let it go to waste with a nod of his own sidroc fell in behind the squad leader the army was advancing hed enjoyed the fruits of victory war didnt look so bad another big algarvian victory near durrwangen a newssheet vendor shouted to vanai unkerlanters falling back in disorder he waved the sheet doing his best to tempt her no she said and hurried past him toward her block of flats she had to hurry shed been out longer than shed planned to be somehow time had got away from her she didnt know how long she would go on looking like a forthwegian worse she wouldnt know when she stopped looking like a forthwegian she couldnt see the spell that kept her safe it was for others not for herself she was almost running now she kept waiting for the cry of kaunian to ring out behind her oh her hair was dyed black but that wouldnt save her once her features shifted only a few more blocks to go a few more crowded blocks a few more blocks full of forthwegians full of people all too many of whom hated kaunians if the forthwegians hadnt hated kaunians how could the algarvians have done what theyd done to vanais people they couldnt she knew it only too well she imagined she felt the enchantment slipping away of course it was imagination she couldnt feel the enchantment at all any more than she could see it but she could feel the fright welling up inside her if she couldnt renew the spell if she couldnt renew it now she thought she would go mad wait till she got to the flat it might be too late powers above it might be too late and then she let out what was almost a sob of relief not the block of flats not even her street not yet but the next best thing the forthwegian apothecarys shop whose proprietor had given her medicine for ealstan even though in those days shed not only been a kaunian but looked like one and whod passed her spell on to the other kaunians in eoforwic she had a length of yellow yarn and a length of dark brown in her handbag she always kept them there against emergencies but she hadnt thought today would turn out to be an emergency not when she went outside she hadnt if the apothecary would let her use a back room for a few minutes shed be safe again for hours on end when she walked in he was molding pills in a little metal press good day he said from behind the high counter and how may i help you could i please go into some quiet little room she asked when i come out again ill feel much better much safer she was pretty sure he already knew she was a kaunian who else but a kaunian would have given him such a spell even so fear made her stop short of coming out and saying it but he only smiled and nodded and said of course come around behind here and right on into my storeroom take as much time as you need im sure youll look the same when you come out as you do now the spell hadnt slipped yet then powers above bless you vanai exclaimed and hurried into the room the apothecary shut the door behind her and she supposed went back to grinding pills only a small dim lamp lit the room it was full of jars and vials and pots that crowded shelves and one little table set into a back corner vanai breathed in a heady mixture of poppy juice and mint and licorice and laurel and camphor and at least half a dozen other odors she couldnt name right away she took a couple of long deep breaths and smiled if she had anything wrong with her lungs she wouldnt when she came out she fished through her handbag far less convenient than a belt pouch but forthwegian women didnt belt their tunics using them to conceal their figures till she found the lengths of yarn she set them on the table twisting them together and began her chant because it was in classical kaunian a forbidden language in forthweg these days she kept her voice very low she didnt want to endanger the apothecary whod done so much for her and for kaunians all over the kingdom she would have been amazed if he were able to hear her through the door just as she was finishing the cantrip she distinctly heard him say good day and how may i help you gentlemen maybe he spoke a little louder than usual to warn her someone else had come into the shop maybe the wood of the door just wasnt very thick either way she was glad shed incanted quietly she waited in the little storeroom sure the apothecary would let her know when it was safe to come out and then one of the newcomers said you are someone who knows of the filthy magics the kaunian scum make to disguise themselves he spoke fluent forthwegian but with a trilling algarvian accent i dont know what youre talking about the apothecary answered calmly can i interest you in a horehoundandhoney cough elixir you sound stuffy and ive just mixed up a new batch in the little storeroom vanai shivered with terror she hadnt wanted to bring the man danger by casting her spell too loudly but shed brought him worse danger deadly danger by asking him to pass it on to her fellow kaunians and now the redheads were here and one jump away from her she wanted to jump out from the storeroom and attack them as if she were the heroine of one of the trashy forthwegian romances of which shed read so many while cooped up in the flat common sense told her that would only ruin her along with the apothecary she stayed where she was hating herself for it you are a whorehound and a son of a whorehound besides the algarvian said he and his comrade both laughed loudly at his wit you are also a lying son of a whorehound and you are going to pay for it come with us right now and we shall have the truth from you i have given you the truth the apothecary said you have given us dung and told us it is perfume the algarvian retorted now you come with us or we blaze you where you stand here hold what are you doing taking a pill the apothecary said his voice easy and relaxed ive been getting over the grippe let me swallow it down and i am yours you are ours all right now we have you in our grip mezentios man along with his other depravities fancied himself a punster i go with you under protest for you are seizing an innocent man the apothecary said that sent both algarvians into gales of laughter vanai leaned forward and ever so cautiously pressed her ear to the door receding footsteps told her of the redheads departure with their captive she didnt hear the front door slam behind them the algarvians wouldnt care who plundered the shop while the apothecary bless him was giving her a way to slip off without drawing notice to herself she waited then she opened the door the tiniest crack and peered out not seeing anyone she darted out from behind the counter and into the front part of the shop as if she were an ordinary customer then as casually as she could she left the place and strode out onto the street nobody asked her what she was doing coming out of the shop bare minutes after a couple of algarvians had hauled away the proprietor nobody paid her any heed at all in fact a goodsized crowd had gathered down at the end of the block confident now that she would keep on looking forthwegian vanai hurried over to find out what was going on she saw two redheads in the middle of the crowd they overtopped the forthwegians around them by several inches one of them said we did not touch him by the powers above he just fell over shed heard that voice in the apothecarys shop the algarvian wasnt punning now his partner bent down disappearing from vanais view a moment later he spoke in his own language hes dead the day was cool and gloomy but sunshine burst in vanai she didnt know but she would have bet her life what the apothecary had taken had nothing to do with the grippe the algarvians reached the same conclusion a heartbeat later they both started cursing in their own language he cheated us the stinking bugger cried the one whod done all the talking in forthwegian if he werent already dead id kill him for that the other one answered the one who did the talking in forthwegian started waving his arms that got him attention not least because he held a short deadly looking stick in his right hand go away he shouted this criminal this dog who hid kaunians has escaped our justice but the fight against the menace of the blonds goes on vanai wondered how many in the crowd were sorcerously disguised kaunians like herself because the forthwegian majority left without a word of protest she couldnt stay she had to act as it she were a person who despised her own kind it left her sick inside even as she realized she had no choice she had to walk past the apothecarys shop on the way back to her block of flats people were already going in and starting to clean the place out vanai wanted to scream at them but would good would that do again none at all it would only draw the algarvians notice the one thing she couldnt afford the thing the apothecary had kept from happening hes dead because of what i did she said to ealstan when he came home that evening how do i live with that hed want you to ealstan answered he killed himself so mezentios men couldnt pry anything about you out of him and so they couldnt torment him of course but they wouldnt have had anything to torment him about if it werent for me vanai said and if it werent for you and it werent for him how many kaunians who are still alive would be dead now her husband returned it was a good question it had no good answer no matter how obvious its truth vanai still felt terrible and she had an argument of her own he shouldnt have died for what he did he should be a hero he is a hero not to the algarvians ealstan said a pestilence take the algarvians vanai glared at him starting to get really angry theyre evil nothing else they would say the same about kaunians a lot of forthwegians would say the same about kaunians ealstan replied they really believe it i used to think they knew they were doing wrong im not so sure anymore that doesnt make it any better vanai snapped if anything that makes it worse if they cant tell the difference between right and wrong it makes it more complicated ealstan said the more i look at things the more complicated they get his mouth twisted i wonder if your magic would work on ethelhelm if it did maybe he wouldnt have to sell himself to the algarvians any more vanai drummed her fingers on the table i suppose youre going to tell me thats complicated too i sometimes have some sympathy for him ealstan answered he tried to make a little bargain with the redheads and vanai pounced and he found out you cant make a little bargain with evil ealstan thought about that slowly he nodded maybe youre right ethelhelm would say you were i should hope so vanai said when youre a mouse theres nothing complicated about a hawk she stared a challenge at ealstan he didnt argue with her which was one of the wiser things hed done or hadnt done since they were married cornelu thought no one could possibly hate the algarvians more than he did theyd invaded and occupied his kingdom powers above theyd invaded and occupied his wife but the two men who met him at the leviathan pen in setubal harbor gave him pause they stared at him out of chilly grayblue eyes you look too much like one of mezentios men one of them said in lagoan spoken with a rather mushy valmieran accent he drew himself up with all the dignity he had i am of sibiu he replied this for mezentios men he spat on the timbers of the pier some sibians fight side by side with algarve the other valmieran said some sibians he spoke too rapidly for cornelu to follow whatever it was the tone made him bristle switching to classical kaunian he said perhaps you will explain yourself sir in a language with which i am more familiar than that of this kingdom or perhaps you will apologize for what certainly sounded as if it might be a slur against my own homeland i apologize for nothing the second valmieran said in the language of his imperial ancestors i spoke nothing but the truth some of your countrymen in algarvian service go forward because some of my fellow kaunians were murdered to make magic against the unkerlanters cornelu started to let his temper slip but then he checked himself sibiu was occupied aye the kingdom was sad and hungry and grim hed seen it for himself after his leviathan was killed off his home island of tirgoviste seen it till he could escape again he had no doubt that a good many sibians known to be unfriendly to king mezentio no longer remained among the living but the valmieran was right mezentios minions hadnt started massacring sibians as they had kaunians from forthweg he bowed and spoke one word algarve then he spat again the valmierans looked at each other grudgingly the one whod accused cornelu of looking too much like one of mezentios men said it could be that even men with red hair can hate algarve lagoas was a land of mostly redhaired folk somehow the valmieran exiles seemed not to have noticed that still speaking classical kaunian his lagoan remained bad and sibian being so close to algarvian would have set their teeth on edge if they understood it cornelu said i shall take you across the strait of valmiera help your countrymen resist that last was a barb of its own a lot of valmierans nobles and commoners alike werent resisting but acquiescing in algarvian rule by the way the two exiles flinched they knew it too well jelgava was the same way cornelu had brought home a sorcerously disguised kuusaman who was stirring up trouble there let us be off the first valmieran said enough talk back and forth that is well said cornelu answered it was as far as he was concerned the first thing these supercilious blonds had said well one could see why the algarvians he shook his head he didnt want his thoughts gliding down that ley line even in annoyance he slapped the surface of the water in the leviathan pen that let the beast know who he was and that he was allowed even required to be here had he got into the water without the slaps the leviathan might have recognized him theyd been working together for a while now had the arrogant valmierans got into the water without the recognition signal their end would have been swift and unpleasant up to the surface came the leviathan it pointed its long toothy snout at cornelu and let out a surprisingly shrill squeak he patted the slick smooth skin then reached into a bucket on the pier and tossed it a couple of fish they disappeared as if they had never been fast enough to make anyone watching glad the leviathan was tame and well trained smiling an unpleasant smile cornelu threw the beast another mackerel as its great teeth closed on the tidbit he turned that smile on the valmierans he was to ferry across the strait and back to their own kingdom shall we go gentlemen he asked as he slid down into the water they looked at each other before answering at last one of them said aye and they both got in they werent leviathanriders if cornelu had to guess he would have said theyd never done this before not even once he had to show them how to secure themselves in harness and how to lie still along the leviathans back and not give the beast even inadvertent signals it would be unfortunate if you did that he remarked how unfortunate one of the valmierans asked that depends cornelu replied you might live on the other hand he was exaggerating but he didnt want his passengers annoying or confusing the leviathan when he was sure everything was ready he waved to the lagoans who handled the nets that formed the pen they waved back and let down one side the leviathan swam out of the pen and into the harbor channel that led to the sea cornelu wasnt quite so happy as usual to be leaving setubal the reason for that was simple he wasnt alone with his thoughts as he so often was on leviathanback and as he craved to be he had company and not the best of company either they werent seamen despite the rubber suits and spells that kept them from freezing or drowning in the chilly waters of the strait of valmiera and they were valmieran nobles which meant that to them even a minor noble of algarvic blood like cornelu wasnt far removed from a savage hunting wild boar in the forest they kept talking about him in valmieran he didnt speak it but enough words were recognizably similar to their classical kaunian ancestors for him to have no trouble figuring out they werent paying him compliments by the powers above valmiera deserved to have the algarvians run over it cornelu thought if mezentios men were only a little smarter they might have slaughtered all the nobles there and even more so in jelgava and won the commoners to them forever but they hadnt theyd worked through the nobles who would work with them and replaced others with men more cooperative but no less nasty and so both kingdoms still had rebellions simmering against the occupiers maybe these fellows would help bring the rebellion in valmiera from simmer to boil that would be good it would distract the algarvians from their even bigger troubles elsewhere but cornelu wouldnt have bet much above a copper on it he didnt want anything to do with them why would anyone with a dram of sense in their own kingdom think any different he knew nothing but relief when he saw the coast of the derlavaian mainland crawl up over the horizon it had been an easy trip across the strait no enemy leyline ships no leviathans only a couple of dragons off in the distance and neither of their dragonfliers had spotted the leviathan is this the place where you are to land us one of the valmierans demanded are you sure this is the place where you are to land us he sounded as if he didnt think cornelu could find his way across the street let alone across a hundred miles of ocean by the landmarks by the configuration of the ley lines this is the place where i am to land you the leviathanrider answered with such patience as he could muster swim to shore and twist the algarvians tails for them the two blonds struck out awkwardly toward the land a couple of hundred yards away cornelu would go no closer for fear of beaching his leviathan the valmierans couldnt drown no matter how hard they tried not with the spells laid on them if they had to they would walk across the seabottom to the shore breathing as if they were fish cornelu felt a little guilty about not wishing them good luck but only a little they didnt bring him any luck not on the way back to setubal an algarvian dragonflier spotted his leviathan and dropped a couple of eggs close enough to it to panic the beast and very nearly close enough to hurt or kill it the leviathan swam at random deep underwater till at last it had to surface once more that might have been the best thing it could have done when it did spout the dragon was far away the algarvian aboard it must have assumed that cornelu would run straight south for setubal and so he might have but he hadnt anything to do with it the leviathan had swum almost due west in the direction of algarve itself cornelu would have loved to attack mezentios land but he had no weapons with which to do it not this time he regained control over the leviathan during its next dive and did manage to lead it away from the algarvian dragon the search spirals the dragon flew worked against it this time carrying it farther and farther from cornelu at last when he was sure the dragonflier couldnt possibly see him he waved a courteous goodbye it was a relieved goodbye too he hesitated to admit that even to himself about halfway across the strait he spied a great many dragons ahead that meant only one thing the lagoans and algarvians were fighting at sea on a leviathan not carrying eggs cornelu should have stayed away he knew that he could do nothing but the spectacle of the fight would be riveting in itself he steered the leviathan toward it a lagoan leyline cruiser was engaging two lighter swifter algarvian vessels they tossed eggs at one another and blazed away with sticks that drew their sorcerous energy from the worlds grid over which the ships traveled sticks far larger and heavier and more powerful than any that could have been made mobile on land more eggs fell from the dragons overhead but they couldnt swoop to drop them with deadly accuracy as they might have against footsoldiers those potent sticks would have blazed them out of the sky had they dared and so the dragons wheeled and fought among themselves high above the bigger fray on the surface of the sea the eggs their dragonfliers dropped churned the strait but few struck home someone aboard the lagoan cruiser spotted cornelu atop his leviathan a stick swung his way with terrifying speed no you fools im a friend he shouted which of course did no good at all the beam missed but not by much a patch of ocean perhaps fifty yards from the leviathan turned all at once to steam with a noise as of a redhot iron behemoth suddenly falling into the sea the leviathan didnt know that was dangerous cornelu did he urged the beast into a dive and took it away from the fight he shouldnt have approached when he got back to setubal he learned the cruiser had sunk as had one of its algarvian foes the other badly damaged was limping toward home with more lagoan ships in pursuit no one really owned the strait cornelu doubted anyone would not till the derlavaian war was as good as won till then both sides would keep struggling over it a new man in istvans squad a fellow named hevesi came up to the front from regimental headquarters with orders to be alert because of a possible unkerlanter attack and with gossip that had his hazel eyes bugging out of his head youll never guess sergeant he said to istvan after relaying the order by the stars you couldnt guess if you tried for the next five years well youd better tell me then istvan said reasonably aye speak up szonyi agreed safe behind a timber rampart he stood up to show that he towered over hevesi as he did over most people speak up before somebody decides to tear the words out of you anything new would be welcome in this dreary wilderness corporal kun added the rest of the soldiers crowded toward hevesi so they could hear too he grinned pleased at the effect hed created no need to get pushy he said ill talk im glad to talk to spit it out he spoke with the accent of the northeastern mountain provinces of gyongyos an accent so much like istvans that he might have come from only a few valleys away when he still didnt start talking right away szonyi loomed over him and rumbled out with it little man hevesi wasnt so little as all that but he was a goodnatured fellow and didnt get angry as many gyongyosians might have all right for dramatic effect he lowered his voice to not much more than a whisper i hear that up a couple of regiments north of us they burned three men for goateating everyone who heard him exclaimed in horror but hevesi didnt know his comrades were expressing two different kinds of horror istvan hoped he never found out either eating goats flesh was the worst abomination gyongyos recognized istvan and several of his comrades knew the sin from the inside out if anyone but captain tivadar ever discovered that they knew they were doomed some of their horror was disgust at themselves some a fear others might learn what theyd done how did they come to do that asked lajos whod already shown more interest in goats and goats flesh than istvan was comfortable with they overran one of those little forest villages you stumble across every once in a while hevesi answered istvan nodded he and his squad had overrun such a village himself and doubted if any mountain valley in all of gyongyos were so isolated hevesi went on the accursed unkerlanters keep goats of course and these three just slaughtered one and roasted it and ate of the flesh he shuddered of their own free will kun asked knowingly by the stars they did hevesi said kun bared his teeth in what was anything but a smile in the tones of a man passing sentence he said i expect they deserved it then aye istvan could speak with conviction too if they did it and they knew what they were doing that sets them beyond the pale there might be some excuse for letting them live if they didnt he wouldnt look at the scar on his hand but he could feel the blood pulsing through it i dont know that it really much matters sergeant if they ate goat hevesi drew his thumb across his throat by the stars thats right lajos said no excuse for that sort of filthy business none he spoke with great certainty well there are those who would tell you youre right and plenty of em istvan said wishing with all his heart that hevesi had come back to his squad with any other gossip but that the way things looked he would never be able to escape from goateating and stories about goateating as long as he lived what was that szonyi suddenly pointed east did you hear something from the unkerlanters the question made soldiers separate as fast as hevesis gossip had brought them together men snatched up their sticks and scrambled off to loopholes and good blazing positions istvan wouldnt have thought that standing on the defensive came naturally to the warrior race the gyongyosians prided themselves on being but theyd seemed willing enough to give the unkerlanters the initiative by all the signs theyd never quite known what to do with it themselves after an anxious pause here they relaxed looks like you were wrong istvan told szonyi aye looks like i was doesnt break my heart szonyis broad shoulders went up and down in a shrug kun said better to be alert about something that isnt there than to miss something that is thats right istvan said gravely the three veterans and a couple of other men in the squad nodded with more solemnity than the remark might have deserved istvan suspected szonyi hadnt heard anything whatsoever out of the ordinary he had managed to get hevesi and the rest of the squad to stop talking about more important to stop thinking about the abomination of goateating though and that as far as istvan was concerned was all to the good kun might have been thinking along with him behind the lenses of his spectacles his eyes slid toward szonyi sometimes youre not as foolish as you look he remarked and then spoiled it by adding sometimes of course you bloody well are thanks szonyi said thanks ever so much ill remember you in my nightmares enough istvan said ive had enough of saying enough to the two of you and then he made a sharp chopping motion with his right hand urging szonyi and kun and the rest of the squad to silence somewhere in the woods out in front of them a twig had snapped not an imaginary one like szonyis but unquestionably real there was plenty of snow and ice out there its weight sometimes broke great boughs those sharp reports could panic a regiment this one might have been something like that but smaller or it might have been an unkerlanter making a mistake what do you think sergeant kuns voice was a thin thread of whisper istvans shrug barely moved one shoulder i think wed better find out he made a little gesture that could be seen from the side but not from ahead szonyi with me aye sergeant szonyi said istvan could hear the answer he didnt think any of swemmels men would be able to even if they were just on the other side of the redoubt kun looked offended istvan didnt care kun was a good soldier szonyi was a better one especially moving forward but then instead of getting angry kun said something sensible let me use my little sorcery that will tell you if anyones out there before you go after a couple of heartbeats thought istvan nodded aye go ahead do it the charm was very simple if it hadnt been very simple the former mages apprentice wouldnt have been able to use it when he was done he said one word somebody there would be istvan gestured to szonyi lets go find out the idea is to come back understand not just to disappear out there im not stupid szonyi answered istvan wasnt altogether sure that was true but he didnt argue they left the redoubt to the rear shielded from the enemys sight and from his sticks by the snowcovered logs piled up in front istvan gestured to the left szonyi nodded both the gesture and the nod were small all but unnoticeable in their white smocks istvan and szonyi might have been a couple of moving drifts of snow istvan felt cold as a snowdrift but even as he muttered inaudibly to himself about that he also felt like a proper warrior again he wondered about that it perplexed him saying it alarmed him wouldnt have been far shy of the mark either hed seen enough fighting to last him a lifetime probably two why go looking for more because thats what ive been trained to do he thought but that wasnt the whole answer or even any great part of it because if i dont go looking for it itll come looking for me at that he nodded again though he was careful to keep the hood of his smock low and expose none of his face to an enemys beam he knew what he was doing in the snow hed had enough practice in it after all his home valley was worse in winter than these woods ever dreamt of being he got within five or six feet of an ermine before it realized he was there hed spotted it by the triangle of black dots that marked its eyes and nose and the black spot at the very tip of its tail that never went white in winter it drew back in sudden horror when it spied or scented him baring a pink mouth full of needle teeth then it scurried behind a tree trunk and vanished istvan followed it not in any real pursuit but because that beech also gave him cover from the east the ermine by then was gone only tiny tracks in the snow showing where it had run szonyi had found cover behind a pine not far away he glanced toward istvan who paused for a moment taking his bearings then istvan pointed in the direction from which he thought the suspicious noise had come szonyi considered then nodded they both crawled forward again now they advanced separately each one taking his own path to the target if something happens to me szonyi will get back with the word istvan thought he hoped the converse was in szonyis mind he hoped even more that the two of them were right have to be close now went through his mind a few minutes later he looked around for szonyi but didnt see him he refused to let that worry him despite the stories told silently killing a man wasnt that easy had something gone wrong he would have heard the struggle so he told himself at any rate he started to come out from behind a birch then froze in the sense of not moving as opposed to the sense of being cold in the snow in front of the tree were tracks not the little marks of an ermine but those of a man on snowshoes the unkerlanters were very fond of snowshoes and istvan didnt think any of his own folk had come this way lately a scout he thought doesnt look like more than one man just a scout snooping around to see what were up to that wasnt so bad he vastly preferred it to coming across the forerunners of a brigade about to sweep down on him maybe the rumor of attack hevesi had brought was nothing but a rumor the unkerlanters have as much trouble putting enough men into this fight as we do different reasons but as much trouble no sooner had that thought crossed his mind than the unkerlanter soldier came out from behind a tree a couple of hundred yards away istvan got only a glimpse other trees blocked his view and gave him hardly any chance for a good blaze he wasnt too inclined to take one anyhow he had more sympathy for swemmels men than hed had when the war was new but a moment later the unkerlanter crumpled with a yowl of pain szonyi evidently had a better spot and less sympathy back now istvan called and headed off toward the redoubt if swemmels men had hoped to catch the gyongyosians hereabouts napping theyd just been disappointed captured by the algarvians the summer before retaken by unkerlant only a couple of months earlier the starting point from which marshal rathar had sent out his attacking columns to ravage the redheads further durrwangen was under algarvian attack again now that it was too late to do him any good rathar understood the lesson mezentios men had taught him we just pushed them back here and there he said to general vatran we didnt pinch in behind them and destroy them the way they did to us so many times you wanted to make them fight in front of rivers and such vatran said we thought they were panicked or else turning coward when they wouldnt stand and fight but fell back instead never trust an algarvian retreat rathar said solemnly mournfully when you got down to it they saved their men they concentrated them and then they went and hit us with them disgraceful deceitful thing to go and do vatran said as if the algarvians had pulled off some underhanded trick instead of one of the more brilliant counterattacks rathar had ever seen he would have appreciated it even more had it not been aimed at him we were almost up to hagenow he said pointing to the map his voice grew more mournful still wed driven east all the way up to the border of grelz and then curse them the redheads bit back he kicked at the floor of the battered bank that housed his headquarters i knew theyd try i didnt think they could bite so hard or with such sharp teeth as if to underscore that more eggs burst in durrwangen some of them close to the headquarters he didnt have to worry about splinters of glass flying through the air like shining knives to pierce him by now he doubted whether any building in durrwangen kept glazed windows he knew perfectly well that the headquarters didnt shall we go down to the vault vatran asked oh very well rathars voice was testy he seldom suggested such a thing himself he was too proud for that but he wasnt too proud to acknowledge common sense when he heard it down in the vault everyone commanders subordinate officers runners crystallomancers secretaries cooks what have you was crowded together as tightly as sardines in a tin people didnt even have oil to lubricate the spaces between them they elbowed one another trod on one anothers toes breathed in one anothers faces and without intending to at all generally made themselves as unpleasant for one another as they could above them around them the ground shuddered as if in torment and that was only from the sorcerous energy the algarvian eggs released when they burst if mezentios mages decided to start killing kaunians turning to vatran rathar asked are our special sorcerous countermeasures in place special sorcerous countermeasures was a euphemism for the peasants and condemned criminals unkerlanters had available and ready to slay to blunt algarvian magics and to power spells against the redheads rathar was no more comfortable than anyone else always excluding king swemmel whose many vices did not include hypocrisy about calling murder by its right name vatran nodded aye lord marshal if they try and bring the roof down around our ears with magecraft we can try to hold it up the same way good rathar said though he was anything but sure it was he wished the algarvians hadnt turned loose the demon of slaughter it might have won them the war if swemmel hadnt been so quick to adopt it for his own but swemmel as hed proved in the twinkings war would do anything survival called for now both sides slaughtered and neither gained much by it more eggs fell these closer still ysolt the cook whod been steady as a rock in the cave by the wolter river even when the fighting for sulingen was at its worst let out a shriek that tore at rathars eardrums well all be killed she blubbered every last one of us killed rathar wished he were convinced she was wrong and then vatran asked him a truly unwelcome question if they try to throw us out of durrwangen can we stop em if they come straight at us out of the north aye we can rathar replied but that wasnt exactly what the general had asked if they try to flank us out i just dont know vatran replied with what the whole derlavaian war had proved theyre cursed good at flanking maneuvers before rathar could say anything to that ysolt started screaming again be silent he roared in a paradeground voice and the cook for a wonder was silent he wished once more this time that he could control the algarvians so easily since he couldnt he answered vatran up until a few days ago i was hoping for a late thaw this spring so we could grab all we could before everything slowed to a crawl now im hoping for an early one to do half powers above more than half our fighting for us vatrans chuckle was wheezy oh aye marshal muds an even stronger master than marshal winter curse the algarvians rathar ground out we had them on the run i never dreamt i was fighting circus acrobats who could turn a somersault and then come forward as fast as theyd gone back life is full of surprises vatran said dryly an egg burst close enough to the headquarters to add a deafening emphasis to that chunks of plaster slid between the boards that shored up the ceiling and came down on peoples heads ysolt started screaming again and she wasnt the only one some of the cries were contralto others bass and at that most inauspicious moment a crystallomancer shouted lord marshal sir his majesty would speak to you from cottbus rathar had a long list of people to whom he would sooner have spoken than swemmel just then having such a list did him no good whatever of course im coming he said and then had to elbow his way through the insanely crowded vault to get to the crystal when he did the crystallomancer murmured into it presumably to his colleague back in cottbus a moment later swemmels long pale face appeared in the crystal he glared out at rathar without preamble he said lord marshal we are not pleased we are in fact far from pleased your majesty i am far from pleased too rathar said another handful of eggs burst on durrwangen surely close enough to the headquarters for swemmel to hear them through the crystal in case he didnt recognize them for what they were rathar added im under attack here aye that is why we are not pleased swemmel answered rathers safety meant nothing to him the disruption of his plans counted for far more we ordered you to attack not to be attacked you ordered me to attack in every direction at once your majesty rathar said i obeyed you now do you see that an attack in every direction is in fact an attack in no direction at all swemmels eyebrows rose in surprise then came down in anger do you presume to tell us how to conduct our war isnt that why you pay me your majesty rathar returned if you want a cake you hire the best cook you can and what sort of sour burnt thing do you set on the table before us swemmel demanded the kind you ordered rathar said and waited swemmel was more likely to make the roof cave in on him than were algarvian eggs you blame us for the debacle of unkerlants arms the king said how dare you we did not send the armies out to defeat you did aye so i did rathar agreed i sent them out according to your plan at your order and against my better judgment the algarvians were not so weak as you supposed and they have proved it if you put sour milk rancid butter and moldy flour into a cake it will not be fit to eat if you joggle an officers elbow when he tries to fight an army the fighting it gives you will not be what you had in mind either swemmels eyes opened very wide he wasnt used to frank speech from those who served him not least because of the horrible things that often happened after someone was rash enough to speak his mind in most of the things that went on at court whether swemmel heard the truth or a pleasing lie mattered little in the grand scheme of things but in matters military that wasnt so bad advice and bad decisions in the war against algarve could and nearly had cost him his kingdom for years then rathar had used frankness as a weapon and a shield he knew the weapon might burst in his hand one day and wondered if this would be that day vatran would handle things reasonably well if he got the sack there were some other promising officers he hoped swemmel would grant him the quick mercy of the axe and not be so angry as to boil him alive it had got very quiet inside the vault everyone was staring at the small image of the king rathar realized more slowly than he should have that king swemmel might not be satisfied with his head alone he might destroy everyone at the headquarters who was there to tell him he could not he should not no one at all next to swemmels wrath the eggs bursting all around were indeed small tubers swemmel could if he chose wreck his realm in a moment of fury the algarvians couldnt come close to that no matter how hard they tried rathar couldnt help feeling fear he stolidly refused to show it in that too he differed from most of the kings courtiers after a long long pause swemmel said we suppose you will tell us now that if we give you your head you will reverse all this at the snap of a finger and swear by the powers above to preserve durrwangen against the building algarvian attack no your majesty rathar said at once ill fight for this town ill fight hard but we stretched ourselves too thin and mezentios men are the ones on the move right now they cant just break into durrwangen but they may be able to flank us out of it curse them swemmel snarled curse them all we live for the day we can hurl their sovereign into the soup pot at least he wasnt talking about hurling rathar into the soup pot the marshal said they may retake durrwangen or as i told you we may yet hold them out of it till spring comes and the spring thaw with it but even if they do take it your majesty they cant possibly hope to do anything more till summer so you say but the king didnt call rathar a liar swemmel had called rathar a great many things but never that maybe a reputation for frankness was worth something after all after muttering something about traitors rathar was probably lucky not to hear king swemmel went on hold durrwangen if you can we shall give you the wherewithal to do it so far as that may be in our power what i can do i will rather promised swemmels image winked out the crystal flared then went dark rather sighed hed survived again sir leudast came up to lieutenant recared as his company commander sat hunched in front of a little fire toasting a gobbet of unicorn meat over the flames eh recared turned his face and voice were still very young but he moved like an old man these days leudast could hardly blame his superior he felt like an old man himself these days the lieutenant let out a weary sigh what is it sergeant sir i was just wondering leudast answered have you got any notion of where in blazes we are weve done so much marching and countermarching hopping onto this leyline caravan car and off of that one i wouldnt be sure id brought my arsehole along if it werent attached if you know what i mean that got him a wan smile from lieutenant recared who said i wouldnt put it quite that way but i do know what you mean aye and i can even tell you where we are more or less were somewhere south and a little west of durrwangen does it make you happy to know that happy no sir leudast shook his head one of the earflaps on his far cap flipped up for a moment he grabbed it and shoved it back into place the spring thaw was coming it hadnt got here yet and nights remained bitterly cold we came through this part of the country a while ago i didnt ever want to see it again it was ugly to start with and it hasnt got better since recared smiled again and added a couple of syllables worth of chuckle there are other reasons for not wanting to see it again too he said as in if we had the bit between our teeth instead of the algarvians they wouldnt have forced us into defensive positions to try to save durrwangen again he cut a piece from the chunk of unicorn meat with his knife and popped it into his mouth powers above thats good i dont remember the last time i had anything to eat he didnt offer to share but leudast wasnt particularly offended recared was an officer after all and leudast wasnt particularly hungry either he made a better forager than recared would be if he lived to be a hundred the very idea of living to a hundred made leudast snort he didnt expect to live through the war and was amazed hed been wounded only once a few eggs burst several hundred yards off to the west those are ours i think leudast said anything we can do to make the redheads keep their heads down is fine by me they have to be almost at the end of their tether recared said who would have thought they could counterattack at all the way we drove them north and east through the winter his face set in unhappy lines theyre a formidable people he spoke with regret and with genuine if grudging respect there might have been unkerlanters who didnt respect algarvian soldiers after seeing them in action leudast hadnt met any though he suspected that most of his countrymen who couldnt see what was in front of their noses didnt live long enough to spread their opinions very far felt boots crunched on crusted snow leudast whirled snatching his stick off his back and swinging it in the direction of the sound dont blaze sergeant an unmistakable unkerlanter voice called a trooper a man of recareds regiment came into the small circle of firelight im looking for the lieutenant recared raised his head im here sindold what do you need from me sir ive got captain gundioc with me here sindold answered hes commanding a regiment thats just come up out of the west through sulingen theyll be going into the line alongside of us and he wants to know what theyll be up against thats about the size of it captain gundioc agreed coming forward into the light with sindold im new to this business and so are the soldiers im commanding youve been through the fire ill be grateful for anything you can tell me he looked like a man who hadnt yet seen combat his face strong and serious with a jutting chin was well shaven he wore a thick clean cloak over his equally clean uniform tunic even his boots had only a couple of mud stains on them and those looked new he might have been running a foundry or teaching school only a few days before ill be glad to tell you what i know sir recared answered and this is sergeant leudast who has a lot more experience than i do if you dont mind his sitting in you can learn from him i have leudast hid a grin he knew hed taught recared a thing or two he hadnt been so sure the lieutenant also knew it gundioc nodded saying aye ill gladly hear the sergeant if hes fought and hes alive he knows things worth knowing he may be raw but hes no fool leudast thought after coughing a couple of times he said the thing to remember about the redheads sir is they think lefthanded a lot of the time theyll do things wed never imagine and theyll make them work they love to feint and to make flank attacks theyll look like theyre going to hit you one place and then drive it home somewhere else up your arse usually all thats true recared agreed every word of it its also wise not to go right at them a charge straight for their lines will slaughter the men who make it use the ground as best you can use feints too if its obvious theyll wreck it if its not you have a better chance i understand gundioc said this all strikes me as good advice but if im ordered to go forward and i have inspectors with sticks standing behind my line to make sure i obey what am i to do blaze those buggers leudast thought but he couldnt say that aloud not unless he wanted an inspector blazing him he glanced over to recared if the officer had the privileges of his rank he also had the obligations which included answering nasty questions like that answer he did saying if you are ordered you must obey but men who give such orders often dont live very long in the field the algarvians seem to kill them quickly or we can blame it on the algarvians anyhow leudast thought he didnt know exactly how many unkerlanter officers had met with unfortunate accidents from the men they were supposed to be leading not enough probably one reason the unkerlanters had suffered such gruesome casualties was that their officers werent trained so well as their counterparts in mezentios service another was that with plenty of men to spend the unkerlanters put out fires by throwing bodies on them till they smothered did gundioc understand what recared had just told him if he didnt maybe he was the sort of officer whod meet with an accident one fine day but he did his eyes narrowed the lines running down from his nose to his mouth deepened and darkened and filled with shadow i see he said slowly that sounds unofficial i havent the faintest idea what youre talking about sir recared answered which is probably just as well gundioc got to his feet thank you for your time youve given me a thing or two to think about he trudged across the snow toward his own regiment leudast went up to his company not far behind the fighting front his nose guided him to a pot sizzling above a little fire a cook ladled bits of turnip and parsnip and chunks of meat into his mess tin he didnt ask what the meat was had he found out he might have decided he didnt want to eat it and he was too hungry to take the chance what are the redheads doing he asked the first question anyone with any sense asked on getting near the algarvians nothing much sergeant doesnt look like one of his troopers answered real quietlike over there suspicion flowered in leudast thats not good he said theyre up to something but what will it land on our heads or will it come down on somebody else heres hoping its somebody else the soldier said oh aye heres hoping leudasts voice was dry but hope doesnt milk the cow well send extra pickets forward if the redheads have got something nasty under their kilts theyll have to work hard to bring it off even with extra men out in front of the main line he had trouble going to sleep he didnt like having raw troops to his left their commander seemed smart enough but how good were his men what would they do if the algarvians tested them he dozed off dreaming about it when he woke he thought he was still in the dream a soldier shook him awake shouting sergeant everythings gone south on the left what do you mean leudast demanded somebody had been saying much the same thing to him in his nightmare the redheads hit that new regiment and broke through sergeant the soldier answered alarm in his voice now theyre trying to swing over and attack us from the flank aye that sounds like them after two sentences leudast was fully awake he started shouting orders first squad third squad fall back and form a front to the left runner i need a runner for a wonder he got one go back to brigade headquarters and tell them were under attack from the left aye sergeant the runner dashed off a couple of squads of leudasts company werent the only unkerlanters trying to stem the algarvian breakthrough recareds other company commanders also used some of their men as a firewall against the redheads like him they were all sergeants whod seen a lot of fighting they knew what having mezentios men on their flank meant and how much danger it put them in the trouble was telling who was who in the dark wasnt easy some of the men running toward the line leudast and his comrades desperately tried to form were unkerlanters from gundiocs shattered regiment fleeing the algarvian onslaught others were authentic redheads they didnt yell mezentio as they came forward not now silence helped them sow confusion if it moves blaze it leudast shouted to his men well sort it out later but we cant let the algarvians get in among us that was all the more true and urgent because the men hed pulled out to face left didnt have enough holes in which to hide and the ones they did have werent deep enough if it meant some of his countrymen got blazed it did that was all and how are you different from the officers you warned gundioc about leudast wondered he had no answer except that he wanted to stay alive someone blazed at him out of the night the beam hissed as it boiled snow into steam a few feet to his right he blazed back and was rewarded with a cry of pain more to the point a cry of pain whose words he didnt understand but whose language was undeniably algarvian he didnt have to feel personally guilty not yet his runner or another one from the regiment must have got through eggs started falling where the algarvians had broken the line a fresh regiment of unkerlanter soldiers all of them shouting urra and swemmel rushed up to push the redheads back a couple of troops of behemoths came forward with the reinforcements sullenly the algarvians withdrew after the sun came up leudast saw captain gundiocs body he sprawled in the snow with some of his own men and some redheads leudast sighed gundioc might well have made a good officer with some seasoning hed never get it now seven wind whipped past colonel sabrinos face as his dragon dove on a leyline caravan coming up into durrwangen from the south he didnt know whether the caravan was carrying unkerlanter soldiers or horses and unicorns or simply sacks of barley and dried peas he didnt much care either whatever it was carrying would help king swemmels men inside durrwangen if it got there as the dragon stooped like a striking falcon the caravan swelled from a worm on the ground to a toy to its real size with astonishing speed mezentio sabrino shouted loosing the eggs slung under his mounts belly then he whacked the dragon with his goad to make it pull up if he hadnt the stupid thing might have flown itself straight into the ground without the weight of the eggs it gained height more readily behind it twin flashes of light marked bursts of sorcerous energy sabrino looked back over his shoulder he whooped with glee hed knocked the caravan right off the ley line whatever it was carrying wouldnt get to durrwangen any time soon flames leaped up from a shattered caravan car sabrino whooped again some of what that caravan was carrying wouldnt get to durrwangen at all captain domizianos image appeared in the crystal sabrino carried nicely struck colonel he cried sabrino bowed in his harness i thank you he looked around now lets see what else we can do to make king swemmels boys love us no immediately obvious answer sprang to mind a nice pillar of smoke was rising from the wrecked leyline caravan now more smoke much more rose from durrwangen itself algarvian eggtossers and dragons had been pounding the city ever since the latewinter counterattacks pushed this far south sabrino hoped his countrymen would be able to break into durrwangen before the spring thaw glued everything in place for a month or a month and a half if they didnt the unkerlanters would have all that time to fortify the town and then it would be twice as expensive to take if it could be done at all that wasnt anything about which he could do much he couldnt even drop any more eggs till he flew back to the dragon farm and loaded up again sir that was domiziano again his voice cracking with excitement like a youths look over to the west sir a column of behemoths and curse me if they arent stuck in a snowdrift after looking sabrino said you have sharp eyes captain i didnt spot those buggers at all well since you did see them would you like to give your squadron the honor of the first pass against them my honor sir and my pleasure domiziano replied not all the rankandfile dragonfliers had crystals he used hand signals to point them toward the new target off they flew the rest of sabrinos battered wing trailing them to ward against unkerlanter dragons and to finish whatever behemoths they might miss sabrino sang a tune that had been popular on the stage in trapani the year before the derlavaian war broke out it was called just routine and sung by one longtime lover to another smashing up columns of unkerlanter behemoths was just routine for him these days hed been doing it ever since algarve and unkerlant first collided more than a year and a half ago now great wingbeats quickly ate up the distance to the behemoths sabrino laughed aloud saying so your snowshoes didnt help you this time eh the first winter here in the trackless west had been a nightmare with the unkerlanters able to move through snow that stymied algarvian men and behemoths those odds were more even now experience was a harsh schoolmaster but an undeniably effective one the snow down there didnt seem all that deep sabrino had seen drifts that looked like young mountain ranges drifts into which you could drop a palace let alone a behemoth of course gauging the ground from above was always risky business maybe snow filled a gully and the behemoths had discovered it the hard way still although theyd halted they didnt seem to be in any enormous distress he frowned that thought sent suspicion blazing through him he peered through his goggles trying to see if anything else about the behemoths looked out of the ordinary he didnt note anything not at first but then he did domiziano he shouted into the crystal pull up domiziano theyve all got heavy sticks and theyre waiting for us usually dragons took behemoths by surprise and the men aboard those behemoths had scant seconds to swing their sticks toward the dragonfliers diving on them usually too more behemoths carried eggtossers useless against dragons than heavy sticks not this column swemmels men had set a trap for algarvian dragonfliers and sabrinos wing was flying right into it before domiziano and his dragonfliers could even begin to obey sabrinos orders the unkerlanters started blazing at them the behemoth crews had seen the dragons coming and had had the time to swing their heavy sticks toward the leaders of the attack the beams that burst forth from those sticks were bright and hot as the sun they struck dragon after dragon out of the sky almost as a man might swat flies that annoyed him a heavy stick could burn through the silver paint that shielded dragons bellies from weapons a footsoldier might carry or could sear a wing and send a dragon and the man who rode it tumbling to the ground so far below domizianos dragon seemed to stumble in midair sabrino cried out in horror domiziano had led a squadron in his wing since the war was new he would lead it no more his dragon took another couple of halfhearted flaps then plummeted a cloud of snow briefly rose when it smashed to earth the only memorial domiziano would ever have pull up pull back sabrino called to his surviving squadron commanders gain height even their sticks wont bite if were high enough and we can still drop our eggs on them vengeance a poor mean vengeance it would be with half a dozen dragons hacked down how many unkerlanter behemoths made a fair exchange for one dragon for one highly trained dragonflier more than were in this column of that sabrino was sure another dragon fell as one of his own men proved less cautious than he should have sabrinos curses went flat and harsh with despair some of his dragonfliers started dropping their eggs too soon so they burst in front of the unkerlanters without coming particularly close to them but others had more patience and before long the bursts came among the behemoths as nicely placed as sabrino could have wished when the snow cleared down below some of the beasts lay on their sides while others lumbered off in all directions that was how behemoths should have behaved when attacked by dragons even so sabrino ordered no pursuit the unkerlanters had already done too much damage to his wing and who could say what other tricks they had waiting back to the dragon farm he commanded no one protested the algarvians were all in shock not till theyd turned and been flying northeast for some little while did he realize that for perhaps the first time in the war the unkerlanters had succeeded in intimidating him because of that weight of gloom the flight back to the dragon farm seemed against the wind all the way when he finally got his dragon down on the ground sabrino discovered he had been flying against the wind instead of endlessly blowing out of the west it came from the north and carried warmth and an odor of growing things with it spring any day now a dragon handler said as he chained sabrinos mount to a crowbar driven into the ground he looked around wheres the rest of the beasts colonel off to a different farm dead whatever the wind said sabrinos voice held nothing but winter the unkerlanters set a snare and we blundered right into it and now i have to write domizianos kin and tell them how their son died a hero for algarve which he did but id sooner he went on living as a hero instead he was writing that letter and having a tough go of it when colonel ambaldo stuck his head into the tent ambaldo was beaming we smashed them he told sabrino who could smell brandy fumes on his breath with a scornful snap of his fingers the newcomer from the east went on these unkerlanters they are not so much of a much the lagoans and kuusamans are ten times the dragonfliers you see here in unkerlant we smashed up a couple of squadrons over durrwangen and dropped any number of eggs on the town good for you sabrino said tonelessly and now good my sir if you will excuse me i am trying to send my condolences to a fallen fliers family ah i see of course ambaldo said had he left the tent then everything would have been if not fine then at least tolerably well but perhaps elevated by the brandy he added though how anyone could easily lose men to these unkerlanter clods is beyond me sabrino rose to his feet fixing ambaldo with a deadly glare he spoke in a voice chillier than any unkerlanter winter a great many things appear to be beyond you sir sense among them kindly take your possessions and get them out of this my tent you are no longer welcome here lodge yourself elsewhere or let the powers below eat you its all one to me but get out colonel ambaldos eyes widened sir you may not speak to me so regardless of what you claim to be the rules of the front i shall seek satisfaction if you want satisfaction go find a whore sabrino gave ambaldo a mocking bow i told you we do not duel here let me say this then if you ever seek to inflict your presence upon me here in this tent again i will not duel i will simply kill you on sight you joke ambaldo exclaimed sabrino shrugged you are welcome to make the experiment and after you do somebody will have to write to your kin assuming anyone has any idea who your father is sir i know you are overwrought but you try my patience ambaldo said i warn you i will call you out regardless of these socalled rules if provoked too far good sabrino said if your friends in the unlikely event you have any speak to mine they need not inquire as to weapons i shall choose knives sticks were common in duels they got things over with quickly and decisively swords were also common especially among those with an antiquarian bent knives a man who chose knives didnt just want to kill his opponent he wanted to make sure the foe suffered before dying ambaldo licked his lips he wasnt a coward no algarvian colonel of dragonfliers was likely to be a coward but he saw that sabrino meant what he said and at the moment didnt much care whether he lived or died with such dignity as he could muster ambaldo said i hope to speak to you again someday sir when you are more nearly yourself he turned and left with a last soft curse sabrino sat down again he reinked his pen hoping the fury that had coursed through him would make the words come easier but it didnt hed had to write far too many of these letters and they never came easy and as he wrote he couldnt help wondering who would write a letter for him one day and what the man would say sidroc took off his fur hat and stowed it in his pack not so cold these days he remarked sergeant werferth made silent clapping motions youre a sly one you are to notice that i bet it was all the stinking snow melting that gave you the clue heh sidroc said werferth being a sergeant he couldnt say any more than that without landing in trouble he could and did turn away from the sergeant and walk off down one of the lengths of trench north of durrwangen plegmunds brigade was holding his boots made squelching sucking noises at every step werferth had been rude but he hadnt been wrong the snow was melting indeed had all but melted when it melted it didnt just disappear either things would have been simpler and more convenient if it had but it didnt it soaked into the ground and turned everything to a dreadful morass of mud a couple of eggs came whizzing out from durrwangen to burst close by throwing up fountains of muck it splatted down with a noise that reminded sidroc of a latrine only louder he threw his hands in the air as if that would do any good how are we supposed to go forward in this he demanded and then answered his own question we cant nobody could doesnt mean we wont ceorl said the ruffian spat his spittle was but one more bit of moisture in the mire havent you noticed the redheads would sooner spend our lives than theirs thats so sidroc didnt think anyone in plegmunds brigade hadnt noticed it but they spend plenty of their own men too ceorl spat again aye they do and for what this lousy stretch of unkerlant isnt worth shitting in let alone anything else sidroc would have argued with that if only he could since he agreed with it he just grunted and squelched along the trench till he came to a brass pot bubbling over a little fire the stew was oats and rhubarb and something that had been dead long enough to get gamy but not long enough to become altogether inedible he filled his mess tin and ate with good appetite only after he was done while he was rinsing the mess tin with water from his canteen did he pause to wonder what he would have thought of the meal were he still living soft back in gromheort he laughed he would have thrown the mess tin at anyone who tried to give it to him here and now with a full belly he was happy enough he was also happy that none of the brigades algarvian officers looked to be around as long as they werent there nothing much would happen hed seen that they didnt trust the forthwegian sergeants to do anything much forthwegians were good enough to fight for algarve but not to think or to lead the unkerlanters launched more eggs from the outskirts of durrwangen these burst closer than the others had one of them close enough to make sidroc throw himself down in the cold clammy mud powers below eat them he muttered as bits of the thin metal shell that had housed the eggs sorcerous energy hissed through the air why dont they just run off and make things easy on us for once but despite the pounding the algarvians had given durrwangen swemmels men showed no inclination whatever to run off if the algarvians wanted them gone they would have to drive them out after the eggs stopped falling sidroc stuck his head up over the parapet and peered south get down you fool somebody called to him you want a beam in the face he got down unblazed the outskirts of durrwangen lay a mile or so away the unkerlanters held on to the city from the outskirts to its heart like grim death he couldnt see all the fortifications theyd put up but that proved nothing hed already discovered the gift they had for making fieldworks that didnt look like much till you attacked them whatever they had waiting in durrwangen he wasnt eager to find out whether he was eager or not of course didnt matter to the algarvian officers commanding plegmunds brigade they came back from wherever theyd been with smiles as broad as if theyd just heard king swemmel had surrendered sidrocs company commander was a captain named zerbino he gathered his men together and declared tomorrow we shall have the high honor and privilege of being among the first to break into durrwangen he spoke algarvian of course the forthwegians in the brigade were expected to understand him rather than the other way round but no matter what language he used none of his troopers was eager to go forward against the heavily defended city even sergeant werferth who loved fighting for its own sake said why am i not surprised they chose us captain zerbino fixed him with a malignant stare and what pray tell do you mean by this sergeant he asked in his haughtiest manner werferth knew better than to be openly insubordinate but from behind the algarvian officer somebody sidroc thought it was ceorl but he wasnt sure spoke up he means we arent redheads thats what so who gives a fornicating futter what happens to us zerbino whirled he drew himself up to his full height being an algarvian he had several inches on most of the men in his company after a crisp sardonic bow he answered i am a redhead and i assure that when the order to attack is given i shall be at the fore where i go will you dare to follow nobody had anything to say to that sidroc wished he could have found something but his wits were empty too like all the officers assigned to plegmunds brigade zerbino had shown himself to be recklessly brave where he went the company would follow and if that was straight into the meat grinder then it was and nobody could do anything about it sidroc slapped his canteen it held nothing but water he sighed wishing for spirits somebody would have some but would anybody be willing to give him any all he could do was try to find out he ended up paying some silver for a short knock i cant spare any more said the soldier who let him have it im going to drink the rest myself before we go at em tomorrow sidroc wished he could get drunk for the assault too he wrapped himself in his blanket and tried to sleep bursting eggs didnt bother him he had their measure but thinking about what hed go through come morning he tried not to think about it which only made things worse eventually he must have slept for sergeant werferth shook him awake come on werferth said its just about time eggtossers and dragons were pounding the forwardmost unkerlanter positions more will come when we go forward captain zerbino promised we are not breaking into durrwangen alone after all algarvian brigades will be moving forward too which is why theyll do something more to help us along sidroc thought before he could say it aloud not that it needed saying not when most of the men in the company were doubtless thinking the same thing zerbino raised his long tubular brass whistle to his lips and blew a blast that pierced the din of battle like a needle piercing thin shabby cloth and as zerbino had promised he was the first one out of the muddy holes in which the men of plegmunds brigade sheltered the first one moving toward the enemy the ground ahead was also muddy muddy and churned to chaos by the bursts of endless eggs it sucked leechlike at sidrocs boots trying to pull them off his feet the mud stank too stank with the odor of all the men and animals already killed in it there would be more before the day was through sidroc hoped he wouldnt be part of the more a barrage of eggs flew through the air arcing up from the south toward the soldiers of plegmunds brigade and the algarvians who advanced on either side of them try as they would the algarvians eggtossers and dragons hadnt wrecked the unkerlanters ability to hit back sidroc would have been angrier had he expected more as things were he threw himself down into the noisome mud and hoped no egg burst right on top of him captain zerbino kept blowing his whistle for all he was worth that pulled sidroc up and got him squelching toward durrwangen again an egg burst just in front of zerbino it flung him high in the air limp and broken he fell to the soggy ground no more whistles sidroc thought he trudged on anyhow someone he was all too certain would blaze him if he turned back the ground shook under his feet up ahead some of the rubble in which the unkerlanters sheltered slid into ruin only when sidroc saw purple flames shooting up from the ground among those ruins did he fully understand then he whooped and cheered aye kill those kaunians he yelled they dont deserve anything better by the powers above had his superiors asked it of him he would cheerfully have set about killing blonds himself as things were he rushed toward the defenses battered by algarvian sorcery rushed as best he could with great globs of mud clinging to his boots and more sticking on at every stride even the strongest sorcery didnt take out all the defenders here and there amidst the wreckage ahead beams winked to life a forthwegian not far from sidroc dropped his stick threw up his hands and fell face forward into the muck but plegmunds brigade and the algarvians moving forward with it pressed on toward durrwangen with the city battered by murderous magecraft sidroc didnt see how they could fail to break in and then the ground shook beneath him hard enough to knock him off his feet as he sprawled in the mire a great crack opened ahead it sucked down a couple of forthwegian troopers and slammed shut again smashing them before they could even scream sidroc felt like screaming himself he did scream he screamed curses at the algarvian wizards safe behind the line them you crackbrained whoreson arseholes them not us crackbrain yourself ceorl yelled thats not the redheads thats swemmels mages killing peasants and hitting back oh sidroc felt like a fool not for the first time since joining plegmunds brigade that didnt even count the times he felt like a fool for joining plegmunds brigade he looked to his right and left gain the algarvian troops to either side of the brigade had been hit at least as hard as his forthwegian countrymen how are we supposed to go forward then ceorl didnt answer swarms of unkerlanter dragons painted rockgray flew up from the south dropping eggs on the attackers and flaming those incautious enough to bunch together the algarvians magecraft hadnt reached far enough to do anything to king swemmels dragon farms and then the ground shook and opened and closed again almost under sidrocs feet more purple flames shot up from it one incinerated an algarvian behemoth and its crew not far away king swemmel didnt seem to care how many of his own folk his mages killed so long as they halted their foes and theyd done that sidroc was no general and never would be but he could tell at a glance that the algarvians hadnt the least chance of taking durrwangen till after the mud of southern unkerlant turned hard again spring was coming to the valmieran countryside the first shoots of new green grass were springing up from the ground leaf buds sprouted on apple and plum and cherry trees early birds were returning from their winter homes in northern jelgava and algarve and on the tropical continent of siaulia pretty soon skarnu thought itll be time to plant the years barley and wheat and turn the cattle and sheep out to pasture instead of feeding them on hay and silage he laughed at himself before the war hed never thought about where food came from or how it was produced for all he knew or cared it might have appeared by sorcery in grocers or butchers shops he knew better now he knew enough to make himself more than a little useful on a farm out in the country hed helped one farmer who hid him and now he was doing the same for another this fellow was as surprised as the other had been he said i heard tell you were a city man you talk like a city man thats a fact but you know what to do with a pitchfork and thats a fact too i know what to do with a pitchfork skarnu agreed and let it go at that the less people knew about him the better again he wasnt too far from ventspils and wanted to get farther away the algarvians had come too close to nabbing him to nabbing the whole underground organization there somebodyd been made to talk somewhere or trusted someone he shouldnt have the risks irregulars inevitably took when fighting an occupying army more powerful than they when fighting an occupying army and a whole great swarm of traitors skarnu thought sourly as always the first traitor whose face came to mind was his sister krasta right behind her though were all the valmieran constables who served the algarvians as steadily as theyd ever served king gainibu if they hadnt he didnt see how the redheads could have held on to his kingdom and held it down but the fellow who came to the farm a couple of days later was neither an algarvian nor a constable in the redheads pay the painter who headed up the irregulars in ventspils found skarnu weeding the vegetable plot by the farmhouse amusement in his voice he said hello pavilosta anybody would think youd been doing that all your born days hello yourself skarnu got to his feet and swiped at the mud on the knees of his trousers good to see mezentios men didnt manage to grab you either i worry more about our own the painter said echoing skarnus earlier thought but i came out here to talk about you not me what are we going to do with you anyhow i dont know skarnu pointed to the plants hed been weeding the scallions and leeks look to be doing nicely heh the underground leader said not a laugh but the appearance of one youre too good a man with your hands to waste them on produce you need to go someplace where you can give the redheads a hard time i wish we could send you into priekule youd do good things the way you know the city trouble is the city knows me too skarnu said i wouldnt last long before somebody fingered me to the algarvians he thought of krasta again but she wasnt the only one far from it how many valmieran nobles in the capital were in bed with the occupiers literally or metaphorically too many he sighed i wish i could go back to the farm by pavilosta i was doing fine there not safe the painter spoke with great authority he rubbed his chin as he thought i know of a couple of fellows you might want to meet theyve been away for a while you could show em how things have changed why me what in blazes do i know about anything skarnu didnt try to hide his bitterness i couldnt even guess where the redheads were shipping those poor cursed kaunians from forthweg they must have aimed their magic at kuusamo but it wouldnt have gone at yliharma or we would have heard about it he stared down at his hands they had mud on them too but in his eyes it looked like blood no not at yliharma the man from ventspils agreed they did something nasty with the life energy they stole something that helped them and hurt us i dont know any more about it than that i dont think anybody in valmiera knows much more about it than that hed succeeded in making skarnu curious hed also let him know his curiosity wouldnt be satisfied scowling skarnu said who are these two fellows and how will you bring them here without bringing mezentios men too i wont the painter said youll go to them you know that little village you visited once before tomorrow about noon a wagon will stop here the man driving it will say the column of victory you answer will rise again hell take you where youre going what if he doesnt say that skarnu asked run like blazes the other irregular leader answered as if hed said everything hed come to say he turned on his heel and ambled back toward ventspils sure enough the wagon turned up the next day skarnu warily approached the driver said what he was supposed to say skarnu gave the countersign the driver nodded skarnu climbed aboard the driver flicked the reins and clucked to the horses they got to the village a day and a half later by then skarnu thought his fundament was turning to stone the driver seemed undisturbed he even chuckled at the old mans hobble with which skarnu made for the house that served as the undergrounds nerve center the woman hed met there at his last visit let him in she gave him bread and beer which were both welcome and let him sit down on a soft chair which at the moment seemed almost as fine as falling into merkelas arms he let out a long sigh of pleasure before asking im to meet someone so you are she said let me go upstairs and get them ill be back directly skarnu was perfectly content for her to take as much time as she wanted he could have sat in that chair forever without minding in the least but she came back far too soon to suit him fully with a couple of men dressed in the shabby homespun of farmers dressed much as he was as a matter of fact he had to heave himself to his feet to greet them his back groaned when he rose but then to his astonishment he discovered he recognized both newcomers amatu lauzdonu i thought you were dead no such luck said lauzdonu the taller of the two he grinned and pumped skarnus hand we were both flying dragons down in the south when the collapse came amatu added i knew that skarnu said thats why i thought youd bought a plot came close a few times lauzdonu said in the offhand way of a man who had indeed had death brush his sleeve a time or two the algarvians had too many dragons down there nothing like a fair fight they had too much of everything all over the place skarnu said bitterly that they did amatu agreed but when the surrender order came neither one of us could stomach it we climbed on our dragons and flew across the strait of valmiera to lagoas and weve been in setubal ever since his lip curled theyre algarvic over there too but at least theyre on our side skarnu remembered that amatu had always been a snob lauzdonu who had somewhat more charity in him put in aye they kept fighting even when things looked blackest well so did you two skarnu said and so did i and if more valmieran nobles had wed have given mezentios men a harder time he thought but most of them and a lot of the kingdoms commoners had made their accommodations inevitably his sister sprang to mind yet again to force the thought of krasta down he asked and what are you doing here on the right side of the strait again their faces which had been smiling and excited closed down again skarnu knew what that meant they had orders they couldnt talk about lauzdonu tried to make light of it saying hows that pretty sister of yours my lord marquis my lord count shes sleeping with a redhead skarnus voice went flat and harsh lauzdonu and amatu both exclaimed then the one in surprise the other in outrage lauzdonu strode forward to lay a sympathetic hand on skarnus shoulder skarnu wanted to shake it off but made himself endure it amatu said something ought to happen to her and to her lover too i wouldnt mind skarnu said i wouldnt mind at all he eyed the two nobles hed known in priekule you may have to talk to me sooner or later they brought me here to go with you wherever it is youre going better you than that leviathanrider who fetched us from lagoas amatu said he told us he was a sib but he could have passed for an algarvian any day itll be good to have you along lauzdonu said after all its been going on three years since we left we dont know whos alive whos dead who chose the wrong bloody side he patted skarnu again where are you going skarnu asked i wont ask what youll do when you get there but i do need to know that zarasai lauzdonu answered amatus lip curled again to him any town that wasnt the capital really wasnt worth visiting lauzdonu seemed to have a clearer understanding of the way things worked if we go to priekule somebody will betray us to the algarvians thats why i havent gone back skarnu agreed he nodded to the two of them priekule then setubal theyd been spoiled and they didnt even know it youll find the rest of the countryside isnt so bad and he turned serious youll find you do better if you dont let on that youve got noble blood commoners getting out of hand are they amatu said well well tend to that once weve beaten the algarvians by the powers above im surprised you didnt take your dragons up to jelgava skarnu murmured youd have felt right at home there amatu stared at him in annoyed incomprehension lauzdonu snickered and then tried to pretend he hadnt jelgavan nobles had long since given themselves a name for reaction that amatu couldnt hear how he sounded warned that he would indeed have fit right in lauzdonu said skarnu knows how things work these days better than we do i suppose so amatu spoke grudgingly zarasai skarnu spoke in musing tones well among other things thats a good place to monitor the ley lines coming down toward the coast from the north and west what are you talking about amatu sounded impatient in a way that reminded skarnu achingly of krasta lauzdonu murmured in the other returned exiles ear oh amatus nod was reluctant too even after he got the point skarnu wondered what hed done to make the irregulars hate him enough to saddle himself with these two maybe its their revenge on me for being of noble blood myself he sighed the algarvians were the only people on whom he wanted that much revenge a valmieran waiter fawned on colonel lurcanio and incidentally on krasta too krasta expected servile deference from commoners so did lurcanio servile deference of a slightly different sort the deference of the conquered to their conquerors since he got it here he seemed happy enough in fact he seemed happier than he had for quite some time the war news must be good krasta ventured better at any rate lurcanio allowed even if the cursed unkerlanters did keep us from retaking durrwangen they wont be doing anything much for some weeks general mud has replaced general winter over there you see no i dont see krastas voice had an edge in it what are you talking about why do you always talk in riddles no riddle he said and then paused while the waiter brought him white wine and krasta ale when the fellow scurried off again lurcanio resumed no riddle i say merely mud a great gluey sea of it and when the fighting starts again it will be on our terms not king swemmels he raised his wineglass to victory to victory krasta sipped her ale part of her she wasnt sure how much and it varied from day to day sometimes from minute to minute even meant it an algarvian triumph in the west would justify everything shed done here and the unkerlanters were surely uncultured barbarians who deserved whatever happened to them the other things an algarvian triumph in the west would mean this time krasta gulped at the ale she didnt want to think about that she was relieved when the waiter brought the dinners theyd ordered beef ribs in a creamy gravy with spinach in cheese sauce and boiled beans for her a trout sautйed in wine and a green salad for lurcanio he stared at her plate in some bemusement remarking i have never understood why valmierans arent round as footballs considering what you eat you complain about things like that almost every time we go out krasta said i like the way my kingdom cooks why arent algarvians all skin and bones if they eat the way you do lurcanio laughed and mimed taking a sword in the chest like so many of his countrymen he had a gift for pantomime even though krasta had been feeling gloomy his antics made her smile he had charm when he chose to use it and he also had frightful severity when he chose to use that the combination kept krasta off balance never quite sure where she stood before long hed reduced his trout to nothing but a skeleton with head and tail still attached its looking at you krasta said with more than a little distaste those boiled eyes staring up you milady have never seen combat lurcanio answered if you had you would not let something so small as a fish head get in the way of your appetite under the table his hand found her leg well above the knee of any of your appetites he added krasta sighed she knew what that meant lurcanio never raised a fuss if she kept him out of her bed of an evening but she didnt dare do it very often if she did he was liable to find someone else who wouldnt that would leave her without an algarvian protector spring was in the air but the thought filled her with winter the occupiers answered to themselves and to themselves alone without an algarvian by her side what was she fair game she thought and shivered are you cold milady colonel lurcanio asked startled krasta shook her head lurcanios smile put her in mind of that of a beast of prey good you are well advised not to be cold she sighed again after supper lurcanios driver threaded his way through the dark streets of priekule to a theater not far from the palace the play like so many showing these days was a comedy of manners from a couple of centuries before nothing in it that could offend anyone valmieran or algarvian nothing political at any rate the manners it featured were mostly bad including an inordinate number of cuckoldings lurcanio laughed his head off do you think infidelity is funny krasta asked not without malice aforethought as they headed for the exit that depends lurcanio replied with a splendid algarvian shrug if it happens to someone else most certainly if i give the horns all the more so if i have to wear them and if i have to notice i am wearing them that is another business altogether do you understand me aye krasta said coldly hed made her very unhappy when he caught her kissing viscount valnu she didnt want that to happen again if she decided to stray once more she knew she dared not get caught she was moodily silent on the ride back to the mansion on the edge of town lurcanio affected not to notice that krasta knew was an act it was a good act and would have been better had he not been so conscious of how good it was when they got there lurcanio went up the stairs to krastas bedchamber with the easy familiarity of a man who had visited it many times before his manner in the bedchamber sometimes struck her as a good act too again slightly marred by his being aware of how good it was but he succeeded in giving her pleasure as well as taking his own things could have been worse lurcanio occasionally made it plain that they could have been worse what hed done with her to her after catching her with valnu such things had been against the law in valmiera and still were shed heard in jelgava afterwards lurcanio dressed quickly sleep well my sweet he said i know i shall even his yawn was as calculated as theatrical as anything shed seen on the stage earlier in the evening but krasta full and sated did sleep well until some time after midnight a noisy commotion at the front entrance woke her someone was pounding on the door and shouting let me in by the powers above let me in at the same time as the algarvian sentries out there yelled silence stopping stopping or blazing krasta threw open her window and cried no no blazing i know this man then in a lower voice she went on this is most unseemly viscount valnu what in blazes are you doing here at whatever hour this is marchioness i am here to save my life if i can valnu answered if i dont do it here i wont do it anywhere i cant imagine what youre talking about krasta said let me in and ill tell you valnus voice rose with urgency once more oh by the powers above let me in shutting up noisy maniac one of the sentries said waking everyone inside making everyone to hating you i dont hate him krasta said sharply which was most of the time true as if to prove it she added ill be right down her night tunic and trousers were thin and filmy she threw on a cloak over them by the time she got downstairs several servants had gathered in the front hall krasta sent them back to bed with angry gestures and opened the front door herself valnu darted in and fell at her feet as if prostrating himself before the king of unkerlant save me he cried as melodramatically as an algarvian oh get up krastas voice turned irritable i let you into my house if this is some mad scheme to get me to let you into my bed youre wasting your time anything she said here would get back to lurcanio as she was uneasily aware she hated having to be uneasy about anything but valnu answered i did not come here for that i did not come here to see you at all milady though i bless you for letting me in i came here to see your protector the eminent count and colonel lurcanio he can truly save me where you cannot and why should i save you viscount valnu lurcanio strode into the front hall from the west wing why should i not order you blazed for disturbing my rest if not for any of a large number of other good reasons because except in this particular instance perhaps you would be blazing an innocent man valnu said my dear fellow you have not been an innocent for a great many years lurcanio said with sardonic glee not even in your left ear valnu bowed very low that you pick the left rather than the right proves how closely you listen to your fellow officers who know me well know me intimately one might even say but i am an innocent in matters concerning your bold algarvian hounds by the powers above your excellency i am and what matters are those sure enough lurcanio had a purr in his voice almost as if he were talking to krasta after bedding her they think i am playing some sort of stupid some sort of idiotic double game looking to tear down everything algarves done valnu answered its a lie by the powers above a lie he did not draw attention to the kilt he was wearing at first krasta thought that might be a mistake then she decided valnu was making lurcanio notice it for himself not a bad ploy she saw the algarvian eyeing valnus bare knobby knees but her lover was first and foremost an officer of his kingdom youve called on the powers above twice now viscount he said by the powers above sir why should i believe you and not my kingdoms hounds their task after all is to sniff out treason and rebellion wherever they find them if they turn their noses your way if they turn them my way they turn them in the wrong direction valnu insisted ask your lady if you doubt me that made colonel lurcanio laugh out loud considering the embrace the two of you were enjoying when i was so inconsiderate as to interrupt you i might be inclined to doubt her objectivity but his eyes swung toward krasta nonetheless well milady what say you krasta could have said a good deal valnu must have known she could have said a good deal he was betting his life that she didnt want him dead no matter how much hed irked her in days gone by and hed irked her a great deal indeed if she spoke against him he was dead if she spoke for him too fulsomely lurcanio wouldnt believe her what she did say was whatever his problem may be i wish he wouldnt bring it here at this ridiculous hour of the morning and that colonel is nothing but the truth i wish the same thing lurcanio fixed valnu with a hard stare to a certain degree i admire your nerve but only to a certain degree go back to your home if the hounds come for you then they come but i will have them explain themselves to me before they do anything too drastic that is the most i intend to give you valnu bowed low again i thank you your excellency it is more than i deserve i am afraid you may be right lurcanio answered now get out aye get out krasta said let decent people sleep if youd be so kind for reasons she absolutely could not fathom both valnu and lurcanio started laughing at her pekka wished things were as they had been before the algarvians struck at her comrades and her without siuntio though they would never be the same first and foremost she missed the master mage more with every passing day she hadnt realized how much shed relied on his good sense his resolute optimism and his capacity for moral outrage till they were gone second and as important in a less personal less intimate way siuntio had been the one mage who could keep ilmarinen under something vaguely resembling control ilmarinen was wild for revenge against algarve aye but he was also wild for experimenting with the nature of time and wild for one of the serving women at the hostel a passion apparently not returned which somehow didnt seem to bother him in the least and wild for the birds flocking into the area with the return of spring and wild for anything everything pekka complained to fernao in the dining room one morning he is supposed to be in charge he is supposed to be leading us in our work against mezentios men and what is he doing running around in all directions at once like a puppy in a park full of interesting smells the lagoan mage quirked up a gingery eyebrow if you can make similes like that in classical kaunian maybe you ought to try writing along with magecraft i do not want to try writing pekka said i want to get on with the work we are supposed to be doing have we done that under ilmarinen he is not the leader i hoped he would be i hate to say that but it is the truth some people are not made to be either leaders or followers fernao observed some people listen only to themselves that may be so pekka replied reflecting that with ilmarinen it certainly seemed so but leading is the job he has been given fernao sipped from his mug of tea and looked at her over the top of it with his disconcertingly kuusaman eyes if he is not doing it maybe you should have it instead me pekkas voice rose to a startled squeak one that made raahe and alkio sitting a couple of tables away turn and stare at her she fought for quiet fought and won it how could i take it by what right without siuntio and ilmarinen this project would not exist the seven princes would not have supported it as may be fernao shrugged but now that they are supporting it do you not think they expect success to follow from that support i couldnt pekka muttered in kuusaman more to herself than to him it would be like throwing my father out onto the street but the lagoan mages grasp of her language got better day by day not to do with family he said in kuusaman and then returned to classical kaunian this is not even the business of the kingdom this is the business of the world i couldnt pekka repeated now fernao eyed her with the first open disapproval shed seen from him why not he asked pointedly if not you who i am an ignorant foreigner the newcomers he lowered his voice a little further they are all a step below you and two steps behind you if it is not to be ilmarinen he had confidence in her where she had none in herself pekka had never known that from anyone but her husband before she wished leino were here now he would know how to gauge things in the aftermath of the algarvians sorcerous assault shed lost her feel and then when she was hoping fernao would leave her alone he found one more question how long do you suppose it will be before mezentios mages strike us again if they do can we withstand them why should they strike us again pekka asked since they hit us the last time what have we done that would draw their notice she rose from the table and left in a hurry if she hadnt just made fernaos point for him what had she done he called after her but she kept walking going up to her room didnt help she looked out and saw mud and rock where snow had lain mud and rock with grass and bushes growing furiously here almost as in the land of the ice people everything had to grow furiously for winter came early and left late giving life little time to burgeon buntings and pipits chirped insects buzzed before long pekka knew there was liable to be a plague of gnats and mosquitoes again as happened on the austral continent the bog the countryside became after the snow melted made a perfect breeding ground for all sorts of bugs but the signs of spring did nothing to cheer pekka instead they reminded her how time was running out slipping away through her fingers experiments should have resumed they should have been strengthened they hadnt the landscape by the blockhouse should have had new craters it didnt curse me if fernao isnt right pekka exclaimed though no one was there to hear her if i dont do something who will she left her room and walked down the hall to ilmarinens her knock was sharp and peremptory ilmarinen opened the door when he saw her he smiled in something that looked like relief and said oh good i thought you were linna that was the serving woman with whom he was infatuated if she knocked like that shed want to knock my block off next thing i want to knock your block off pekka said why arent we working more when mezentios mages attacked us you promised vengeance for siuntio where is it how far away is it how long does his shade have to wait well well ilmarinen said and then again well well whos been feeding you raw meat my dear i am not your dear pekka snapped not when you sit there and twiddle your thumbs instead of doing what needs doing if you dont move this project forward master ilmarinen who will i am moving it forward ilmarinen answered a little uneasily and we will get back in the field very soon when is soon pekka asked we should have been back weeks ago and you know it as well as i do what are the algarvians doing while we do nothing how are we remembering master siuntio ilmarinen fell back a step in the face of that barrage of questions uneasiness gave way to anger on his face if you think going forward is so very easy mistress if you think it can be done just like that he snapped his fingers maybe you ought to try running this mess yourself fernao had told pekka that shed told herself that now ilmarinen was telling her that too with a crisp nod she said aye i think youre right i ought to lets go to the crystallomancer so we can let prince juhainen know were making the change come on youre serious ilmarinen spoke in tones of wonder by the powers above i am pekka said weve been frozen while the ground was melting time to let juhainen know were going to thaw out she sighed juhainen wasnt quite so solidly behind the research project as his predecessor and uncle prince joroinen had been but joroinen was dead buried in the rubble of the princely palace when algarvian magic smote yliharma still since juhainens princely domain included her home town of kajaani she expected he would take her more seriously than any of the other seven ilmarinen followed her down the hall if youre trying to cast me out like an algarvian bandit overthrowing his chieftain why do you suppose id want to work with you work under you afterwards why pekka spun on her heel and glared at the older mage ill tell you why master ilmarinen because i will break you in half with my own hands if you try to leave now have you got that at the moment it would be a pleasure pekka waited if ilmarinens temper always uncertain did burst like an egg what could she do about it nothing that she could see and if the senior theoretical sorcerer did decide to abandon the project could she really stop him she feared she couldnt sometimes though just showing you were ready to face a question meant you didnt have to as her son uto usually did when she took a firm stand ilmarinen yielded take it then and welcome he growled may you have more joy of it than i did when it landed in my lap joy pekka shook her head not likely but by the powers above i am going to have my revenge if its there to have now lets get along to the crystallomancer and let prince juhainen know she didnt intend to give ilmarinen any chance to change his mind once the shock of being confronted wore off and he not only came with her he spoke in favor of the change when juhainens image appeared in the crystal for some reason or other probably doing as i please all these years i appear to make a better sorcerer than administrator he told the prince putting mistress pekka in charge of things here will move us ahead faster than we could go if i tried to steer us down the ley line juhainen said if you both think this is for the best i will not quarrel with it moving down the ley line is what matters i dont care how you do it and i dont think any of my colleagues will either thank you your highness pekka said with considerable relief juhainen was a young man hardly more than a youth but he looked to be showing the common sense that had marked his uncle prince joroinen his answer displayed more of that common sense i dont know why you are thanking me youve just had a lot more hard work land on your head it needs doing pekka said with the help of everyone here she let her eyes flick toward ilmarinen i think i can get it done let it be so then prince juhainen said and turned back to whatever hed been doing when the call came in the crystal into which pekka had been speaking flared briefly before returning to quiescence ilmarinen gave pekka a bow half mocking half respectful let it be so then he echoed but you cant just let it be so you know you have to make it be so lucky you for now what i have to do is let the others know it is so pekka said will you come down with me or would you rather i did that myself oh ill come ilmarinen said some of them may care to see that you havent murdered me of course some of them may not too when pekka got down to the dining hall she was surprised to find fernao and raahe and alkio still there piilis had come down to eat too her rebellion my successful rebellion she thought dizzily hadnt taken long fernaos eyes widened when he saw ilmarinen behind her pekka said ah good now i can tell everyone at once with the agreement of prince juhainen i am now responsible for taking our work forward if the weather lets us do it i want us experimenting again within three days shed spoken kuusaman she started to turn her words into classical kaunian for fernao but the lagoan mage waved to show her she neednt bother her eyes darted to the other theoretical sorcerers no one burst into applause that would have been cruel to ilmarinen but everyone looked pleased its mine now pekka thought and responsibility heavy as the weight of the world came pressing down on her shoulders qutuz came into hajjajs office your excellency the marquis balastro is here to see you the zuwayzi foreign ministers secretary said i thank you hajjaj answered show him in as you see i am ready to receive him he wore an algarvianstyle tunic and pleated kilt with every day that spring advanced clothes grew less comfortable for him but discomfort was part of the price he paid for diplomacy qutuz being a mere secretary did not have to drape himself in cloth that clung and held the heat after bowing to hajjaj he went out to the antechamber and returned with algarves minister to zuwayza balastro wore tunic and kilt too and was sweating in them even more than hajjaj the algarvian minister offered his hand hajjaj clasped it balastro said you look very well your excellency and you are the picture of sartorial splendor for the year after the end of the six years war hajjaj laughed what i usually wear never goes out of style another advantage to skin if you care what i think as much as i ever do balastros grin showed teeth white but slightly crooked he was a bluff blocky middleaged man with sandyred hair streaked with gray he wasnt subtle but he wasnt stupid either on the whole hajjaj liked him not that he let that get in the way of doing what he needed to do for his kingdom and how can i help you today your excellency hajjaj inquired besides amusing you with my wardrobe i mean would you care for some refreshments before answering balastro lowered himself to the carpeted floor and piled up cushions till hed made a comfortable nest more than most foreign envoys who came to zuwayza he imitated local customs once he was reclining he grinned at hajjaj and shook his head since you give me the choice ill decline how many hours over the years have you kept me simmering while we sip and nibble as many as i thought were needed hajjaj answered imperturbably which made balastro laugh out loud hajjaj piled up pillows too by his low desk if today i claim i am simply aiming to get out of these unpleasantly warm garments before too long i doubt you will be able to contradict me if you like ill take off my clothes so you can shed yours balastro said hed done that a few times which made him unique in the annals of diplomacy in zuwayza with his pale body and his circumcision though he did not make an inconspicuous nude in this kingdom on the contrary and so hajjaj said never mind by all means do say on though i listen with great attention he had to listen with great attention algarve being zuwayzas cobelligerent against king swemmel of unkerlant and much the bigger power of the two things are looking up balastro said its been a hard winter aye but things are looking up i can i think say that truthfully now looking at the way things down in the south have gone considering how things were there a few weeks ago algarve does seem to have managed a revival hajjaj agreed after sulingen fell there was some small concern lest your entire position in the south unravel a lifetime of diplomacy had taught him to minimize things zuwayza and yanina and even neutral landlocked ortah had all been terrified of the prospect of swarms of unkerlanters rolling down on their kingdoms without any algarvian armies left to throw them back well it didnt it didnt and it wont balastro always spoke confidently here his confidence seemed justified he went on weve stabilized the battle line and were deeper into algarve than we were a year ago that was all true even if mildly obscene of course it said nothing of the debacle at sulingen but then balastro did not pretend to be objective i am pleased to hear it hajjaj said general ikhshid has been full of admiration for the way you let the unkerlanters overextended themselves and then struck them in the flanks and rear for which i think him balastro as if the generalship were his he continued pity we couldnt drive them out of durrwangen again too but the mud got too thick too fast when it dries out again well deal with them there may it be so hajjaj said on the whole sincerely he knew of unkerlanter mud of course but it didnt seem quite real to him any more than the savage summer heat of bishah would seem real to a man from durrwangen hearing about it without having experienced it oh it will balastro might have been talking about tomorrows sunrise weve pushed well past the place to both east and west even if we couldnt quite break in a couple of attacks to pinch off the neck of the salient he gestured and the head falls into the basket a vivid image deadpan hajjaj asked are you sure you will have enough kaunians to make it real you need have no fear on that score the algarvian minister replied he impaled hajjaj with a cold green stare we would have even more if you werent harboring those cursed refugees since they are here in my kingdom king shazlis kingdom they are no concern of yours hajjaj said the position zuwayza had held ever since kaunians from forthweg began sailing to her eastern shore and i have repeatedly ordered them to stay here in zuwayza and under no circumstances to return to forthweg you are the soul of virtue balastro said sourly you know as well as i your excellency that any order you have to give repeatedly is an order that is not working would you rather i gave no such order at all hajjaj returned i would rather that you put some teeth in the order you have given balastro said string up a few blonds and the rest will get the point i shall consider it hajjaj wondered if he would have to do more than consider it if the algarvian minister insisted boisterously enough he might have to follow through balastro grunted thats more than i thought id get out of you youre a stubborn old crow hajjaj you know that why no your excellency hajjajs eyes widened in almost convincing surprise i had no idea prevaricating old porcupine too balastro said your father was a tortoise and your mother was a thornbush have you got any more compliments to pay me or are we through till the next session of teethpulling hajjaj asked but less gruffly than he would have liked on the whole he took balastros words for compliment rather than insult not quite through the algarvian minister answered my military attachй has asked me to ask you if zuwayza can do without a good many of the behemoths and dragons weve sent you over the past couple of years i am not the one to respond to questions on matters military hajjaj said trying to hide the alarm he couldnt help feeling if your attachй does not care to do so himself i shall raise the issue with general ikhshid and pass on to you his reply assuming he doesnt have an apoplexy and fall down frothing on the floor may i tell him why you would consider withdrawing this aid you cant be that angry about our harboring the kaunians can you im no soldier either balastro said but what it amounts to is this we aim to force a decision in unkerlant and well need everything we can scrape together when we do it we dont aim to lose a fight because we didnt strike a blow with all our strength i see said hajjaj who was not altogether sure he did well would you have me inquire of ikhshid or would your attachй sooner do it directly if youd be so kind id be grateful balastro answered suave and smooth as if hed never called hajjaj a porcupine in all his born days as you wish of course the zuwayzi foreign minister said good balastro heaved himself to his feet which meant hajjaj had to rise too the algarvian made his farewells and departed with the air of a man well pleased with himself hajjaj was pleased to be able to shed the clothes he despised he was much less pleased when he called qutuz and said would you be so kind as to inquire of general ikhshid if he would give me the pleasure of his company for a few minutes as soon as he conveniently can what that meant in plain language was get ikhshid here this instant qutuz a good secretary recognized as much of course your excellency he said and hurried away as hajjaj had hoped he would he had general ikhshid with him when he returned ikhshid was not far from hajjajs age a stocky whitehaired soldier whod served in the unkerlanter army during the six years war and rare for a zuwayzi had gained captains rank there after bows and handclasps ikhshid spoke with almost unkerlanter bluntness all right whats gone and got buggered up now nothing yet hajjaj said marquis balastro asked me to inquire of you how the buggering might go forward at some future date he relayed the algarvian ministers remarks to the general ikhshids shining eyebrows were like signal flags astonishingly visible against his dark skin they twitched now twitched and then descended and came together sounds like theyre thinking of staking everything on one throw of the dice you dont really want to do that not if youre fighting a war i wouldnt want to do it no matter what im doing hajjaj said why would king mezentio algarvians are better soldiers than unkerlanters ikhshid remarked not quite responsively put a company of redheads up against a company of swemmels men and the algarvians will come out on top put a company of algarvians against two companies of unkerlanters and they still might come out on top put them up against three he shook his head ah hajjaj inclined his head theres always the third unkerlanter aye there is there is indeed ikhshid agreed the algarvians didnt take cottbus they didnt take sulingen they dont have that many more chances left its not just men either your excellency its horses and unicorns and behemoths and dragons too skill counts or the redheads wouldnt have got as far as they did but weight counts too or theydve got farther and so the algarvians are aiming to put all their weight into whatever blow they choose to strike next hajjaj said slowly balastro said as much ikhshid nodded thats how it looks to me and itd look that way even if balastro hadnt said so can we afford to let them take dragons and behemoths out of zuwayza to strike this blow the foreign minister asked that comes down to two questions ikhshid answered first can we stop em if they choose to do it i doubt it and second of course when they strike this blow will it finally go to the heart aye hajjaj let out a long slow sigh we have to hope for the best then he wondered what the best was and if in this cursed war it even existed eight fernao found his kuusaman getting better day by day more kuusaman mages had come to the hostel not just piilis and raahe and alkio all of whom spoke excellent classical kaunian but several others who didnt know so much those less fluent newcomers werent directly involved in the experiments the theoretical sorcerers were making but were important even so their duty was to repel or at least to weaken any new assaults algarvian mages might launch against the experiments can you do it fernao asked one of them a woman named vihti much force many killings we can try vihti answered we can fight hard they are not close distance she used a word fernao didnt know distance does what he asked attenuates vihti repeated as to a child and then used a synonym weakens if you had been working in the north of kuusamo and not down here in the south the last attack would have done you all in you need not sound so happy fernao said i am not happy vihti said i am telling you what is that was something kuusamans were in the habit of doing vihti went off muttering under her breath probably about flighty overimaginative lagoans when fernao went out to the blockhouse with pekka and ilmarinen and the three newly arrived theoretical sorcerers he didnt think he was the overimaginative one the kuusamans had done things that no one else would have dreamt of for years the blockhouse was new and stronger than the one the algarvians had wrecked but a few of the timbers were charred ones salvaged from the old blockhouse pointing to them pekka spoke in classical kaunian they help remind us why we continue our work where nothing else lately seemed to have that got ilmarinens notice aye he growled with something of the fire hed had before the algarvian attack every one of those boards has siuntios blood on it we shall have our revenge piilis was a careful man who spoke careful kaunian that is what siuntio would have wanted pekka shook her head i doubt it he saw what needed doing against algarve but vengeance was never any great part of his style her eyes flashed i do not care regardless of whether he would have wanted me to take revenge i want it for my own sake i do not think he would have approved again i do not care aye hot eagerness filled fernaos voice he believed in vengeance too probably more so than any of the kuusamans elaborate revenge was part of the algarvic tradition lagoas shared with sibiu and algarve herself kuusamans were generally calmer and more restrained siuntio had been but calm and restraint however valuable in peacetime grew less so after war began fewer secondary sorcerers had accompanied fernao and his colleagues to the blockhouse this time with the coming of spring the experimental animals shouldnt freeze unless magecraft kept them warm but the secondary sorcerers still did have to transfer the spell pekka would recite to the racks of cages that held the rats and rabbits remember we are trying something new this time pekka said if all goes as planned most of the sorcerous energy we unleash today will strike at a point well removed from the animals we have to learn to do this if we are to turn our magecraft into a proper weapon the algarvians can do it with their murderous magic we must be able to match them and if things dont go quite right well bring it down on our own heads and that will put paid to this project once for all ilmarinen said oddly his gloom didnt bother fernao so much the master mage had been making cracks like that for as long as fernao had been in kuusamo and undoubtedly for a lot of decades before that getting him back to sounding like his sardonic self was if anything an improvement are we ready pekkas voice had steel in it warning that anyone who wasnt ready would face her wrath she didnt even come up to the top of fernaos shoulder but he wouldnt have wanted to have to do that no one admitted he wasnt ready pekkas gaze flicked around the blockhouse after a sharp abrupt nod she quietly recited the ritual sentences with which kuusamans began any sorcerous operation raahe and alkio and piilis spoke the words with her so did the secondary sorcerers and vihti and the other protective mages and so did ilmarinen who had about as little concern for most forms of ritual correctness as any wizard fernao had ever known fernao himself stood mute pretending he shared the kuusamans belief would have been useless perhaps even dangerous hypocrisy no one insisted that he join the recitation but when it was through pekka glanced toward him in my class at kajaani city college you would have had to say the words she remarked we are all learning here fernao answered that seemed to please her she nodded again more relaxed less jerky than she had been then after a couple of deep breaths she turned to the secondary sorcerers and asked again in kuusaman if they were ready fernao knew a certain amount of pride at understanding the question he understood the answer too they confirmed they were pekka inhaled once more then spoke first in her language and afterwards in classical kaunian i begin and begin she did with the same quiet authority fernao had seen again and again in her incanting she was rougher at her work than a mage who spent day after day refurbishing rest crates would have been at his but such a mage barely touched the surface of sorcery while pekka understood it down to the very roots down deeper in fact than anyone before her had imagined those roots ran watching her listening to her attack the spell fernao could have loved her not for who she was but for what she knew a distinction of a sort hed never imagined making he felt rather less proud of the spell she was using all the kuusamans had joined together in crafting it and it had the smoothed corners and shapelessness characteristic of a work formed by committee even with his imperfect grasp of kuusaman he could tell as much from the feel of the air in the blockhouse as she worked he did not doubt the spell would do what it was designed to do but it had no elegance to it had siuntio drafted it it would have been half as long and twice as strong fernao was sure of it he had no proof though he would never have proof not anymore not with siuntio dead force built not the bloodtasting force the algarvians had brought down on their heads but potent nonetheless potent enough to confront mezentios murderpowered magic fernao wouldnt have thought so not from what was in the air but hed seen what this energy release could do transferring it from one site to another seemed far easier than finding out how to elicit it had been and then as matter approached a climax pekka made the sort of mistake that could befall any mage working through a long complex difficult spell she dropped a line ilmarinen jumped piilis exclaimed in horror raahe and alkio seized each others hands as if they never expected to touch anything else again fernao knew a certain amount of pride at recognizing the problem as fast as any of the kuusamans he also knew the same fear that gripped them ilmarinens joke about bringing the sorcerous energy down on their own heads wasnt funny anymore when things went wrong at this stage counterspells ilmarinen rapped out and began to chant with sudden harsh urgency so did raahe and alkio their two voices merging into one so did pekka trying to reverse what shed unleashed dismay still seemed to freeze piilis not so fernao for a long time hed had nothing to do but draft and refine counterspells because he wasnt fluent in kuusaman hed been only an emergency backstop a firewall the spell he raced through now wasnt in kuusaman or even classical kaunian it was in lagoan his birthspeech hed long since decided would be best for such magic for he could use it faster and more accurately than any other and he like the rest of the mages was incanting for his life now he knew as much the sorcerous energies that would have torn a new hole in the landscape were poised now to do the same to the mages who had unleashed them if the mages couldnt divert those energies weaken them spread them fast enough they wouldnt get a second chance past present and future seemed to stretch very thin all too fitting for the sort of sorcery theyd been using fernao felt an odd rush of memories from his youth from his childhood from what he would have taken oath were his fathers and grandfathers childhoods as well but all recalled or perhaps relived with as much immediacy as much reality as his own and at the same time if time had any meaning here he knew also memories from years he hadnt yet experienced from himself as an old man from one of the children he did not at this moment have also old and from that childs child he wished he could have held those memories instead of just being aware that hed had them all the kuusaman mages around him were exclaiming in awe and dread as they used their counterspells so he supposed they were going through the same thing he was and then at last when he thought the chaos in the timestream would cast them adrift in duration or perhaps cast them out of it altogether the counterspells began to bite now suddenly took on meaning again his consciousness which had been spread over what felt like a century or more contracted back to a single sharp point that advanced heartbeat by heartbeat he remembered things that had happened to him before that point but nothing more no not quite nothing more he remembered remembering other things but he could not have said what they were well well ilmarinen said sweat beaded his face and soaked the armpits of his tunic even so he didnt forget to use classical kaunian wasnt that interesting my friends he didnt forget his ironic tone either pekka who had been standing while she cast the spell that went awry slumped down onto a stool and began to weep her face hidden in her hands i could have us all she said in a broken voice fernao didnt know the kuusaman verb but he would have been astonished if it didnt mean killed he limped over to her and put a hand on her shoulder it is all right he said cursing the classical tongue for not letting him sound colloquial we are safe we can try again we shall try again aye no harm done ilmarinen agreed any spell you live through is a spell you learn something from learn what pekka said with a laugh that sounded more like hysterics than mirth not to miss a line at the key moment of the incantation i was already supposed to know that master ilmarinen thank you very kindly fernao said no i think there is more to learn here than that now we know from the inside out what our spell does or some of what it does if our next version is not better on account of that i shall be surprised the method was drastic but the lesson is worthwhile aye ilmarinen repeated the lagoan mage has the right of it he glanced over at fernao accidents will happen fernao smiled and nodded as if at a compliment ilmarinen glared at him which was exactly what he wanted every time a peasant sneaked into the woods and sought out the battered band of irregulars garivald was leading these days he almost wished the newcomer would go away hed heard a great many tales of woe some of them horrible enough to move him close to tears how could he resist bringing such people into the band he couldnt but what if one of them was lying what do i do he asked obilot let in the wrong man or woman and the grelzers will know everything about us a day later if we dont get new blood they wont care about us one way or the other she answered if we didnt take chances none of us would be irregulars in the first place garivald grunted that held an unpleasant amount of truth but he said its not on your shoulders its on my shoulders and youre one of the people who helped dump it there he glowered at her with none of the interest none of the liking why lie none of the desire he usually felt obilot met the glare with a shrug munderic got killed somebody had to lead us why not you thanks to your songs people have heard your name they want to join garivald the songmakers band but i dont want to lead them garivald said in a sort of whispered scream i never wanted to lead anybody all i ever wanted to do was raise a decent crop and stay drunk through the winter and lately make songs thats all curse it i wanted this and that too obilot said the algarvians made sure i wouldnt have any of that shed never said just why shed joined the irregulars but she hated the redheads with a passion that made what her male comrades felt toward them seem mere mild distaste by comparison and now you cant have the things you always wanted either isnt that one more reason to want to do everything you can to make them suffer i suppose so he admitted but it doesnt mean i want to lead besides we arent strong enough to do anything much right now we will be obilot sounded more confident than garivald felt he didnt have to answer rain had been falling steadily for a while now lightning flashed and thunder bellowed drowning out anything he might have said nobody could do anything much in such weather the grelzers couldnt push into the woods as they had when snow lay on the ground but the band of irregulars couldnt very well sally forth by squelching through the mud after another peal of thunder rumbled and subsided obilot said would you rather be taking orders from sadoc thats not fair garivald answered though he couldnt have said why it wasnt as a matter of fact he had no desire whatever to take orders from sadoc the idea scared him worse than going up against the algarvians in battle but no one had proposed the inept wouldbe mage to succeed munderic no one had proposed garivald either or not exactly people had just looked at him they hadnt looked at anyone else and so the job ended up his but the irregulars couldnt very well stay holed up in the woods forever either a fellow named razalic came up to garivald while the rain was still falling and said you know boss were almost out of food aye garivald agreed not altogether happily wed better pay a call on one of those villages outside the forest maybe on more than one of them some of the peasant villages in these parts collaborated with the irregulars and gave them grain and meat others had firstmen who worked hand in glove with the grelzer authorities and with their algarvian puppet masters but when garivald led a couple of dozen men out of the woods he found the peasants from even the friendliest villages imperfectly delighted to see him hed expected nothing better early spring was the hungry time of year for everybody living on the end of the supplies that had brought them through the winter the peasants had little left over to share with anyone what do you want us to do he asked the firstman of a hamlet named dargun dry up and blow away and leave you at the mercy of the redheads and the grelzer dogs who sniff their arses well no the firstman answered but he didnt sound pleased dont want the brats here to starve either though garivald set his hands on his hips he knew a trimmer when he heard one you cant have it both ways he said we cant farm and fight the algarvians at the same time that means weve got to get food from somewhere this is somewhere even to him though it looked like nowhere next to dargun zossen nothing out of the ordinary as villages went looked like a metropolis the firstmans sigh was close to a wail what i really wish is things were back the way they were before the war started then i wouldnt have to worry all the time then i wouldnt have to make hard choices that or something close to it had to be what he meant and what hard choices was he contemplating feeding the irregulars or betraying them to the soldiers who followed false king raniero that was one obvious possibility everything gets remembered garivald remarked keeping his tone casual aye thats so everything gets remembered when king swemmels inspectors come back to this part of the realm theyll know who did what even if something goes wrong with us somebody will tell them or do you think im wrong by the look the firstman gave him he was certainly loathsome regardless of whether he was right or wrong if the inspectors ever get this far again the fellow said munderic would have blustered and bellowed garivald pulled a knife from his belt and started cleaning dirt from under his fingernails with the point chance you take he agreed doing his best to stay mild but if you think the inspectors arent ever coming back you never should have started feeding us in the first place the firstman bit his lip curse you he muttered you dont make things easy do you aye i want the algarvians out but but you dont want to do anything to make that happen garivald finished and the firstman bit his lip again garivald went on youre not fighting fair enough not everybody can fight but if you wont fight and you wont help the folk who are fighting what good are you curse you the firstman repeated his voice weary hopeless it almost doesnt matter who wins the stinking war whoever it is we lose take what you need you would anyhow back before the algarvians had hauled him out of zossen garivald hadnt felt much different hed just wished the war would go away and leave him and his alone but it hadnt worked like that it wouldnt work like that here in dargun either along with his irregulars and several pack mules borrowed from the village he trudged toward the woods one peasant from dargun came along too to lead the mules back after they werent needed anymore the mules were heavily laden with sacks of beans and barley and rye so were the men as heavily laden as they could manage and still walk through the mud garivald his back bent and creaking didnt want to think about what would happen if a grelzer patrol came across them because he didnt want to think about it he had trouble thinking about anything else more irregulars met them at the edge of the woods and took the sacks the mules carried the peasant headed off to dargun garivald wondered if he should have kept him behind munderic might have but garivald didnt see much point to it everybody knew the irregulars denned somewhere in this forest the peasant wouldnt find out where as far as garivald could see that meant he was no great risk when he got back to the clearing the irregulars had reclaimed after the grelzer raiders left the wood he expected applause from the men and women who hadnt gone along to bring in the supplies after all hed done what he set out to do if anything hed done better than he expected they wouldnt have to worry about food again for two or three weeks maybe even a month and indeed people were staring at him and the men he led as they came into the clearing among the people staring were a couple of men garivald had never seen before he wondered if he ought to shrug the beans off his back and grab for his stick but the irregulars who hadnt gone out to dargun seemed to take the newcomers for granted they wouldnt have if theyd thought the strangers meant trouble obilot came up to one of those strangers and pointed toward garivald thats our leader she said her voice not loud but very clear a couple of the other irregulars nodded garivald straightened with pride despite the weight he carried both newcomers strode toward him they had on rockgray tunics at first that meant little to him a lot of the men in his band still wore the ever more threadbare clothes theyd used while serving in king swemmels army but these tunics werent threadbare they werent particularly clean but they were new garivald didnt need long to realize what that meant he let the sacks of beans down to the ground and stuck out his hand you must be real soldiers he exclaimed the two men looked at each other hes quick one of them said aye he is the other agreed thats efficient but by the way one of his thick eyebrows rose he might have thought garivald too quick for his own good wonderful to see real soldiers here garivald said he knew the real fighting still lay far to the west which led to an obvious question what are you doing here being efficient the unkerlanter soldiers spoke together the one who might have thought garivald too efficient continued weve brought you a crystal have you now garivald wondered how efficient that was can i keep it activated without have to sacrifice somebody every month or two the way a mage had to do back in my home village before the soldiers could answer sadocs big head bobbed up and down aye you can he said theres a power point in these woods not a very big one but its there if it wasnt i couldnt work any magecraft at all in garivalds view that would have been an improvement but he didnt say so instead he gave a sharp quick nod and turned back to the soldiers all right i guess i can run a crystal now what will i do with it whatever his majestys officers tell you to do by the powers above answered the one whod mentioned the crystal were getting these things out to as many bands behind the algarvian line as we can the more you people work with the regular army the more efficient the fight against the redheads becomes that made a certain amount of sense it also fit in with everything garivald knew about king swemmel he wanted control as firmly in his fists as he could make it the other unkerlanter soldier said well also bring you weapons and medicines whenever we can good im glad to hear it we can use them garivald eyed the two regulars and youll tell us what to do whenever you can they looked at each other for a moment then they both nodded well of course they said together bembo walked up to sergeant pesaro in the constabulary barracks and said sergeant i want some leave time pesaro looked him up and down i want all sorts of things im not going to get the fat sergeant said after a while i get over it and go about my business youd better do the same or youll be sorry have a heart bembo exclaimed not a plea likely to win success when aimed at a superior i havent been back to tricarico in forever nobodys got out of forthweg in a demon of a long time its not fair its not right pesaro opened a drawer of the desk behind which he sat here he handed bembo a form a form for requesting leave bembo saw fill this out give it back to me and ill pass it on up the line and itll bloody well get ignored the way every other leaverequest form gets ignored its not fair bembo repeated lifes not fair pesaro answered if you dont believe me go dye your hair blond and see what looking like a kaunian gets you they arent taking many leave requests from soldiers and they arent taking any from constables but if you want to volunteer to go fight in unkerlant so you have a little chance of getting leave ive got a form for that too he made as if to reach into the desk drawer again never mind bembo said hastily i feel better about things already compared to leave in tricarico patrolling the streets of gromheort wasnt so good compared to fighting bloodthirsty unkerlanter maniacs it wasnt so bad there you see pesaros round jowly face radiated as much goodwill as a sergeants face was ever likely to show but he didnt keep on beaming for long the scowl that spread over his countenance was much more in character what in blazes are you doing now filling out the leave form bembo answered doing just that you never can tell lightning might strike lightningll strike you pesaro rumbled but he waited till bembo finished checking boxes and he didnt throw the form in the wastebasket by the desk in fact he read through it whats this his coppery eyebrows leaped up i want to start a family you son of a whore youre not married sergeant you dont have to be married to do what it takes to start a family bembo was the picture the implausible picture but the picture nonetheless of innocence pesaro snorted if you think his majesty is going to ship you back to tricarico so you can get your ashes hauled youve been chewing on zuwayzi hashish you know where the brothels are in town its not the same in a brothel bembo complained no you have to pay for it pesaro looked down at the form again his shoulders shook with silent laughter beside how do you know youd get laid if you did go back to tricarico its not like you even had a girlfriend there or anything that really hurt not least because it was true sergeant bembo said reproachfully but sergeant pesaro lost patience not something of which hed ever had any great supply enough he growled too fornicating much get your arse out on the street ill send the stinking form up the line just dont hold your breath waiting for a leyline caravan ticket back to tricarico thats all to add insult to injury he started eating one of the flaky manylayered pastries full of honey and nuts in which forthweg specialized he didnt offer bembo any stomach gurgling head full of a sense of injustice that would have been worse still if he hadnt paused to contemplate the idea of going to unkerlant bembo stomped out of the barracks he couldnt even complain to oraste his partner was nursing a sprained ankle and couldnt walk his beat for a few days on reflection bembo decided that wasnt so bad hed met a lot of people more sympathetic than oraste had he met anybody less sympathetic he wasnt so sure about that even early in the morning the day was fine and mild he didnt mind gromheorts weather which wasnt much different from tricaricos now that winter had given way to spring the rain had pretty much stopped before long he would be sweating and glad of his broadbrimmed hat to keep his face from burning forthwegians on their way to work and to gromheorts market square crowded the streets men wore kneelength tunics women garments that reached almost to their ankles bembo wondered how many of them were kaunians in sorcerous disguise he couldnt do anything about that not by himself not unless somebodys features changed right before his eyes just before he rounded a corner he heard raucous hoots and jeers when he did round it he spied a bright blond head coming his way as the woman drew closer he realized the forthwegians werent raising an uproar only because she was a kaunian seeing her made him want to raise an uproar himself she was young and pretty and wore a tunic of transparent green silk while her trousers might have been painted onto her hips and haunches display all the more startling in a land where most almost all women didnt try to show off their shapes she stopped in front of bembo letting him look her up and down the way she looked at him was half respectful half as if he were something nasty shed found on the sole of her shoe he tried to keep his voice brisk but couldnt help coughing a couple of times before saying youll have a pass i expect aye constable of course i do she answered in good algarvian hed expected that too she opened out her belt pouch took out a folded sheet of paper and handed it to him doldasai daughter of daukantis he read and the kaunian woman nodded the pass did indeed allow her out of the kaunian quarter when and as she chose for all practical purposes it made her an honorary forthwegian the price shed paid to get it was obvious enough aye ive seen you before bembo said handing the paper back to her he smiled ive always been glad when i have too doldasai made sure of the precious pass before answering him i am a woman for officers you know her voice also held that mixture of respect and contempt he was an algarvian so she couldnt ignore him as she had the jeering forthwegians but the pass proved she had powerful protectors and he realized a moment later he was a man like a lot of courtesans she likely despised his whole sex he said im keeping my hands to myself to prove as much he clasped them behind his back dressed the way you are though you cant expect me not to look i am a kaunian in forthweg doldasai said how can i possibly expect anything she didnt even sound bitter just very tired bembo said powers above if you dont like the life youre living why dont you get your hands on the charm that makes you people look like forthwegians then you could just disappear doldasai stared at him perhaps for the first time noticing the person inside the uniform you say this she asked you say this a constable of algarve you tell me to break the law your own people made she dug a finger in one ear as if to be sure she heard correctly her nails were carefully trimmed and painted the color of blood i did say it didnt i bembo spoke in some surprise maybe by doing something like that for her he could take a tiny step toward making up for all the kaunians hed forced into their tiny district or simply sent west maybe too hed just been staring at the pinktipped breasts so plainly visible through the thin silk of her tunic he shrugged now that the words were out of his mouth he made the best of them you could do it you know whod be the wiser curse you she muttered in classical kaunian before going back to bembos language every time i steel myself to see you algarvians as nothing but pricks with legs one of you has to go and remind me youre people too she set a hand on his arm not provocatively but in a friendly way kind of you to say that kind of you to think that but i cant why not bembo asked seems like about every third kaunian around has already done it more for all i know doldasai nodded true but your folk dont hold hostage the parents of most kaunians in gromheort they have way to make sure of my good behavior and so you see i cant just disappear thats bembo didnt want to say what he thought it was he could hardly denounce his own officers to a woman whose looks proclaimed her an enemy of algarve what he did say was tell me where theyre at and ill see if i cant get em moved into the regular kaunian district after that well if you look like everybody else around these parts whos going to ask any questions now the kaunian courtesan frankly gaped you would do that for a blond she didnt make him answer she might have been afraid of the result she might have been wise to be afraid too instead she hurried on if you do that if you can do that ill give you anything you want she shrugged bembo watched entranced she said what difference would one more time make especially if it was the last if you think ill go all noble and say you dont have to do that sweetheart youre daft bembo said doldasai nodded she understood such deals bembo went on now where are they theyre quartered in count brordas castle the place where your governor rules now she answered their names are daukantis and feliksai bembo started to say he didnt care what their names were but then realized knowing might be useful instead he asked do you know whereabouts they are in the castle aye doldasai told him he made her repeat it so he had it straight she did and then said powers above bless you for you to do such a thing he reached out and caressed her she let him do it believe me sweetheart i know why he told her and im not going to risk my neck for theirs either he thought if its easy fine if its not i copped a feel anyhow aloud he went on there are rooms above a tavern called the imperial unicorn a couple of blocks inside the kaunian district you know the place her eyes showed she did bembo said wait for me there well see what i can do and well see what you can do back in algarve the great stone pile that lay at the center of gromheort would have been labeled quaint here in forthweg the adjectives chilly ugly and gloomy more readily sprang to mind soldiers and bureaucrats bustled this way and that nobody bothered noticing a plump redheaded constable to bembos vast relief the sentry in front of daukantis and feliksais door was a soldier hed never seen before not a fellow constable with a nasty smile he said ive come for these kaunian buggers theyre going straight back in with the rest of their stinking kind very possibly nobodyd told the sentry why the blonds were being held he didnt argue he didnt make bembo sign anything or ask his name and authority he just grinned wolfishly opened the door and said theyre all yours good riddance to em no one paid any attention to a constable marching a couple of kaunians along in front of his stick either once bembo got them out of the castle he murmured now they dont have a hold on your daughter any more they gaped and then started to weep that was nothing out of the ordinary either at the edge of the kaunian quarter another constable waved to bembo and called caught a couple did you you lucky whoreson bembo waved his hat with typical algarvian braggadocio like the ancient kaunian empire the tavern called the imperial unicorn was a sad shadow of its former self bembo took doldasais father and mother upstairs she was pacing the narrow hallway there she looked from bembo to feliksai and daukantis and back again in astonished disbelief you really did it she whispered and then flew into her parents arms bargain bembo said pointedly bargain doldasai agreed she took her mother and father into one of the little rooms then came out and took bembo into another one for what you just did you deserve the best she said and proceeded to give it to him if she didnt enjoy it herself too she was a better actress than any courtesan hed known her pleasure might have been set off more by her parents rescue than his charms but he thought it real even so and his own pleasure as he left the kaunian district was more than merely physical he hadnt quite done a good deed for the sake of doing a good deed but hed come a lot closer than usual close enough to leave his conscience as happy as the rest of him which was saying a great deal come on boys get yourselves ready major spinello told the troopers in his regiment weve been kicking the unkerlanters arses for almost two years now well go right on doing it too wont we the algarvian soldiers cheered some of them waved their sticks in the air what a liar im turning into spinello thought he hadnt told a lie or not exactly if his countrymen hadnt won victory after victory he and the regiment wouldnt have been here deep in northern unkerlant but swemmels men could kick too every time he took off his tunic to bathe the puckered scar on the right side of his chest reminded him of the truth there had that beam caught him in the left side of the chest it wouldnt have left a scar it would have killed him outright and the unkerlanter campaign against sulingen had come too close to killing all the algarvian armies in the southern part of king swemmels domain it hadnt though like spinello theyd been badly scarred like him too they kept battling all right then he told his men well go forward for king mezentio powers above bless him and well go forward because there arent any unkerlanters on the face of the earth who can stop us he got more cheers from the men even some of his officers applauded captain turpino didnt look altogether convinced turpino in fact looked about to be ill he didnt lead with speeches he was always at the head of his company when an attack went in and that seemed to be enough for him spinello led from the front too but he remained convinced that getting the most from his soldiers was also a sorcery of the sort the universities didnt teach to mages just before spinello could give the command that would send his men forward a rider on a lathered horse came up calling his name i am spinello he said drawing himself up to his full if not very impressive height what would you be quick we are about to attack i have orders for you sir and for your regiment the messenger opened a leather tube he wore on his belt and took out a roll of paper bound with a ribbon and a wax seal from army headquarters i see that spinello said brigade headquarters would have been much less formal he took the orders and used his thumbnail to crack the seal then unrolled the paper and quickly read it even before hed finished he started to curse whats wrong sir turpino asked we are not going to stamp the unkerlanters into the dust today spinello answered what his men howled furious protests dont they think were good enough well lick em a plague on the unkerlanters and another one on our generals you have your men very ready for action the messenger observed whats gone wrong sir captain turpino had he assumed something had and spinello could hardly blame him for that spinello had thought something was wrong too till hed gone all the way through the orders as things were he said nothing captain it is if you like even a compliment he passed the paper to turpino so the senior company commander could see for himself spinello addressed the regiment as a whole we are withdrawn from the line for rest refit and reinforcements this because of our outstanding fighting qualities as the general heading up the army says in so many words they want us in very top shape before they throw us into battle again so we can do the enemy as much harm as possible aye thats what it says turpino agreed it also says were going to get sent south when the refits done spinello nodded that looks to be where the war will be won or lost i say that because having fought there i see the difference between that part of the front and this one here we go forward or we go back and not a whole lot changes either way there there they take whole armies off the board when things go wrong theyve gone wrong for us and the unkerlanters both next time by the powers above i want em going wrong for swemmels men and we can help make that happen his men clapped their hands a few of them tossed their hats in the air the messenger saluted spinello sir youve got them eating out of the palm of his hand do i spinello looked at the palm in question grinning he wiped it on his kilt ive been wondering why it was wet the messenger snorted spinello turned back to his troops form up you lugs some other lucky fellows get the joy of fighting unkerlanters here poor us we have to face baths and barbers and beds and brothels i dont know how well be able to manage it but for the sake of the kingdom we have to try you are a mountebank turpino said as spinello led his soldiers out of the line sir his voice held nothing but admiration a new regiment came up the dirt road to replace spinellos it looked to be a very new regiment with plump wellfed men wearing clean uniforms do your mothers know youre here one of spinellos scrawny veterans called that set off an avalanche of jeering the raw troops smiled nervously and kept marching they didnt jeer back which only proved they didnt know what they were getting into stay awake spinello told his men keep an eye skinned for dragons i think weve got enough holes in the ground to dive into if we have to that drew more laughter from the veterans the landscape like most landscapes that had seen a lot of fighting was a jumble of craters and old halfcollapsed trenches and foxholes spinello bunched his fingertips and kissed them aye unkerlant is beautiful in the springtime hed hoped for a leyline caravan ride back to goldap the unkerlanter town the algarvians used for a rest center and replacement depot but swemmels men had sabotaged the ley line and the algarvian mages were still working to repair the damage that meant three days of marching through mud for the regiment once they got into goldap soldiers exclaimed at how large and fine it was maybe they were from little farms and had no idea what a city was supposed to be like maybe and more likely theyd been out in the field too long so that any place with several streets worth of buildings standing seemed impressive spinello got them billeted and queued up at a bathhouse next door to the barracks before seeking army headquarters to report his presence though normally fastidious indeed more than a bit of a dandy he didnt bother cleaning up first if he brought the smell of the front with him then he did that was all and if he brought a few fleas and lice with him too well the officers here had a better chance of getting rid of them than somebody who spent all his time fighting as spinello had expected the lieutenant to whom he first announced his presence wrinkled his nose and did his best not to breathe but the colonel to whom the lieutenant conducted him only smiled and said major about every third officer who visits me tries to show me how dreadful things are up at the front i know it for myself believe me spinello eyed the decorations the colonel wore they included a couple of medals for gallantry a pair of wound badges and what the troops called the frozenmeat medal marking service in unkerlant the first winter of the war against swemmel perhaps you do sir spinello admitted but you might have been someone just in from trapani too in which case youdve made me feel guilty for being clean and safe eh the colonel said id be angrier at you if i hadnt played those games every now and again too as things are im trying to arrange another field command for myself i hope you get one sir spinello said anybody can be a hero back here youve shown you can do it where it counts the colonel rose from his chair so he could bow you are too kind he murmured and you have made a respectable name for yourself as a combat soldier i might add if you hadnt we would have left you here in a sector where nothing much ever happens as things are youll serve the kingdom where it really matters good hearing himself sound so fierce spinello started to laugh can you believe sir that before this war started i was more interested in the archaeology and literature of the kaunian empire than in how to outflank a fortified position life is to live life is to enjoy till duty calls the colonel answered me i was a beekeeper some of the honeys my hives turned out won prizes at agricultural shows all over algarve now though i have to pay attention to behemoths not bees i understand spinello said if theyre sending us south does that mean we aim to have another go at durrwangen once the ground really gets hard i cant tell you for a fact major because i dont know the colonel said but if you can read a map i expect youll draw certain conclusions i would now major spinello bowed i think youve answered me sir where am i to pick up the drafts of men who will bring my regiment to full strength weve taken over a couple of what used to be hostels down the street from the caravan depot the colonel replied at the moment weve got a brigade just in from occupation duty in jelgava three companies have your name on them speak with one of the officers there theyll take care of you if they dont send them on to me and ill take care of them he sounded as if he relished the prospect spinello laughed again from jelgava eh poor bastards theyll be wondering what in blazes hit em and then they go down south powers above they wont enjoy that much i hope theyll be able to fight theyll manage the other algarvian officer said this past winter we had a brigade from valmiera get out of its caravan in a blizzard in a depot the unkerlanters were attacking right that minute they gave swemmels men a prime boot in the balls good for them spinello clapped his hands together may we do the same aye may you indeed the colonel agreed meanwhile though go collar your new men make sure the ones you already have are able to climb into their caravan cars day after tomorrow well try not to halt em at a depot where they have to fight their way off generous of you sir spinello said saluting ill do everything you told me just as you said i wont be sorry to go down south again he reached up and touched his own wound badge i owe the unkerlanters down there a little something that i do and you believe in paying your debts the colonel asked every one of them sir spinello answered solemnly every single one with interest hello there ealstan said to the doorman at ethelhelms block of flats i got a message he wanted to see me he didnt bother hiding his distaste he wished he hadnt come at all but had ignored the band leader and singer who couldnt break with the algarvians and then the doorman said you got a message from whom sir ealstan stared this fellow had been letting him into the building for months so he could cast the singers accounts had he suddenly gone soft in the head why from ethelhelm of course he answered ah the doorman nodded and looked wise i thought that might be whom you meant sir but i must tell you that gentleman no longer resides here oh really ealstan said and the doorman nodded again ealstan asked did he leave a forwarding address no sir now the doorman shook his head his cultured veneer slipped why do you want to know did he skip out owing you money too too ealstan thought but he also shook his head no as a matter of fact we were square but why did he ask me to come here if he knew he was going to disappear maybe he didnt know the doorman said he just up and left a couple of days ago all kinds of people have been looking for him he sighed powers above you should see some of the women whove been looking for him if they were looking for me id make cursed sure they found me i would i believe that ealstan decided to risk a somewhat more dangerous question have the algarvians come looking for him too havent they just the doorman exclaimed more of those buggers than you can shake a stick at and this one redheaded piece his hands described an hourglass in the air her kilt was so short i dont hardly know why she bothered wearing it at all he made a chopping motion at his own kneelength tunic just below crotch level to show what he meant vanai had talked about seeing algarvian women in the baths ealstan had no interest in them he wondered what ethelhelm had wanted and what the musician was doing now whatever it was he hoped ethelhelm would manage to do it far from the algarvians eyes aloud he said well the crows take him for making me come halfway across town for nothing if he ever wants me again i expect he knows where to find me he turned and left the block of flats with a little luck ill never see it again he thought someone had scrawled penda and freedom on a wall not far from ethelhelms building ealstan nodded when he saw that he hadnt felt particularly free when penda still ruled forthweg but he hadnt had standards of comparison then either king mezentios men had given him some he saw the slogan again half a block later that made him nod even more new graffiti always pleased him they were signs he wasnt the only one who despised the algarvian occupiers he hadnt seen so many since the spate of scribbles crowing about sulingen the redheads curse them had proved they werent going to fold up and die in unkerlant after all when an algarvian constable came round the corner ealstan picked up his pace and walked past the new scribble without turning his head toward it he must have succeeded in keeping his face straight too because the constable didnt reach for his club or growl at him im well rid of ethelhelm anyhow ealstan thought hed found a couple of new clients who between them paid almost as much as the musician had and who didnt threaten to disappoint him with a friendship that would turn sour his father had been friendly with his clients but hadnt made friends with them now ealstan saw the difference between those two and the reason for it not far from the leyline caravan depot a work gang was clearing rubble where an unkerlanter egg had burst some of the laborers the forthwegians among them looked like pickpockets and petty thieves let out of gaol so the algarvians could get some work from them the rest were trousered kaunians taken out of their district ealstan hadnt seen so many blond heads all together for a long time he wondered why the kaunian men hadnt dyed their hair and used vanais spell to help themselves disappear into the forthwegian majority maybe they just hadnt got the chance he hoped that was it or maybe they didnt want to believe what the algarvians were doing with and to their people as if not believing it made it less true the forthwegians werent working any harder than they had to every so often one of the redheads overseeing the job would yell at them sometimes they picked up a little sometimes they didnt once an algarvian whacked one of them in the seat of his tunic with a club that produced a yelp a few curses and a little more work the kaunians in the gang though labored like men possessed ealstan understood that and wished he didnt the forthwegians would sooner have been sitting in a cell but if the kaunians didnt work hard theyd go west and never ever come back their lives depended on convincing the algarvians they were worth their keep a forthwegian passing by called hey you kaunians when a couple of the blonds looked up he drew his finger across his throat and made horrible gurgling noises then he threw back his head and laughed so did the algarvian strawbosses so did about half the forthwegian laborers the kaunians for some reason didnt seem to find the joke so funny and ealstan had to walk on by without even cursing his loutish countryman he didnt dare do anything that would draw the occupiers notice his own fate was of no great concern to him without him though how would vanai manage he didnt want her to have to find out at the doorway to the flat he gave the coded knock he always used vanai opened the door to let him in after they kissed they both said the same thing at the same time ive got news laughing they pointed to each other and said the same thing at the same time again you first all right ealstan said and told vanai of ethelhelms disappearance he finished i dont know where hes gone i dont know what hes doing and i dont much care not anymore maybe he even listened to me maybe hes gone off to find some quiet little place in the country where nobody will care where he came from or what he used to do as long as he pulls his weight maybe vanai said that would be easier for him if he didnt look as if he had kaunian blood of course maybe someone got my spell to him maybe somebody did ealstan said for his sake i hope somebody did it would make things easier he paused then remembered he wasnt the only one with something on his mind he pointed at vanai and asked whats your news im going to have a baby she answered ealstan gaped he didnt know what hed expected her to say whatever it was that wasnt it for a couple of seconds he couldnt think of anything to say what did come out was a foolish question are you sure vanai laughed in his face of course i am she answered i have a perfectly good way to tell you know i was pretty sure a month ago theres no room for doubt now not anymore all right he mumbled his cheeks and ears heated talk of such intimate details embarrassed him you surprised me did i vanai raised an eyebrow im not surprised not really or rather the only thing i am surprised about is that it took so long to happen weve been busy he heard her but he wasnt really paying much attention to what she said a baby i dont know anything about taking care of babies do you not really she said we can learn though people do if they didnt there wouldnt be any more people well have to think of a name ealstan said and then added two names remembering it might be either boy or girl well have to do all sorts of things he had no idea what most of them were but vanai was right he could learn hed have to learn a baby he walked past his wife into the kitchen opened a jar of red wine and poured two cups full then he went out to vanai handed her one and raised the other in salute they both drank vanai yawned im sleepy all the time thats another thing thats supposed to be a sign is it ealstan shrugged a shrug meant to show ignorance id noticed you were but i didnt think it meant anything well it does she said you sleep as much as you can beforehand because you wont sleep once the babys born that makes sense ealstan agreed a baby he kept saying the words he believed them but in a different sense he had trouble believing them my mother and father will be grandparents my sister will be an aunt he started to mention his brother also started and then stopped leofsig was dead he still had trouble believing that too vanais mind was going down the same ley line my grandfather would be a greatgrandfather she said and sighed and he would grumble about miscegenation and halfbreeds as long as he lived ealstan hadnt cared about that he didnt think his family would either oh there was uncle hengist sidrocs father but ealstan wasnt going to waste any worry on him the baby will be fine he said as long as he didnt break off quite soon enough vanai thought along with him again as long as algarve loses the war she said and ealstan had to nod she went on but what if algarve doesnt lose what if the babys looks show it has kaunian blood will we have to make magic over it two or three times a day till it can make magic for itself will it have to make magic for itself for the rest of its life algarve cant win ealstan declared though he knew no certain reason why not the redheads seemed convinced they could but vanai didnt contradict him she wanted to believe that as much as he did more than he did let me get supper ready she said it wont be anything fancy just bread and cheese and olives that will be fine ealstan said the way the redheads are stealing from us were lucky to have that were lucky we can afford it thats not luck vanai answered thats because you do good work youre sweet ealstan hurried over to her and gave her another kiss i love you she said theyd both been speaking forthwegian they almost always did these days suddenly though she switched to kaunian i want the child to learn this language too to know both sides of its family all right ealstan replied also in kaunian i think that would be very good he was pleased he could bring the words out quickly he pulled out a chair for vanai if it is cheese and olives and bread you sit down i can fix that for us more often than not she didnt want him messing about in the kitchen now with a yawn she said thank you after a moment she added you speak kaunian well im glad ealstan of course hadnt learned it as his birthspeech hed acquired it from schoolmasters whod stimulated his memory with a switch even so he told the truth when he answered i am glad too cornelus leviathan heartily approved of swimming south and west toward the outlet of the narrow sea to the waters just off the coast of the land of the ice people hed expected nothing different eforiel the leviathan hed ridden for king burebistu of sibiu had also liked to make this journey the tiny plants and animals that fed bigger ones flourished in the cold water off the austral continent the leviathan cared nothing for tiny plants and animals whales fed on those sieving them up with baleen but the squid and mackerel and tunny that swarmed where food was so thick delighted the leviathan delighted it so much that cornelu sometimes had trouble persuading it to go where he wanted come on you stubborn thing he exclaimed in exasperation more affectionate than otherwise plenty of nice fish for you to eat over here too despite taps and prods the beast didnt want to obey him if it decided to go off on its own and eat itself fat what could he do every so often a leviathanrider went out on a mission that looked easy and was never seen again eventually and in fact well before he could go from exasperated to alarmed the leviathan decided there might be good eating in the direction he chose too that didnt mean cornelu could take it easy and not worry on the ride algarvian warships prowled the ley lines that ran south from occupied sibiu algarvian leviathans swam in these seas too and algarvian dragons flew overhead every day was longer than the one that had gone before and the farther south the leviathan swam the longer the sun stayed in the heavens at high summer daylight never ceased on the austral continent the season hadnt come to that yet but it wasnt far away ice floating in the sea foretold the presence of the austral continent first relatively small relatively scattered chunks then bergs that loomed up out of the water like sculpted mountains of blue and green and white and bulked ever so much larger below the surface of the ocean somehow leviathans could sense those great masses of underwater ice without seeing them and never collided with them cornelu wished he knew how his beast managed that but the finest veterinary mages were as baffled as he in winter the sea itself froze solid for miles out from the shore of the land of the ice people the icebergs cornelu passed broke off from the main mass as sea and air warmed when the sun swung south in the sky once more he and his leviathan had to thread their way through channels in the ice to the little settlement kuusaman and lagoan sorcerers had established east of mizpah on the long headland that jutted out toward the island the two kingdoms shared a kuusaman mage in a rowboat came out to bring cornelu the last couple of hundred yards to shore very good to see you the kuusaman said in classical kaunian the only language they proved to have in common he introduced himself as leino very good to see anyone who is not a familiar face as a matter of fact all the familiar faces have become much too familiar if you know what i mean i think i do cornelu answered i suspect you would be even happier to see me if i were a goodlooking woman especially if you were my wife the kuusaman said but pekka has her own sorcerous work and i know as little about what she is doing as she knows about what goes on here what does go on here cornelu looked at the miserable collection of huts and camelhide tents on the mainland why would anyone in his right mind want to come here leino grinned at him you make assumptions that may not be justified you know the mage might smile and joke but didnt answer the question cornelu knew he wasnt going to get much of an answer but he did want some why on earth did they have my leviathan bring you two large egg casings filled with sawdust no trees around these parts leino replied as the rowboat ran aground on a pebbly beach hard to get a ship through all these icebergs a leviathan can carry more than a dragon and so here you are here i am cornelu agreed in hollow tones here i may stay too unless you get me back to my leviathan before it swims off after food no worry there leino scrambled out of the boat we have a good binding spell on the sea hereabouts you are not the first leviathanrider to come here but not a one of them has been stranded fair enough cornelu got out of the boat too with rubber flippers still on his feet he was as awkward as a duck on land he persisted why sawdust why to mix with the ice of course leino replied as if that were the most obvious thing in the world we have plenty of ice here cornelu gave up he might hope for a straight answer but he could tell he wasnt going to get one he asked a different sort of question how do you keep yourselves fed leino seemed willing enough to answer that we buy reindeer and camel meat from the ice people his flat swarthy features twisted into a horrible grimace camel meat is pretty bad but at least the camel it comes from is dead live camels believe me commander you do not want to know about live camels and we blaze seals and sea birds every now and then they are not very good either to keep us from dying of scurvy the lagoans are generous enough to send us plenty of pickled cabbage by his expression he also didnt care for that cranberries fight scurvy too cornelu said do cranberries grow on this part of the austral continent nothing has grown on this part of the austral continent since i got here leino replied he looked around at the green sprouting up here and there i must admit i cannot be quite so sure about what will grow now see even these sorry things yield up a crop he pointed to the shelters from which emerged a couple of dozen other mages most were easy to type as either kuusamans or lagoans but six or eight could have been either and were in fact partly both such untidiness bothered cornelu in sibiu everyone was recognizably sibian he shrugged he couldnt do anything about it here whatever their blood the mages were friendly they gave cornelu smoked meat and sour cabbage and potent spirits leino hadnt mentioned some of them spoke algarvian in which he was more fluent than classical kaunian waving a slice of meat he said this stuff isnt so bad its got a flavor all its own thats one way to put it said a mage who looked like a kuusaman but spoke lagoan when he wasnt using algarvian or classical kaunian and do you know why its got that flavor because it was smoked over burning camel dung thats why youre joking but cornelu saw that the wizard wasnt he set down the meat and took a big swig of spirits once he had the spirits in his mouth he swished them around before swallowing as if cleaning his teeth in fact that was exactly what he was doing the mage laughed youve got to get used to eating things cooked with it if youre going to try and live in the land of the ice people there isnt much in the way of wood here if there were would you be bringing sawdust from lagoas you never can tell cornelu answered which made the mage laugh again well maybe not the fellow said some of those blockheads in setubal ought to be ground up for sawdust themselves if anybody wants to know what i think cornelu tried again now that you have all this sawdust what will you do with it mix it with ice the lagoan mage answered as leino had were trying to make cold drinks for termites you see thank you so very much the sibian exile said all that got him was still more laughter from the wizard are you feeling refreshed after your long journey here leino asked in classical kaunian when cornelu admitted he was the kuusaman mage asked then you will not mind if i row you out to sea again so you can summon your leviathan and so we can bring these casings full of sawdust to the shore whatever the mages wanted to do with the sawdust they were eager to get at it with a sigh cornelu got to his feet again after tasting the delicacies of the countryside here i suppose i can he answered the sooner he left the land of the ice people and its delicacies the happier he would be he didnt say anything about that the mages who were stuck down here at the bottom of the world couldnt leave no matter how much they wanted to leino handled the oars with ease a fisherman might have envied as he rowed he asked when you go back to setubal commander you will take letters with you aye if you and your comrades give them to me cornelu answered we will the kuusaman sighed the cursed censors will probably have to use their black ink and knives on them they have taken too many bites out of the letters my wife sends to me i can do nothing about that cornelus wife didnt write him letters the most he could say about her was that she hadnt betrayed him to the algarvians even after she started giving herself to them it wasnt enough it wasnt nearly enough leino let the rowboat drift to a stop this was about where i picked you up was it not i think so aye cornelu leaned out over the gunwale and slapped the water in the pattern that would summon his leviathan if it was anywhere close by he waited a couple of minutes then slapped again he got only a brief glimpse of the leviathans sinuously muscled shape before its snout broke the surface by the boat and sent water splashing up onto the two men in it still in his rubber suit cornelu didnt mind leino spluttered and said something in kuusaman that sounded pungent before returning to classical kaunian i think the beast did that on purpose i would not be a bit surprised if you were right cornelu answered leviathans seem to think people were made for their amusement he slid down into the sea and swam over to the leviathan after patting it and praising it for coming he undid the egg casings it carried under its belly and brought the two ropes over to leino the cases are of neutral buoyancy he said as he got back into the boat they will not pull you under leino made the ropes fast to the stern of the boat when the kuusaman mage started to row again he grunted they may not sink me but they are not light the shore looks a good deal farther away than it did when you were here before i gather you and your colleagues wanted a good deal of sawdust cornelu replied i still do not understand why you wanted it but you did and now you have it i hope you use it to confound algarve with the help of the powers above i think we may be able to oblige you leino took another stroke and grunted again assuming my arms do not fall out of their sockets between here and the beach that is would the work not go on either way cornelu asked as innocently as he could leino started to say something perhaps something sharp then checked himself and chuckled commander you are more dangerous than you look cornelu courteously inclined his head i hope so nine tears ran down vanais face shed just finished chopping up a particularly potent onion when someone knocked on the door to the flat as she hurried out of the kitchen whoever it was knocked again louder and more insistently fear blazed through her this wasnt just a knock this was liable to be the knock the one shed dreaded ever since coming to eoforwic opening up the call came in algarvianaccented forthwegian opening up or breaking down by powers above vanai wondered if she ought to leap out the window and hope she could end everything quickly the redheads wouldnt get the use of her life energy that way anyhow but shed just renewed the spell that disguised her kaunianity and she was carrying a child if that wasnt an expression of hope what was she unbarred the door and worked the latch the kilted algarvian in the hall had his fist upraised to knock again a couple of burly forthwegian constables flanked him like bookends he looked vanai up and down then said you are being thelberge wife to ealstan aye thats right more hope flowered in vanai if the algarvian called her by her forthwegian name he probably wasnt going to seize her for being a kaunian gathering courage she asked what do you want your husband is keeping books for ethelhelm the singing and drumming man ah vanai wouldnt let her knees shake with relief if that was why the redhead was here she could even tell the truth ealstan did keep books for ethelhelm aye but ethelhelm hasnt been his client since late winter but ealstan is going was going to seeing ethelhelm only a few days ago it wasnt a question maybe the algarvian had talked to the doorman at ethelhelms block of flats again vanai could tell the truth and did ethelhelm did send ealstan a note asking him to visit but when he went to ethelhelms block of flats he found ethelhelm had left the building he is knowing where the singing and drumming man is going has going no vanai said he was surprised when he found ethelhelm had gone from what he told me everyone was surprised when ethelhelm left thats the truth one of the forthwegian constables muttered you husband ealstan not hearing from ethelhelm since the algarvian asked no vanai repeated he doesnt want to hear from him either theyd fallen out i dont know what ethelhelm wanted with him and i dont want to find out either that was also true she recognized how craven it was but she didnt care she only wanted that algarvian to go away and to take his forthwegian henchmen with him and she got what she wanted the redhead swept off his hat and bowed to her all right pretty lady we going you seeing this ethelhelm item you hearing him you telling us we wanting him oh aye we wanting him you telling of course vanai answered a lie this time the algarvian and the two forthwegians tramped down the hall to the odorous stairwell vanai stood in the doorway and watched till they disappeared then she shut the door leaned against it and slid halfway to the ground as her knees did weaken with relief as she put the bar back on the door she realized what a narrow escape that had been ealstan and ethelhelm might have fallen out at any time if they had and if ethelhelm had disappeared not long afterwards mezentios men would have come around asking questions if theyd done it while she still looked like the kaunian she was she went back to the onion and threw it in the stew pot it still stung her eyes but she didnt feel like crying anymore not after shed had her disguise tested and shed won through to safety when ealstan got back that evening she told him about her adventure he held her and squeezed her and didnt say anything for a long time then he set the palm of his hand on her belly and murmured you are all right you are both all right vanai needed a moment to realize hed spoken kaunian she smiled and snuggled against him speaking forthwegian had always seemed safer and more and more lately it wasnt that ealstan was more at home in it than in kaunian that had always been true but when vanai wore thelberges seeming she put on all the trappings that went with being thelberge including her language as he had when she told him she would have a baby he went into the kitchen and came back with two cups of wine to freedom he said also in classical kaunian and she happily drank to that he probably assumed they would make love after supper vanai assumed the same thing theyd spent a lot of evenings doing that both back in the days before she could leave the flat and afterwards her own left hand went to her belly as she spooned up more beanandbarley soup with grated cheese and a couple of marrow bones if they hadnt she wouldnt have had a baby growing in there she yawned she wouldnt have been so tired all the time either when they were done eating she went out to the sofa and lay down the next thing she knew ealstan was shaking her awake come on he said time and past time to go on into the bedchamber ive washed the dishes and put them away you have vanai said astonished why what time is it by way of answer ealstan pointed to their windows which faced toward the southwest they framed the firstquarter moon now sinking down toward the horizon he spelled out what that meant getting on toward midnight but it cant be vanai exclaimed as if hed somehow tricked her cheated her i just came out here to rest for a few minutes and and you started to snore ealstan said i wasnt going to bother you but i didnt think youd want to spend the whole night here oh now vanai sounded sheepish it caught me again she yawned again too am i going to stay asleep till the babys born ealstan grinned at her maybe you ought to hope you will i dont know much about what women do while theyre expecting but you were the one who said you wouldnt get much sleep after the babys here that was indeed all too likely to be true vanai got up cleaned her teeth changed into a light linen tunic and lay down in bed beside ealstan he went to sleep right away she tossed and turned for a while she was used to sleeping on her belly but her breasts were too tender for that to be comfortable she curled up on her side and it was morning she rolled over ealstan wasnt there noise from the kitchen told where hed gone she went out there herself he was dipping bread into olive oil and sipping from a cup of wine hello there he said cheerfully and got up and gave her a quick kiss shall i fix you some would you please vanai laughed a small nervous laugh i didnt have any trouble keeping supper down lets hope i do all right with this too you havent been too bad that way ealstan said cutting her a chunk of bread adding oil to the dipping bowl and pouring wine thats easy for you to say vanai answered some women shed heard got morning sickness right away and kept on having it till their babies were born she didnt know how long shed keep having hers of course but she didnt have it all the time ealstan was right about that even a couple of meals disastrously lost though were plenty to make her wary about food this morning everything seemed willing to stay down shed almost finished when ealstan said your spell just slipped did it vanai raised a hand to her face that was foolish she couldnt feel any change in her looks any more than she could see one ealstan reached across the table and stroked her cheek too aye it did he answered eyeing her thats the face i fell in love with you know youre sweet vanai said its also the face that could ruin everything if anybody but you saw it she got the yellow and dark brown lengths of yarn out of her handbag twisted them together and chanted in classical kaunian one use for her own first language that would not go away when she finished she looked a question to ealstan he nodded now you look like my sister again i wish youd stop saying that vanai told him it was the wrong sort of family connection to have especially now that she was pregnant im sorry ealstan finished his wine if this cursed war ever ends if you and conberge ever get the chance to meet i think youll like each other i hope so vanai said she hoped with all her heart that his family would like her so far as she knew none of her own family was left alive after a moment she went on the one i truly want to meet is your father he made you what you are that first time we met in the woods you said kaunians are people too and that hed taught you that if more forthwegians thought that way i wouldnt have to worry about my magecraft i know hell like you ealstan told her hes bound to like you youre difficult am i vanai wasnt sure how to take that it sounded as if it wanted to be a compliment ealstan nodded dont you suppose the algarvians think youre difficult i never even learned that apothecarys name vanai said it didnt sound like a responsive answer but it was mezentios hounds had been one man away from learning whod devised the magic that let kaunians look like their forthwegian neighbors if the apothecary hadnt had a lethal dose ready to hand they might have torn the knowledge out of him she wondered what they would do to someone whod caused them so much trouble she shivered she was glad she didnt have to find out ealstan poured his cup half full of wine once more gulped it down and said im off ive got a couple of people whose accounts need casting and another fellow a friend of one of theirs might want to take me on at least to give his regular bookkeeper a hand pybba heads up one of the biggest pottery outfits in town which means one of the biggest ones in the kingdom hed pay well hed better or i wont work for him good vanai said i approve of money aye my father would like you will like you just fine ealstan said that youre mother to his grandchild wont hurt either he got up and brushed her lips with his she tasted the wine on them she stood too to give him a quick hug ill do what i can around the house she said and what i cant she shrugged and yawned ill curl up like a dormouse and sleep the day away why not ealstan said if ethelhelm comes knocking dont let him in you dont need to worry about that vanai said one of the reasons she approved of money was that it would let her bribe algarvians at need she never wanted to have to bribe them about her kaunianity that would leave her enslaved to them but some silver might make them stop asking her questions about the singer she hoped she wouldnt have to find out but she could try it if she had to through the winter the woods in the west of unkerlant had been quiet save for the sounds of men and mens magic with the coming of spring birdsongs burst out everywhere the very air took on a fresh green smell as the sap rose in untold millions of trees even some of the logs in front of the gyongyosian armys redoubts sprouted little leafy shoots but the gyongyosians stayed on the defensive one day szonyi came up to istvan and said sergeant the stars only know what kind of horrible scheme the unkerlanters are hatching over there he pointed east we ought to give em a good prod knock em back on their heels istvan shrugged we havent got any orders he shook his head no i take that back we have got orders to sit tight its foolishness szonyi insisted its worse than foolishness its going to get a lot of us killed he waved his arms in disgust the motion drew corporal kuns notice whats eating him he asked istvan as if szonyi werent there he wants to go out and kill things again istvan answered ah spectacles glinting in a shaft of sunlight kun turned to szonyi when was the last time we saw anything that looked like reinforcements i dont know szonyi said impatiently whats that got to do with anything if we attack and use up our men and dont get any new ones how long will it be before we havent got any men left at all kun asked as if to an idiot child i dont know that either szonyi said but if we sit here and dont do anything and let the unkerlanters build up and roll over us how long will it be before we havent got any men left that way he has a point istvan said he should wear a hat on it kun said istvan laughed at the former mages apprentice kun hated admitting that szonyi could score off him lajos who was on sentry duty called who comes that sent istvan and kun and szonyi and everybody else in the squad grabbing for sticks but the answer was immediate i captain tivadar come ahead sir lajos said and the men in the redoubt relaxed tivadar did sliding down into the trench behind the log barricade istvan hurried over to salute him what can we do for you today sir he asked not a thing carry on as you were his company commander replied i just came up to see how things were going were all right sir istvan said nothing much going on in front of us right now szonyi stirred but didnt say anything seeing him stir made istvan remark been a while since weve seen any new men up here sir we could use some this whole line could use some tivadar agreed dont hold your breath till we get them though or well have one more casualty to replace somethings gone wrong somewhere istvan spoke with the assurance of a man who had seen a great many things go wrong up till not very long ago we got well not everything we needed but enough to keep us going from day to day now stars above know i mean no disrespect to ekrekek arpad or anybody else but its like people have forgotten were here youre not far wrong tivadar answered things arent going so well out in the islands in the bothnian ocean im not giving away any great secrets when i tell you that the kuusamans keep biting them off one after another and were putting more and more soldiers into the ones we still hold we dont really have enough men to fight that campaign to the fullest and this one to the fullest at the same time by the stars a couple of years ago the kuusamans couldnt even throw us off obuda istvan exclaimed what have they done since and why havent we done anything about it kun asked a different but related question kuusamo is fighting us and algarve the same as were fighting them and unkerlant how is it that they can divide up their forces but we cant because corporal their fight with algarve is only a sham tivadar chose to answer kun they face our allies with ships and dragons but not with many men what soldiers they have in the fight they throw at us both our fronts are real thats true kun said and if the unkerlanters hit us hard here well fall down like a stoneblock house in an earthquake unkerlants got two fronts too istvan said and this is the one thats their sham tivadar nodded thats about the size of it sergeant we can grab chunks of their land here but thats the most we can do we cant take cottbus away from them and the algarvians might cottbus was only a name to istvan and not a name that seemed particularly real once when the fight in western unkerlant was new kun had calculated how long the gyongyosians would need to get to cottbus at the rate of advance theyd had then it had been years istvan remembered that how many three five he couldnt recall one thing seemed certain if his countrymen werent advancing toward cottbus at all theyd never get there that led to the next interesting question sir do you think well be able to hold what weve already taken from unkerlant the way things are now i mean well were still going to try sergeant sure as blazes tivadar replied the last time we talked about this i was pretty sure we could do it now itll be harder id be a liar if i said otherwise itll get harder still if we have to pull men out of the woods here so we can send them to fight on the islands but the unkerlanters have their troubles too well do our best the stars favor us szonyi said with the heavens smiling how can we lose tivadar walked over and slapped him on the back youre a good man with men like you in our army how can we lose just for a moment szonyi held out his left hand palm up and looked at the scar on it tivadar thumped him on the back again you heard what i said soldier i meant it szonyi stood straight and looked proud kun said how can we lose thats why people fight wars to find out how one side can lose szonyi started to get angry istvan took a deep breath casting about for the words that would put kun in his place but captain tivadar just laughed and said we need a few city men in the ranks too otherwise the rest of us would take too much for granted he cant take it for granted that his szonyi started enough now istvans voice cracked sharp as a whip aye enough tivadar looked from kun to szonyi and back again his eye fell on istvan too as his gaze passed from one soldiers to the other you are brothers blooded together in battle the slight pause reminded them how theyd been blooded together for a different reason too but no one who didnt know about that other darker reason could have guessed it from the company commanders words tivadar continued let no quarrel come between you now kun nodded at once city men didnt cling to feuds the way folk from the mountain valleys did szonyi took longer tivadar and istvan both glared at him at last reluctantly his big shaggy head bobbed up and down too thats a strong fellow tivadar said he turned and started to climb out of the redoubt sir one more question istvan asked tivadar paused then nodded istvan asked have we got enough mages forward to warn us if swemmels whoresons are going to turn that horrible magic loose on us again you know the one i mean i know the one you mean the company commander agreed grimly what i dont know is the answer to your question im not even sure mages can detect that spell before the unkerlanters start slaughtering people to power it we might do better to slide forward to find out if theyre bringing peasants up toward the front thats not a bad notion sir kun said i dont mean just for us i mean all along the line of these cursed woods im no general i cant give an order for the whole line i cant even give an order for the whole regiment tivadar said but if you boys want to poke men out to the east to see whats going on you wont make me unhappy and now i will be on my way he climbed the sandbagged steps at the rear of the redoubt and hurried off through the forest he had a good idea there sergeant kun said if we could get some warning before the unkerlanters started slaying he shuddered when they loosed that magic the last time it was so vile i thought my head would burst like an egg by the stars i hoped my head would burst like an egg all right well do it istvan said though itd only be luck if swemmels buggers had their victims in our sector we ought to have scouts pushing forward all along the line the unkerlanters do may the stars go black for them before he could order anyone to go out and scout around in the woods to the east an egg burst about fifty yards in front of the redoubt a moment later another burst less than half as far away before the third egg could land istvan was flat on his belly his face pressed against the black earth he breathed in a moist lungful of air smelling of mold and old leaves that third egg burst behind the redoubt close enough that the blast of sorcerous energy made the ground shudder beneath istvans prostrate form a couple of trees crashed in noisy ruin earth and twigs rained down on istvan hed been through such pummelings before unless an egg burst right on top of the redoubt he knew he was safe enough he was his squad was as more eggs burst all around he exclaimed in dismay captain tivadar he didnt dare raise his head very far no matter how dismayed he was he has a good chance kun said his head not an inch farther from the ground than istvans was hed have gone flat when the first egg flew and started digging himself a hole before the second one burst you would i would the captain too hes no fool from kun that was highest praise we ought to go out after him szonyi said if it was one of us stuck in a storm like that hed go out and bring us back we dont even know which way he went istvan said but that sounded hollow even to him szonyi didnt answer his silence sounded more reproachful than shouted curses would have cursing on his own istvan heaved himself to his feet and left the redoubt as soon as he was out in the woods he went down on his belly again eggs were still bursting all around captain tivadar he shouted though his voice seemed tiny and lost through those shattering roars of suddenly released sorcerous energy captain tivadar sir even if tivadar did answer how was istvan supposed to hear him his ears were bruised overwhelmed battered an egg burst nearby very close a pine that might have stood for a hundred years swayed toppled and crashed down had it fallen at a slightly different an ever so slightly different angle it would have crushed the life out of him was that someones tawny hair or a bit of dead yellowed fern istvan crawled toward it then wished he hadnt there lay tivadar broken like a jointed doll some thoughtless child had stepped on but dolls didnt bleed a bursting egg must have flung him full force into a tree trunk at least he cant have known what hit him istvan thought stars above preserve and guide his spirit he murmured and hurried back to the redoubt he hoped his own end if it came when it came would be as quick as winter gave way to spring so talsu accommodated himself to life in prison he hadnt intended to do any such thing but as hed found in the jelgavan army routine had a force of its own even when the routine was horrid as it was here he got used to it his belly anticipated almost to the minute the times the guards fed him his nasty sadly inadequate bowls of gruel afterwards for half an hour sometimes even for an hour he felt as nearly content as he could in a small stinking vermininfested cell nearly his best time in the prison was the exercise period when along with other captives from his hall he got to tramp back and forth in the yard even whispers among them could bring the wrath of the guards down on their heads the gray stone of the prison was as unlovely in the yard as anywhere else but talsu saw it by sunlight a light that grew brighter almost ever day he saw blue sky he breathed fresh air he began to hear birds sing he wasnt free he knew that all too well but the exercise period let him remember freedom and then like a drowning man sinking beneath the surface of the sea he would have to go back into the gloom and the reek even that came to be part of the routine he would put a lot of himself away deaden himself till the next time he got to go out and see the sun once more whenever routine broke he dreaded it he had reason to dread it routine never broke for anything good the jelgavan constabulary captain hadnt summoned him for several weeks now talsu hoped that meant the fellow had given up he didnt believe it though if the authorities decided he was innocent or at least harmless wouldnt they let him go one morning not long after what passed for his breakfast the door to his cell came open at an unaccustomed time what is it talsu demanded alarm in his an voice any change in routine meant something that could that was about to go wrong shut up the lead guard said stand up talsu sprang off his cot to his feet he said not another word the guards punished without mercy anything that smacked of disobedience or insubordination come along the man at their head commanded and talsu came to his relief he discovered he was not going down the corridors that led to the constabulary captains lair instead he was installed in another cell even smaller and darker than the one from which hed been taken light from the corridor leaked in only through a couple of tiny peepholes the guards stayed in there with him which convinced him this change wasnt permanent their leader said all right boys gag him with rough efficiency the other guards did talsu wanted to struggle but the sticks they aimed at him persuaded him not to he wanted to protest too but the gag kept him from doing that here said one of the men whod bound the leatherandcloth contraption over his mouth now you get to look out the guards shoved him up to one of the peepholes doing his best to be contrary talsu closed his eyes tight whatever they wanted him to see he would do his best not to see it then he felt the business end of a stick pressed against the back of his head if you make even the smallest sound now i will blaze you the lead guard whispered and that will not be the worst thing that happens not even close to the worst i almost hope you do sing out they were playing games with him talsu knew they were playing games with him but that didnt mean he could keep from opening his eyes what was so important that he had to see it but also had to keep silent about it there was the corridor as uninteresting as the stretch of hallway in front of his own cell what sort of foolish game were the gaolers making him join a guard walked along the hall into and out of talsus limited field of vision even if hed looked full at talsu all he could have seen of him through the peephole were a couple of staring eyes but he walked past the closed door as if it didnt exist not a word the lead guard whispered again talsu nodded but only a little he kept his eyes to the peephole he surely did the guards had him going aye he knew it but he couldnt do anything about it here came another guard this one as indifferent to the door to talsus new cell as the first fellow had been behind him walked a woman she wasnt a prisoner her person and clothes were clean at first that was all talsu noticed then he recognized his wife he started to scream gailisa in spite of the guards warning but he almost blessed the gag which reminded him he must not make a sound another guard followed gailisa but talsu hardly saw him his eyes were only on his wife and he couldnt have seen her for more than two heartbeats three at the outside then she was gone the corridor was just a corridor again you see the lead guard said with complacency that was almost obscene we have her too it wont get any better for you and oh how easy it can get worse he didnt bother ordering his henchmen to ungag talsu before they took him back to his own cell if any other captives were looking out and saw a gagged man marched down a corridor what would that do except make them more likely to submit to escape a similar fate after they took talsu back after they released him from the gag they let him stew in his own juice for a couple of days only then did they haul him out again and bring him before the constabulary captain who served king mainardo as ready as he had served king donalitu talsu son of traku the captain sounded reproachful do you see what your stubbornness has got you we had no choice but to bring in your wife for interrogation too and what she told us i wouldnt say it looks good no by the powers above i wouldnt say that at all i dont believe you talsu started to say but he bit that back almost in the same way hed bitten back gailisas name there in the cell with the peephole anything he said gave them a greater hold on him he stood there and waited aye shes turned on you the constabulary captain said and shes given us enough denunciations to keep us busy for quite a while that she has he eyed talsu what have you got to say about that nothing sir talsu answered eventually this would end nothing now disbelief filled the officers voice nothing i cant believe my ears well thats not what your pretty little gailisa had to say she sang like a redbreast and she sang about you he pointed a forefinger at talsu as if it were a stick that bit of overacting convinced talsu of what hed only hoped before that the captain was lying he was sure gailisa would never betray him not like that not for anything he said well sir youve already got me and well have all the rebels in skrunda before long the constabulary captain said make it easy on yourself like your wife did help us but i have no names to give you talsu said more than a little desperation in his voice weve cut these trousers before he knew what would come at the end of such protestations too another beating if that was the routine for interrogations he wouldnt be sorry to disrupt it sure enough the guards behind him growled in eager anticipation they knew what would come too and they looked forward to it so much in life depended on whether one did or was done to here the captain picked up a sheet of paper with writing on it and waved it in talsus face your wife has given us a list of names you see shes not so shy not so shy at all and now for both your sakes id better have a list of names from you and a good many of the names on it had better match the ones on this list here or youll be even sorrier than you are already you may take that to the bank talsu son of traku seeing the list did rock talsu was the constable lying or had gailisa given him names would she do that in the hope of freeing talsu she might talsu knew only too well that she might shed never betray him but she might betray others to save him he might have done the same for her what names would she give though she wouldnt know anyone who really was involved in fighting the algarvian occupiers such people did not advertise talsu had gone looking for them when he started learning classical kaunian and whom had he found kugu the silversmith kugu the traitor which meant curse you talsu said and the guards behind him growled again but before they could do anything more than growl he went on let me have some paper and a pen ill give you what you want just leave my wife alone i knew we would find a key to pick your lock the constabulary captain smiled broadly with an almost algarvian flourish he passed talsu the writing tools remember what i told you im not likely to forget talsu mumbled as he started to write he still didnt know for a fact that gailisa had given the constabulary captain any names at all the fellow hadnt let him get a good enough look at the list to recognize her writing but if she had written down names whose names would they be most likely talsu judged the names of people who liked the algarvians well enough but werent outandout lickspittles using those would have made what she was up to only too clear talsu knew a good many people of that sort and the redheads and their jelgavan hounds wouldnt be able to trust people like that after all such folk might just be putting up a good front and so wishing the worst to those who seemed happy under an algarvian puppet king talsu set down a dozen names and then after a little thought three or four more he passed his list back to the constabulary captain these are the ones i can think of lets see what weve got the captain compared the sheet hed got from talsu to the one hed waved maybe gailisa really had given him a list maybe he wasnt such a dreadful actor after all he clicked his tongue between his teeth isnt that interesting he murmured there are some matches i must admit im a little surprised you took a long time coming to your senses talsu son of traku but im glad youve finally seen who has the strength in this new and greater jelgava thats pretty plain talsu said which wasnt altogether untrue had things been the other way round men who served redheaded king mainardo could never had laid hands on gailisa we shall have to do some more investigating aye indeed we shall the captain said at least half to himself powers above only know what may have been going on right under our noses well if it was well put a stop to it aye we will what about me talsu demanded ive given you what you wanted he sounded like a girl whod just let a seducer have his way with her he felt like that too hed yielded but the constabulary captain wasnt doing anything for him the captain tapped the list with a fingernail what about you i dont know yet well find out if youve done us some good well do you some good if you havent he tapped it again if you havent youll be sorry you tried to get clever with us he nodded to the guards take him back to his cell back talsu went the guards didnt work him over that was something he returned to his place in time for supper that was something too routine returned he wondered when it would end again when and how pybba the pottery magnate was about fifty with energy enough to wear down any three men half his age he certainly left ealstan panting dont complain he boomed dont carp just do the work young fellow as long as you do the work everything will be fine thats why i sacked the bookkeeper i had before you he couldnt keep up couldnt come close to keeping up i need someone who will attend if you will ill pay you if you wont ill boot you out on your arse is that plain enough hed been standing much too close to ealstan and all but bellowing in his ear with his most innocent expression ealstan looked up from the accounts hed been casting and said no sir im sorry but i dont know what youre talking about pybba stared whaat he rumbled then he realized ealstan was pulling his leg he rumbled again this time with laughter youve got spunk young fellow ill say that for you but have you got staying power and i dont want to hear what your wife thinks that made ealstan laugh too if a little uncomfortably im managing so far and you pay well enough do the work and you earn the money thats only fair pybba said do the work if you dont do the work the powers below are welcome to you and ill give em horseradish and capers to eat you with ealstan could have done the work better and faster if pybba hadnt hovered there haranguing him but pybba as best he could see harangued everybody about everything he also worked harder than any of his employees as far as ealstan was concerned his example was a lot more persuasive than his lectures eventually pybba went off to yell at someone else the kilnmaster as ealstan and everyone else within earshot soon realized not paying attention to pybba when he wasnt talking to them was a skill a lot of people who worked for him had acquired ealstan hadnt not yet but he was learning he was also learning a demon of a lot about bookkeeping nobody back in gromheort ran a business a quarter the size of pybbas ethelhelm had made almost as much money but his accounts were straightforward by comparison with pybba it wasnt just the right hand not knowing what the left was doing a lot of his fingers hadnt been introduced to one another well what do you think this is he demanded when ealstan asked him about an incidental expense it looks like a bribe to keep the algarvians sweet ealstan answered pybba beamed at him ah good youre not a blind man have to stay in business you know aye ealstan said pybba was a fullblooded forthwegian he had to pay out less than ethelhelm had to stay in business the algarvians couldnt seize him merely for existing as they could with the halfbreed band leader after some thought ealstan shook his head the algarvians could do that if they wanted to badly enough they could do anything if they wanted to badly enough but they had far less reason to want to than they did with ethelhelm because the algarvians didnt force his bribes to rise out of the range of ordinary thievery pybba was making money almost faster than he knew what to do with it and he should be making even more than he is ealstan said to vanai one evening over supper i dont quite know where some of its going well you said he pays his people well she answered around one of a long series of yawns hes paying you well thats certain and he hired you just about fulltime soon enough oh he does ealstan agreed and he is and he did but thats all in the open all in the books somewhere moneys leaking out of things not a whole lot mind you but it is is somebody stealing from pybba vanai asked or is that what hes paying mezentios men so they wont bother him she knew how the redheads operated its not bribes ealstan said those are on the books too though thats not what theyre called someone stealing i dont know it wouldnt be easy and youre right he pays well enough youd have to be a greedy fool to want more plenty of people are greedy fools vanai pointed out ealstan couldnt disagree with that he still had clients other than pybba though the pottery magnate swallowed more and more of his hours he kept trying to find out how and why pybba wasnt making quite so much money as he should have he kept trying and kept failing he imagined his father looking over his shoulder and making disapproving noises as far as hestan was concerned numbers were as transparent as glass ealstan had thought they were too but all he found here was opacity at last baffled he brought the matter to pybbas notice saying i think you have a thief but im cursed if i can see where whoevers doing this is more clever than i am maybe you ought to have him casting your accounts instead of me a thief pybbas hard face darkened with anger youd better show me what youve found lad if i can figure out who the son of a whore is ill break him in half he didnt sound as if he were joking i hope you can figure it out because i cant ealstan answered and i have to tell you i havent really found anything all ive noticed is that something is lost and im not even sure where let me have a look pybba said ealstan guided him through it showing how things didnt quite add up he said ive been looking back through the books too trying to find out how long this has been going on im sure it was happening while your last bookkeeper before me was here the other thing im sure of is that he didnt even notice him he wouldnt have noticed a naked woman if she got into bed with him he wouldnt pybba snorted in fine contempt the finger he used to mark his place darted now here now there as he followed the track ealstan set out for him he clicked his tongue between his teeth well well young fellow isnt that interesting thats not the word id use ealstan answered the word id use is larcenous he hated cooked books they offended his sense of order in that as in so many things he was very much his fathers son then pybba astonished him instead of furiously bursting like an egg and blasting his bookkeeper and maybe the office too to smithereens he set a hand on ealstans shoulder and said im going to pay you a bonus for finding this youve earned it i dont think one man in ten would have noticed any of it let alone all of it but its not so much of a much you dont need to fret yourself over it the way youve been doing are you sure ealstan asked in lieu of are you out of your mind somebodys stealing from you if hes stealing not so much from you now hes liable to steal a lot more later and even a little hurts and its wrong he spoke that last with great conviction pybba said all sorts of things are wrong you can start with the redheads and go on from there im not going to get excited about this its not big enough to get excited about and if youve got any sense you wont get excited about it either he phrased that as a request but plainly meant it as an order ealstan didnt see how he could disobey it however much he might want to but he did speak up in plaintive tones i dont understand i know that i noticed pybba let out a gruff chuckle but you dont get silver for understanding you get silver for keeping my books youre good at that youve proved it youll get your bonus too like i said but if im not worried about this nobody else needs to be that made the third time hed said pretty much the same thing ealstan was had to be convinced he meant it which brought him no closer to following pybbas mind he slammed the ledgers shut one after another to show without words what he thought pybba only chuckled again which irked him further but the pottery magnate though he could be as sharptongued as the sherds that sprang from his trade was a man of his word when he gave ealstan his next weeks pay he included the promised bonus the size of it made ealstans eyes go big this is too much he blurted pybba threw back his head and roared laughter by the powers above ive heard plenty whine that they got too little but never till now the other way round go on go home spend it youve said your wife is big with child havent you aye i know you have with a brat on the way theres no such thing as too much money coins heavy and jingling in his belt pouch ealstan went back to his flat in something of a daze vanai clapped her hands together in delight when she saw how much pybba had given him he knows youre good she said proudly ealstan shook his head he separated the silver into two gleaming piles pointing to the smaller one he said this is what he pays me for being good then he pointed to the bigger one and this is what he paid me for powers above only know what for being good at what you do vanai repeated showing more faith in him than he had in himself if you werent good you wouldnt have seen what you saw and you wouldnt have got this her logic was as good as a geometry masters up to a point ealstan said i still dont know what in blazes i saw and hes not paying me because i saw it hed be pushing hard after whoever was stealing from him if that were so no hes paying me he broke off when he spoke again it was with sudden new certainty hes paying me to keep my mouth shut thats what hes doing it cant be anything else keep your mouth shut about what vanai asked about seeing this whatever it is ealstan answered he was surprised when i did his last bookkeeper hadnt im sure of that hes bribing me the same way hes bribing the algarvians vanai found the next question are you going to let him bribe you i dont know ealstan scratched his head if hes hiring robbers or murderers with that missing money then i dont want anything to do with him either if hes got a lady friend somewhere thats his wifes worry but if hes doing something to the redheads with the money if hes doing something like that by the powers above the only thing id want to do was join him he wondered how he could tell pybba that he wondered if he ought to tell pybba that he couldnt prove the pottery magnate wasnt working for the algarvians plenty of forthwegians were and ealstan with a kaunian wife and with a baby on the way had even more to lose from a wrong guess than most of his countrymen would have with a regretful sigh he said i dont dare try to find out too many bad things could happen youre probably right but vanai sighed too i wish you had the chance so do i ealstan plucked a hair from his beard looked at it and let it fall to the floor if i ever find out where that moneys going find out for sure i mean not just that its going missing somewhere then ill know what to do but pybba had no intention of making that easy for him when ealstan came into the office the next day his employer said remember why you got your extra silver no more snooping around or youll be sorry i remember ealstan assured him that wasnt the same as promising he wouldnt snoop anymore most people wouldnt have noticed pybba did no getting cute with me either or your arsell be out on the sidewalk before youve got time to fart do you understand me do you believe me i wont just give you the boot either ill blacken your name all over town dont you even think about doubting me i wouldnt ealstan answered thinking of nothing else like most educated folk in the eastern regions of derlavai and the islands lying near the mainland the kuusaman physician spoke classical kaunian along with her own language nodding to fernao she said you will have to strengthen that leg a good deal more you know the lagoan mage looked down at the limb in question it was only about half as thick as its mate really he said in pretty convincing astonishment and here i was planning a fiftymile hike tomorrow morning what shall i do now for a moment the physician took him seriously then she exhaled in loud exasperation people who cannot take even their own health seriously do not deserve to keep it she said fernao said im sorry in kuusaman that mollified the physician who smiled at him instead of wearing that severe frown he went on his way with nothing but a cane to help him walk ill probably limp all my days he thought as he walked toward the dining room of the isolated hostel in the naantali district ill probably limp but ill be able to walk pekka was already in there sitting alone at a table drinking a mug of ale a couple of secondary sorcerers sat at another table arguing about the best way to focus a spell at a distance from where it was cast not so long before fernao wouldnt have known what they were talking about his kuusaman got a little better every day seeing him pekka set down the mug and clapped her hands together you really are making progress she said in her own language and because he was making progress in that too he understood her with a nod he said aye a bit also in her tongue he lifted the cane into the air and stood on his own two feet and nothing else for a few heartbeats pekka clapped again reveling in his kuusaman fernao asked may i join you that was what he thought he asked anyhow pekka giggled switching to classical kaunian she said several words in kuusaman may be translated as to join you might be wiser not to use that one to a woman married to another man oh fernaos cheeks got hot im sorry he said as he had to the physician pekka returned to kuusaman im not angry and aye you may join me she used a verb different from the one hed tried thank you fernao said and asked a server for a mug of ale of his own he had that request quite well memorized when his mug came pekka raised hers in salute to your full recovery she said and drank fernao drank to that toast too who wouldnt if he doubted the wish would be fully granted then he did that was all and he enjoyed what he drank the kuusamans were good brewers then he said i hope you are well well enough anyhow pekka said something in kuusaman he didnt catch seeing as much she translated it overworked she hesitated a moment then asked does the name habakkuk mean anything to you it sounds as if it ought to come from the land of the ice people he replied in the classical tongue other than that no why what is it something i heard somewhere pekka answered and fernao hardly needed to be a mage to realize she wasnt telling him everything she knew but when she went on i do not know what it is either he thought she might be telling the truth habakkuk he tasted the word again sure enough it put him in mind of a caravanmaster hairy all over and stinking because hed never had a bath in all the days of his life fernaos opinion of the nomadic natives of the austral continent was not high hed seen enough of them for familiarity to breed contempt he wasnt altogether surprised when pekka changed the subject in a few days i will be going away for a week or two she said i have got leave you will put ilmarinen in charge again fernao asked for a little while she answered only for a little while i have got leave to see my husband and my son and i have got leave to see my sister too elimaki is expecting her first child her husband got leave not so long ago you see fernao smiled so i do or maybe i do he wondered if pekka would come back from leave expecting her second child if she didnt it probably wouldnt be from lack of effort he said i wonder whom i would have to kill to get leave for myself as the physician had before pekka took him literally you would not have to kill anyone she said you would have to ask me you would ask and i would say aye how could i refuse you leave how could i refuse you anything after you have saved the project saved me be careful he thought you dont know what i might ask for and it wouldnt be leave he rather suspected she did know he hadnt tried to push things he hadnt used the wrong verb on purpose he saw no point to pushing not when she was so obviously eager to go home to her husband but the notion wouldnt leave his mind he said whatever we do the project needs to go forward after you come back here i can think about leave i wonder if i speak lagoan anymore or if i will go through the streets of setubal trying to use classical kaunian with everyone i meet many people would understand you pekka said though you might surprise them or with your eyes they might take you for a kuusaman with a lot of lagoan blood when i return you tell me what you want and i shall give it to you to keep from saying anything he would regret later fernao took a long pull at his ale having the mug in front of his face also kept pekka from seeing him go red again maybe a few passages with a friendly woman or even a mercenary one would let him keep his mind on business when he got back ilmarinen came into the dining hall and walked over to the table where fernao and pekka were sitting nodding to pekka he said do i hear right im going to be in charge again he spoke kuusaman but fernao followed well enough pekka nodded aye for a little while she answered in courteous classical kaunian try not to destroy the place while i am gone i thought destroying as much of naantali as we could was the reason we came here ilmarinen said also in the classical language then he switched back to kuusaman and called to the serving woman another mug of ale over here linna aye master ilmarinen linna said you can have anything you want from me as long as you just want ale ilmarinen winced heartless bitch he muttered in kaunian his pursuit of the serving girl had gone exactly nowhere fernao winced too in sympathy he was glad he supposed he was glad he hadnt tried pursuing pekka anywhere except inside his mind as linna brought the mug pekka told ilmarinen if you want to carry out the experiments while i am away please do the more we get done the sooner we can take it into battle we have a ways to go before we manage that ilmarinen swigged at the ale then wiped his wispy mustache on his sleeve and weve been hitting the gongs pretty hard just in the ordinary way of doing things gyongyos is one kind of fight pekka said when we go onto the derlavaian mainland against algarve that will be another kind tell me i am wrong master she stuck out her chin and looked a challenge at ilmarinen he only grunted and drank more ale by way of reply gyongyos was far away and her soldiers being driven back one island at a time algarve had already proved she could strike across the strait of valmiera all the mages whod been in the blockhouse were lucky to be alive fernao said unkerlant will be glad to have more company in the fight on the ground when we do cross to the mainland unkerlant ilmarinen spoke the name of the kingdom as if it were the name of a loathsome disease the measure of unkerlants accursedness is that king swemmels subjects fight by the tens of thousands for murderous mezentio against their own sovereign he held up a hand before either fernao or pekka could speak and the measure of algarves accursedness is that practically every other kingdom in the world has lined up with swemmel and against mezentio that is not a very happy way of looking at the world fernao said as much protest as he was prepared to make the world is not a happy place to look at nowadays pekka said too right its not ilmarinen said do you know the state were reduced to were reduced to hoping the algarvians and the unkerlanters do a right and proper job of slaughtering each other so we can pick up the pieces without getting too badly mauled ourselves arent you glad to be living in a great kingdom he drained his ale and shouted for a refill fernao said i would rather live in a kingdom still fighting the algarvians than in one that had yielded to them and so would i ilmarinen agreed what we have here isnt the best of things but its a long way from the worst of things oh indeed pekka said we could be kaunians in forthweg thats one of the reasons were fighting of course to keep mezentios men from having the chance to use us as they use those kaunians i mean ilmarinen shook his head no thats not right or its not quite right anyhow were fighting to keep anybody from using anybody else the way the algarvians are using those poor cursed kaunians he held up his hand again aye i see the irony of our being allied to unkerlant in that fight linna brought him a full mug and took away the empty you people would be happier if you stuck to kuusaman all the time she declared all this chatter in foreign languages never did anybody any good with almost clinical curiosity pekka asked ilmarinen what on earth do you see in her she made a point of using classical kaunian after coughing a couple of times the master mage answered well she is a pretty little thing he glanced toward fernao perhaps hoping for support fernao only shrugged the serving girl wasnt ugly but she didnt do anything for him with a sigh ilmarinen went on and besides theres something cursed attractive about such invincible stupidity i do not understand that at all pekka said i do not either fernao knew he would have been much less interested in pekka if he hadnt thought at least as much of her mind as he did of her body sometimes things should be simple ilmarinen insisted no competition no quarrels no no interest in you whatever pekka put in besides which fernao said while you would not quarrel about your work with an invincibly stupid woman he used ilmarinens words even though he was far from sure linna deserved them you would be likely to quarrel with her over everything else or do you think i am wrong ilmarinen gulped down his ale sprang up from his seat and hurried away without answering you frightened him off pekka said only from us not from linna fernao predicted unless he decides he would rather go after some other girl pekka said as for me i am glad my heart points in only one direction because of his cane fernao couldnt spring up and hurry away he didnt shout for more ale or better spirits to make him forget hed heard that either he hoped pekka never realized how close he came to doing both when krasta went into the west wing of her mansion to ask something of colonel lurcanio she noticed more empty desks there than shed ever seen before it didnt take much to knock a thought right out of her head and that was plenty among the empty desks was that of captain gradasso lurcanios adjutant captain mosco gradassos predecessor had already been sent off to fight in unkerlant krasta wouldnt have been brokenhearted to see the same fate befall gradasso who embarrassed her by speaking far better classical kaunian than she did but with gradassos desk empty there was no one to keep her from barging right into lurcanios office rather to her disappointment she found gradasso in there he and her algarvian lover were standing in front of a large map of eastern derlavai tacked to the wall and were arguing volubly in their own language they both jumped a little when krasta came in lurcanio recovered first later captain he told gradasso switching to valmieran so krasta could follow aye later an it be your pleasure gradasso replied in what he thought was valmieran he hadnt known the modern language till being assigned to priekule and mixed in a lot of classical constructions and vocabulary when he spoke it with a bow to lurcanio he strode past krasta to his usual station as the colonels watchdog what was that all about krasta asked we dont see eye to eye about what algarve ought to do in unkerlant once the mud dries up lurcanio answered whatever it is does it account for all those desks with no people sitting at them krasta asked as a matter of fact it does lurcanio said when we strike swemmels soldiers this year we shall strike them with all our strength on that gradasso and i agree we can do nothing less not if we intend to win the war and we do but on what to do with our strength once mustered he shook his head there we differ interested in spite of herself krasta asked what does he want and why do you think hes wrong lurcanio didnt answer directly krasta often thought lurcanio incapable of answering directly instead the algarvian colonel said here come look at the way things are for yourself not without trepidation krasta walked to the map geography had never been a strong subject for her not that many subjects in her brief and checkered academic career had been strong ones lurcanio pointed here is durrwangen in southern unkerlant the unkerlanters took it away from us this winter and we could not quite get it back before the spring thaw down there turned the landscape to soup and stopped both sides from doing much krasta nodded aye i remember you complaining about that do you lurcanio bowed will marvels never cease before krasta could even wonder if that was sardonic he pointed to the map again you see though that to both the east and west of durrwangen we have pushed some distance south of the city he waited krasta realized she was supposed to say something she nodded again thats plain from where the green pins are and the gray ones her tone sharpened its also plain this wall will need replastering when your precious map comes down lurcanio ignored that he was good at ignoring things he didnt want to hear in that he resembled krasta herself though she didnt realize it he waved at the map you are quite the most charming military cadet i have ever seen if algarves fate lay in your pretty hands how would you take durrwangen when the fighting starts anew the day was mild and cool but sweat burst out on krastas forehead she hated questions she always had and she particularly hated questions from lurcanio he could be he delighted in being rude when her answers didnt satisfy him but she saw she had to answer after examining the map she drew two hesitant lines with her forefinger if you move your armies here so they meet behind this durrwangen place it doesnt look like youd have to move them very far you could come at it from every which way at once i dont see how the unkerlanters could keep you out of it then to her astonishment lurcanio took her in his arms and did a good thorough job of kissing her nicely reasoned my sweet he said and pinched her on the backside she squeaked and leaped into the air you have reached exactly the same solution as captain gradasso exactly the same solution as king mezentio himself youre teasing me krasta said wondering what kind of foolish obvious blunder shed made whatever it was lurcanio would enjoy pointing it out he always did but he solemnly shook his head by the powers above milady i am not you have seen the very thing that caught the eye of some of the ablest officers in the kingdom krasta studied him he remained solemn when he felt like slapping her down he didnt usually wait so long but his voice had had an edge to it even if not one aimed at her you were arguing with gradasso she said slowly does that mean you didnt see this move if i saw it couldnt anyone any soldier i mean see it lurcanio kissed her again which left her more confused than ever oh i saw it he said i would have to be far gone in my second childhood not to have seen it sure enough the sarcastic sparkle was back in his voice but if the king saw it if i saw it if captain gradasso saw it if even you saw it would you not suspect the unkerlanters might see it too i wouldnt know krasta tossed her head ive never had anything to do with unkerlanter barbarians nor wanted to either who can say what theyd see and what they wouldnt there is something to that colonel lurcanio admitted something but how much when we went into unkerlant we did not think swemmels men could see the sun when it was shining in their eyes we have discovered to our sorrow that we were mistaken which is why you started killing kaunians from forthweg krasta thought she almost blurted that aloud but lurcanio would be on her like a hawk if she did the kaunians of valmiera werent supposed to know anything about that discretion didnt come easy but she managed it she asked what will happen if the unkerlanters do see this what looks easy on the map will get much harder lurcanio replied that is why i wish we were doing something else anything else have you told anybody krasta asked you are an important man what you think carries weight i am an important man in priekule lurcanio said in trapani where these decisions are made i am nothing in particular only a colonel only a military bureaucrat what could i know about actual fighting i have sent my superiors a memorial aye much good it will do me either they will read it and ignore it or they will not bother reading it before they ignore it krasta gaped lurcanio often mocked her he mocked other valmierans too shed even heard him mock his countrymen here in priekule but never till now had she known him to sound so bitter about his superiors slowly she asked what will you do if they turn out to be right take off my hat and bow to them lurcanio suited action to word which made krasta laugh but then she asked and what will you do if you turn out to be right and the generals back in trapani are wrong they wont take off their hats and bow to you of course they wont with a lifted eyebrow colonel lurcanio cast scorn on the idea what will i do if things come to such a pass most likely my dear i will get my marching orders i will pick up a stick and i will go where my colleagues have gone before me off to the west to do my best to throw back the unkerlanter hordes with my body he looked krasta up and down undressing her with his eyes there are i confess other things i would sooner do with my body right here with gradasso outside krasta giggled being outrageous being risky often excited her shed flipped up lurcanios kilt in here before do you want to rather to her disappointment her algarvian lover shook his head no not now tonight perhaps but i have not the time now he sighed i really have not the time to argue with my adjutant either with more and more of the men who have been aiding me gone more and more of the work falls on my shoulders for the work must be done regardless of who does it to krasta those who occupied valmiera had always seemed to have it easy they lived well when even valmieran nobles often had trouble making ends meet they had their choice of bed partners she knew that all too well that they or some of them also worked themselves to exhaustion hadnt crossed her mind lurcanio asked did you come down here to pick my brains over strategy or to molest me the one was interesting the other would be enjoyable but i really am too busy for either being twitted worked a minor miracle it made krasta remember why she had come down to see lurcanio something that had gone clean out of her mind even before she got to his office she said what did your hounds end up deciding about viscount valnu he made more entertaining company at most festivities than almost anyone else who was likely to come oh aye indeed valnu has charmed any number of people of all genders and preferences lurcanio didnt bother hiding his contempt he does very little for me in which i seem to be almost unique in the city but you asked about the hounds they must not have found anything worth mentioning for i am given to understand he is at liberty once more is he krasta breathed she must have sounded more excited than shed intended to for lurcanio laughed at her aye he is why does it mean so much to you will you rush right out and make him the same offer you just made me i would advise against that i suspect he owes his freedom not least to the ah enthusiasm of certain handsome algarvian officers that wouldnt have particularly surprised krasta valnu did what he felt like with whomever he felt like but she heard the edge in lurcanios voice and knew she would have to soften him oh no she said making her eyes go wide with littlegirl innocence i wouldnt think of doing such a thing not after the lesson you taught me the last time to her chagrin that only made lurcanio laugh again you wouldnt think of doing such a thing if you might get caught isnt that what you mean i dont know what youre talking about krasta said with such dignity as she could muster lurcanio laughed harder than ever she stuck out her tongue at him she hated being transparent and disliked the algarvian for showing her she was when he wouldnt stop laughing she flounced out of his office slamming the door behind her but she knew that when he came to her bedchamber that evening she wouldnt slam the door in his face ten sergeant pesaro glared at the algarvian constables drawn up at attention in front of the barracks in gromheort listen up you lugs he growled youd better listen up on account of this is important as imperceptibly as he could bembo shifted from foot to foot how many times have we heard speeches like this he whispered to oraste who stood next to him oraste might have been carved from stone even his lips hardly stirred as he answered too cursed many shut up the lot of you pesaro roared his jowls wobbled when he opened his mouth very wide youd better shut up or youll bloody well be sorry have you got that he looked so fierce even bembo whod known him since dirt decided he had to take him seriously after one more glare pesaro went on all right thats better our kingdom needs us by the powers above and were going to come through alarm blazed up bembos back one of the things hed always feared was that the meat grinder of war might decide to take constables and turn them into soldiers by the horrified expressions some of his comrades were wearing the same thing had occurred to them too pesaros chuckle was anything but pleasant there have i got your attention i cursed well better have what were going to do is were going to go into the kaunian quarter here were going to grab as many blonds as we can and were going to ship em west the men in the trenches therell need all the sorcerous help they can get were the boys who can give em what they need as long as were not going into the trenches ourselves somebody behind bembo muttered bembo had all he could do to keep from nodding like a fool because that was exactly how he felt himself a constable in front of him stuck up a hand when pesaro nodded the fellow asked what do we do if we run into people who look like forthwegians grab em anyhow pesaro answered promptly well throw the buggers into holding cells if they still look like forthwegians a day later well turn em loose and if they dont which you ask me is a lot more likely then off they go if theyre in the kaunian quarter we figure theyre blonds till they show us different another constable a young fellow named almonio raised his hand permission to fall out sergeant he never had had the stomach for seizing kaunians who would be doomed to massacre but pesaro shook his head which made his jowls wobble again this time from side to side no his voice was flat and hard you can come along or you can go to the guardhouse those are your choices ill come almonio said miserably its not right but ill come bembo knew the youngster would drink himself into a stupor the first chance he got you bet your arse youll come pesaro wasnt just going to have his way he was going to rub the other constables nose in it so that almonio wouldnt pester him again with second thoughts this war were fighting with unkerlant touches everybody now were all fighting it irregardless of whether were in the front line or not a smile spread over his broad fleshy face he plainly thought that rather fine elsewhere on the parade ground in front of the barracks other sergeants were haranguing other squads of constables that fit in with what bembo knew or thought he knew of how soldiers and their leaders behaved before a battle all the sergeants finished at about the same time that bembo suspected was no accident the captain whod led the raid on the block of flats where the kaunian robber gippias pals had been hiding out was in charge of this assault on the kaunian quarter bembo still didnt know his name he did know the fellow was from trapani and had a vast contempt not only for kaunians but also for forthwegians and for his own countrymen who had the misfortune to come from provincial towns well get them the captain declared as the constables marched toward the little district into which the blonds had been shoehorned well get them and well teach them what it means to be algarves enemies he sees what needs doing anyhow oraste said but then the captain repeated himself and then he said the same thing over again for a third and soon for a fourth time oraste rolled his eyes all right weve got the fornicating idea forthwegians who saw a companys worth of constables bearing down on them sensibly got out of the way as fast as they could pride made bembo suck in his belly throw back his shoulders and march as if marching really mattered like any algarvian he reckoned being part of a parade the only thing better than watching one but that thought had hardly crossed his mind before the constables had to halt it wasnt forthwegians or kaunians who stopped them either it was their own countrymen a couple of regiments of soldiers were marching through the city toward the leyline caravan depot they didnt swagger as the constables did they just tramped along intent on getting where they were going probably back to the front in unkerlant the ones who werent lean were downright skinny their tunics and kilts were faded and patched and they all had a knowing look in their eyes a look that said theyd been places and done things the constables couldnt and wouldnt want to imagine arent they cute one soldier said to another pointing at the constables arent they sweet oh aye theyre just the most precious dears i ever saw his friend answered both men guffawed bembos ears heated in dull embarrassment another algarvian trooper was blunter slackers he yelled whose prong did you suck to stay out of the real fight his pals growled and shook their fists at the constables one of them flipped up his kilt and showed his bare buttocks he wasnt wearing drawers get that mans name discipline him the constabulary captain shouted to the sergeants and lieutenants and captains marching past but in spite of his fury the military officers paid him no attention the more they ignored him the angrier and louder he got it did him no good at all he was still steaming when the last footsoldier finally walked past some of the other constables had got angry too more like bembo were just resigned soldiers never have any use for us he said theyre jealous that they have to go forward and we get to stay back here wouldnt you be oraste returned of course i would you think im daft bembo said but i dont have to be jealous of me on account of im a constable not a soldier oraste might have had further opinion on just what bembo was if he did he kept his mouth shut about them the two constables were partners after all they marched on till they came to the edge of the kaunian quarter there the captain divided them into two groups a larger one that would go into houses and shops and bring out the blonds and a smaller one that would guard them and keep them from slipping away in the confusion bembo and oraste were both in the first group this is for algarve the captain declared this is for victory go in there and do your duty had the constables been rookies they might have charged into the kaunian district with cheers ringing from their lips but almost all of them had been through roundups before both in gromheort and in the surrounding villages they had a hard time getting excited about another one oraste might not have been excited but he enjoyed kicking in a door when no one responded after he yelled kaunians come forth he liked breaking things and knocking things down roundups gave him the chance to have fun but he went from gloating to cursing when he and bembo found nobody in the flat once he had kicked in the door they went next door this time bembo shouted kaunians come forth again no one came forth no one responded at all with a snarl oraste put a boot to the door near the latch it flew open the constables swarmed in sticks in hand and ready to blaze once more though they found only a deserted flat powers above oraste exclaimed did all the stinking blonds magic themselves dark and sneak out when nobody was looking they couldnt have bembo said though without much conviction somebody would have noticed then where are they oraste asked and bembo had no good answer for him he did hope doldasai and her family had managed to get out of the kaunian quarter if they hadnt he wouldnt be able to do a thing about it if they got seized again they both shouted kaunians come forth in front of the doorway to the next flat once more no one inside came out or said a word yet again oraste kicked in the door not only was he better at it than bembo he enjoyed it more this time though they found a man and a woman hiding in a closet under some cloaks both of them might have been forthwegian by their looks we were just visiting the man quavered in algarvian and your shout frightened us so shut up oraste said and hit him in the head with his bludgeon the woman screamed he hit her too for one thing i know youre lying for another thing i dont give a fart orders are to grab everybody and i dont care what you look like get moving or else ill wallop you again as the unhappy couple stumbled toward the door blood ran down their faces and dripped on the shabby carpeting desperation in his voice the man said ill give you anything you want to pretend you never saw us forget it oraste said bembo couldnt do anything but nod oraste continued go on curse you its not like anybodyll miss you once youre gone the man said something in classical kaunian oraste didnt know a word of the language bembo knew just enough to recognize a curse when he heard one he hit the man again on the off chance that the fellow was mage enough to make the curse stick if he got to finish it none of that he snapped were warded against wizardry anyhow he hoped the wards worked well he and oraste led the couple theyd captured back to the constables in charge of holding kaunians once caught other constables were leading more kaunians and presumed kaunians out of the cramped district powers above a lot of these buggers look like forthwegians and wear tunics oraste said bembo could only nod close to half the captives looked swarthy and dressed like their forthwegian countrymen genuine blonds wearing genuine trousers had become scarce even in the kaunian quarter i do wonder how many have slipped away to someplace where nobody knows what in blazes they are bembo said too cursed many ill tell you that oraste said the captain in charge of the operation plainly agreed with him youll have to do better than this he shouted to his men algarves going to need bodies for the fight ahead youve got to go in there and get em there arent that many bodies to get not anymore bembo said weve already nabbed a good many and likely even more have slipped through our fingers with their sorcerous disguises again he hoped doldasai had he wouldnt have wanted to put his neck on the block like that for nothing too right they have oraste agreed but the ones that are left weve bloody well got to dig out come on back into the kaunian quarter he went intent on doing all he could bembo couldnt come close to matching such zeal and didnt much want to but he followed nonetheless what choice have i got he wondered he knew the answer all too well none whatever smooth as velvet the leyline caravan glided to a stop at the depot skrunda the conductor yelled going from car to car all out for skrunda your pardon talsu said as he got to his feet the man sitting next to him swung his legs into the aisle so talsu whod been by the window could get past and walk to the doorway that would let him return to his own town he had to snatch at his trousers as he went up the aisle theyd fit fine when the algarvians first captured him after months in prison though they threatened to fall down with every stride he took he was willing to hang on to them when he got home he or his father could alter his clothes so theyd fit his present scrawny state and he could start eating properly again to start making himself fit the clothes watch your step sir the conductor said as talsu got down from the caravan car by way of the little set of stairs that led to the platform his voice was an emotionless drone how many thousands of times how many tens of thousands of times had he said exactly the same thing enough to drive a man easily bored mad surely but he said watch your step sir to the man behind talsu too in just the same way talsu had no baggage to reclaim he counted himself lucky that his captors had given him back the clothes he was wearing when theyd seized him he hurried out of the depot and onto the streets of the town where hed lived all his life till conscripted into king donalitus army that hadnt turned out well not for him and not for jelgava either next to months in a dungeon though he went through the market square at close to a trot part of him said the bread and onions and olives and almonds and olive oil on display there were shadows of what had been for sale before the war the rest the part that had thought hard about eating cockroaches wanted to stop right there and stuff himself till he couldnt walk anymore he did stop when someone called his name talsu his friend repeated coming up to pump his hand i thought you were you know hello stikliu talsu said i was as a matter of fact but they finally let me go did they something in stiklius face changed it wasnt a pleasant sort of change either how lucky for you ill see you later i have some other things to do so long he left as fast as hed come forward what was that all about talsu wondered but he didnt need to wonder for long stikliu thought hed sold his soul to the algarvians talsu scowled a lot of people were liable to think that for what other reason would he have come out of the dungeon what would he have thought if someone imprisoned were suddenly freed nothing good stikliu hadnt thought anything good either a couple of other people who knew talsu saw him on the way to the tailors shop and the dwelling over it they didnt come rushing over to find out how he was they did their best to pretend theyd never set eyes on him his scowl got deeper maybe the gaolers hadnt done him such an enormous favor by turning him loose he walked into the tailors shop there behind the counter sat his father doing the necessary hand stitching on an algarvian kilt before chanting the spell that would use the laws of similarity and contagion to bind the whole garment together traku looked up from his work good morn he began and then threw down the kilt and ran out to take talsu in his arms talsu he said and his voice broke he rumpled his sons hair as he had when talsu was a little boy powers above be praised youve come home he didnt care how that might have happened he just rejoiced that it had aye father tears ran down talsus face too im home traku all but squeezed the breath out of talsu then talsus father hurried to the stairway and called laitsina ausra come quick what on earth talsus mother said but she and his sister ausra both hurried downstairs they both squealed shrieked actually when they saw talsu standing there and then smothered him in hugs and kisses after a couple of minutes coherent speech and coherent thought returned laitsina asked does gailisa know youre free no mother talsu shook his head i came here first all right laitsina took charge as she had a way of doing ausra go to the grocers and bring her back dont name any names not out loud she rounded on her husband dont just stand there traku run upstairs and bring down the wine aye ausra and traku said the same thing at the same time as if to their commander ausra dashed out the door traku dashed up the stairs in his army days talsu had had only one officer whod got that instant obedience from his men poor colonel adomu hadnt lasted long the algarvians had killed him traku came down with the wine he poured cups for himself his wife and talsu and set the jar on the counter to wait for ausra and gailisa then he raised his own cup high to freedom he said and drank to freedom talsu echoed but when he sipped the red wine made tangy in the usual jelgavan style with the juices of limes and oranges and lemons put him in mind of the prison and of the jelgavan constabulary captain whod given him all the wine he wanted to get him to denounce his friends and neighbors what finally made them let you go son traku asked you must know how they took gailisa away talsu said and his father and mother both nodded he went on they brought her to my prison and made her write out a list of names then they told me shed done it and that my names had better match hers i knew shed never denounce anyone who really hated algarvians so i wrote down people who liked them but werent real showy about it you know the kind i mean and i must have been thinking along with her because they turned me loose clever lad traku burst out and hit him in the shoulder you can say a lot of things about my line but we dont raise fools laitsina contented herself with kissing talsu which probably amounted to the same thing his parents were pleased with him they thought him a clever fellow but what would other people in skrunda think of him hed already had a taste of the answer theyd think hed sold himself to the redheads would they have anything to do with him now that hed been released the only ones likely to were men and women of the sort hed named as antialgarvian activists that was funny if you looked at it the right way it would have been even funnier if hed wanted to have anything to do with those people the problem seemed urgent for a moment then the bell rang as the door opened again there was ausra with gailisa right behind her talsus wife gaped at him then let out exactly the squeal a sevenyearold might have used at getting a new doll she threw herself into trakus arms i dont believe it she said over and over again i cant believe it talsu had trouble believing the feel of a woman pressed against him hed thought his imagination and memory had held onto what that feeling was like but hed been wrong wrong i saw you once he said in between kisses did you gailisa answered when they took me to that horrible prison i wondered if you would if that was why i didnt see you no they wouldnt let you talsu said but i was looking out through a peephole when they took you down the hallway and when they told me youd written a denunciation i had to figure out what kind of names youd put in it so mine would match i guess i did it right on account of they let me go i named all the fat smug whoresons i could think of is what i did gailisa said me too talsu said and it worked somebody he didnt notice who had brought down and filled another pair of cups his mother gave one to ausra his father gave the other to gailisa they both drank gailisa turned an accusing stare on his sister you didnt tell me why i had to come back here she said you just told me it was important well was i right or was i wrong ausra asked you were wrong because you didnt come close to saying enough gailisa answered you didnt come close she seized talsus arm and stared up into his face in such a marked manner that at any other time he would have been embarrassed not now now he drank in the warmth of her affection like a plant long in darkness drinking in the sun not very much later still holding him by the arm she took him upstairs ausra started to follow them traku contrived to get in her way in a low voice but not quite low enough to keep talsu from overhearing he said no wait whatever you want up there it will keep for a while talsus ears got hot his parents and his sister had to know what he and gailisa would be doing in the little bedchamber that had been his alone before he got married then he shrugged if it didnt bother them and it didnt seem to he wasnt about to let it bother him either gailisa closed and barred the door to the bedchamber then she undid the toggles on talsus tunic how skinny youve got she said running the palm of her hand along his ribs didnt they feed you anything not much talsu answered the ease with which his trousers came down proved that dont you worry gailisa said ill take care of things aye i will she let her hand linger for a moment then planted it in the middle of his chest he went over on his back onto the bed stay there she told him busy with the fastenings of her own clothes once she was out of them talsu stared and stared no memory and imagination were only shadows when set beside reality she lay down beside him their lips met their hands wandered before long gailisa straddled him and impaled herself upon him ohhh he said one long exhalation how could he have misremembered so much you hush gailisa said just let me and she did slowly carefully lovingly having gone without so long talsu didnt think hed be able to last now but she took care of that too when he finally did groan and shudder it was as if he were making up for all the lost time at once gailisa leaned forward and brushed his lips with hers there she murmured almost as if to a child is that better better aye he said but he was still a young man even if poorly fed and his spear retained its temper this time he began to move slowly at first but then with more insistence gailisa threw her head back her breath came short so did his she clenched him as with a hand he groaned again this time so did she sweat made their skins slide against each other as they separated talsu hoped for a third round but not urgently he caressed gailisa marveling all over again at how soft she was a heavily laden wagon rattled by outside turning his mind away from lovemaking and toward less delightful things people are going to think i sold out to the redheads he said they already think i did gailisa answered powers below eat them aye talsus hand closed on her bare left breast somehow talking of such things while they sprawled naked and sated was an exorcism of sorts even if modern thaumaturgy had proved precious few demons really existed he went on do you know who betrayed me he waited for her to shake her head then spoke three more words kugu the silversmith the classical kaunian master gailisa exclaimed in horror the very same fellow talsu said something ought to happen to him his wife spoke with great conviction maybe something will talsu said but if anything does it wont be something anybody can blame me for gailisa accepted that as naturally as if hed said the sun rose in the east pekka lay beside leino in the big bed where theyd spent so much happy time together hed be ready again pretty soon she judged and then they would start another round of what theyd both been too long without so good to be here her husband murmured so good to be here with you pekka said leino laughed so good to be here at all compared to the land of the ice people his voice trailed off ive said too much habakkuk pekka said her husband nodded aye habakkuk i never should have said anything about that either and if i did say something about it the censor never should have passed it but i did and he did and now weve got to live with it fer one of the other mages whos working with me said the name sounded as if it came from the land of the ice people pekka didnt want to very strongly didnt want to mention fernaos name while she was in bed with her husband shed worry about what that meant and if it meant anything another time he was right if leino noticed her hesitation he didnt make a big thing of it forbearance was one of the reasons she loved him he sighed and went on i think youve got the more interesting job working with people like ilmarinen and siuntio whats the matter now siuntios dead pekka knew she shouldnt have been so startled but she couldnt help it her husband couldnt have known she hadnt written about it to him even if she had one of the censors probably would have kept the news from getting out the harder the time mezentios men had of learning what theyd done the better is he leino clicked his tongue between his teeth thats a pity but he wasnt a young man to begin with no not dead like that pekka would have staked her life that the redheads couldnt possibly be listening to what went on in her bedchamber dead in an algarvian attack if he hadnt fought it off or at least fought part of it off the whole team might have died with him by the powers above leino said you never told me anything about this before you couldnt could you pekka shook her head with a sigh leino went on i think im working on a sideshow youre doing what really matters am i i hope so pekka clung to him she didnt want to have to think about the work shed finally escaped she was more interested in thinking about the two of them what they had been doing and what theyd soon do again but leino couldnt do it again quite yet had he been able to he would have been stirring against her thigh because he couldnt quite yet he was interested in what pekka had been up to the algarvians must think so he said if they didnt they wouldnt have bothered attacking you how did they do it dragons pekka shook her head she didnt want to think about that either but the question gave her no choice no another kaunian sacrifice i dont know whether they just grabbed the first however many valmierans they saw or if they brought kaunians east out of forthweg whichever it was very bad she shuddered recalling just how bad it had been leino held her and stroked her she could tell he was bursting with curiosity shed known him a good many years now if she couldnt tell such things who could but he did his best not to let any of it show because he knew that would bother her and if a mages suppressing his curiosity wasnt love what was it as much in gratitude as for any other reason she slid down and took him in her mouth trying to hurry things along that wasnt magic but it worked as if it were before long they both stopped worrying about what habakkuk was or why mezentios mages chose to assail pekka and her colleagues but lovemaking never resolved things it only put them off for a while after theyd gasped their way to completion pekka knew leino wouldnt be trying yet another round any time soon that meant his thought would turn elsewhere and sure enough he said you must be working on something truly big if the algarvians used that spell against you something aye pekka still didnt want to talk about it leino said they tried to use that same spell to drive us off the austral continent you know pekka nodded shed heard something about that her husband continued it went wrong it went horribly wrong and came down on their heads instead of ours and the lagoans magecraft that works fine here or on the mainland of derlavai has a way of going wrong down in the land of the ice people thats what they say pekka nodded again then laughed whoever they are because she found worrying about her husbands problems easier than worrying about her own she quickly found another question to ask will that cause trouble for habakkuk it shouldnt leino used an extravagant gesture habakkuk is something else he chuckled ruefully i cant talk about it any more than you can say much about whatever it is youre working on i know i understand pekka wanted to tell him everything just for a moment she wished fernao were there so she could talk shop then she shook her hair and had to brush hair out of her eyes he was part of what shed come here come away from the project to escape i love you leino said and pekka reminded herself hed come a long way to escape hard dangerous work too she clung to him as he clung to her they didnt make love again leino wasnt so young that he could do it whenever he wanted but the feel of him pressed against her was about as good as the real thing for pekka especially when theyd been apart so long she hoped holding her was as good for him but had her doubts men were different that way the next morning uto woke both of them at an improbably early hour with kajaani so far south spring days lengthened quickly the sun rose early and set late even so pekkas sleepgummed eyelids told just how beastly early it was you dont treat aunt elimaki this way do you she asked wishing either for tea which she could get or another couple of hours sleep which she wouldnt of course not her son said virtuously that as pekka knew might mean anything or nothing youd better not she warned aunt elimaki is going to have a baby of her own and she needs all the sleep she can get she wont get it later thats for sure leino sounded as sandbagged as pekka all right mother all right father uto by contrast might have been the soul of virtue he patted pekka on the arm are you going to have another baby too mother i dont think so pekka answered she and leino smiled at each other if she wasnt it was in spite of last nights exertions she yawned and sat up in bed somewhat resigned to being awake what would the two of you like for breakfast anything leino said before his son could speak almost anything at all down in the land of the ice people i counted for a good cook if you can believe it im so sorry for you pekka exclaimed the horror of that idea was plenty to rout her out of bed and into the kitchen she got the teakettle going then folded fat fresh shrimp into an omelette along with fried mashed turnips and bread and butter olive oil was an imported luxury in kuusamo not a staple it made a fine breakfast uto inhaled everything he wasnt picky in what he ate he chose other ways to make himself difficult leino ate hugely too and put down cup after cup of tea thats so much better he said will you be able to sleep at all tonight pekka asked him he nodded and opened his eyes very wide which made uto laugh oh aye he said i wont have any trouble i may have to eat seal every now and again down in the land of the ice people but theres plenty of tea the lagoans drink even more of it than we do they say it lubricates the brain and i cant argue with them seal uto sounded horrified but looked interested what does it taste like greasy fishy his father answered we eat camel too sometimes thats better at least for a while it sort of tastes like beef but its fatter meat the ice people live on camel and reindeer almost all the time are they as ugly as everybody says uto asked no leino said which obviously disappointed his son then he added theyre uglier and everything was right with the world as far as uto was concerned hurry up and get ready for school pekka told him he greeted that with moans and groans now that his parents were back in kajaani he wanted to spend as much time as he could with them pekka was inflexible youll be back this afternoon and you need to learn things besides youre the one who got us up early that produced as many more groans as shed thought it would but uto wearing a martyred expression eventually went out the door and headed for school privacy leino said when he was gone id almost forgotten what it means there in the little sorcerers colony east of mizpah everybody lives in everybody elses belt pouch all the time its not quite so bad over in the naantali district pekka started to laugh and now weve both said more than we should have leino nodded he took keeping secrets seriously his voice was thoughtful musing as he said the naantali district eh nothing but empty space in those parts i cant think of anybody whod want to go there or need to go there which probably makes it perfect for whatever youre doing he held up a hand im not asking any questions and even if i did i know you couldnt give me any answers thats right pekka sent him a challenging stare well now that weve got this privacy what shall we do with it oh maybe well think of something leino pulled his tunic off over his head pekka didnt know if either of them had been so ardent even on their honeymoon theyd spent that at a small hostel in priekule and had alternated making love and sightseeing now they just had each other and they were intent on making the most of it before they both had to return to the war im not quite so young as i used to be leino said at some point that morning when after several days of horizontal exercises he failed to rise to the occasion dont worry about it pekka said youve done fine believe me her body felt all aglow so that it seemed they would hardly need the bedchamber lamp that evening i wasnt worried leino said the people who worry about things like that are the ones who think theres only one way to get from hither to yon mages know better or if they dont they ought to with fingers and tongue he showed her what he meant he was right too that road worked as well as the other one when pekkas breathing and heartbeat had slowed to something close to normal she said they talk about women wearing men out this is the other way round she ran a hand down his smooth chest kuusamans werent a very hairy people not that im complaining mind you i hope not leino said this is like putting money in olavins bank elimakis husband these days was keeping the finances of the kuusaman army and navy straight but pekka understood what her own husband meant he went on we dont get many chances now so we have to make the most of them put them away in our memory bank they may not earn interest but theyre interesting thats one word pekka remarked leinos hands had started wandering again too but when one of them found its way between her legs she said wait a bit i really have done everything i can right now lets see what i can do for you she crouched beside him her head bobbing up and down rather sooner than shed expected she pulled away taking a couple of deep breaths and choking a little well well leino said i didnt think i had it in me you certainly did pekka went over to the sink and washed off her chin youll have to excuse me now her husband said curling up on the bed im going to sleep for about a week he offered a theatrical snore it made pekka smile but it didnt convince her a likely story she said youll be feeling me up again before uto gets home who was just doing what to whom leino asked and pekka had no good answer he stretched out again then said i love you you know i love you too she said thats probably why weve been doing all this can you think of a better reason leino said this is a lot more fun than being lonely and jumping on the first halfway decentlooking person you find aye pekka said and wished fernao hadnt chosen that moment to cross her mind again vanai poured out wine and listened to ealstan pour out excitement he is pybba is by the powers above her husband said sure as im sitting here hes funneling money into things that hurt the algarvians good for him vanai said do you want some sausage its the first time in a while the butcher had some that looked even halfway decent sausage oh aye ealstans voice was far away hed heard what she said but he hadnt paid much attention to it his mind was on pybbas accounts if hes fighting the algarvians maybe ill finally get the chance to fight them too i mean really fight them and maybe youll get in trouble too vanai said for all you know his accounts are like a spiderweb set up to catch somebody whos not quite as smart as he thinks he is she put a length of sausage on ealstans plate and then set a hand on her own belly please be careful of course ill be careful but ealstan didnt sound as if that were the first thing on his mind or even the fourth or fifth he sounded annoyed at vanai for reminding him he might need to have a care youre a man sure enough vanai thought youll do whatever you please and then blame me if it doesnt work out the way you want she sighed how is the sausage she asked ealstan suddenly seemed to notice what hed been devouring for supper oh its very good he said vanai sighed again as soon as ealstan finished eating he started going on about pybba some more short of clouting him in the head with a rock vanai didnt know how to make him shut up but when he declared its practically my patriotic duty to see whats going on she lost patience with him you are going to do this thing she said i can tell youre going to do it and you wont listen to me no matter what i say but i am going to say this dont go charging straight ahead as if you had four legs and two big horns and no brains at all if you do that i have the bad feeling youll disappear one day and ill never see you again dont be silly he answered which really made her want to clout him in the head with a rock but he went on im my fathers son after all i dont go blindly charging into things that held enough truth to give her pause but not enough fully to reassure her ealstan was his fathers son but he was also a redblooded forthwegian vanai knew that without fully understanding it forthweg was her homeland but she didnt love it the way forthwegians did why should she a good part of the overwhelming forthwegian majority would have been just as well pleased if she and all the kaunians in the kingdom disappeared and now a lot of the kaunians in the kingdom were disappearing thanks to the algarvians and thanks to forthwegians not sorry to see them go those thoughts flashed through her mind in a moment she hardly missed a beat in answering i hope you dont youd better not i wont truly ealstan sounded perfectly confident he also sounded perfectly blockheaded vanai couldnt tell him that it wouldnt have made him pay attention to her and would have made her angry what she did say was remember youve got a lot to live for here at the flat she wondered if she ought to pull off her tunic and skin out of her drawers that would remind him of what he had to live for if nothing else did patriot or no he was wild for lovemaking a good deal wilder than she was at the moment with pregnancy making her desire fitful but she shook her head as if hed asked her to strip herself naked she had too much pride too much dignity for that shed been major spinellos plaything she wouldnt make herself anyone elses not that way ealstan pointed to her for a moment she thought he was going to ask her to do what shed just rejected she took a deep breath she was ready to scorch him but he said your sorcerys slipped you need to set it right you especially need to keep it strong now mezentios men have been taking a demon of a lot of people out of the kaunian quarter lately oh vanais anger evaporated all right thank you she always kept the golden yarn and the dark brown in her handbag she got them twisted them together and chanted the spell shed devised when she was done she turned to ealstan and said is it good its fine ealstans smile was suddenly shy im sorry you cant look like yourself the way youre supposed to look i mean all the time youre very pretty when you look like a forthwegian dont get me wrong but i think youre beautiful when you look like a kaunian i always have from the day i first saw you have you vanai said ealstans nod was shy too as few things did that little show of embarrassment reminded her she was a year older than he hed been fifteen when they first met in the oak wood between oyngestun and gromheort his beard only darkening fuzz on his cheeks he looked like a man now and acted like a man and he wanted to fight like a man vanai didnt know what to do about that she feared she couldnt do anything about it she let him make love to her when they went to bed it made him happy and that made her happy though she didnt kindle one thing she thought as she drifted toward sleep i dont need to worry about whether im going to have a baby now i know her spell had slipped again by the time she woke the next morning she hastily repaired it while ealstan ate barley porridge and gulped a morning cup of wine as it had the night before his smile reassured her she could cast the spell with no one checking her but shed find out the hard way if she made a mistake ealstan gave her an absentminded kiss and hurried out the door by the way he hurried vanai was sure he was heading to pybbas pottery works though he didnt say so she shook her head shed done everything she could to keep him safe he would have to do something for himself too she also had to go out to the market square while shed kept her kaunian looks ealstan had done the shopping getting out of the flat still seemed a miracle so much so that she didnt mind lugging food back beans olives cabbages so what just the chance to be out on the streets of eoforwic to see more than she could from her grimy window made up for the work she had to do the apothecarys shop where shed almost been caught out as a kaunian where the proprietor had killed himself rather than letting the algarvians try to torment answers out of him was open again under new ownership a sign in one window said new lower prices cried another sign a bigger one in the other window i might get medicines there vanai thought id never trust this new owner whoever he is with anything more he might be in the redheads belt pouch for all she knew the new owner might be a relative of the dead apothecary she still wouldnt trust him and he still might be in the algarvians pay she didnt trust the butcher either but for different reasons suspicion that he called mutton lamb that he put grain in his sausages when he swore he didnt that his scales worked in his favor writers had complained about such tricks in the days of the kaunian empire brivibas no doubt could have cited half a dozen examples with appropriate citations vanai bit her lip her grandfather wouldnt be citing any more classical authors half the distress she felt was at not feeling more distress now that he was dead marrow bones would flavor soup the butcher said they were beef they might have been horse or donkey vanai couldnt have proved otherwise there for once the lie if it was one was reassuring the gizzards he sold her probably did come from chickens they were too big to belong to crows or pigeons i wouldnt have had em by this afternoon he told her i know that she answered and took them away when she got out on the street people were nudging one another and pointing look at him somebody said who does he think he is somebody else a woman added what does he think he is another woman said vanai didnt want to look she was too afraid of what shed see a kaunian whose magic had run out most likely if the fellow had dyed hair he wouldnt look exactly like a kaunian but he wouldnt look like a forthwegian either before long the cry for algarvian constables would go up horrid fascination didnt take long to turn vanais eyes in the direction of the pointing fingers the man at whom people were pointing didnt look just like a forthwegian but he wasnt an obvious kaunian either halfbreed vanai thought eoforwic held more than the rest of forthweg put together her hand flattened on her belly she held one herself then she gasped because she recognized the man ethelhelm the name slipped from her lips almost by accident in a moment it was in everyones mouth and the singer and drummer grinned at the crowd that had been so hostile and now paused uncertain waiting to hear what he would say hello folks his voice was relaxed easy i often use a little magic so i can go out and about without people bothering me it mustve worn off can i give you a song to make up for startling you hed told a great thumping lie and vanai knew it the redheads were hungry for ethelhelm but the crowd didnt know that with one voice they shouted aye they might have mobbed an ordinary kaunian or halfbreed whose luck had run out with his magic ethelhelm wasnt ordinary he might have lost his magic but he still had some luck and he still had his voice he grabbed a wooden bucket from someone turned it upside down and used it to beat out a rhythm as he sang after one song he carefully picked one that said nothing about the algarvians the crowd howled for another the impromptu concert was still going on when vanai left hell get away she thought hell keep playing till he satisfies them then get off somewhere by himself and renew his spell and then hell be an ordinary forthwegian the same way im an ordinary forthwegian but that wasnt quite right the algarvians wanted ethelhelm because of who he was not what he was vanai shook her head in slow wonder shed finally found somebody worse off than she was when skarnu had visited zarasai by himself he hadnt been much impressed it was a southern provincial town without much going for it that a man from priekule could see returning to it with amatu and lauzdonu was unpleasantly like torture the two valmieran nobles whod come back from lagoas seemed to him to be doing their best to get caught his temper didnt take long to kindle when he got them alone in the flat the underground had found for them he snapped why dont you just carry signs that say we hate king mezentio then the constables would nab you and the people who really know what theyre doing could get back to doing it instead of spending half their time saving you whenever you go outside you risk yourselves and everybody who helped you get here in one piece sorry said lauzdonu who had some vestiges of sense the kingdoms changed a lot more than we thought it had since we flew our dragons south instead of giving up aye amatu had a sharp rather shrill voice that would have irritated skarnu no matter what he said when he said things like its changed for the worse thats what its done he irritated skarnu all the more and then he went on it looks like nine people out of every ten are stinking traitors thats what it looks like and im not so bloody sure about the tenth chap either he looked skarnu full in the face as he made that perhaps impolitic remark im not supposed to bash him in the head skarnu reminded himself were on the same side were supposed to be anyhow people are trying to live their lives he said you cant blame them for that whats a waiter to do if an algarvian comes into his eatery throw him out the poor whoresond get arrested or more likely blazed and whod arrest him lauzdonu put in not the redheads most likely itd be a valmieran constable you bet it would theyre the real traitors amatu snarled they all need shortening by a head powers below eat em he was quick to condemn and the waiters too if an algarvian comes into their eatery the redhead ought to go out with a case of the runs or the pukes thatd teach him a lesson so it would skarnu agreed the lesson being that something dreadful ought to happen to the waiter who messed with his stew or his chop you havent got any sense amatu you havent got any balls skarnu retorted the noble returned from exile lauzdonu had to step between them stop he said stop if we quarrel who laughs mezentio thats who that was enough to halt skarnu in his tracks amatu still seethed i ought to call you out he snarled aye go ahead imitate the algarvians skarnu said that brought the other noble up short where nothing else had done the job pushing his edge skarnu went on can we look for ways to hurt the enemy instead of each other you dont seem to know who the enemy is but now amatu only sounded sulky not incandescent we do what we can skarnu answered we came here remember because a lot of ley lines run south through zarasai we want to keep the redheads from sending kaunians to the seashore and slaughtering them to strike at lagoas and kuusamo amatus lip curled maybe you came here for that i came here to strike at the algarvians and their lickspittle lapdogs who cares what happens to the kingdoms on the far side of the strait of valmiera doing his best to be reasonable lauzdonu said except for unkerlant theyre the only two kingdoms still in the fight against algarve that counts for something all he got was another sneer from amatu skarnu said my lord if youre not interested in doing the job you were sent here to do if youd sooner do what you think best you can do that but youll have to move out of this flat and find one on your own and youll have to strike at the redheads on your own too no one from the underground will help you find a flat on my own amatu looked horrified without a doubt hed never had to look for lodgings in his whole life skarnu wondered if he had any idea how to go about it by his expression probably not the fight against algarve is bigger than any one man skarnu knew he sounded like a particularly gooey kind of recruiting poster but he didnt much care anything to get some use out of amatu all right all right the returned exile threw his hands in the air im yours do with me as you will and once youre done once i have time of my own have i got your gracious leave to go after the algarvians in my own way he bowed himself almost double he really did want to go after the redheads skarnu recognized as much the trouble was he made almost every valmieran commoner and a lot of nobles want to go after him when betrayal was as simple as a word whispered in the ear of a valmieran constable that wouldnt do skarnu had to remember to bow back lest amatu think he was offering a deadly insult of course you may as long as you try not to do anything thatll get us killed or captured and tortured betraying our friends isnt what weve got in mind either i understand that im not an idiot amatu said testily though skarnu might not have agreed with him the noble went on ill haunt the caravan depot if thats what you need from me if i could sleep upside down in the rafters like a bat id do that are you satisfied no skarnu said at once which made amatu glare at him all over again he went on you and lauzdonu and a lot of other people we dont even know will wander through the depot every so often not often enough to make the algarvians or their valmieran hunting dogs notice us if we see anything powers above if we smell anything because those cars stink theres a little eatery where we can go in the back of that eatery theres a crystal heres hoping we dont have to use it aye lauzdonu said that would mean trouble for us and trouble for the poor kaunians in the caravan car too he had some basic sense of reality amatu skarnu wasnt so sure about him he might have forgotten what hed promised a moment before now he said hang around in the depot oh very well he gave a martyred sigh but if i were a woman or viscount valnu i might get arrested for soliciting no not like that skarnu said again dont hang around wander through pause on a platform when a caravan comes in from the north or east wander off again buy yourself a mug of ale or a news sheet kill time beastly lies in the news sheets amatu said of course there are skarnu agreed but knowing how the enemy is lying is military information too that seemed to startle the other noble who thought for a bit before nodding amatu had probably been fine fighting on dragonback his headlong aggressiveness matched his mounts skarnus opinion was that his brainpower also matched his mounts but that was nothing he could say he decided not to trust amatu alone in the leyline caravan depot at least at first to his relief the returned exile seemed glad for company not irate because skarnu was coming with him he probably hasnt realized why im coming along skarnu thought im not going to tell him either bloody ugly building amatu remarked as they walked up to the redbrick depot skarnu agreed with him but he hadnt come as an architecture critic once they got inside he studied the board then pointed amatu nodded aye platform three he said skarnu didnt stomp on his toes to make him shut up but couldnt have said why he didnt he was more merciful than hed suspected that was all on the way to platform three he bought some ale and a news sheet amatu refused to buy a news sheet and made a horrible face when he tasted his ale skarnu wondered if his comrade were trying to get them both caught if he were in algarvian pay skarnu didnt think so but stupidity and arrogance could be as deadly as treason the caravan that stopped at the depot seemed ordinary it had no passenger cars with wooden shutters nailed over the windows no baggage cars from which came the stench of crowded filthy people well this was a waste of time wasnt it amatu said aye it was but we didnt know ahead of time that it would be skarnu answered in a much lower voice thats why we keep an eye on the depot because we dont know ahead of time i mean amatu accepted that even if reluctantly he was glad to leave the depot though alone skarnu would have hung around for a while longer with amatu for a comrade he was delighted to get away unscathed he let out a silent sigh of relief when they got past the pair of valmieran constables standing at the entranceway once they reached their street amatu started toward their block of flats without the least hesitation wait skarnu murmured and took him by the arm lets walk past lets not go inside why not for a wonder amatu kept his voice down ive never seen those fellows lounging by the stairway skarnu answered beggars usually have their own turfs those fellows are new their rags look too clean and so do they theyve never missed a meal i think theyre constables no curse you dont stare at them lauzdonu amatu began skarnu had become a better actor than he would have imagined in his carefree days in priekule without seeming to break stride he contrived to step on amatus foot and make the noble hop and curse for good measure he stuck an elbow in the pit of amatus stomach too shut up you cursed fool he hissed they may have him already odds are they do for another wonder amatu heeded him and said not another word till theyd turned the corner then in tones more subdued than he usually used he asked what do we do now we go to that eatery skarnu answered patiently we talk on the crystal just long enough to let people know theres trouble here after that we disappear again this isnt my town you know nor mine powers above be praised for that amatu said all right the eatery no suspiciously wellfed tramps lingered outside but when skarnu casually asked after the waiters health the fellow answered that he was fine and didnt use the words he was supposed to skarnu ordered ale and a plate of smoked beef tongue for himself and amatu they ate and drank paid the scot and left no good amatu asked no good skarnu agreed theyre waiting for people in the underground to come in and show themselves if wed done it we wouldnt have walked out again what do we do now amatu asked again walk around for a while skarnu answered they cant have grabbed everybody in zarasai somebody will give us a hand i hope he thought oh by the powers above how i hope otherwise im stuck here with the worst excuse for an underground man the world has ever known and no way to get free of him the bigger of the two unkerlanter soldiers whod come east into the duchy of grelz was named gandiluz the smaller one was tantris they were both back with garivalds band of irregulars these days tantris did most of the talking for them now that the trees are in full leaf again things favor you he declared youve got to strike the algarvians and their grelzer puppets one stinging blow after another well do what we can of course garivald answered but look around were not a big band tantris waved that aside as if of no account and youve got a mage where garivald asked in real perplexity there the unkerlanter regular pointed at sadoc garivald threw his hands in the air oh by the powers above he howled munderic thought the same bloody thing every time sadoc tried a spell something would go wrong every stinking time sometimes itd be something big sometimes just something little but something would always happen he turned his furious glare on sadoc tell em yourself am i right or am i wrong well aye youre right sadoc said but thats only so far i think i know what ive been doing wrong ill be better from here on out a likely story garivald growled he turned back to the pair of unkerlanter regulars are you both daft do you want to get the lot of us killed before you can squeeze any kind of proper use out of us of course not gandiluz said shut up tantris told him and shut up he did tantris returned his attention to garivald what we want to do should be as plain as the nose on my face he had a formidable unkerlanter beak we want to do the most harm we can to the algarvians with this band of irregulars it stands to reason that we can do more using magecraft than we can without it if weve got a mage here we ought to get what we can out of him if we had a mage here that would be a good idea obilot put in what weve got is sadoc so you can forget about it garivald sent her a grateful glance im sure hes not a firstrank mage like the ones theyve got in cottbus tantris began hes not even a fifthrank mage like the worthless drunk they sent to zossen my home village garivald said what he is is a disaster waiting to happen i wont be that bad from now on sadoc insisted i truly wont i can do just about anything now i know i can that was one of the more frightening things garivald had heard sadoc scared him almost as much as had the algarvian officer whod told him hed be boiled alive in herborn the capital of grelz the algarvian had turned out to be wrong garivald was sure sadoc was wrong too he scowled at the unkerlanter irregulars whod encouraged the wouldbe mage to new dreams of glory if you want to get the most out of us why dont you just cut our throats and use our life energy against the redheads tantris didnt turn a hair weve thought about that if we have to well do it he and gandiluz were king swemmels only formal representatives within the clearing the irregulars could have blazed them down and buried them with no one outside the woods the wiser but they didnt theyd been too accustomed for too long to doing what unkerlanter inspectors and impressers said when they couldnt get around it that is garivald hoped he could get around it here youve been in grelz for a few weeks weve been doing this ever since the algarvians came through he hadnt not quite but swemmels men didnt need to hear that dont you think we know whether weve got a mage here or not what we think is you havent been using him the right way tantris said and gandiluz nodded to show he was part of that we tantris went on its especially important to hit the algarvians now to make it hard for them to bring men and beasts to the fighting front southwest of here from behind tantris somebody said weve heard nothing but how this is especially important and thats especially important and the other thing is especially important too when its all especially important none of its especially important well this truly is tantris said if the algarvians win the summers fight were almost as bad off as we were last year they might even have another go at sulingen curse em but if we win it then theyre the ones who have to worry how is sadocs magecraft going to make a coppers worth of difference garivald demanded i mean how would it make any difference if he had any magecraft he will disguise us as we charge down on the enemy tantris declared sadoc nodded he thought he could do it but garivald had seen how sadoc had thought he could do any number of things he couldnt do here garivald didnt have to do any complaining the other irregulars did it for him the woods were alive with the sound of outrage obilot proved most articulate if you use us to charge down on the enemy you use us once i thought the point of a band of irregulars was stinging the enemy again and again weve done that we can keep doing it too if you leave any of us alive to do it saving the kingdom comes first gandiluz said for once speaking ahead of his comrade saving the band comes only after that garivald nodded fine you show me how charging down on a bunch of grelzers or even redheads will save the kingdom and well do it till you show us that well hit the foe and run away the way weve been doing for almost two years now thats what efficiency is all about isnt it tantris gave him a dirty look youre not cooperating his majesty will hear of this im doing my best garivald said tell me what you want lets see if we cant do it without magecraft a company of grelzers will march past these woods day after tomorrow tantris said you ought to attack them he didnt say how he knew that was supposed to make him seem knowledgeable and impressive but garivald had a good idea of all the ways he might know magic was one getting the news from a grelzer soldier was another a grelzer clerk a third gossip would work about as well as patriotism or treason from a grelzer point of view or of course it could have been a trap but none of that mattered a certain amount of common sense did garivald waved look at us its been a hard winter i dont care if you disguise us as behemoths or butterflies how likely are we to take out a company of soldiers say that ferocious company of grelzers though algarve wouldnt have a chance of winning the war without them obilot said her sarcasm finally got under tantris hide he snapped be silent woman as if he were her husband back in a peasant village she was carrying her stick of course she was hardly ever without it as if by magic the business end suddenly pointed at tantris belly if you want to come here and make me come right ahead she said pleasantly gandiluz started to move to flank her not you garivald told him also pleasantly talking back to the regulars got easier the more he did it he aimed his stick at gandiluzs midriff gandiluz stopped moving he didnt stop weighing his chances though neither did tantris king swemmel might have sent out petty tyrants but he hadnt chosen cowards in the confrontation everyone had forgotten about sadoc the peasant whod struggled so hard to become a mage was dark with fury there is a power point in these woods and im going to use it he growled his hands moving in swift passes that certainly looked confident and competent garivald youll pay for mocking me garivald knew a certain amount of alarm but less than he had going into combat against the grelzers theyd made it plain they knew what they were doing when they tried to kill him sadoc hadnt proved any such thing dont be a bigger jackass than you can help garivald suggested and youll pay for that too sadoc said i can call down lightnings out of a clear blue sky i can and i will he raised his hands to the heavens and cried out words of power or they might have been nonsense syllables for all garivald knew but power gathered in the air garivald could feel it hed felt it before when sadoc tried to do this that or the other thing the wouldbe wizard could prepare for a spell what came after the preparations though sadoc stop it this instant now obilots voice came sharp as a whipcrack garivald wasnt the only one who felt that building power then as a matter of fact gandiluz felt it too you see he said to garivald he can be what we need against algarve my arse garivald said succinctly no my arse sadoc said you can kiss it garivald he brought down his hands in a gesture filled with hate and lightning followed garivald fell to the ground stunned and blinded by the bluewhite stroke thunder roared around him for a couple of heartbeats he thought he really was dead but then like the rest of the irregulars he staggered to his feet sadoc was still upright looking in astonishment at what hed done like everybody elses garivalds gaze followed his oh you idiot garivald said astonished at how few shakes his voice held he blinked but it would be a while before he stopped seeing the world through green and purple snakes you big clumsy futtering idiot there stood tantris he was shaking shaking like a leaf and there beside him lay the charred smoking ruins of gandiluz one unkerlanter regular who would never report back to king swemmel again sadoc had called down the lightning all right but not on the target hed had in mind iim sorry he stammered i really am i aimed to hit you with that garivald i probably shouldnt have done that either should i no you bloody clot garivald snapped he rounded on tantris again well he demanded are you going to tell me some more about how sadoc is the unicorn youre going to ride to victory and hell gore everything that gets in front of you out of the way tantris was still gaping at the remains of his comrade the stench of burnt meat filled the clearing garivald had to repeat himself to get his attention when he did tantris shuddered he leaned over and was noisily sick garivald nodded to the irregular closest to him the man gave tantris a canteen after hed rinsed his mouth and spat he violently shook his head im not going to tell anybody anything not for a while he answered thats the first sensible thing youve said since you got here garivald told him but tantris shook his head no we really do need to do everything we can to keep the redheads from moving supplies through grelz however we do it however we do it aye garivald said suppose you let us find our way instead of telling us yours tantris looked at gandiluzs corpse again he gulped he said not another word eleven no one could have come near the fighting line through the great woods of western unkerlant without knowing two armies grappled there the ignorant travelers nose would have told him if nothing else did istvan was no ignorant traveler but he smelled the reek of unwashed bodies the fouler stench of imperfectly covered latrines and the sharp tang of woodsmoke too and yet at this season of the year those stinks were almost afterthoughts in the air everything was green and growing broadleafed trees bare through the winter had cloaked themselves anew so had the bushes and ferns that grew under them pines and firs and balsams stayed in leaf the year around but the sap rising in them put out spicy notes istvans nostrils appreciated he also appreciated the lull in the fighting were on the defensive he told captain frigyes when the new company commander came forward to inspect the redoubt and theyre on the defensive too put it all together and it means theres not a whole lot of action sometimes the stars shine on us frigyes said he was a big man burly even by gyongyosian standards with a scar on his right cheek we have troubles out in the islands the unkerlanters have troubles off in the east put it all together and they dont want to be fighting here and neither do we captain tivadar might have said the same thing istvan missed his longtime superior but frigyes looked to be a solid officer and he knew nothing of why istvan and several of his squadmates bore scars on their left hands istvan looked around all of his troopers were busy with other things he could bring out a question perhaps improper for a man of a warrior race why dont we go ahead and make peace then because we would betray our algarvian allies if we did and theyve struck some heavy blows at the accursed kuusamans frigyes answered also because king swemmel hasnt shown any interest in making peace may the stars withhold their light from him anyone would reckon swemmel the warrior istvan thought uncomfortably but hes just a madman everybody knows that even his own soldiers know it but why do they fight so hard for a madman enjoy this while it lasts frigyes told him it wont last forever sooner or later the algarvians will strike their blow as they do every spring then odds are theyll drive the unkerlanters back again and then the unkerlanters will hit us again here im sorry sir istvan frowned i dont follow that how likely is swemmel to get summer victories against algarve frigyes asked not very not if you look at whats happened the past two years so if the unkerlanters want wins to keep their own people happy theyll try to get them against us oh that made an unpleasant amount of sense it was also an insult of sorts were easier than the algarvians are we we shouldnt be easier than anyone were easier than the algarvians aye frigyes didnt seem insulted they can bring their whole apparatus of war with them we cant all weve got here in these woods are some of the best footsoldiers in the world he slapped istvan on the back climbed out of the redoubt and went on his way istvan turned to his squad the captain says gyongyos has some of the best footsoldiers in the world he hasnt seen you lazy buggers in action yet thats what i think there hasnt been any action for a while szonyi said which was also true do you really want much kun asked even if he did wear spectacles he could ask a question like that hed seen as much desperate fighting as any man in the woods istvan possibly excepted had one of the newer men put the question szonyi would have felt compelled to puff out his chest and act manly as things were he shrugged and answered itll probably come whether i want it or not so whats the point of worrying a red squirrel was rash enough to show its head around the trunk of a birch istvans stick ready for unkerlanters was ready for a squirrel too it fell into the bushes under the trees nice blazing sergeant lajos said something good for the pot kun sighed by the time you skin it and gut it theres hardly enough meat on a squirrel to be worth bothering about thats not why youre complaining istvan said as he left the redoubt to collect the squirrel i know why youre complaining youre a born city man and you never had to worry about eating things like squirrels before they sucked you into the army in the bushes the squirrel was still feebly thrashing istvan found a rock and smashed its head a couple of times then he carried it back by the tail pausing once or twice to brush away fleas he hoped he got them all if he didnt hed do some extra scratching doesnt seem natural eating something like that kun said as istvans knife slit the squirrels belly whats not natural is going hungry when theres good food around istvan said his squadmates spoke up in loud agreement they came off farms or out of little villages gyongyos was a kingdom of smallholdings towns were market centers administrative points they werent the heart of the land as hed heard they were elsewhere on derlavai and stewed squirrel no matter what kun thought of it was tasty kun didnt complain when it was ladled out to him by then it had got mixed up with everything else in the pot mixed to where you couldnt point at any one chunk of meat and say this is squirrel off to the south somebody started lobbing eggs at somebody else istvan had no idea whether it was the unkerlanters or his own countrymen whoever it was he hoped theyd stop it captain frigyes came back the next day with a mage in tow that made kun perk up it always did men the new company commander said this is major borsos hes going to be well by the stars so it is istvan exclaimed no offense sir but i figured youd be dead by now he saw blank expressions all around him including the one on borsos face he explained sir i fetched and carried for you on obuda when you were dousing out where the kuusaman ships were oh major borsos face cleared he was a major by courtesy so ordinary troopers would fetch and carry for him hed been a captain by courtesy out on the island in the bothnian ocean so hed come up a bit in the world istvan had been a common soldier then so he had too good to see you again borsos said a beat slower than he might have istvan suspected the mage didnt really remember him he shrugged borsos had seen a lot since then as he had himself and kun looked as green with envy as the tarnished bronze dowsing rods borsos had used on obuda istvan smiled that was worth something frigyes said i didnt expect it to be old home week here but major borsos is going to do what he can to spy out the unkerlanters ah istvan said how will your dowsing sort through all the moving beasts and especially the moving leaves to find the moving unkerlanters eh major borsos beamed aye by the stars you did assist me sergeant or some dowser anyhow and he listened when he ran on at the mouth kun was standing behind his back and behind frigyes and looked to be on the point of retching istvan wanted to make a face back at him but couldnt borsos went on the answer is just as i have a dowsing rod attuned to the sea so ive also got one attuned to soldiers it hardly cares about leaves and it isnt much interested in beasts either though mountain apes might confuse it here ill show you he set down the leather satchel he was carrying it clanked he opened it and went through the rods finally grunting when he found the one he wanted doesnt look like much does it no sir istvan answered the dowsing rod wasnt of fresh shiny bronze or of the green patinaed sort either it looked like a thin length of rusty iron if those stains on it were rust kun was about to speak again istvan beat him to the punch pointing and asking unkerlanter blood borsos beamed again frigyes said my what a clever chap you turn out to be kun looked about ready to burst like an egg from rage and jealousy that made istvan happier than either officers reaction he had to live with kun all the time even so sergeant even so borsos answered beaming still by the law of similarity when i dowse with this rod ill sense motion from unkerlanters and very little from any other source he waved the rod as if it were a sword then thwacked it into the palm of his hand its not perfect dowsing isnt but its pretty good go ahead major captain frigyes said he wouldnt have talked like that to a real soldier of rank higher than his own lets see whats going on out there major borsos didnt take offense hed probably had officers real officers men of noble blood treat him a good deal worse he said aye captain just as you please holding the handle of the dowsing rod in both hands he swung it to the east murmuring as he did so he hadnt gone far before it dipped sharply something in that direction not far away unless i miss my guess oh thats where their scouts always hide sir szonyi said nothing much to worry about unless you feel a whole lot of the buggers no borsos said looking down at his hands as if asking them to speak more clearly after some thought he nodded no it doesnt feel like a lot of men one not far away that could well be so kun worked his little magic and said hes not moving toward us no borsos said what charm were you using there soldier he shrugged whatever it is it wont matter to me i never have been able to do much in the way of magecraft save for dowsing the art is in the blood or else its not with me its not unless i have a dowsing rod in my hand its very easy sir kun said and ran through it borsos tried the charm then shrugged again i cant tell if anyone is moving or not you have your gift i have mine and now i had better finish doing what i can do he started working the dowsing rod again kun looked proud that he could do something the dowser couldnt he didnt bother remembering that borsos could do something he couldnt something a great deal larger people istvan had noticed were often like that after sweeping through the entire halfcircle borsos turned to frigyes and said i see no vast hordes of unkerlanters set to sweep down on this redoubt of course if theyre more than a mile or so away i probably wont see them thats the range i can get out of this rod with a shrug he put it back into his valise thanks major captain frigyes said i didnt really expect an attack but its nice to know we havent got one building here he corrected himself before borsos could do it for him sir you could sense kuusaman ships out beyond the horizon istvan said why cant you see that far with your unkerlanter rod mainly because a big moving warship creates a lot more disturbance than even a whole lot of moving men the dowser answered men arent all moving in just the same direction some of them might even move away on purpose to confuse people like me this is a funny business im in no two ways about it istvan started to say that hed trade in a flash but checked himself borsos job brought him up to the front lines too and he was no great shakes at fighting back each sheep has its own pasture istvan thought he looked up and laughed a little his pasture came with altogether too many trees when hajjaj walked into general ikhshids office the portly officer started to get to his feet so he could bow dont bother general i pray you dont bother hajjaj said i am willing indeed i am eager to take the thought for the act youre kind your excellency very kind ikhshid wheezed since you say i may im more than content to stay down here on my arse believe me i am are you well general the zuwayzi foreign minister asked in some anxiety if ikhshid went down he didnt know who could replace him as a soldier ikhshid was better than competent but no more than that but he had the respect of every clanfather in zuwayza hajjaj couldnt think of any other officer who did with another wheeze the general answered ill last as long as i can and a little longer than that with any luck at all but i didnt ask you to drag your own set of old bones over here for that i wanted you to take a look at the map and tell me what you see he gestured toward the map of derlavai that took up most of one office wall no tea and wine and cakes hajjaj asked mildly if you want to waste time on frivolities ill send for em ikhshid answered otherwise id sooner talk about whats what from your charm anyone could guess youd served in the unkerlanter army hajjaj murmured that squeezed a breathy snort out of ikhshid hajjaj said i suppose we can dispense with ritual he studied the map i am pleased to note the advances our bold zuwayzi forces have made here in the north ikhshid snorted again this time in derision cut to the chase your excellency by the powers above cut to the chase you see that big ugly bulge down around durrwangen the same as i do there cant be a soldier on derlavai or on the island either who looks at the map and doesnt see that bulge not just soldiers hajjaj said some weeks ago marquis balastro assured me the algarvians would cut it off as soon as the ground dried he shook his head what a strange notion ground getting too wet for armies to move across it i mean ive seen it myself matter of fact ikhshid said itd be like trying to fight in a tin of cake batter thats what the muddy seasons all about down there but never mind that the grounds been dry enough to hold armies for a while now and the algarvians still havent moved how come you would do better to ask marquis balastro or his military attachй hajjaj replied i fear i cannot tell you i suppose not but i can tell you and im not an algarvian ikhshid said the thing of it is you think marshal rathar doesnt know whats coming next they might have come close to a surprise if theyd moved as soon as ever they could but now he shook his head now its a slugging match ah hajjaj studied the map if they strike there they wont have much of an advantage of maneuver will they ikhshid beamed so widely his face showed a net of wrinkles that didnt usually appear your excellency when i fall over dead they can paint stars on your arm and you can take over for me may you live to a hundred and twenty years then hajjaj exclaimed the only thing i want to do less than command a few soldiers in the field is command a lot of soldiers in the field and that is nothing but the truth as may be ikhshid said but you can see it too if rather cant hes dumber than i know he is why are mezentios men waiting then hajjaj asked only reason i can think of is to get everyone and everything into the fight ikhshid answered moving soldiers from every other part of the line pulling animals off the breeding farms young and half trained theyve hit unkerlant as hard as they could two summers in a row and king swemmel wouldnt fall over if they hit him again theyll try to hold a rock in their fist but finding the rock takes time hajjaj said ikhshid nodded well know more about how things look once they finally get around to fighting the battle when marquis balastro speaks of this hell guarantee algarvian victory hajjaj predicted of course he will thats his job hajjaj said your job though your job is to keep king shazli from listening to a pack of lies hajjaj bowed where he sat i have seldom met a zuwayzi with such a delicate understanding of what i do and what im supposed to do delicate my arse ikhshid said if my men tell me theyve seen thus and so in the unkerlanter lines and it turns out not to be thus and so at all i look like a fool and some good men end up dead if you tell king shazli what isnt so you can kill more zuwayzin than id ever dream of doing that unfortunately is true hajjaj got to his feet he knees and back and ankles creaked seriously ikhshid i hope you stay well the kingdom needs you and i would enjoy harassing a new commander a serious commander much less than i like bothering you well youre a wizened old thornbush but zuwayzas got used to having you around ikhshid said once more he didnt get up he sat on his hams his eyes turned to the map your excellency qutuz said when hajjaj returned to his own office the algarvian minister would confer with you why am i not surprised hajjaj murmured and then i will see him he says he will be here in half an hour qutuz said time enough for me to get dressed hajjaj let out a heartfelt sigh with the weather warmer than it was im starting to feel that im martyring myself for the sake of diplomacy again what if he comes naked qutuz asked what if he comes showing off his circumcision he sounded as queasy talking about that as a prim and proper sibian would have sounded while taking about going naked i dont expect it the zuwayzi foreign minister replied hes only done it a couple of times and then as much to startle us i think as to conform to our customs if he does if he does ill get out of my own clothes again and ill spend the time hes in my office not looking between his legs the idea of mutilating oneself and especially of mutilating oneself there left him queasy too he went on make sure you fetch in the tray of tea and wine and cakes with balastro i may want to spin things out as long as i can his secretary bowed everything shall be just as you say your excellency i doubt it hajjaj answered bleakly not even a firstrank mage can make that claim but we do what we can so we do hed started quietly baking in his algarvianstyle clothes when marquis balastro came strutting into his office the algarvian minister to hajjajs relief was himself clothed after the handshake and bows and protestations of esteem some of which approached sincerity hajjaj said you look extraordinarily dapper today your excellency balastro chortled how in blazes would you know hajjaj shrugged so much for diplomacy take a seat if youd be so kind qutuz will be here with tea and wine and cakes in a moment will he the algarvian minister sent him a sour look which means there are things about which you dont care to talk to me why am i not surprised but even as balastro grumbled he made a nest for himself in the pillows that took the place of chairs in hajjajs office tell me my friend since you cant very well say a barenaked man is looking dapper what do you say for polite chitchat along those lines hello old fellow your wens no bigger than it was the last time i saw you if its not hajjaj answered which made balastro laugh or you can talk about sandals or jewelry or hats hats do well aye i suppose they would with so little competition balastro nodded to qutuz who fetched in the traditional zuwayzi refreshments good to see you nice hat youre not wearing qutuz stooped to set the tray on hajjajs low desk then he bowed to balastro i thank you very kindly your excellency he replied in good algarvian i hope you like it just as much the next time you dont see it he bowed again and departed balastro stared after him then chortled again that ones dangerous hajjaj hell succeed you one of these days it could be hajjaj poured wine it was he saw date wine which meant qutuz hadnt been so diplomatic as all that zuwayzin were the only folk with a real taste for the stuff most people however prefer not to think of their successors and in this i must confess to following the vulgar majority at last as the tea and wine and cakes failed so did the small talk leaning forward a little hajjaj asked and how may i serve you today your excellency it appears likely that kaunian marauders have made their way back to forthweg from the refuge places zuwayza had unfortunately granted them balastro said i will have you know that king mezentio formally protests this outrage his protest is noted hajjaj replied be it also noted that zuwayza has done everything possible to prevent such unfortunate incidents our navy has sunk several boats sailing east toward forthweg for unknown but suspicious purposes how many more had slipped past zuwayzas small not very energetic navy he couldnt begin to guess balastros snort said he couldnt begin to guess either but assumed the number was large hajjaj didnt worry overmuch about that snort if the forthwegian kaunians were all that balastro had on his mind the zuwayzi foreign minister would be well content but snort aside balastro still had reasons to confer with hajjaj hajjaj had been mournfully certain he would and even on which topic sure enough balastro said you are doubtless wondering why we have not struck at the unkerlanters i hajjaj contrived to look innocent even if such a thought were in my mind balastro cut him off with a sharp gesture more the sort an unkerlanter might have used than anything he would have expected from an algarvian were getting ready thats all were not leaving anything to chance this time when we hit them were going to hit them with everything weve got and were going to smash them flat may it be so on the whole hajjaj meant it algarve was a nasty cobelligerent unkerlant was a nasty neighbor which was worse king swemmel rampant in triumph his mind shied away like a horse from a snake believe it balastro said fervently only believe it and it becomes that much likelier to be true he whose will fails first fails altogether its rather harder than that i fear hajjaj said if it werent you would not have needed to pause to gather all your forces in the south balastro stared at him as if astonished to be called on the inconsistency hajjaj didnt care not about that part of the diplomatists art was knowing when not to be diplomatic as cornelu urged the leviathan west islands rose up out of the sea he couldnt see all of them even if the leviathan stood on its tail but he knew how many lay ahead of him five goodsized ones one for each crown on the breast of the rubber suit he wore sibiu he whispered my sibiu the last time hed gone back to his sibiu the algarvian occupiers had killed his leviathan out from under him but the algarvians had done worse than that theyd killed his family out from under him even though costache and brindza remained alive he was glad this scouting mission didnt take him to tirgoviste town didnt take him to tirgoviste island how alert were mezentios men around facaceni island the westernmost of the main five if they were too alert of course he wouldnt bring the leviathan back to setubal but that would tell the lagoan naval officers something worth knowing too he kept an eye peeled for dragons another for leyline warships so far no sign of either the algarvians these days had a lot of coast to watch sibius of course but also their own and valmieras and jelgavas and forthwegs and cornelu supposed zuwayzas and yaninas as well the algarvian navy hadnt been enormous before the war began it also had to hold off unkerlants to try to keep an eye on the land of the ice people and to help colonial forces keep the sputtering war going in tropical siaulia looked at that way was it any wonder cornelu saw no warships maybe the lagoans and kuusamans could send a fleet into sibiu and snatch it out from under the algarvians noses maybe that was one of the reasons cornelu and his leviathan were here if they didnt spot any patrollers maybe mezentios minions were sending everything west for the big fight the fight that couldnt be ignored the fight against unkerlant what sort of garrison stayed in facaceni town real soldiers or beardless boys and grayhaired veterans of the six years war cornelu couldnt tell that not from the sea but lagoas and kuusamo were bound to have spies in the town too what were they telling the spymasters in setubal and yliharma and how much of what they were telling those spymasters could be believed on swam the leviathan pausing or turning aside now and again to snap up a fish somewhere along the coastline the algarvians would have men with spyglasses or perhaps mages watching for the approach of foes from the west cornelu and his leviathan would not draw the mages notice for he pulled no energy from the ley lines that powered fleets and to a man with a spyglass one spouting leviathan looked much like another for that matter from farther than a few hundred yards a spouting leviathan looked much like a spouting whale as he rounded the headland and neared facaceni town cornelu saw several sailboats bobbing in the water they wouldnt draw the notice of any mages either cornelu grimaced the algarvians had conquered sibiu through a daring reversion to the days before ley lines were known with a fleet of sailing ships that reached cornelus kingdom unseen and undetected in dead of night in a world of evergrowing complexity the simple approach had proved overwhelmingly successful he thought about going up to one of the boats and asking the fishermen for local news most sibians despised their algarvian overlords most but not all mezentios men recruited sibians to fight in unkerlant sibian constables helped the algarvians rule their countrymen a few folk genuinely believed in the notion of a union of algarvic peoples not pausing to think that such a union meant the algarvians would stay on top forever one of the fishermen saw cornelu atop his leviathan when the great beast surfaced he sent an obscene gesture cornelus way that probably meant cornelu hoped it meant he thought cornelu an algarvian but cornelu didnt find out by experiment when he got to facaceni town he spied a couple of dragons on patrol above it wheeling in the clear blue sky he noted them with grease pencil on a slate what he could not note was how many more dragons might rise into the sky on a moments notice if dragonfliers or mages spied something amiss facaceni town of course faced the derlavaian mainland faced toward algarve in fact all the major sibian towns did only the lesser ones turned toward lagoas and kuusamo part of that was because sibiu lay closer to the mainland than to the big island the rest was due to the way the ley lines ran in olden days before ley lines mattered so much sibiu had long contended with lagoas for control of the sea between them shed lost lagoas outweighed her but shed fought hard as an officer of the sibian navy cornelu knew the ley lines around his kingdom the way he knew the pattern of redgold hairs on the back of his right arm if anything he knew the ley lines better they mattered more to him he knew just when he could peer into the harbor of facaceni to see leyline warships if any were there to be seen and some were he cursed softly under his breath to spot the unmistakable bulk of a leyline cruiser and three or four smaller craft they were algarvian vessels too with lines slightly different from those of the warships the sibian navy had used a civilian spy might not have noticed the differences to cornelu once more they were obvious he saw no sibian vessels he didnt know where theyd gone he couldnt very well urge his leviathan into the harbor and ask he made more greasepencil notes he had a crystal with him if hed spotted something urgent he could have let the admiralty back in setubal know as things were he scribbled no algarvian mage no matter how formidable could possibly detect the emanations from a grease pencil some lagoan was probably peering into the harbor of tirgoviste town cornelu cursed softly again he didnt even know why he was cursing did he really want to lacerate himself by seeing his home town again did he really want to stare up the hills of tirgoviste town to see if he could catch a glimpse of his old home did he really want to wonder if the algarvians had put a cuckoos egg in his nest the trouble was part of him did the part that liked to pick scabs off scrapes and watch them bleed again most of the time he could keep that part in check every so often it welled up and got loose youre going back to janira he reminded himself that didnt stop him from wanting to see what costache was up to at this very moment but it helped him fight the craving down to the bottom of his mind again come on he told the leviathan weve done what weve come to do now lets go back to setubal hed almost said lets go home but setubal wasnt home and never would be tirgoviste town was home hed just come up with all the good reasons he didnt want to go there even so he knew the place would draw him like a lodestone till the day he died absently he wondered why a lodestone drew little bits of iron to it no mage had ever come up with a satisfactory explanation for that he shrugged in a way it was nice to know the world still held mysteries his leviathan of course made nothing of human speech he wondered what it thought he was doing playing some elaborate game he supposed more elaborate than it could have devised on its own he tapped its smooth skin that got it moving where words could not have it turned away from facaceni town and swam back in the direction from which it had come cornelu kept it underwater as much as he could he didnt want to draw the notice of those dragons over facaceni town and of whatever friends they had down on the ground again the leviathan didnt mind all sorts of interesting fish and squid swam just below the surface he took his bearing whenever it had to surface to blow that was enough to let him know when he rounded facaceni islands eastern headland someone there spotted him and flashed a mirror at him in an intricate pattern since he had no idea whether it was an algarvian signal or one from local rebels he kept his leviathan on the course it was swimming and didnt try to answer whoever was using it the mirror was a clever idea it involved no magic and if well aimed could be seen only near its target he found out in short order to whom the mirror belonged an egg flew through the air and burst in the sea about half a mile short of his leviathan another one followed a minute later it threw up a plume of water a little closer than the first had but not much nyah cornelu thumbed his nose at the algarvians on the headland cant hit me you couldnt hit your mother if you swung right at her face nyah that was bravado and he knew it facaceni lay farthest west of sibius main islands he expected to run a gauntlet before he could escape into the open ocean the algarvians would be after him like hounds after a rabbit hed had to run from them enough times before no not like hounds alone like hounds and hawks theyd surely put dragons in the air too and so they did a couple they flew search spirals but didnt happen to spot him and mezentios men sent out a couple of swift little leyline patrol boats after him but again only a couple he had no trouble making good his escape it was in fact so easy it worried him he kept anxiously looking around wondering what hed missed wondering what was about to drop on his head but nothing did after a while the pursuit never more than halfhearted simply gave up he had an easy time returning to the harbor at setubal he almost got killed before he could enter it though lagoan patrol boats were thick as fleas on a dog they could go almost anywhere in those waters more ley lines converged on setubal than on any other city of the world he got challenged three different times in the course of an hour and peremptorily ordered off his leviathan when the third captain decided he sounded like an algarvian to his surprise the fellow had a rider on his ship a man who examined the leviathan made sure it was carrying no eggs and took it into the port himself what happened cornelu asked over and over but no one on the patrol boat would tell him only after admiralty officials vouched for him was he allowed to learn the algarvians on sibiu had been quiet but the ones in valmiera hadnt theyd sneaked a couple of leviathanriders across the strait and the men had planted eggs on half a dozen warships including two leyline cruisers most embarrassing a sourfaced lagoan captain said in what he imagined was sibian but was in fact only algarvian slightly mispronounced most of the time that playing fast and loose with his language offended cornelu not today he wanted facts instead the captain gave him an opinion worst thing thats happened to our navy since you sibs beat it right outside of setubal here two hundred and fifty years ago it was at least an opinion calculated to put a smile on cornelus long dour face he asked what will you do now build more ships train more men give back better than we got the captain replied without hesitation we did that against sibiu too he was unfortunately correct here at least he and cornelu had the same enemy where do i make my report the sibian exile asked third door on your left the sourfaced captain answered well get our own back you wait and see cornelu didnt want to wait he hurried to the third door on his left in the summertime marshal rathar said durrwangen can get quite respectably warm oh aye i think so too general vatran agreed of course the naked black zuwayzin would laugh themselves to death to hear us go on like this i wont say youre wrong rathar shuddered i was up in the north for the end of our war against them you know he waited for vatran to nod then went on ghastly place sand and rocks and dry riverbeds and thornbushes and camels and poisoned wells and the sun blazing down and the zuwayzin fought like demons too till we broke em by weight of numbers and drove em straight into king mezentios arms vatran said mournfully and drove em straight into king mezentios arms rathar agreed he stared north across the battered ruins of durrwangen toward the algarvian lines not far outside of town then he turned to vatran you know if the redheads wanted to come straight at us they could push us out of here vatrans nod was stolid oh aye they could but they wont and how do you know that rathar asked with a smile how do i know vatrans shaggy white eyebrows rose ill tell you how by the powers above three different ways as he spoke he ticked off points on his gnarled fingers for one thing they learned at sulingen that coming straight at us doesnt pay and they havent had the chance to forget it yet for another theyre algarvians they never like doing anything simple if they can do it fancy and tie a big bow and red ribbons around it besides huh rathar said if thats not the truth curse me if i know what is you hush lord marshal i wasnt done vatran overacted reproach for a third all the signs show that theyre going to try to bite off the salient and trap us here and all the captives we take say the same thing i cant argue with any of that rathar said its your second reason that worries me a little though doing it fancy might mean setting us up for an enormous surprise but he shook his head theyre algarvians and that means they think theyre smarter than everybody else he sighed sometimes theyre right too but not always i dont think theyre right here theyd better not be vatran said if they are itll mean weve wasted a cursed lot of work in the salient weve done what we can rather said anybody who tries to break through there will have a rough time of it he sighed again of course the algarvians have done things i wouldve sworn were flatout impossible how they got into sulingen last summer they got in but they didnt get out again vatran sounded cheerful as he usually did rathar had a good soldiers confidence even a good soldiers arrogance but he was not by nature a cheerful man nobody whod served so long directly under king swemmel had an easy time being cheerful we beat them in the wintertime the same as we held them out of cottbus the winter before rathar said its summer now whenever they attack in the summer they drive us before them nobodys driving us out of this salient vatran said nobody and just because youre talking about what they have done whats that got to do with what theyre going to do not a fornicating thing says i rathar slapped him on the shoulder not so much for being right as for trying to raise both their spirits but if the algarvians had gone forward by great leaps in the two earlier summers of their war against unkerlant what was to keep them from going forward by great leaps in this third summer of the war unkerlanter soldiers thats what he thought unkerlanter behemoths unkerlanter dragons unkerlanter cavalry weve learned a lot from these redheaded whoresons the past two years now well find out if weve got our lessons right if they hadnt learned they would have gone under he knew no stronger incentive than that they might still go under if king mezentios men did break through what unkerlant had built here to hold them back but the algarvians would know theyd been in a fight they already knew theyd been in a fight a harder fight than theyd had anywhere in the east of derlavai vatran had been thinking with him invade our kingdom will they well teach them what we think of people who do things like that powers below eat me if we dont if we dont the powers below will eat both of us rathar said and vatran nodded they trudged through rubblestrewn streets or perhaps across what had been yards from which most of the rubble had been blown back toward the battered bank building where rather had made his headquarters a lot of eggs had fallen on durrwangen since but the building still stood banks had to be strong places that was one of the reasons rathar had chosen this one no sentries stood outside to snap to attention and salute as he and general vatran came up king swemmel would have had sentries out there swemmel insisted on show maybe because his sovereign did rathar didnt also of course sentries outside the building would have been likely to get killed when the algarvians tossed in some more of their endless eggs rathar had sent uncounted tens of thousands of soldiers to their deaths but he wasnt deliberately wasteful he hoped the war never made him so hard or simply so indifferent as that a horned lark hopped out of his way then leaped into the air to catch a fly the goldenbellied lark was svelte even plump it probably had a great brood of svelte even plump nestlings somewhere amid the ruins with so much dead but unburied flesh in durrwangen there were a great many flies to catch inside the headquarters building a sentry did salute the marshal and his general rathar nodded to the youngster then he spoke to vatran lets go look at the map he wondered how many times hed said that whenever he was worried undoubtedly hed been worried a lot vatran walked over to the map table with him algarvianheld bulges overlapped durrwangen to either side theyre good curse them vatran said who wouldve thought they had that counterattack in em we didnt thats certain rathar ruefully shook his head and weve paid for it and were liable to pay more he pointed to the map are these the best sites we could have picked for the centers archmage addanz thinks so vatran scowled are you ready to argue with him hed likely turn you into a frog he chuckled but the laughter sounded strained war would be easier without magecraft maybe it would rathar shrugged but ill argue with addanz if i have to ive asked him to come up to durrwangen he should be here soon ill argue with anyone and do anything i have to to win this war i dont like arguing with mages vatran said too many things they can do to you if you rub em the wrong way a soldier can generally slay a mage faster than a mage can get rid of a soldier rathar said serenely and magecraft even the simple stuff isnt easy if it were wed have mages running the world and we dont and a good thing too says i vatran exclaimed excuse me lord marshal the sentry came back to the map table sorry to bother you but the archmage is here good rathar said vatran looked as if he thought it was anything but the marshal continued send him right on back here weve got things to talk about he and i the sentry saluted and hurried up to the entrance he didnt just send the archmage back he brought him rathar nodded approval he rarely found fault with a man who exceeded his orders addanz was a wellgroomed man of middle years perhaps a little younger than rathar few old men served king swemmel vatran was an exception a lot of leaders of the generation ahead of rathars had chosen the wrong side in the twinkings war most of the others had managed to displease the king in the intervening years or hed killed them anyway to make others thoughtful or simply on a whim swemmel did as he chose that was what being king of unkerlant meant as long as a king lived swemmel had lived a surprisingly long time i greet you lord marshal addanzs voice was rich and smooth like strong tea with milk rathar was a long way from sure he was the best mage in unkerlant what he was without a doubt was the prominent mage with the fewest enemies hello archmage set beside addanz rathar felt himself to be all harsh stone and rough edges the archmage was a courtier rathar wasnt or was as little as he could get away with but regardless of what he wasnt he cursed well was a soldier and hed summoned addanz on soldiers business his index finger stabbed down at the map this center here the western one are you sure its where you want it if they break through past this line of low hills they may overrun it the closer the stronger so we have shown addanz answered with soldiers and magecraft to defend it it should serve well enough besides given how soon mezentios minions may strike at us have we got the time to move it and set it up again farther from the front rathar gnawed his lower lip mm youre likely right if i thought we had more time id still have you move it a bit youre liable to take a pounding from dragons too you know that would be so even if we did move it addanz answered rathar gnawed his lip some more the archmage went on and we have masked it as best we can both with magecraft and with such tricks as soldiers use he didnt sound patronizing he seemed to make a point of not sounding patronizing that only made rathar feel twice as patronized he shook his head addanz had won this round all right ill never complain about anyone who wants to get close to the enemy i just dont want the enemy getting too close to you too fast i rely on your valiant men and officers to keep such a calamity from happening addanz said ill blame them to swemmel if it does he didnt say that but he might have your mages know exactly what they have to do rathar persisted aye addanz nodded a year and a half before the notion had so rocked him he couldnt even think of it for himself how swemmel had laughed nothing rocked swemmel not if it meant holding on to his throne and now addanz took it for granted too the war against algarve had coarsened him as it had everybody else that was what war did distant thunder rumbled off to the south but there should have been no thunder not on a fine warm early summer day eggs thousands of eggs bursting at once rathar looked to vatran vatran was already looking to him its begun the marshal said vatran nodded rathar went on now well know one way or the other well know what addanz needed a moment to recognize the sound when the archmage did he blanched a little how shall i go back to the center now carefully rathar answered and threw back his head and laughed addanz looked most offended rathar hardly cared at last after longer than hed expected the waiting was over even sergeant werferth who had been a soldier for a long time first in forthwegs army and then in plegmunds brigade was impressed look at em boys he said just look at em you ever see so fornicating many behemoths in one place in all your born days sirdoc wrinkled his nose smell em boys he said doing his best to imitate his sergeant just smell em you ever smell so fornicating many behemoths in one place in all your born days everybody in the squad laughed even ceorl who was about as eager to fight sidroc as the unkerlanters even werferth who seldom took kindly to being lampooned they all had to laugh sidrocs joke held altogether too much truth algarve had indeed assembled a great host of behemoths to hurl against the western flank of the unkerlanter salient around durrwangen and those behemoths did indeed stink theyd been moving up toward the front for days now and the air was thick with the rottengrass reek of their droppings it was also thick with flies which buzzed around the behemoths and their droppings and which werent too proud to visit the waiting men and their latrines as well like the other soldiers in plegmunds brigade like the algarvians with them sidroc slapped all the time like everybody else he also did his best to be careful where he put his feet he knew all about stepping in horse turds who didnt by smelly experience but a horse turd dirtied the bottom of a shoe and maybe a bit of the upper behemoths were a lot bigger than horses their droppings were in proportion those who didnt notice them in the weeds and rank grassland and unattended fields had enormous reason to regret it an algarvian senior lieutenant named ercole had replaced the late captain zerbino as company commander sidroc wondered how ercole had got to be senior to anybody he doubted the redhead had as many years as his own eighteen ercoles mustache far from the splendid waxed spikes his countrymen adored was hardly more than copper fuzz but he sounded calm and confident as he said once the eggs stop falling we go in alongside the behemoths we protect them they protect us we all go forward together the cry is mezentio and victory he waited expectantly mezentio and victory shouted the forthwegians of plegmunds brigade the brigade might have been named after their own great king but it served algarves were any unkerlanters close enough to hear sidroc didnt suppose it mattered theyd soon hear a lot of that cry with the help of the powers above it would be the last cry a lot of them heard algarvian eggtossers began to fling then sidroc whooped at the great roar of bursts to the east of him and it went on and on seemingly without end there wont be anything left alive by the time theyre through he had to shout even to hear himself through the din oh yes there will sergeant werferth was shouting too his shout held grim certainty there always is curse it as if to prove him right on the spot unkerlanter eggtossers began hurling sorcerous energy back at the algarvians there didnt seem to be so many of them and they flung fewer eggs but they hadnt gone away either sidroc wished they would have he crouched in a hole scraped in the ground and hoped for the best not a lot of unkerlanter eggs were falling close by he approved of that and hoped it would go on algarvian dragons flew by overhead at what would have been treetop height had any trees grown close by they had eggs slung under their bellies to add to those the tossers were flinging not long after they struck swemmels men fewer eggs flew back toward the algarvian army of which plegmunds brigade was a part the pounding from the algarvian side kept on theyve put everything theyve got into this havent they sidroc shouted this time ceorl answered him aye they have including us sidroc grunted he wished ceorl wouldnt have put it quite like that he also wished he could have found some way to disagree with the ruffian at last after what seemed like forever but was probably a couple of hours the algarvian eggtossers stopped as abruptly as theyd begun all up and down the line officers whistles shrilled they didnt seem so much of a much not to sidrocs battered ears but they were enough to send men and behemoths trotting forward against the foe lieutenant ercole blew his whistle as lustily as anyone else forward he shouted mezentio and victory mezentio and victory sidroc shouted as he scrambled out of his hole he kept shouting it as he went forward too so did the rest of the forthwegians in plegmunds brigade they wore tunics they had dark hair and proud hooked noses even though they wore beards they didnt want excitable algarvians and what other kind were there taking them for unkerlanters and blazing them by mistake if anything or anyone had stayed alive in the tormented landscape ahead sidroc had trouble understanding how after a good part of a year in action he reckoned himself a connoisseur of ruined terrain and this churned smoking cratered ground was as bad as any hed ever seen and then off to his right a new crater opened a flash of sorcerous energy and a brief shriek marked the passage of an algarvian soldier someone shouted an altogether unnecessary warning theyve buried eggs in the ground all at once sidroc wanted to tippytoe forward then a little farther away an egg burst under a behemoth that one blast of sorcerous energy touched off all the eggs the behemoth was carrying its crew had no chance sidroc wondered if any pieces would come down or if the men were altogether destroyed and he couldnt tippytoe despite the buried eggs another of which blew up a soldier not too far from him however many eggs the tossers had rained down on the ground ahead they hadnt got rid of all the unkerlanters sidroc hadnt really expected they would but he had hoped no such luck swemmels men popped up out of holes and started blazing at the soldiers struggling through the belt of buried eggs going fast meant you might miss whatever signs there were on the ground to warn you an egg lay concealed beneath it going slow meant the unkerlanters had a better chance to blaze you shouting mezentio and victory at the top of his lungs sidroc dashed ahead he might get through to unblighted ground if he stayed where he was he would get blazed lieutenant ercole was shouting and waving all his men on so sidroc supposed hed done the right thing when the crews of the algarvian behemoths saw targets they lobbed eggs at them or blazed at them with heavy sticks fewer beams tore at the advancing soldiers men ahead of sidroc were battling unkerlanters in their holes he saw a man in a rockgray tunic show his head and shoulders as he looked for a target that was enough too much in fact sidroc blazed the unkerlanter down keep moving ercole screamed youve got to keep moving this is how we beat them with speed and movement by all the news sheets sidroc had read back in gromheort before joining plegmunds brigade by all the training hed had by all the fighting hed seen the company commander was right but it wouldnt be easy not here it wouldnt the unkerlanters had known they were coming had probably known for a long time theyd fortified this ground as best they could it didnt look like much but obstacles tree trunks ditches mud made the going slower than it would have been otherwise those obstacles also channeled the advancing men and behemoths in certain directions right into more waiting unkerlanters as soon as the algarvians and the men of plegmunds brigade got in among the first belt of unkerlanter defenders others farther back began blazing at them from long range more obstacles slowed their efforts to get at the unkerlanters who now revealed themselves men on both sides fell as if winnowed algarvian behemoths went down too here and there though few unkerlanter behemoths were yet in the fight at last around noon mezentios men cleared that first stubborn belt of defenders ercole was almost beside himself we arent keeping up with the plan he cried were falling behind sir weve done everything we could sergeant werferth said were still here were still moving not fast enough ercole stuck his whistle in his mouth and blew a long piercing blast onward for a furlong or so the going was easy sidrocs spirits began to rise then he heard the sharp flat roar of an egg bursting under another algarvian soldier he realized why no unkerlanters infested this stretch of ground theyd sown it with more eggs to slow up his advancing comrades what had been woods ahead had taken a demon of a beating but still offered some shelter enough that the unkerlanter behemoths emerging from it were an unwelcome surprise powers above sidroc exclaimed in dismay look at how many of the whoresons there are the behemoths started tossing eggs at plegmunds brigade and at the algarvian footsoldiers to either side of the forthwegians sidroc jumped into a hole in the ground he had plenty from which to choose so did ceorl but he jumped down in with sidroc anyhow sidroc wondered whether he wouldnt be safer facing the unkerlanter behemoths hard work today ceorl remarked as if hed been hauling sacks of grain or chopping wood aye sidroc agreed an egg burst close by shaking the ground and showering them with clods of dirt but well do it ceorl went on we go east the redheads on the other side come west and we meet in the middle be a whole great fornicating kettle full of dead unkerlanters by the time were through too he sounded as if he enjoyed the idea a lot of us dead too sidroc said a lot of us dead already ceorl shrugged cant make an omelette without breaking eggs he brought out the clichй as if he were the first one ever to use it maybe he thought he was an officers whistle squealed onward that was lieutenant ercole whod had the sense to jump in a hole now sooner than he might have been he was out again the algarvians hadnt given plegmunds brigade any officers who werent recklessly brave that sidroc had to admit come on ercole shouted again we wont win anything if we stay here all day sidroc surged up out of the hole the algarvian behemoths had taken care of a lot of their unkerlanter counterparts but theyd had holes torn in their ranks too a dragon fell from the sky and thrashed out its death throes a couple of hundred yards from sidroc it was painted rockgray a moment later an algarvian dragon smashed down even closer by the time night came theyd almost cleared that second belt of defenders weve got to be efficient lieutenant recared sounded serious and earnest the algarvians will throw everything theyve got at us weve got to make every blaze count and to use the positions weve spent so long building up he turned to leudast anything you want to add to that sergeant leudast looked at the men in his company they knew the algarvians would be coming any day maybe any minute they were serious even somber but if they were afraid they didnt let it show leudast knew he was afraid and did his best not to let that show he thought recared wanted him to say something so he did just dont do anything stupid boys thisll be a hard enough fight even if were smart thats right recared nodded vigorously being smart is being efficient the sergeant said the same thing i did only with different words i guess i did leudast thought a little surprised that hadnt occurred to him he peered east toward the rising sun if the algarvians attacked now theyd be silhouetted against the bright sky every time they came over a rise he judged they would wait till the sun was well up before moving he was in no great hurry to risk getting killed or maimed they could wait forever for all of him light built grew leudast studied the landscape he couldnt see most of the defensive positions the unkerlanters had built if he couldnt see them that meant mezentios men wouldnt be able to either he hoped that was what it meant anyhow the sun climbed in the sky the day grew warm even hot leudast slapped at bugs there werent so many as there had been right after the snow melted when the endless swampy puddles in the mud bred hordes of mosquitoes and gnats but they hadnt all gone away they wouldnt have wanted to not with so many latrines and animals to keep them happy leudast was pissing in a slit trench when the algarvians started flinging eggs he almost jumped right into that latrine trench combat had taught him how important taking cover was and diving into the closest available hole was almost as automatic as breathing but he hadnt wanted to breathe by the noisome nearly full trench and he didnt jump into it either not quite he ran back toward the hole in the ground from which hed come such sensibilities almost cost him his neck an egg burst not far behind him just as he started sliding into his hole it flung him in instead flung him hard enough to make him wonder if hed cracked his ribs only when hed sucked in a couple of breaths without having knives stab did he decide he hadnt hed been through a lot fighting the algarvians hed helped hold them out of cottbus hed been wounded down in sulingen hed thought he knew everything the redheads could do now he discovered hed been wrong in all that time with everything hed seen hed never had to endure such a concentrated rain of eggs as they threw at him threw at all the unkerlanters the first thing he did was dig himself deeper he wondered if he were digging his own grave but the shallow scrape hed had before didnt seem nearly enough he flung dirt out with his shorthandled spade wishing all the while that he had broad clawed hands like a moles so he wouldnt need a tool sometimes he thought bursts all around him threw as much dirt back into the hole as he was throwing out after the hole was deep enough he lay down at full length in it his face pressed into the rich dark loam he needed a while to realize he was screaming the din of those bursting eggs was so continuous he could hardly even hear himself realizing what he was doing didnt make him stop hed known fear hed known terror this went past those and out the other side it was so immense so irresistible it carried him along as a wave might carry a small boat and after a little while it washed him ashore if he was beyond fear beyond terror what else was there to do but go on he got up onto his knees he wasnt ready to expose his body to blasts of sorcerous energy and to flying metal shards of egg casing and looked at the sky instead of the dirt he had plenty to watch up there dragons wheeled and dueled and flamed some painted in unkerlants concealing rockgray others wearing algarves gaudy colors it was a dance in the air as intricate and lovely as a springtime figure dance in the square of the peasant village where hed grown up but this dance was deadly too an algarvian dragon flamed one from his kingdom flamed its wing and flank across who could say how much air he heard the great furious bellow of agony the unkerlanter dragon let out surely the dragonflier screamed too but his voice was lost lost the dragon frantically beat the air with its one good wing that only made it twist in the other direction and then it twisted no more but fell writhing it smashed to the unyielding ground not far in front of leudast as abruptly as theyd started the algarvians stopped tossing eggs leudast knew what that meant he snatched up his stick and did peer out from his hole theyre coming he shouted his own voice sounded strange in his ears because of the pounding theyd taken dimly as if from far away he heard others shouting the same thing footsoldiers loped ahead of algarvian behemoths the men in kilts looked tiny even the behemoths looked small the redheads would have to fight their way through a couple of defensive lines before they reached the position lieutenant recareds regiment held by the way they came on mezentios men thought they could fight their way through anything after what theyd done two summers in a row in unkerlant who could say they were wrong then the first redhead stepped on a buried egg and abruptly ceased to be good riddance you son of a whore leudast shouted soldiers had spent weeks burying eggs soldiers and conscripted peasants had spent those same weeks fortifying the ground between the belts some of those peasants might have gone back to their farms others leudast was sure remained in the salient he wondered how many of them would come out once more now that the algarvians were out in the open unkerlanter eggtossers began flinging death their way unkerlanter dragons swooped low on mezentios men some of them dropped eggs too others flamed footsoldiers and behemoths too leudast cheered again more algarvian behemoths than usual seemed to be carrying heavy sticks those were less useful than eggtossers against targets on the ground but ever so much more useful against dragons their thick strong beams seared the air several dragons fell one though smashed into two behemoths as it struck the ground killing them in its own destruction leudast stopped cheering he was too awed to see how many of his countrymen had survived the ferocious algarvian bombardment but the algarvians showed no awe they went about their business with the air of men whod done it many times before a charge of behemoths tore an opening in the first defensive line footsoldiers swarmed through the gap then some of them wheeled and attacked the line from the rear others pushed on toward leudast they did that too fast curse them lieutenant recared said from a hole not far from leudasts they should have been hung up there longer theyre good at what they do sir leudast answered they wouldnt be here in our kingdom if they werent powers below eat them recared said and then ha theyve just found the second belt of eggs he shouted toward the redheads enjoy it you whoresons but the algarvians kept coming in two years of war against them leudast had rarely known them to be less than game they were game here sure enough after a few minutes he started to curse will you look at what those buggers have done theyre using that dry wash to get up toward our second line thats not good recared said they werent supposed to go that way they were supposed to be drawn toward the places where we have more men i wish it would rain leudast said savagely theyd drown then i wish our dragons would come and flame them to ruins and drop eggs on the ones left alive recared said aye leudast nodded the redheads dragons would do that to us down in sulingen recared sounded worried i dont think our men up there in the second line can see what the algarvians are doing he shouted crystallomancer when no one answered he shouted again louder this time he did get a reply hes dead sir and his crystal smashed a trooper said sergeant recared turned to leudast go down there and let them know with everything else thats going on i really dont think they have any idea what mezentios men are up to if a regiment of redheads erupts into the middle of that line it wont hold get moving aye sir leudast scrambled out of his hole got to his feet and started trotting toward the line ahead if he hadnt recared would have blazed him on the spot as things were all he had to do was run across perhaps half a mile of field and grassland full of buried eggs if he went up like a torch in a blaze of sorcerous energy the second line wouldnt know its danger till too late he looked back over his shoulder three or four more unkerlanter soldiers came trotting after him he nodded to himself recared was minimizing the risk the pup made a pretty fair officer leudast trotted on one foot in front of the other dont think about what happens if a foot comes down in the wrong place odds are it wont happen dont think about it odds are it wont and the insistent rising scream in his mind oh but what if it does it didnt he still had trouble finding the unkerlanter field fortifications then a nervous soldier in a rockgray tunic popped up and almost blazed him panting he stammered out his message the soldier lowered his stick come on pal he said youd better tell my captain tell him leudast did the captains crystallomancer was still alive he got the word to soldiers nearer the dry wash an attack went in it didnt stop the algarvians but it slowed them rocked them back on their heels your lieutenant did well to send you the captain told leudast he handed him a flask here have a taste of this youve earned it thanks sir leudast swigged spirits ran hot down his throat he wiped his mouth on his sleeve are we winning the captain answered with a broadshouldered shrug were just getting started twelve major spinello had thought the fighting in sulingen the worst warfare possible now as his regiment fought its way east toward other faroff algarvian forces fighting their way west he saw sulingen recreated across miles of rolling plains the unkerlanters had been waiting for this assault there didnt seem to be an inch of their salient where they hadnt either built a redoubt or buried an egg by now most of the dowsers whod picked out paths through those buried eggs were dead or wounded either from their own mistakes or from unkerlanter beams or eggs five days into the fighting the algarvians on the western edge of the bulge around durrwangen had advanced perhaps half a dozen miles they were far behind where they should have been spinello knew as much every algarvian officer and probably every algarvian common soldier too knew as much spinello counted it a minor miracle that his countrymen were still moving forward at all he lay behind a dead unkerlanter behemoth that was starting to stink under the hot summer sun captain turpino lay at the other end of the dead beast turpino turned a filthy haggard smokeblackened face to spinello and asked what now sir were supposed to take that hill up ahead spinellos hand shook as he pointed he was every bit as filthy and haggard as his senior company commander he couldnt remember the last time hed slept cautious turpino peered up over the carcass what the regiment by itself he demanded that hills got unkerlanter behemoths live ones the way a dog has fleas no not the regiment by itself our army however much of it we can aim at the high ground spinello yawned powers above he was tired it was like being drunk he didnt care what came out of his mouth i dont think our regiments in any shape to take a gumdrop away from a threeyearold turpino stared at him then laughed as cautiously as hed looked at the hill ahead spinellos answering grimace might have been a smile along with the rest of the great force the algarvians had mustered the regiment had hammered its way through five successive unkerlanter lines and in the hammering had burned away like wood in the fire he wondered if he still had half the men whod gone forward when he first blew the whistle he doubted it the three companies plucked from occupation duty in jelgava had suffered particularly hard it wasnt that they werent brave they were to a fault they went forward when they should have hesitated and had got themselves and their comrades into a couple of desperate pickles simply because theyd lacked the experience to see traps they should have well they had that experience now the survivors anyhow turpino turned his head more of our behemoths coming up and he stiffened whore those buggers in the wrongcolored tunics are the unkerlanters trying to pull another fast one after looking back toward the footsoldiers spinello shook his head thats plegmunds brigade theyre on our side forthwegians in algarvian service forthwegians turpinos lip curled we are throwing everything weve got left into this fight arent we actually theyre supposed to be brave spinello said turpino looked anything but convinced on came the behemoths they started tossing eggs at the unkerlanter beasts on the hill the algarvians needed to take the unkerlanters answered but they still didnt handle their beasts or their gear as well as mezentios men spinello cheered when an algarvian behemoth crew used the heavy stick mounted on their beast to burst the eggs an unkerlanter behemoth carried and then a moment later repeated the feat and took out another behemoth and crew but the unkerlanters eggs and beams knocked down algarvian behemoths too and more beasts with unkerlanters aboard trotted over the crest of the hill captain turpino cursed how many fornicating behemoths do swemmels fornicators have he demanded or words to that effect too many spinello answered looking from the beasts on the hill to the algarvian behemoths moving against them he sighed well well just have to get them off of there wont we he blew his whistle as he got to his feet forward he shouted waving his arm to urge on his troops what was left of them turpino stayed beside him as they advanced turpino still wanted the regiment if spinello fell and he also wanted to show he was at least as brave as the man who held it now spinello grinned as he ran past craters and corpses and dead beasts hed expected nothing less algarvians were like that the unkerlanters not only had behemoths on that hill they had footsoldiers there too spinello watched beams flash from places where he would have sworn no squirrel let alone a man could have hidden beams burned brown lines in the green grass some very near him here and there little grass fires sprang up he almost welcomed them the smokier the air the more it spread beams and the more trouble they had biting but bite they still did men fell all around him he dove into a hole in the ground it was big enough to hold two and spinellos dour shadow dove in right behind him turpino said theyre going to make us pay a demon of a price for that high ground i know spinello answered weve got to have it though the armys melting the way the snow did this spring turpino said i know that too spinello said im not blind he raised his voice to a shout again crystallomancer a moment later he shouted it once more and louder crystallomancer aye sir the algarvian who scrambled over to spinello didnt belong to his regiment hed never seen the fellow before but he had a crystal with him and that was good enough get me the mages at special camp four spinello said the fourth special camp was attached to his division aye sir the crystallomancer repeated and went to work in bright daylight spinello could hardly see the flash of light that showed the crystals activation but he couldnt miss the image of the mage that formed in it the crystallomancer said go ahead sir right spinello spoke into the crystal major spinello here my regiment and a good part of this army footsoldiers and behemoths both are pinned down in front of the hill at map grid greenseven we need that hill if were going to go on and we need the special sorceries if were going to take it are you certain the mage asked demand for the special sorceries has been very high far higher than anyone expected when we began this campaign i am not sure well have enough to sustain us if we keep using up our resources at this rate spinello abruptly dropped the language of euphemism if you dont start killing kaunians pretty cursed quick there wont be any campaign left to worry about have you got that sorcerous sir if the unkerlanters halt us here whats to stop them from rolling forward whats to stop them from rolling over you and all the precious kaunians youre hoarding very well major the point is taken the algarvian mage looked and sounded affronted spinello didnt care so long as he got results the mage said i shall consult my colleagues stand by to await developments his image winked out the crystallomancer said thats it sir turpino said you made him angry when you reminded him what he was really doing back there what a pity spinello growled if hes unhappy about it let him come to the front and see what were really doing up here that earned him one of the few looks of unreserved approval hed ever had from turpino he went on besides if hes not getting screams from every other officer on this field im a poached egg regardless of whether he was a poached egg the mages back at the special camp must have decided the algarvian army did need help spinello knew to the moment when the sacrifices began a great cloud of dust rose from the hillside as the ground shook there cracks opened then slammed shut flames shot up from the ground now were in business turpino said happily cursed kaunians are good for something anyhow this time he rose and ran forward first leaving spinello to hurry after him spinello did so did the crystallomancer evidently glad to have someone giving him orders even if it wasnt his proper commander but they hadnt gone far before the ground trembled under their feet a huge crack opened under the crystallomancer he had time for a terrified shriek before it smashed him as it closed violet flame engulfed two behemoths and their crews not far from spinello and more men and beasts elsewhere on the field spinello fell he clutched the ground trying to make it hold still powers below eat the unkerlanters cried turpino who had also fallen their mages are hitting back harder and faster than they ever did before can they spend more peasants than we can spend kaunians spinello asked a question on which the fate of the battle might turn he gave the only answer he had for it well find out even before the magemade earthquake ended he fought his way back onto his feet he hauled turpino up too thanks the company commander said my pleasure spinello said and bowed he looked behind him i think weve got more still standing than the unkerlanters do after blowing his whistle he yelled come on aye all of you you forthwegians too we can take that hill take it they did though the unkerlanters who hadnt been overwhelmed by algarvian magecraft sold themselves dear and werent finally driven back or killed till after sunset by then nobody on the bloodsoaked field had any doubts left about whether the men of plegmunds brigade could fight algarvians and bearded forthwegians sat down together and shared food and wine and water and lay down side by side to rest and ready themselves for the next days horrors spinello found himself trading barley bread hed taken from a dead unkerlanter for the sausages a couple of men from plegmunds brigade had one of them looked more like a bandit than a soldier the other was younger but might have been grimmer speaking pretty good algarvian he said i hope they get rid of all the kaunians its the only thing theyre good for oh not the only thing tired as he was spinello still laughed i was posted in forthweg before i came here in a little pisspot village named oyngestun i know it the man from plegmunds brigade said i am from gromheort all right then spinello said i found this kaunian tart there named vanai who hed been telling stories about her since coming to unkerlant tonight to his astonishment he was interrupted vanai by the powers above i remember now the forthwegian exclaimed my cousin the cursed fool was sweet on a kaunian bitch named vanai and she was from oyngestun could it be dont ask me for i dont know spinello said but i do know this i was in there first and he got to tell his bawdy stories after all there in the brooding night filled with the stink of fire and the far worse stink of death even in his dreams count sabrino flew his dragon against the unkerlanters he had few dreams he had little time for sleep he and the men of his wing and colonel ambaldos wing and all the other algarvian dragonfliers on the eastern side of the unkerlanter salient around durrwangen had been flying as often as their flesh and that of their mounts would stand or perhaps rather more than that but sabrino was dreaming now hed blazed an unkerlanter dragonflier and made the mans beast fly wild when suddenly his own beast was flamed from behind it stumbled in midair trying to right itself but could not it stumbled it staggered it shook it shook sabrinos eyes came open he discovered a dragon handler shaking him awake sabrino groaned and tried to roll away the handler was inexorable colonel youve got to get up he said urgently the wings got to fly youve got to fly now powers below eat you sabrino said dowsers have spotted a great swarm of unkerlanter dragons flying our way the dragon handler said theyll want to catch us on the ground drop their eggs all over the dragon farms hereabouts but if we get into the air first sleep and the need for sleep fell away from sabrino like an abandoned kilt get out of the way he growled springing off his cot he checked himself but only for an instant no run and sound the alarm before the dragon handler could ever begin to turn horns blared in the predawn darkness sabrino grunted in satisfaction he pulled on his boots donned the heavy coat hed been using as a blanket and put his goggles on his head then he ran past the dragon handler and toward his own stupid eviltempered mount other dragonfliers from his wing and ambaldos were dashing to their dragons too sabrino grudged a quarter of a minute to cry out if we get into the air we slaughter the unkerlanters who are coming to call if they catch us on the ground the way they want to were dead come on mezentio mezentio the dragonfliers shouted behind them in the east the sky was going pink off to the west the direction from which those rockgray dragons would be coming stars still shone and night still ruled but not securely not even there purpleblack had lightened to deep blue and the dimmer stars winked out one by one day was coming by all the signs trouble would get here first a handler released the chain that held sabrinos dragon to the spike driven deep into the black soil of southern unkerlant sabrino whacked the dragon with his goad it screamed at him hed known it would he whacked it again and it bounded into the air as much from sheer rage as for any other reason sabrino didnt care why the dragon flew he only cared that it flew as the ground fell away below them he spoke into his crystal to his squadron commanders get as high as you can we dont want swemmels boys to know were up here till we drop on them aye colonel that was gloomy captain orosio he was the senior squadron commander left alive hed been juniormost when the war started or had he even had a squadron then after close to four years sabrino couldnt remember anymore he marveled that he himself still survived if fighting on the ground in the six years war didnt kill me nothing here will he thought light spread in the sky as he urged his dragon ever higher before long he spied the sun low and red in the east its rays hadnt yet reached the ground and wouldnt for some little time to come he might have been on a mountaintop looking down into some stilldark valley and then as hed hoped he would he saw things moving in the air below his squadron he whooped with glee there they are he shouted into the crystal and pointed for good measure aye colonel that was orosio again i saw em a little while ago dour laconic he hardly seemed like an algarvian but he was a good officer had he come from a more prominent family he would have had a better chance to prove it no matter how fierce the casualties among dragonfliers he wasnt likely to rise above his present rank flashes of light from the ground said the unkerlanters were plastering the dragon farm with eggs no doubt thinking they were wreaking havoc on the algarvian beasts sabrino hoped the handlers had found holes king swemmels dragonfliers would do some damage down below but they hadnt yet awakened to the realization that they were about to take damage too with astonishing speed the unkerlanter dragons swelled beneath sabrino he had his pick of targets sure enough the enemy had no idea he and his comrades were above them this time the dowsers had been right on the money and now the unkerlanters will pay sabrino muttered how they will pay the wind from his dive swept the words away for once it mattered not at all sabrino blazed not just one unkerlanter dragonflier as he had dreamt but two in quick succession even as the beasts theyd ridden went wild and useless his own dragon flamed another unkerlanters mount sabrino brought his dragon in as close as he dared before letting it flame quicksilver was in short supply and without it a dragons flame grew short too but his mount had enough the dragon painted rockgray fell out of the air sabrino looked around the brightening sky looked around and howled with savage glee almost every algarvian dragonflier was having luck to match his the unkerlanters had hoped to catch them by surprise but ended up caught themselves in hardly more than the twinkling of an eye the air was free of them the ones left alive flew back toward the salient as fast as their dragons wings would take them pursuit sir captain orosios voice came from the crystal reluctantly sabrino said no we take the dragons down we get them fed we get ourselves fed too while were at it and then we go back to hammering the unkerlanter positions on the ground i wish we could rest them more but we havent got the time we land he emphasized the words with hand signals so all the dragonfliers could see what he meant they obeyed him he would have been astonished horrified if they hadnt down they went now the sun had reached the unkerlanter plains dead dragons almost all of them painted rockgray cast long shadows across those plains sabrino whistled softly to see how many he and his comrades had knocked out of the sky a good mornings work he said to the handler who started tossing his dragon gobbets of meat the dowsers gave us a hand today aye the handler agreed wouldnt have been much fun if those buggers had caught us unawares no sabrino shuddered at the thought of it as he freed himself from his harness and slid to the ground he asked the handler hows the cinnabar holding out all right so far the fellow told him well get through this fight without any trouble i think dont know what well do about the next one though worry about it later what else can we do sabrino hurried off toward the mess tent he would rather have gone back to his cot but that wouldnt do he yawned enormously falling asleep aboard his dragon wouldnt do either he gulped hot strong tea gulped it and gulped it till it pried his eyelids open breakfast was more of the stew that had been in the pot for supper the night before he recognized barley buckwheat carrots celery onions and bits of meat he couldnt tell what the meat was maybe that was for the best colonel ambaldo raised his mug of tea in salute as if it held wine heres to the unkerlanters outsmarting themselves he said ill gladly drink to that sabrino said this mornings ours till they can bring more dragons forward well pound em to our hearts content sounds good to me by the powers above ambaldo said the lads down on the ground need all the help they can get in sabrinos eyes ambaldo wasnt too much more than a lad himself that didnt make him wrong sabrino said swemmels men have been waiting for us too cursed long in these parts row on row of fieldworks and they fight to hold every miserable stinking little village as if it were sulingen too right they do ambaldo agreed brigades go into those places and companies come out its butchery is what it is never saw anything like this in valmiera did you sabrino couldnt resist the jab colonel ambaldo shook his head never once not even close theyre madmen these unkerlanters they fight like madmen anyhow no wonder we started killing kaunians to shift em though from what i hear were using up the blonds so fast were liable to run short swemmel wont ever run short on people to kill to power his magecraft sabrino said gloomily unkerlant has more peasants than it knows what to do with he scowled thats not quite right swemmel knows too bloody well what to do with them and to them both wing commanders slammed down their empty mugs at the same time they hurried out of the mess tent shouting for their men to join them sabrino spent a little while cursing because the dragon handlers hadnt finished securing the eggs under all the dragons in his wing but the delay was only short it might even have worked to the dragonfliers advantage though sabrino wouldnt have admitted that to the handlers feeling how his dragon labored under him sabrino knew it needed rest rest it couldnt have a few more quiet minutes on the ground had surely done it some good not having many fresh unkerlanter dragons to face did the algarvians a lot of good too most of swemmels dragonfliers wouldnt have been allowed to mount an algarvian beast but they had more dragons than did sabrino and his countrymen a bad dragonflier on a fresh beast could match a master aboard a worn overworked dragon a fresh algarvian attack was just going in against the village of eylau the wreckage of a couple of previous assaults still lay outside the place dead men and behemoths by all the signs the new brigades assailing the unkerlanter strongpoint would have had no easier time of it but after two wings of algarvian dragons delivered an all but unopposed attack on eylau the strongpoint wasnt so strong anymore the footsoldiers and behemoths battled their way into the village they fought their way in but would they fight their way out already more unkerlanter soldiers were moving forward to try to hold them there even if the algarvians did advance how much good would it do them eylau was less than ten miles west of the point from which the assault had begun at that rate how long would this army take to join the one pushing east toward it and would either of them have any men left alive by the time they joined sabrino had no answers all he could do was command his wing as best he could and hope those set over him knew what they were about he ordered his dragonfliers back to the farm more meat for the dragons more eggs loaded under them a little food and a lot of tea for the men and back into the fight once more sidroc wondered why he still breathed everything hed been through before this great fight on the flank of the durrwangen bulge however horrid and terrifying it seemed at the time was as nothing beside reality here hed always thought a fight would start and then it would end this one had started aye but it showed no sign of ever wanting to end a week and a half he said to sergeant werferth who by some miracle also had not been blazed or gone up in a burst of sorcerous energy or been butchered by a flying fragment of egg casing or flamed by a dragon or had any other lethal or disabling accident befall him have we won are we winning futter me if i know futter me if i know anything any more werferth scratched his hairy chin ive got lice in my beard i know that so do i sidroc said and scratched like a siaulian monkey smoke stained the sky above them somewhere not far away eggs burst unkerlanter eggs pounding the algarvians pounding the men of plegmunds brigade who fought at their side werferth said every time we think weve knocked those buggers flat they pop up again if we kill enough kaunians sidroc began but werferth shook his head what good would it do us theyd just kill some more of their own and wed be back where we started weve seen that happen too cursed often already sidroc wanted to argue he wanted kaunians dead what else were they good for except the enjoyment that algarvian major had taken from the one his cousin was sweet on vanai sidroc muttered under his breath it had gone clean out of his head till the algarvian spoke knocked out when cousin ealstan slammed his head against the wall while they were fighting but he remembered now aye the pieces fit together again he laughed a sound not far from honest mirth he wondered what had happened up there in forthweg had the algarvians gone in and cleaned the kaunians out of oyngestun the way they should have or was dear old ealstan still getting that redheads sloppy seconds we might as well kill some more kaunians he said thinking of a new argument you think the unkerlantersll stop slaying their own if we quit not bloody likely you ask me theyll keep right at it they will even if we dont kill blonds to strike well need to do it to shield ourselves he stuck out his chin go on tell me im wrong werferth grunted ill tell you you talk too cursed much thats what ill do he yawned so wide the hinge at the back of his jaw cracked like a knuckle i want to sleep for a year two years with any luck at all im with you there sidroc had never known a man could be so worn i dont think ive slept more than a couple of hours at a stretch since this cursed fight started i feel drunk half the time i wish i were drunk werferth said havent even had a nip since i found that one dead unkerlanter with a canteen half full of spirits he stretched himself out on the torn ground a couple of minutes later he was snoring a couple of minutes after that sidroc was probably snoring too his comrades said he did since hed never heard himself he couldnt have proved it one way or the other snoring or not he was certainly asleep the deep almost deathlike sleep that comes from complete exhaustion and a couple of minutes after that he and werferth were both awake and both digging like men possessed as unkerlanter eggs burst all around them sidroc felt as if he were moving underwater he kept dropping the little shorthandled shovel cursed thing he muttered as if his clumsiness were its fault the algarvians finally started tossing eggs back at king swemmels men took em long enough werferth growled i figured theyd wait till we were all dead and then give back a little something im not all dead sidroc said im just mostly dead he and the sergeant both found that very funny a telling measure of how tired they were they laughed without restraint till tears rolled down their faces and then in spite of the eggs that kept bursting all around them they lay down in the hole theyd dug and went back to sleep an officers whistle woke sidroc a little before dawn lieutenant ercole looked as grimy and beat as any of the forthwegians he commanded not even algarvian vanity let him steal a few minutes for primping not on this field but he sounded far livelier than sidroc felt up you lugs he cried up up and forward weve got a long way to go before we can be lazy again what does he mean again werferth mumbled staggering to his feet as if hed suddenly aged forty or fifty years weve never once been lazy powers above when have we had the time for it id like to have the time to be lazy sidroc said he reached into his belt pouch and pulled out a chunk of stale barley bread he gnawed it as he listened to ercole the company commander pointed ahead you see that wedge of behemoths in front of us sure enough a couple of dozen of the great shapes were silhouetted against the lightening sky lieutenant ercole went on we are going to form up behind them they will pound a breach in the next unkerlanter line for us we will go in behind them we will go into the enemy line we will go through the enemy line we will go on toward our brothers who are fighting their way west toward us mezentio and victory mezentio and victory the men of plegmunds brigade tried their best but couldnt raise much of a cheer too many of them were dead too many wounded too many of the unhurt survivors shambling in an exhausted daze like sidroc and werferth dazed or not exhausted or not sidroc trudged forward to find his place behind the behemoths not only forthwegians from plegmunds brigade were assembled there but also algarvian footsoldiers the redheads didnt sneer at the forthwegians anymore ties of blood bound them together other wedges of behemoths were coming together along the algarvian line theyve thought of something new sidroc remarked good for them werferth said and we get to be the ones who find out whether it works he kicked at the dirt if we live were heroes he kicked again then shrugged and if we dont live who gives a futter what we are at shouts from the men who crewed them the behemoths tramped off toward the rising sun they didnt advance at a full thunderous gallop which would have left the footsoldiers far behind but did move with an implacability that suggested nothing would stop them sidroc hoped the suggestion held truth from on high algarvian dragons dropped eggs on the unkerlanter trenches and redoubts ahead the crews of the behemoths with eggtossers also began pounding the enemy position as soon as they drew within range the unkerlanters had dug ditches to keep behemoths away from their trench line but the rain of eggs caved in the edges to a lot of those ditches and behemoths even armored even carrying men and eggtossers or heavy sticks were surprisingly nimble beasts they had little trouble finding ways to go forward just before the behemoths reached the first trench line both algarvian and unkerlanter wizards used sacrifices to get the life energy they needed for their potent spells lieutenant ercole wasnt twenty feet from sidroc when violet flame shot up from the ground and consumed him he had time for one brief agonized shriek before falling silent forever sidroc smelled burnt meat absurdly dreadfully the smokesweet scent made his mouth flood with spit as soon as the ground stopped shaking beneath him he got up and moved on from not far away ceorl called to werferth youre in charge of the company now aye so i am werferth sounded surprised as if he hadnt thought of that the redheads wont let you keep it sidroc predicted after all youre just a lousy forthwegian ive got it now though werferth said dont see anything to do but keep on going forward do you sidroc stared at him youre not supposed to ask me what to do youre supposed to tell me what to do youre supposed to tell all of us what to do aye sergeant werferth said again he pointed ahead theres a little rise lets take it and then well figure out what to do next like any high ground on this field the little rise had unkerlanters on it the men of plegmunds brigade were able to get closer to the foe than algarvians would have before the unkerlanters started blazing for once being forthwegians helped them king swemmels men thought for a little too long that they were on the same side by the time they realized their mistake sidroc and his countrymen were already on top of them from the crest of the rise they could see more high ground farther east pointing again werferth said if we can get up there i think we can tear this whole position open we sidroc echoed do you mean this company do you mean plegmunds brigade whatevers left of it wearily werferth shook his head no and no i mean the whole army the behemoths will have to do most of the work i cant see footsoldiers making it all that way without help must be another five six miles in ordinary marching that would have taken the soldiers a couple of hours a good deal less than that if they were in a hurry sidroc wondered how long it would take with what had to be all the unkerlanters in the world between his army and that precious ground swemmels soldiers werent inclined to let plegmunds brigade move another inch forward let alone five or six miles as soon as the unkerlanters realized theyd lost the rise they started tossing eggs at it sidroc and his comrades huddled in the holes from which theyd driven the enemy here they come ceorl shouted sure enough unkerlanters in rockgray tunics swarmed up the eastern slope of the rise intent on retaking it sidroc blazed down several of them the other forthwegians did as well but the unkerlanters kept coming then eggs started bursting among swemmels soldiers a beam from a heavy stick blazed down two unkerlanters unlucky enough to be in line with it behemoths sidroc yelled his throat raw with excitement and smoke our behemoths caught by surprise the unkerlanters ran away they would sometimes do that when facing the unexpected though not often enough for anyone ever to count on it sidroc waited for werferth to order a pursuit the order didnt come instead werferth said lets wait till we get some more troops up here then well go after the whoresons sidroc couldnt very well argue with that more eggs began falling on the men from plegmunds brigade sidroc looked out toward the high ground in the distance how could they hope to advance when it was all they could do not to retreat once upon a time probably the village of braunau hadnt been much different from any other unkerlanter peasant village that was before the algarvians pushing west collided here with the unkerlanters who had no intention of letting them go any farther now whatever was left of the village once the fighting finally went somewhere else would be remembered forever how it would be remembered the answer to that question was being written in blood in and around the place again leudast thought of sulingen the unkerlanters defending braunau fought with the same determination their countrymen farther south had shown every hut every barn every well was defended as if it were the gateway to king swemmels palace in cottbus no one counted the cost the determination was there the algarvians would not get past the village for their part king mezentios soldiers remained stubborn and resourceful no sooner would the defenders of braunau chew up one brigade than another went into the fight as always the redheads were brave here that ended up hurting them at least as much as it helped they cant get at braunau any other way than from straight ahead do you see recared said the ground wont let them try any of their fancy algarvian tricks and come up our backside thats the way it looks anyhow leudast agreed he wasnt so sure about what mezentios men could or couldnt do hed been wrong too many times recared had fewer doubts but then he hadnt been in the fight as long as leudast had do they play the game called last man standing in your village he asked aye sir leudast answered they play it everywhere i think it helps if youre drunk two men stood toe to toe taking turns hitting each other as hard as they could eventually one of them wouldnt be able to get up any more and the other fellow was the winner well thats what weve got here recared said either we end up on our feet here in braunau or the algarvians do something to that leudast said but whether were standing or the redheads are braunau wont be not much of braunau was standing at the moment leudast and recared both peered out of a trench between a couple of ruined houses on the eastern edge of the village a dead algarvian lay in front of them a couple more lay behind them the redheads had twice got into braunau but they hadnt been able to stay their trenches right this minute lay a couple of hundred yards outside it from behind leudast unkerlanter eggtossers on the ridge in back of braunau began pounding the algarvian positions algarvian eggtossers answered leudast said better to have the redheads aiming at them than at us oh theyll get to us never fear recared said they always do leudast wished he thought the regimental commander were wrong algarvian dragons flew by they also dropped eggs on the unkerlanter tossers some of them dropped eggs on braunau too where are our dragons leudast demanded havent seen many of them since this fight was new something went wrong recared answered i dont quite know what but something did we were supposed to hit the algarvians a hard blow but they did it to us instead leudast sighed how many times have we heard that sort of story before he said how many of us are going to end up dead on account of it they ought to blaze whoever fouled things up for us odds are the algarvians killed him whoever he was recared said but leudast said no somebody behind the line will have forgotten something or overlooked something thats how it is with us hes the one who deserves to get boiled alive maybe youre right recared said but even if you are we cant do anything about it all we can do is hold on here and not let the redheads through no sir leudast shook his head theres one other thing we can do we can pay the price for that cursed fools mistake we can and it looks like we will lieutenant recared scowled at him sergeant if youd said something like that to me this past winter id have given you up to the inspectors without a qualm he might not have had any qualms the idea was plenty more than plenty to send a chill through leudast leudast had the feeling that anybody turned over to the inspectors today would be sacrificed tomorrow or the day after at the latest and his life energy turned against the algarvians but recared wasnt proposing to give him up now cautiously he asked what makes you think different these days well a couple of things the young regimental commander answered for one ive seen that youre a brave man and a good soldier and he sighed ive also seen that not all our higher officers are everything they might be with that recared had just put his own life in leudasts hands if leudast chose to denounce him the regiment would have a new leader immediately thereafter that it was in the middle of a desperate battle a battle where the future of unkerlant hung in the balance would not matter at all after saluting leudast spoke with great solemnity sir i didnt hear a word you said there no eh recared wasnt a fool he knew what hed done too well thats probably for the best leudast shrugged you never can tell it might not have mattered any which way i mean what are the odds that either one of us is going to come out of braunau in one piece let alone both of us if its all the same to you im not going to answer that question recared said and if youve got any sense you wont spend much time thinking about it either he was right leudast knew as much most of the time he didnt worry about getting wounded or killed worrying wouldnt help and it was liable to hurt you had to do what you had to do if you spent too much time thinking and worrying that might make you slow when you most needed to be fast but here in braunau as in sulingen you were only too likely to get hurt or killed regardless of whether you were a good soldier too many eggs too many beams too many algarvian dragons overhead recared pulled out a spyglass and peered down the charred slopes toward the redheads positions careful sir leudast warned thats a good way to get yourself blazed theyve got plenty of snipers who could put a beam right through your ear at that range we have to see whats going on recared said peevishly if we fight blind were bound to lose or will you tell me im wrong there too since leudast couldnt tell him any such thing he kept his mouth shut going into the fight about half the regiments companies had been commanded by lieutenants junior to recared the other half by sergeants like leudast he didnt know how many of those junior lieutenants were left alive he did know he didnt want to have to try commanding a regiment himself if an algarvian sniper did pick off recared recared stiffened though not because hed taken a beam uhoh he said and pointed out beyond the redheads front line theyre bringing blonds forward powers above leudast said hoarsely that means theyre going to aim that filthy magecraft of theirs right at us from as close as they can thats just what it means recareds voice was grim it got grimmer and we havent got much in the way of dragons to stop them either weve seen that theyll keep out of range of our eggtossers too by now theyll have that measured to the yard so theyll turn braunau inside out with their magic and we cant do a thing to stop em all we can do is take it thats what unkerlanters do best anyhow leudast thought but then he had another thought one that appalled him with its monstrous coldbloodedness but might keep him breathing he grabbed recared by the arm an unheardofliberty for a sergeant to take with an officer sir if our own mages send some of that same kind of magic at those poor kaunian buggers mezentios men wont be able to use their life energy against us by send some of that same kind of magic he meant of course having unkerlanter mages kill some of their own countrymen for their life energy he couldnt stomach saying it in so many words even if killing was part of his line of work too recared stared at him then shouted crystallomancer the regiment had a new one replacing the minor mage slain in the first day of the battle for the durrwangen salient aye sir he said making his way up through the maze of trenches to recareds side when recared told him what he wanted the crystallomancer hesitated are you sure sir his eyes were round and fearful mind made up recared didnt hesitate aye he said and hurry curse you if we dont do what we have to do and if we dont do it fast the algarvians will work their magic on us would you sooner sit still for that no sir the crystallomancer said and activated his crystal when a face appeared in it he passed it to recared go ahead sir recared spoke quickly and to the point the mage on the other end of the etheric connection listened then said i cannot decide this wait he disappeared a moment later another face appeared in the crystal i am addanz archmage of unkerlant say your say recared did as concisely as he had before he even gave leudast credit not that leudast much wanted any such thing leudast had met the archmage once before in trenches not far outside of cottbus perhaps fortunately addanz didnt seem to remember that he said tell me how far east of braunau the kaunians are just outside of eggtosser range sir recared replied very well addanz said and then shook his head no not very well very ill but no help for it youll have your magecraft lieutenant quickly then sir or you waste it recared said youll have it addanz repeated and his image vanished like a blownout candle flame leudast imagined unkerlanter mages lining up unkerlanter peasants and miscreants so unkerlanter soldiers could slay them he wished he hadnt the picture in his mind was all too vivid and here for once swemmels endless talk of efficiency proved true hardly five minute passed before the ground shuddered under those luckless kaunians before fissures opened and flames shot forth recared pounded leudast on the back well done sergeant by the powers above he shouted lets see the redheads make their cursed magic now if we live youll get a decoration for this all leudast said was i feel like a murderer hed caused his own countrymen for all he knew maybe his own kinsmen to die so their life energy could go into killing kaunians so the algarvians couldnt kill the kaunians to kill him that wasnt war or it shouldnt have been he stared east toward the algarvian trenches if he knew mezentios men they wouldnt let a setback stop them for long they never had yet colonel sabrino had rarely seen an army brigadier so furious the algarvian officer looked about ready to leap out of the crystal and strangle somebody king swemmel by choice no doubt but sabrino thought he might do himself at a pinch do you know what those fornicating unkerlanters did the brigadier howled have you got any idea no sir sabrino said around a yawn he grabbed what sleep he could between flight and didnt take kindly to interruptions but youre going to tell me i expect the brigadier went on as if he hadnt spoken which might have been lucky for him we had our kaunians all ready to slay to rout swemmels buggers out of that stinking braunau place and the unkerlanter whoresons killed most of em by magic before we got to use their life energy the attack went in anyhow and we got thrown back again weve got to get past there if were ever going to join hands with our men on the other side of the enemy salient aye sir i know that sabrino said wondering if the algarvians on the western flank of the bulge were doing any better than the eastern army to which he was attached he wished his countrymen hadnt started using murderpowered magecraft now both sides used it ever more freely which added to the death toll without changing much else he also suspected the brigadier shouldnt have attacked braunau once the sorcerous backing for the assault collapsed suggesting such things to a superior was a tricky business he didnt try he knew he was too worn to be tactful instead he asked what would you have me do sir if we cant knock braunau out from under those buggers with dead kaunians next best thing is to pound it flat flatter with dragons the brigadier answered youve got the edge on em there in this side of the salient for now anyway sabrino said theyve put more dragons in the air today than they did yesterday and still more than the day before theyve got more dragons than we thought they did theyve got more of everything than we thought they did the brigadier said but we can still lick em we can curse it he sounded as if sabrino were arguing with him wed better was all sabrino did say about that he went on tell me when you want us there sir and well be there colonel ambaldo is probably sleeping too he thought that means i get to wake him up there were prospects he might have enjoyed less ambaldo after all had spent a lot of the war in the comfortable east he hadnt had his full share of the delights of unkerlant or any share at all in the different delights of the land of the ice people an hour the brigadier said when sabrino nodded the army officers image vanished from the crystal it flared then went back to being a simple globe of glass sabrino strode out of his tent and shouted for dragon handlers the men came running their kilts flapping at each long stride he said get the dragons ready and start kicking the men awake were going after braunau again just your wing sir or both of them at this farm a handler asked both sabrino answered but ill wake ambaldo myself his face must have worn an evil grin because several of the handlers snickered colonel ambaldo awoke with several loud fervent curses he also woke grabbing for the stick by his cot sabrino got it first grabbing and missing seemed to restore something like reason to ambaldo he glowered at sabrino and asked all right your excellency whos gone and pissed in the soup pot this time king swemmels little friends who else sabrino said not that it doesnt sound like some hamfisted generalship from us went into the mix too he quickly explained what had gone wrong in front of braunau ambaldo grunted and rubbed his eyes this whole business of killing kaunians is filthy if anybody wants to know what i think he said as he sat up he looked defiance at sabrino and i dont care what you may believe about it no sabrino said mildly i told king mezentio the same thing before we really started doing it his majesty didnt care what i believed about it really you said that to mezentio to his face ambaldo asked sabrino nodded ambaldo let out a soft whistle i will be dipped in dung i knew you for a brave man your excellency but still you surprise me if i werent a brave man i wouldnt have come in here to get you sabrino said shall we be at it ambaldo got to his feet and bowed i wouldnt miss it for the world when sabrino went out to his dragon he found it loaded with eggs the handler was tossing chunks of meat to it the dragon caught them out of the air one after another hows the cinnabar holding out sabrino asked the handler he got no more reassuring answers as he had earlier in the fight the fellow spread his hands and said if theyd known this stinking battle was going to last so bloody long they shouldve given us more before sabrino could say anything to that the dragon handler added of course maybe they didnt have any more to give on that cheerful note he went back to feeding the dragon sabrino climbed aboard the great scaly beast and fastened himself into his harness at the base of its neck distracted by raw meat the dragon didnt even raise a fuss then the handler stopped feeding it and undid its chain from the iron spike driven deep into the soil of unkerlant sabrino whacked the dragon with his goad urging it into the air the dragon bellowed in fury at the idea that it should work for a living as far as it was concerned it had been hatched to sit on the ground so people could feed it to the bursting point no matter how often sabrino tried to give it other ideas with the goad it was surprised and outraged every time it sprang into the air as much from fury as for any other reason as usual sabrino didnt care why as long as the dragon rose hed take that the other dragons in his wing were every bit as offended at having to earn their keep as was his they all screeched as they spiraled upward colonel ambaldos dragons were flying too sabrino of necessity his own crystallomancer while on dragonback murmured the charm that attuned the emanations of his crystal with that of the other wing commander when ambaldos image appeared in his crystal sabrino said now that youre awake your excellency how do you want to handle the strike at braunau if you like well go in first and then fly cover for your wing aye good enough ambaldo said and sabrino cursed under his breath hed made the offer for forms sake no more ambaldos dragons had been worked hard in this fight but were still fresher than sabrinos they would have made a better covering flight than sabrinos wing ambaldo should have been able to see that for himself if he couldnt though sabrino had too much pride to point it out to him ambaldo did say well cover you on the way in thank you so much sabrino knew how little he meant that ambaldo was brave but bravery didnt matter much not here on the western front the unkerlanters were brave too what really set the algarvians apart from them was brains without a guiding wit behind the fighting it turned into nothing but a slugging match king swemmels men could afford that better than algarve could sabrinos mouth turned down in discontent as he steered the dragon east toward braunau by the look of the battlefield far below it had already turned into a slugging match no more lightning thrusts around unkerlanter positions to flank them out the algarvian attack had gone straight into the heart of the toughest and deepest set of field fortifications sabrino had ever seen on the eastern side of the durrwangen salient and by all the signs on the western side as well no wonder progress was so painfully slow no wonder so many dead men and horses and unicorns and behemoths lay on the ground where sabrino wondered would their replacements come from one thought ran through his mind wed better win here if we dont if weve thrown all this away with nothing to show for it how are we going to carry the war to the unkerlanters from here on out powers above he muttered as his wing flew over what would have been the place where the kaunians were sacrificed in front of braunau were even running out of blonds king swemmels mages had helped there too sabrino cursed softly and the wind blew his words away all things considered maybe he should have called on the powers below instead and then he had no more time for such worries for there lay battered braunau corking the algarvians advance he spoke into his crystal again this time to his own squadron leaders well dive to drop our eggs on the village then climb quick as we can and cover ambaldos wing while they do the same heres hoping the unkerlanters dont hit us captain orosio said weve got tired beasts well have trouble giving our best because sabrino knew that too he made his voice harsh as he answered its what were going to do he never asked his dragonfliers to do anything he wouldnt do himself so he was the first to urge his own mount into a dive over braunau footsoldiers down there blazed at him so did the crew of heavy sticks if one of those hit his dragon the beast wouldnt gain height again and sabrinos mistress and his wife might miss him just above rooftop height he loosed his eggs then beat his dragon as hard as he could to make it pull up he cursed again when a couple of dragonfliers didnt follow him back up into the sky maybe ambaldos fresher faster dragons would have made the men at the heavy sticks miss no way to know sabrino looked back over his shoulder ambaldos dragons were delivering their load of death over braunau going in with as much indifference to danger as any algarvian could want to show sabrino thought he was the first one to spot the swarm of rockgray unkerlanter dragons racing toward braunau from the southwest he hadnt even the time to grab for his crystal and shout out a warning before the unkerlanters swooped down on ambaldos wing slicing through his own almost as if it didnt exist the unkerlanters treated ambaldo and his dragonfliers about as rudely as the algarvians had treated the unkerlanter attack on their dragon farms earlier in the battle dragon after dragon painted in green and red and white tumbled out of the sky beset from above sabrino wasted no time ordering his own men back into the fray but the enemy having struck hard and fast flew off sabrinos dragons were too weary to make much of a pursuit worse he feared flying into another unkerlanter trap with the tired beasts his men were flying that would be the end of them ambaldos dragons or those of them that were left aligned on his when he shouted the other wing commanders name through the crystal he got no answer he didnt think anyone would get answers from ambaldo again back to our dragon farm he told his own squadron leaders well put the pieces back together as best we can and go on he didnt know where more dragons or for that matter more dragonfliers would come from he didnt know how long the wing could keep going without them either all at once without warning he felt old come on major spinello shouted as he led his troopers east we can still do it by the powers above we can but weve got to keep moving he wasnt commanding his own regiment anymore the battered formation he headed was about as big as his regiment had been at the start of the battle of durrwangen but it consisted of the mixedup remnants of three or four different regiments as cooks threw leftovers together to get another meal out of them so algarvian generals stirred together broken units to get one more fight from them battle group spinello they called this one spinello would have been prouder if he hadnt been so tired he pointed ahead if we get over that ridge line and onto the flat land up there we can tear swemmels whole position open its only a couple of miles now we can do it was anybody listening to him was anybody paying any attention at all he looked around to see what he saw were men as filthy and unshaven and weary as he was he looked ahead even the algarvian behemoths seemed worn unto death a couple of wedges of them led battle group spinello ahead without them every footsoldiers would have been wounded or killed by now more behemoths led more algarvian footsoldiers toward that ridge line here and there they dueled at long range with unkerlanter behemoths spinello had never imagined that unkerlant had bred so many behemoths hed never imagined that swemmels men would handle them so well either when a wellplaced algarvian egg knocked over one of those behemoths he let out a cheer see boys he said we can still lick em no point in running if you see a couple of enemy beasts and you havent got any of your own close by that had happened a few times in this battle the algarvians were used to sending their foes fleeing in panic with their behemoths they were anything but used to being on the receiving end of panic but any armys nerve wore thin if its men were fought as hard as they could be and then three steps more besides every so often troops would scream behemoths and run the other way when a couple of unkerlanter beasts showed themselves over the top of a rise captain turpino limped up to spinello his left calf was bandaged hed taken a blaze between the top of his boot and the bottom of his kilt but he refused to leave the field spinello was glad to have him here turpino was about as far from lovable as a man could get but he knew his business now he said sir looks like that little tiny rise there he pointed will screen us from the worst of what the unkerlanters can throw at us and still let us move east toward the real high ground spinello considered his nod when he gave it was hesitant aye unless the unkerlanters see that too and theyve got a brigade lying in wait for us with a shrug turpino answered sir theyve been lying in wait for us ever since we started this attack you want to know what i think somebodys head ought to roll for that im not saying youre wrong but you ought to have a care there spinello told him people i believe tell me this attack went in at the orders of his majesty himself mezentios a good king that doesnt necessarily make him a good general turpino said and whats he going to do to me boil me alive the way swemmel might not likely besides what can he do to me thats worse than what weve gone through these past two weeks good question spinello admitted the sort of question though where you may not want to find out the answer ill worry later turpino said right now the only thing im going to worry about is staying alive through this cursed fight if i manage that king mezentio is welcome to whatevers left of my carcass afterwards nodding spinello shouted for a crystallomancer when an officerbycourtesy with a crystal trotted over to him he said can you get hold of the fellow commanding the behemoths in front of us i can try sir the crystallomancer said youve got to remember though in a field as crowded as this that swemmels men are liable to pick up some of our emanations the same way we steal theirs every chance we get ill keep it in mind spinello said now get him aye sir the crystallomancer murmured the charm after his crystal flared with light an officer on a behemoth appeared in it actually spinello couldnt see much of him for the brim of his iron helmet almost covered his eyes while cheekpieces hid most of the rest of his face spinello knew hed be wearing chain and plate on his body too he didnt have to haul the weight around his behemoth did he listened to spinello then eyed the ground ahead himself after a moment he nodded all right major well go that way once we make it up to the top of the big rise then well see what we see how do you like our chances spinello asked were short a few behemoths or maybe more than a few down in the southeast the other officer answered swemmels whoresons held em up longer than we expected but we ought to be able to do the job just the same good spinello said itll have to do said the fellow on the behemoth and now farewell he vanished from the crystal the crystallomancer put it back into his pack the behemoths turned to use the track captain turpino had suggested spinello blew his whistle follow me he shouted a cry that made algarvian footsoldiers respect and obey the men who led them then he added another cry that was more likely to keep the men of battle group spinello alive pointing to the behemoths he yelled follow them for half a mile or so everything went very well so well in fact that spinello started to get suspicious his eyes went back and forth back and forth he kept expecting hordes of drunken unkerlanters to leap from trenches on either flank and rush toward his men with shouts of urra but the trouble when it came came from the front the unkerlanters crouched in their holes and waited till the wedges of behemoths were almost upon them some of those holes were so hard to spot spinello guessed they had sorcery covering them when swemmels men did pop up and start blazing even they werent so rash or so drunk as to charge instead they ducked down again and waited for the algarvian onslaught they didnt have long to wait the behemoths tossed eggs into their trenches forward spinello shouted again loose order the men he led probably could have done the job without commands theyd done it before some of them countless times having behemoths along to help was if anything an unusual luxury they advanced by rushes some soldiers blazing while others moved ahead the unkerlanters had an unpleasant choice keep their heads down till they were slaughtered in their holes or come out and try to get away more often than not most of them would have died in place here rather to spinellos surprise most of them fled maybe its the behemoths he thought if we can be twitchy about theirs no reason they shouldnt be twitchy about ours whatever the reason running did the unkerlanters little good more eggs from the algarvian behemoths burst among them flinging them this way and that like broken toys when the beam from a heavy stick caught a man in the back he didnt just go down he also went up in flames forward spinello shouted every step took battle group spinello and the behemoths with it closer to the high ground at the heart of the salient if the algarvians could get up there in numbers if they could move quickly once they did this great bloody grapple might yet turn out to have been worthwhile but one of the unkerlanter officers must have had a crystal and must have used it before he fell the algarvians hadnt gone far past the unkerlanter trench line before eggs began dropping among them spinello curled himself into a ball behind a boulder the big gray rock shielded him from the energies of eggs bursting in front of it it would do him no good if eggs burst in back of it he preferred not to dwell on that somewhere not far away an unkerlanter was down and shrieking for his mother in a high shrill voice his cries went on and on then cut off abruptly somebody spinello supposed had put him out of his agony he hoped someone would do the same for him if the need arose even more he hoped it never would he aimed to die in bed preferably with company despite the eggs falling among its men and behemoths battle group spinello fought its way forward spinello noticed the ground rising more sharply under his feet than it had before were getting where we need to go he called pointing ahead if we can get up there in strength if we can drive the unkerlanters back once we do it nothing weve been through will have mattered well rip swemmels boys a new arsehole and then well go on and win this war mezentio and victory mezentio and victory the soldiers shouted they were veterans they knew he was telling them the truth as long as they could keep going forward they would finally battle their way past the last unkerlanter defensive line then it would be fighting in open country and swemmels soldiers had never been able to match them in that destroy the durrwangen bulge destroy the unkerlanter armies here and who could say what might happen after that the unkerlanters might have drawn the same conclusion if they had they liked it less than spinello had more eggs fell on the advancing algarvians forcing footsoldiers to go to earth and separating them from the behemoths which made life more difficult for all of mezentios men algarvian eggtossers and algarvian dragons went hunting the enemys tossers but algarvian dragons didnt have everything their own way not here dragons painted rockgray swooped down on battle group spinello unkerlanter dragons had contested the sky west of here ever since this battle began some of them tried to flame behemoths others dropped still more eggs on the algarvian footsoldiers spinello was running toward the crater one egg had blown in the ground when another burst close by all at once he wasnt running anymore but flying through the air he landed in a thornbush which tore at him but probably saved him from the worse damage he would have got slamming into the ground not till he freed himself tried to go on and put weight on his right leg did he realize a chunk of metal egg casing had wounded him he went down in a heap unlike turpinos his leg wouldnt support him anymore blood poured from a gash above the knee pain poured from the gash too now that he knew he had it stretcherbearers he bawled hoping some of them would hear him stretcherbearers he took a bandage from his belt pouch and bound up the wound as best he could he also gulped down a little jar of poppy juice that made the pain retreat but couldnt rout it battle group turpino now he thought here we are pal an algarvian said he and his comrade lifted spinello and set him on their stretcher well get you out of here that or die trying it wasnt a joke even if it sounded like one i wanted to see the fight on the high ground spinello grumbled but he wouldnt not now thirteen marshal rathar had stayed in durrwangen to direct the twin fights on each flank of the salient from his headquarters for as long as he could stand and indeed for a little longer than that as long as both battles were going furiously he didnt see much point to directly overseeing one or the other he might have guessed wrong as to which would prove the more important and would have no one but himself to blame king swemmel would have no one but him to blame either now though the algarvians plainly wouldnt break through in the east theyd thrown everything they had at braunau theyd broken into the village several times theyd never gone past it and they didnt hold it at the moment rathar had a good notion of the reserves the redheads had left on that side of the bulge and of his own forces over there braunau and that whole side of the salient would stand here in the west though here on the western side of the bulge the unkerlanters had badly hurt mezentios men theyd killed a lot of enemy behemoths and theyd cost the algarvians a lot of time fighting their way through one heavily defended line after another but on this flank unlike the other the algarvians hadnt had to halt they were still coming theyd gained the high ground hed hoped to deny them and they might yet break through and race to cut off the salient in the style theyd shown the past two summers well just have to stop them thats all he said to general vatran oh aye as easy as boiling water for tea vatran said and took a sip from the mug in front of him his grimace filled his face with so many wrinkles it might almost have belonged to an aging gargoyle dont i wish dont we all wish we have to do it rathar repeated he got up from the folding table at which hed been sitting with vatran and paced back and forth under the plum trees that shielded his new field headquarters from the prying eyes of dragonfliers the plateau up here sloped down toward the ground the algarvians had already won gullies some of them dry more with streams at their bottom cut up the flat land most of it was given over to fields and meadows but orchards like this one and little clumps of forest varied the landscape rathar sat his jaw we have to do it and we cursed well will he raised his voice crystallomancer aye lord marshal the young mage came running his crystal ready to hand get me general gurmun in charge of the reserve force of behemoths rathar said aye sir the crystallomancer murmured the charm he needed light flared from the crystal a face appeared in it another crystallomancers face rathars man spoke to the other fellow who hurried away less than a minute later general gurmuns hard visage appeared in the sphere of glass rathars crystallomancer nodded go ahead lord marshal without preamble rathar said general i want all your behemoths moving to me and to the advancing algarvians in an hour can you do it if gurmun said no rathar intended to sack him on the spot gurmun had first won command of an army in the war against the zuwayzin when his thensuperior proved too drunk to deliver an attack when rathar wanted it drunkenness wasnt gurmuns vice he hadnt shown many vices in the three and a half years since but now would be the worst possible moment for one to make itself known sir we can gurmun said inside half an hour in fact well hit the redheads an hour after that by the powers above well hit em hard too good enough rathar gestured to his crystallomancer who broke the etheric link gurmuns image vanished as abruptly as it had appeared vatran whistled a low soft note the whole reserve of behemoths lord marshal he pointed west toward mezentios own oncoming horde of behemoths the field wont be big enough to hold all the beasts battling on it rathar didnt answer he walked to the edge of the plum orchard and swung a spyglass in the direction vatran had pointed advancing wedges of algarvian behemoths leaped toward his eye the redheads werent having things all their own way unkerlanter behemoths and footsoldiers and dragons made them pay for every yard they gained but mezentios men had the bit between their teeth like any good troops they could feel it on they came if the reserves couldnt stop them if the reserves couldnt stop them odds were vatran or gurmun or some other general would get the big stars on his collar the green sash and the ceremonial sword that went with being marshal of unkerlant swemmel had been more forgiving of rathar than of any other officer in his command perhaps but only perhaps because he truly believed rathar wouldnt try to steal the throne but he was unlikely to tolerate failure here sitting on the throne rathar knew he too would have been unlikely to tolerate failure here unkerlanter dragons struck at the algarvian behemoths algarvian dragons promptly struck at the unkerlanters keeping them too busy to deliver the blows they should have rathar cursed under his breath hed hoped to have gained control of the air by this point in the fighting no such luck as far as he could tell neither side dominated the air above the durrwangen bulge he turned to the southeast looking for some sign of the arrival of gurmuns behemoths no such luck there either the plum trees screened him away from a good view in that direction he looked back toward the algarvians and scowled if gurmun didnt get here when hed said he would this headquarters would come under attack before long even though rathar couldnt see much to the southeast he knew to the minute when the behemoth reserve began to draw near half maybe more than half of the algarvian dragons broke off their fight with their unkerlanter counterparts and flew off to the southeast as fast as they could go he might not have seen gurmun coming but they had rathar ran back to the table where vatran still stat as he ran he shouted for the crystallomancer again the commanders of the dragon wings he ordered when the minor mage hurried up to him then he spoke urgently into the crystal the redheads kept you from savaging their behemoths too badly by the powers above youve got to keep them from punishing ours before they reach the field if you fail there were liable to be ruined one after another the wing commander promised to obey rathar hurried back to the edge of the orchard this time vatran came with him fewer unkerlanter dragons were attacking the algarvian behemoths he supposed that meant he hoped it meant the unkerlanters were holding the algarvian dragons away from their behemoths curse the redheads he growled theyre altogether too good at what they do vatran set a hand on his arm lord marshal youve done everything you could do here he said now its time to let the men do what they can do i want to grab a stick and fight alongside them rathar said i want to be everywhere at once and fighting in all those different places you are vatran told him everybody out there he waved is doing what hes doing because your orders told him to do it not everybody rathar said vatran raised a shaggy white eyebrow the marshal explained the algarvians powers below eat em dont want to listen to me at all vatran laughed though rathar hadnt meant it as a joke then at the same time he and vatran both cocked their heads to one side listening hard to a low but building rumble to the southeast or was it listening vatran said im not sure i hear that with my ears or feel it through the soles of my feet you know what i mean rathar nodded that said it better than he could have he stepped out from the cover of the plum trees and looked in the direction of the rumble again a couple of algarvian behemoths had drawn close enough for their crews to spy him eggs flew toward him but burst a couple of hundred yards short and then he whooped like a schoolboy unexpectedly dismissed early here they come he shouted gurmuns on time after all now that their crewmen had seen the algarvian enemy the behemoths from gurmuns reserve several hundred of them a whole armys worth broke into a furious gallop to get into the fight quick as they could they cut in behind the leading algarvian behemoths moving so fast that the redheads didnt have time to deploy against them look at that hardly aware he was doing it rathar pounded vatran on the back will you look at that there hasnt been a charge like that this whole bloody war some of them are even using their horns to fight with if the field had seemed too small with only the algarvian behemoths moving forward on it it suddenly got more than twice as crowded rathar knew a moments pity for the footsoldiers on that field neither sides behemoths were likely to their crews tossed eggs and blazed at one another from ridiculously short ranges as rathar had said some gored others right through their armor as if they were unicorns back in the days before mages learned how to make sticks grass fires sprang up in a dozen places at once making it harder for rathar to tell what was going on even with his spyglass but he could see that the algarvians as was their way didnt stay surprised long they fought back furiously against gurmuns behemoths wedges of algarvian beasts would pop out from behind orchards and copses toss eggs and blaze at the foe and then take cover again gurmun didnt need long to adopt the same tactics overhead both sides dragons battled to something close to a draw the algarvians sacrificed kaunians addanz and the other unkerlanter mages sacrificed their own luckless people to answer the sorcerous duel the duel of horrors was also as near even as made no difference that left it up to the behemoths they surged back and forth over the plain as the sun crawled across the sky if the redheads had enough beasts left after shattering gurmuns reserve their own attack might go on but rathar knew that part of their force of behemoths remained some miles to the southwest it wouldnt get here while todays fight lasted gurmun had the advantage of numbers the algarvians in spite of everything the advantage of skill with two heavy weights flung into the pans of the scale they jounced up and down now one higher now the other an unkerlanter behemoth crew blazed down an algarvian beast the other algarvian behemoths in that part of the field attacked the unkerlanters badly wounding their behemoth the driver the only crewman left on it charged the algarvians he blazed down one and gored another in the flank before his own behemoth finally toppled by then the sun had sunk low in the southwest seen through thick smoke it was red as blood rathar wondered where the day had gone he turned to vatran we havent broken them but weve held them he said they arent going to come pouring through in a great tide the way we feared they would wearily vatran nodded no doubt youre right lord marshal they cant hit us another blow like this one theyve left too many men and beasts dead on the field aye marshal rathar preferred not to dwell on how many unkerlanter men and beasts lay dead on the fields of the durrwangen bulge whatever the cost though he and the soldiers of his kingdom had stopped the algarvians here which meant he called for the crystallomancer when the man came up to him he said connect me to the general commanding our army east and south of the algarvian forces on the eastern flank of the salient and when that officers image appeared in the crystal rathar spoke four words let the counterattack begin like the rest of the algarvian constables in gromheort bembo avidly followed news of the big battles down in the south of unkerlant news sheets from across the nearby border with algarve were brought into town daily so the constables didnt have to go to the trouble of learning to read forthwegian for the first several days of the fight near durrwangen everything seemed to go well the news sheets reported victories on the ground and in the air and their maps showed king mezentios armies advancing the news sheets in forthwegian must have said the same thing for the locals who didnt love their algarvian occupiers strode through gromheort with long faces and then little by little the news sheets stopped talking about the battle they didnt proclaim the great crushing triumph all the algarvians had looked for i want to know whats going on constable almonio complained one morning while he and his comrades were queued up for breakfast bembo stood right behind him sergeant pesaro stood behind bembo turning to pesaro bembo said touching to see such innocence in this age of the world isnt it it is indeed pesaro said as if almonio werent there but then hes the tenderheaded one remember almonio wouldnt hurt a fly or even a kaunian that made bembo laugh it made almonio furious i keep trying to behave like a human being in spite of what the war is doing to all of us he snapped like a drunken human being a lot of the time bembo said almonio really didnt have the stomach for rounding up kaunians he poured down the spirits whenever he had to do it to keep from dwelling on what hed done but he was sober now sober and angry i still dont know what the two of you are talking about he said that edge still in his voice like a stupid human being pesaro said which only made almonio angrier pesaro though was a sergeant so almonio couldnt show that anger so readily not if he had the slightest notion of what was good for him with a sigh both sad and sarcastic pesaro went on he really doesnt get it almonio threw his hands in the air he just missed knocking another constables mess tin out of his hands which would have given the other fellow reason to be angry at him what is there to get he demanded all i want to know is how the battle turned out and the miserable news sheets wont tell me a naturalborn innocent bembo said again to pesaro then he gave his attention back to almonio my dear fellow if you really need it spelled out for you ill do the job if the news sheets dont give us any news its because theres no good news to give there is that simple enough or shall i draw pictures oh almonio said in a very small voice but if the unkerlanters have beaten us down at durrwangen if theyve beaten us in the summertime his voice trailed away altogether were constables sergeant pesaro said perhaps as much to reassure himself as to make almonio and incidentally bembo feel better weve got a job to do here and an important job it is too whatever happens hundreds of miles away doesnt matter a bit to us not a bit do you hear me almonio nodded so did bembo he wasnt so sure his sergeant was right but he wanted to think so anything else was too depressing to contemplate the wine the refectory served with breakfast was nasty sour stuff but he had an extra mug anyhow almonio had an extra two or three bembo wasnt keeping close track when he went out on patrol with oraste he found his partner in a dour mood oraste was often dour but more so than usual today at last bembo asked him whats gnawing at you oraste walked on for several paces without answering bembo thought he wouldnt answer but after a bit he did how in blazes are we supposed to win the war now what do you think i am bembo demanded so fiercely that even rugged oraste gave back a pace a general king mezentio i dont know anything about that business all i know is the bigwigs in trapani will come up with something they always have whats one more time theyd better oraste growled as if hed hold bembo responsible if they didnt that was what should have happened in this big battle it didnt how many more chances do we get as long as theyre fighting way inside unkerlant im not going to worry about it bembo said if youve got any sense you wont worry about it either youre the one who was always saying that if i didnt like it here i could get a stick and go fight the unkerlanters now ill tell you the same cursed thing powers below eat you bembo oraste said surprisingly little rancor in his voice you were supposed to say something funny and stupid so i could stop brooding about the way things are going but you dont like it any more than i do do you instead of answering that straight out bembo said i had to explain the facts of life to almonio this morning he couldnt figure them out for himself why am i not surprised that one oraste grimaced the other question is how come im jealous of him bembo didnt answer that at all shouts from around a corner made them both yank out their sticks and start to run bembo was amazed at the relief with which he ran catching thieves and robbers was why he was here in gromheort as long as he was doing his job he wouldnt have to worry about anything else whats going on here he yelled when he got to the two shouting forthwegians of necessity he spoke algarvian both forthwegians looked as if they understood the language they were middleaged and had probably had to learn it in school back in the days before the six years war this part of forthweg had belonged to algarve then after glancing at each other they spoke together why nothing dont get wise with us oraste said youll be sorry if you do if he could pummel or blaze a forthwegian or two he wouldnt have to think about the way things looked in unkerlant one of the forthwegians said it was nothing really we were just having a bit of a disagreement the other one said sorry we got so loud bembo put away his stick but drew his bludgeon from its loop on his belt and thwacked it into the palm of his left hand you heard my partner dont get wise with us were not in any mood to waste time with forthwegians who want to act cute have you got that on reflection bembo wondered if he should have put it that way what it meant was were jumpy as cats because the war against unkerlant isnt going the way wed like the forthwegians didnt have to be theoretical sorcerers to figure that out either but bembo and oraste had clubs they had sticks they had the power of the occupying authority behind them even if the forthwegians were privately contemptuous they didnt dare show what they were thinking one of them said sorry sir the other one nodded to show he was sorry too thats better bembo said now im going to try this one more time and i want a straight answer what in blazes is going on here were both oil merchants one of the forthwegians said olive almond walnut flaxseed you name it oil and we were arguing about which way prices were going to go on account of he paused the pause stretched hed just admitted knowing things werent going so well for algarve that wasnt very smart lamely he finished on account of the way things are ill tell you what you were doing bembo said you were disturbing the peace thats what you were doing creating a disturbance that happens to be a crime well have to haul you up before a judge both forthwegians looked appalled as hed known they would isnt there some other arrangement we might make asked the oil merchant whod done most of the talking aye oraste rumbled we might not bother with a fornicating judge we might whale the stuffing out of you ourselves instead he sounded as if hed enjoy pounding on the forthwegians the reason he sounded that way as bembo knew perfectly well was that he would enjoy it unlike oraste bembo didnt usually beat people for the sport of it he said maybe you boys might find some reason why we wouldnt want to do that the oil merchants found several interesting reasons those reasons clinked in the constables belt pouches as they went back to walking their beat oraste reached out and hit bembo in the belly not much of a punch but the flesh gave a good deal under his fist youre soft he remarked soft in more ways than one you just want to smash everything flat bembo answered theyre oil merchants they greased our palms thats what theyre for right funny oraste said funny like a man with a wooden leg bembo sent him an injured look when we get back to tricarico well be rich or close to it anyway its not like weve got a lot to spend our money on here the wine and the spirits are cheap and nobody wants to go to the brothel every night speak for yourself oraste said like any algarvian he was vain about his manhood the whores here arent as expensive as they are back home his lip curled of course they arent as pretty as they are back home either oh i dont know bembo almost said it remembering his steamy passage with doldasai he was vain about his manhood too but then he remembered he couldnt talk about that nobodyd grabbed her or her mother and father when the algarvians raided the kaunian quarter in gromheort from that bembo figured the blonds had got and used the sorcery that let them look like forthwegians and slipped out of the quarter before the raids nobodyd ever said anything about their disappearance where he could hear but some highranking officers wouldnt be happy that they werent enjoying what hed had once keeping his mouth shut came no easier for him than for any other boastful algarvian but a keen sense of selfpreservation made him do it their remaining time on the beat passed easily enough when they got back to the constabulary barracks bembo pounced on the latest edition of the news sheet ha he said heres news of the fighting or of some fighting anyway whats it say oraste asked ill read it bembo did in a deep artificial portentous voice in severe defensive struggles southeast of durrwangen algarvian forces inflicted severe casualties on the foe despite heavy bombardment by eggtossers and fierce attacks from unkerlanter dragons and behemoths his majestys forces withdrew to already prepared rearward positions yielding only about a mile of ground and shortening their lines in the process he returned to his normal tones to ask oraste what do you make of that his partner pondered but not for long sounds like a demon of a lot of dead soldiers to me ours or theirs both oraste said bembo gave forth with a theatrical sigh i was hoping youd tell me something different because thats what it sounds like to me too where is everyone krasta demanded of colonel lurcanio as the carriage pulled up in front of viscount valnus house she gave her algarvian lover a peeved look are you sure you got the date right she hoped oh how she hoped lurcanio had got it wrong if he had shed never let him live it down but he nodded and pointed through the gloom a few carriages are there do you see even so his voice was doubtful as he added i admit i expected a good many more is someone else giving another entertainment krasta asked lurcanio shook his head in dark night with no street lamps krasta could barely see the motion he said no i would have heard of that and if by some chance i did not you would have he was right krasta realized as much at once well just have to find out then wont we she said as the carriage pulled to a stop where everyone else has gone i mean aye so we will now lurcanios voice had an edge to it perhaps people have not gone anywhere perhaps they have simply chosen not to come dont be ridiculous krasta didnt wait for him to hand her down but descended from the carriage herself and hurried toward valnus house over her shoulder she added why would anybody be as stupid as that lurcanio caught up with her faster than she might have wanted there are times when you can be quite refreshingly naive he remarked i dont know what youre talking about she said in some annoyance i know its part of your charm lurcanio answered krasta would have snapped at him some more but hed already rung the bell a moment later the door swung open one of valnus servants let them into the front hall he closed the door behind them before opening the dark curtains at the end of the hallway that kept light from leaking out krasta blinked at the bright lights the curtains revealed she also blinked at viscount valnu who stood just beyond the curtains his tunic and kilt were of clothofgold that caught the lamplight and glittered she wouldnt have wanted to wear such material herself too gaudy but valnu brought it off not least by appearing to reject the possibility that he might do anything else my lady he cried when he saw krasta he took her in his arms and kissed her on the cheek so good to see you here spare me your embraces lurcanio said dryly as valnu turned to him valnu had been known to kiss him on the cheek too valnu was never one who did anything by halves i obey he said now and bowed himself almost double krasta had to blink again because of the reflections coruscating from his costume then he bowed again as if intent on showing himself to be even more ceremonious than the average algarvian speaking with unwonted seriousness he went on i am in your debt your excellency and i am not ashamed to own it were it not for your good offices i would probably be languishing in some nasty cell i had little to do with it lurcanio answered some of your friends he put a certain ironic emphasis on the word undoubtedly helped you more valnu didnt pretend to misunderstand him but you sir unlike they were known to be disinterested disinterested no lurcanio shook his head uninterested there i must say aye a nice show of the difference in meaning between the two words eh your excellency you speak my language with a scholars precision valnu said i beg leave to doubt it lurcanio replied but he didnt sound displeased he took krastas arm and led her past their host krasta gave valnu a bright even a glowing smile she kept trying to forget about the trouble in which shed landed herself for trifling with him and letting him trifle with her she probably would have succeeded too had lurcanio not found such a fitting way to punish her few lessons stuck with her for long but that one at least had left her cautious as for valnu his long lean face stayed sober maybe he really did think he owed lurcanio a debt or maybe he didnt feel like taking the chance of getting caught again either his cook and his cellarer had set out an elegant and lavish display as they always did krasta hadnt eaten supper even so she hesitated to go over and get anything the guests already here left her dismayed oh not the algarvian officers and their valmieran mistresses she was used to them but the few valmieran nobles whod come were either of the fierce and brutal sort or else were those who fawned on the algarvians the most extravagantly where are all the interesting people krasta murmured to lurcanio her algarvian lover had also been surveying the crowd not that it unduly crowded valnus reception hall lurcanio sighed fairweather friends most of them what do you mean krasta asked what do i mean i mean that too many of them are wondering about their choices lurcanio let out a scornful sniff mark my words my dear no one can recover his virginity as easily as that he was being obscure again krasta hated it when he wouldnt come out and say what he meant powers above she thought i always say what i mean but shed already asked what he meant once she had too much pride and too much dread of his sharp tongue to embarrass herself by asking again with another sigh colonel lurcanio said we might as well drink after a while at the bar things may look better why so they may krasta had improved plenty of gatherings with enough porter or wine or for severe cases wormwoodlaced brandy this festivity if that was what it was looked like a severe case even so she started with red wine reasoning she could always move up to something stronger later on lurcanio raised an eyebrow when she gave the tapman her order maybe hed expected her to drink herself blind in short order she smiled at him over the top of her goblet she didnt want to be too predictable smiling himself a little quizzically lurcanio asked for red wine too to what shall we drink he asked that startled krasta he usually proposed toasts himself rather than asking her for them she raised her goblet to good company she said and then under her breath may we find some soon she drank with a laugh so did lurcanio then the laughter slipped from his face i think we are about to have company whether good or otherwise he bowed to the valmieran nobleman approaching him good evening sir i do not believe we have met i am lurcanio i present to you also my companion here the marchioness krasta right pleased to meet you colonel the valmieran said in a backwoods dialect im viscount terbatu he held out his hand lurcanio in algarvian fashion clasped his wrist except for a brief nod terbatu ignored krasta that suited her fine he looked more like a tavern brawler than a viscount his nose bent sideways and one of his ears was missing half the lobe she drank more wine content to let lurcanio deal with him i am pleased to make your acquaintance your excellency lurcanio said polite as a cat and what can i do for you by his tone he assumed terbatu would want him to do something fight terbatu growled i beg your pardon lurcanio said and then though he remained a polished gentleman he showed he was polished steel drawing himself a little straighter he asked do we need to continue this conversation through friends if so i shall make every effort to give satisfaction by that even krasta understood him to mean ill kill you she thought he could do it too and without breaking a sweat terbatu put her in mind of a badtempered hound barking at a viper he was liable to be dead before he knew it but he shook his closecropped head no no no not fight you sir not that at all fight for you i meant valmierans fighting for algarve ive tried to get your people to let me raise a regiment and go hunting unkerlanters but nobody wants to pay any attention to me who do i have to kill to make you wake up lurcanio rocked back on his heels to krasta who knew him well that showed astonishment to terbatu it might have shown nothing at all krasta was astonished too and not so good at hiding it as lurcanio you want to fight for the redheads she blurted careless of her lover beside her how could any man of kaunian blood want to do that when mezentios men were murdering the kaunians from forthweg for the sake of their life energy terbatu said im not wild about the notion of fighting for algarve he nodded to lurcanio no offense your excellency turning back to krasta he went on but the unkerlanters now the unkerlanters deserve smashing up if ever a kingdom was a boil on the arse of mankind unkerlants the one bloody big boil too he added looking to lurcanio again it certainly is the algarvian colonel agreed after a moment he bowed to terbatu you must understand sir that i appreciate the spirit in which you offer yourself and whatever countrymen who might fight under your banner there are however certain practical difficulties of which i doubt you are aware youre a kaunian and were already killing kaunians to fight unkerlant that was what lurcanio meant krasta knew it again she had all she could do not to shout it at the top of her lungs and then terbatu said wouldnt you sooner have live men fighting on your side than dead ones colonel krasta stared at him so did lurcanio after a long long pause lurcanio said i have no idea what you are talking about my lord viscount the backwoods noble started to get angry then grudgingly he checked himself and nodded i suppose i see why you have to say such things your excellency but were men of the world eh you and i lurcanio certainly was he didnt look as if he wanted to admit any such thing about terbatu krasta didnt blame him there he let another pause stretch longer than it should have then said in any case your excellency i am not the man to hear such proposals you must put them to grand duke ivone my sovereigns military governor for valmiera if you will excuse me rather pointedly he took krasta by the elbow and steered her away he also left valnus mansion earlier than he might have i trust you enjoyed yourself your excellency milady valnu said krasta was willing to keep silent for politeness sake lurcanio said i am glad to find you such a trusting soul once out of the mansion and into his carriage he asked krasta do you know what that terbatu fellow was talking about back there cautiously ever so cautiously she answered i think a lot of people have heard things nobody knows how much to believe the first sentence was true the second anything but she at least knew exactly how much to believe a good working rule lurcanio said is to believe as little as one possibly can krasta laughed a nervous laugh but he was plainly serious and if a crack like that didnt mark him as a man of the world what would king shazli of zuwayza leaned toward his foreign minister the question i gather is no longer whether algarve can go forward against unkerlant but whether she can keep unkerlant from going forward against her no your majesty hajjaj solemnly shook his head no shazli frowned this is what i have understood from everything you and general ikhshid have been telling me am i mistaken im afraid you are your majesty hajjaj wondered how he would have been able to say such a thing to king swemmel well no actually he didnt wonder he knew it would have been impossible as things were he had no trouble continuing unkerlant will go forward against algarve this summer this question is how far oh king shazli said in the tones of a man who might have expected better but who saw the difference between what hed expected and what lay before him as bad as that i would be lying if i told you otherwise hajjaj said down in the south our allys attack did not do everything the algarvians had hoped it would now its swemmels turn and well have to see what he can do one hopes for the best while preparing for the worst a good way to go about things generally wouldnt you say shazli remarked hajjaj nodded he had to work hard to keep his face straight but he managed hed been saying such things to his young sovereign for many years now the king was repeating them back to him few things gave a man more satisfaction than knowing someone had listened to him but then with the air of someone grasping for straws shazli went on things are quiet here in the north so they are for now hajjaj agreed for the past two summers the greatest fight in unkerlant has been down in the south but i would say that at the moment the algarvians dont know how long that will last and neither do we the only people who know are king swemmel and perhaps marshal rathar shazli poured more date wine into his goblet he gulped it down if the blow falls here can the algarvians withstand it by the powers above your excellency if the blow falls here can we withstand it from my conversations with general ikhshid he is reasonably confident the blow will not fall on us any time soon hajjaj replied well thats something of a relief anyhow the king said so it is hajjaj didnt think he needed to tell shazli ikhshids reason for holding that opinion that zuwayza was only a distraction to unkerlant and algarve the real fight hajjaj did say the algarvians are the ones who will best know their situation in this part of the world how much do you suppose balastro would tell you king shazli asked as little as he could hajjaj said with a smile shazli smiled too though neither of them seemed much amused hajjaj added sometimes of course what he doesnt say is as illuminating as what he does shall i consult with him then use your own best judgment shazli answered by the nature of things you will be seeing him before too long so long as the blow has not fallen when you do will probably be time enough he gnawed at the inside of his lower lip and if the blow does fall it will tell us what we need to know he softly clapped his hands together a gesture of dismissal hajjaj rose and bowed and left his sovereigns presence even the thick mudbrick walls of shazlis palace couldnt hold out all the savage heat not at this season of the year servitors strolled rather than bustling sweat streamed down their bare hides hajjaj was not immune to sweat indeed he was sweating as much from what he knew as from the weather when he got back to his own office his secretary bowed and asked and how are things your excellency you know at least as well as i do hajjaj said maybe i do qutuz answered i was hoping they would be rather better than that though heh hajjaj said and then what have we here he pointed to an envelope on his desk one of minister horthys aides brought it by a few minutes ago qutuz said horthy eh hajjaj said qutuz nodded what went through hajjajs mind was it could be worse it could have been an invitation from marquis balastro or it could have come from minister iskakis of yanina horthy of gyongyos was a large solid man not given to displays of temper he made a good host like any diplomat horthy wrote in classical kaunian saying your company at a reception at the ministry at sunset day after tomorrow would be greatly appreciated hajjaj studied the note in some bemusement in the days of the kaunian empire his ancestors had traded with the blonds but that was all in faroff gyongyos the kaunian empire had been the stuff of myth and legend as gyongyos had been to the ancient kaunians yet he and horthy who had no other tongue in common shared that one there was one irony another of course was that zuwayza and gyongyos shared algarve as an ally considering what king mezentios soldiers and mages were doing to the kaunians of forthweg hajjaj sometimes felt guilty for using their language may i see your excellency qutuz asked and hajjaj passed him the leaf of paper his secretary read it then found the next logical question when i reply for you what shall i say tell him i accept with pleasure and look forward to seeing him hajjaj said his secretary nodded and went off to draft the note for his signature hajjaj sighed balastro would be at horthys reception so would iskakis the diplomatic community in bishah was shrunken these days the ministers for unkerlant and forthweg valmiera and jelgava sibiu and lagoas and kuusamo stood empty these days little ortah the only neutral kingdom left in the world looked after the buildings and after the interests of the kingdoms from his office in the anteroom to hajjajs qutuz asked do you suppose iskakis will bring his wife im sure i dont know though he often does hajjaj replied he likes to show her off thats true his secretary said as far as anyone can tell though showing her off is all he likes to do with her he sighed its a pity really i dont care how pale she is shes a lovely woman she certainly is hajjaj agreed iskakis wears a mask and wants everyone to take it for his face no matter how lovely his wife was iskakis preferred boys that didnt particularly bother hajjaj the yaninan ministers hypocrisy did what sort of clothes will you wear qutuz asked oh by the powers above the zuwayzi foreign minister exclaimed that problem wouldnt arise at a zuwayzi feast where no one would wear anything between hat and sandals algarvianstyle will do hajjaj said at last we are all friends of algarves however exciting the prospect is these days thus it was that two days later he rolled through the streets of bishah in a royal carriage while wearing one of his unstylish algarvian outfits his own countrymen stared at him a few of them sent him pitying looks even though the sun had sunk low the day remained viciously hot and someone sent up a thoroughly disrespectful shout go home you old fool have you lost all of your mind patting his sweaty face with a linen handkerchief hajjaj wondered about that himself the gyongyosian guards outside the ministry were sweating too no one shouted at them with their fierce leonine faces even more to the point with the sticks slung on their backs they looked ready to blaze anyone who gave them a hard time what with gyongyosians reputation as a warrior race they might have done it but they bowed to hajjaj one of them spoke in their twittering language the other proved to know at least a few words of zuwayzi for he said welcome your excellency and stood aside to let the foreign minister pass inside the gyongyosian ministry horthy clasped hajjajs hand and said the same thing in classical kaunian with his thick graystreaked tawny beard he too put hajjaj in mind of a lion he was a cultured lion though for he continued in the same language choose anything under the stars here that makes you happy you are too kind hajjaj murmured looking around in fascination he didnt come here very often whenever he did he thought himself transported to the exotic lands of the uttermost west the squaredoff heavy furniture the pictures of snowy mountains on the walls with their captions in an angular script he could not read the crossed axes that formed so large a part of the decoration all reminded him how different these folk were from his own even horthys invitation felt strange alone among civilized folk the gyongyosians cared nothing for the powers above and the powers below they measured their life in this world and the world to come by the stars hajjaj had never understood that but there were a great many more urgent things in the world that he didnt understand either he got himself a glass of wine grape wine for date wine was as alien to gyongyos as swearing by the stars was to him he took a chicken leg roasted with gyongyosian spices chief among them a reddish powder that reminded him a little of pepper nothing quite like it grew in zuwayza one of the gyongyosians was an excellent fiddler he strolled through the reception hall coaxing fiery music from his instrument as he went hajjaj had never imagined going to war behind a fiddle drums and blaring horns were zuwayzas martial instruments but this fellow showed him a different way might be as good as his own there was iskakis of yanina in earnest conversation with a handsome junior military attachй from gyongyos and there over in a corner stood balastro of algarve in earnest conversation with iskakis lovely young wife hajjaj strolled over to them he had not the slightest intention of asking about the military situation in southern unkerlant not at the moment instead he hoped to head off trouble before it started iskakis might not be passionately devoted to her as a lover but he did have a certain pride of possession and balastro balastro was an algarvian which meant where women were concerned he was trouble waiting to happen seeing hajjaj approach he bowed good evening your excellency he said coming to save me from myself by all appearances someone should hajjaj replied and what would you save me from your excellency iskakis wife asked in fair algarvian the marquis at least seeks to save me from boredom is that what they call it these days hajjaj murmured rather louder he added milady i might hope to help save you from yourself not caring in the least who heard her she answered i would like you better if you looked to save me from my husband with a sigh hajjaj went off to find himself another goblet of wine diplomacy had failed here as it had all over derlavai part of pekka wished shed never gone home to kajaani never spent most of her leave in her husbands arms it made coming back to the naantali district and the rigors of theoretical sorcery all the harder another part of her though quite simply wished she hadnt come back the wilderness seemed doubly desolate after seeing a city even a moderatesized one like kajaani and she had trouble returning to the narrow world that centered on the newly built hostel and the blockhouse and the journey between them everything felt tiny artificial people rubbed her raw without intending to do it or as in the case of ilmarinen they meant every bit of it no we are not going to do that she told the elderly theoretical sorcerer she sounded sharper than shed intended ive told you why not before were trying to make a weapon here we can investigate the theoretical aspects that havent got anything to do with weapons when we have more time till then we have to concentrate on what needs doing most how can we be sure of what that is unless we investigate widely ilmarinen demanded we dont have the people to investigate as widely as you want pekka answered we barely have the people to investigate all the ley lines were on right now there arent enough theoretical sorcerers in the whole land of the seven princes to do everything you want done youre a professor yourself ilmarinen said on whom do you blame that sure enough he was being as difficult as he could pekka refused to rise to the bait i dont blame anyone its just the way things are she smiled an unpleasant smile if ilmarinen felt like being difficult she could be difficult too or would you like us to bring in more mages from lagoas that might give us the manpower wed need and it might give lagoas the edge against us in any trouble we have with them ilmarinen answered then he paused and scowled at pekka it might give you the chance to poke pins in me to see me jump too master ilmarinen when you are contrary with numbers wonderful things happen pekka said you see things no one else can you see things where no one else would think to look but when you are contrary with people you drive everyone around you mad i know you do at least some of it for your amusement but we havent got time for that either who knows what the algarvians are doing i do he answered at once theyre retreating i wonder how good theyll be at it they havent had much practice that wasnt what shed meant ilmarinen doubtless knew as much too he hated the algarvians murderous magecraft perhaps even more than she did but she thought she hoped hed made the crack as a sort of peace offering she answered in that spirit saying may they learn it and learn it well no ilmarinen shook his head may they learn it and learn it badly that will cost them more he called down imaginative curses on the heads of king mezentio and all his ancestors before long in spite of everything he had pekka giggling then making her gladder still he left without arguing anymore for abstract research at the expense of military research he has lost his sense of proportion pekka told fernao at breakfast the next morning the lagoan mage probably would have understood had she spoken kuusaman hed made new strides in her language even in the short time shed been away but she spoke classical kaunian anyhow using the international language of scholarship helped give her some distance from what had gone on fernao spooned up more barley porridge seasoned with butter and salt his answer also came in classical kaunian that is why you head this project and he does not or does not anymore you can supply that sense of proportion even if he has lost it i suppose so pekka sighed but i wish he would remember that too of course if he remembered such things i would not have to lead the way here now i rather wish i did not someone must fernao said you are the best suited maybe pekka had a little bone from her grilled smoked herring stuck between two teeth after worrying it free with her tongue she said i had hoped more would be done while i was away i am sorry fernao said as if the failure were his fault pekka didnt think that was true she knew however that fernao was the only theoretical sorcerer who showed any sign of taking responsibility for the lull she said maybe you should have been in charge while i went to kajaani i doubt it he answered i would not care to take orders from a kuusaman in lagoas no wonder the reverse holds true here why would you not want to take orders from one of my countrymen in your kingdom pekka asked if the kuusaman were best suited to lead the job whatever it was fernao laughed which bewildered pekka he said i think you may be too sane for your own good that made her laugh in turn before she could say anything a crystallomancer came into the dining hall calling her name im here she said getting to her feet what is it a message for you the young woman answered stolidly i suspected that aye pekka said but from whom my son my husband my laundryman back in kajaani that was a bit of sarcasm of which she thought even ilmarinen might have approved its prince juhainen mistress pekka the crystallomancer said what pekka squeaked powers above why didnt you say so she rushed out of the dining hall past the crystallomancer not bothering to wait for her the woman hurried after her stammering apologies pekka ignored those but dashed into the room where the crystals were kept sure enough prince juhainens image waited in one of them she went down to a knee for a moment before asking how may i serve you your highness along with two of my colleagues i propose visiting your establishment soon the young prince answered we have spent a good deal of money over in naantali and we want to discover what we are getting for it i see pekka said it shall be as you say of course for which i thank you juhainen said we expect to be there day after tomorrow and hope to see something interesting very well your highness thank you for letting me know you are coming pekka said we shall try our best to show you what weve been doing and if you like we can also discuss where we hope to go from here juhainen smiled good you have taken the words out of my mouth i look forward to seeing you in two days time then he nodded to someone whose image pekka couldnt see probably his own crystallomancer a moment later his image vanished a princely visit the crystallomancer at naantali exclaimed how exciting a princely visit pekka echoed how appalling performing under the eyes of siuntio and ilmarinen had been intimidating in one way if she blundered she would humiliate herself in front of the mages she admired most she didnt admire juhainen and his fellow princes nearly so much as she did her peers but performing in front of them would be intimidating too if they didnt like what they saw they could end the project with a snap of the fingers the power of the purse wasnt sorcerous but was potent nonetheless she hurried out of the chamber with the crystals and started telling every mage she knew her colleagues reacted with the same mixture of surprise anticipation and dread that she felt when ilmarinen said with any luck at all once they see what were up to we can all go home pekka laughed too ilmarinen sardonic was far preferable to ilmarinen whining and nagging fernao asked a truly relevant question can they get here by day after tomorrow with this hostel out in the middle of nowhere i do not know pekka admitted but we are going to assume they can if we are ready and they are not here that is one thing if they are here and we are not ready that is something else again something i do not intend to let happen they readied the animals they would use in the experiment the secondary sorcerers practiced their projection spells all the theoretical sorcerers but pekka prepared more counterspells in case something went wrong with her incantation she went over the charm again and again i will not drop a line this time she thought fiercely by the powers above i will not the princes did arrive on the appointed day though late they brought with them a fresh squad of protective mages that to pekka made excellent sense the algarvians hadnt struck here since their first heavy blow but there was no guarantee that they wouldnt with juhainen came parainen of kihlanki in the far east and renavall in whose domain the district of naantali lay pekka went to one knee before each of them she said by your leave your highnesses we shall demonstrate our work tomorrow for tonight you are welcome to share our hostel here and see how we live prince renavall chuckled and remarked this is probably an effort to extort finer quarters from us pekka and the other mages laughed so did juhainen prince parainen only nodded as if his colleague had said what he was already thinking ilmarinen said if we can survive here for months on end even princes are a good bet to last the night in a lot of kingdoms such a crack would have made him a good bet not to last the night in easygoing kuusamo juhainen and renavall laughed again even parainen who worried more about gyongyos than the algarvian threat against which the mages were so concerned managed a smile sure enough all three princes came down to breakfast the next morning and accompanied the team of sorcerers to the blockhouse they and their protective mages badly crowded it and they suffered most because of that since pekka insisted on stationing them against the walls where they wouldnt be in the way you came to see the sorcery succeed is that not so your highnesses she said with her sweetest smile and so you could not possibly want to interfere with those who perform it could you juhainen shrugged renavall smiled parainen gave back only stony silence we had better succeed now pekka thought she recited the kuusaman ritual that marked the beginning of any sorcerous enterprise in her land as always it helped steady her i begin she said abruptly and did for a demonstration for three of the seven they broke no new ground she used a spell they had tested before and gave it every ounce of concentration she had the rumbling roar of suddenly released energies shook the blockhouse stones and clods of dirt thudded down on the roof even though the secondary sorcerers had transferred the effect of the spell to the animal cages a couple of miles away may we see what you wrought parainen asked when silence and steadiness returned glad he was the one whod asked and even gladder he sounded less sure of himself now pekka said by all means ilmarinen caught her eye she shook her head this was not the time or place for him to expound on his hypothesis of what they were really doing to her relief he subsided to her even greater relief the princes gaped in undisguised wonder at the new crater gouged from the soil of naantali parainen said the two words pekka most wanted to hear from him carry on numbers had always been ealstans friends he was after all a bookkeepers son and now a bookkeeper of growing experience himself he saw patterns in what looked like chaos to most people as mages did when they developed spells and when he found chaos in what should have been order he wanted to root it out pybbas books drove him mad money kept right on leaking out of the pottery magnates business ealstan was morally certain it went to resist the algarvians but pybba had paid him a hefty sum not to notice vanai didnt want him poking his nose into things either and so when he probed the mystery he had to be most discreet he told neither his boss nor his wife what he was doing he just quietly kept doing it my father would act the same way he thought hed want to get to the bottom of things even if somebody told him not to maybe especially if somebody told him not to more of the money vanished in the invoices at one of pybbas warehouses than from any other place in the magnates business ealstan had never been to that warehouse which lay on the outskirts of eoforwic he thought about asking pybba if he might go look things over there thought about it and shook his head his boss would see right through him if he did when he went to look the place over then he went on his day off he wore a grimy old tunic and a battered straw hat against the sun as he headed out the door vanai said you look like youre ready for a day of tavern crawling he nodded thats right im going to come home drunk and beat you the way forthwegian husbands do even in sorcerous disguise as a swarthy forthwegian vanai blushed kaunians often perceived forthwegians as drunks in modern kaunian literature in forthweg the drunken forthwegian was as much a clichй as the sly or aloof kaunian was in forthwegian romances vanai said youre the only forthwegian husband i know and i like the things you do thats good a wide foolish grin spread over ealstans face he couldnt get enough praise from his wife im off he said and headed out the door to get to that warehouse he could either walk for an hour or ride most of the way on a leyline caravan without hesitation he chose the caravan he tossed a small silver bit into the fare box everything was outrageously expensive under the algarvians and took his seat because the fare was high the caravan wasnt close to full as best he could tell the car hadnt been cleaned since the algarvians took eoforwic or maybe since the unkerlanters took it a year and a half before that someone had slit the upholstery of the seat on which ealstan sat someone else had pulled out most of the stuffing what was left protruded from the gashes in the fabric in pathetic tufts the seat next to ealstans had no padding at all and no upholstery left either none of the windows in the car would open but several had no glass so that evened out getting out of the car was something of a relief at least till ealstan saw what sort of neighborhood it was he marveled that pybba would put a warehouse here it seemed the sort of place where breaking crockery was the favorite local sport no matter how shabby ealstan looked he had the feeling hed overdressed a drunk came up and whined for money ealstan walked past as if the beggar didnt exist a technique hed had to perfect since coming to eoforwic the drunk cursed him but only halfheartedly a lot of people must have walked past him over the last few years down an alley a dog barked and then snarled a sound like ripping canvas ealstan bent down and grabbed a stout olive branch to his relief the dog didnt come out after him he held on to the branch anyhow and methodically pulled twigs from it it was better than nothing against beasts with four or two legs he had no trouble finding the warehouse pybbas pottery shouted a tall sign with red letters on a yellow ground pybba never did anything by halves which was part of what made him so successful people all over western forthweg knew who he was his pots and cups and basins and plates might not have been better than anyone elses but they were better known that counted for at least as much as quality now that ealstan had got here he wondered what the demon to do next how in blazes could he hope to find out why the money from pybbas booming business looked to be leaking here he doubted the clerks would say if they even knew maybe he should have gone out and got drunk instead he would have had more fun even if beating his wife wasnt part of it he could hardly have had less as he walked up to the warehouse entrance he was surprised to see a couple of guards there he shouldnt have been he remembered the line item for their salary but a line item was one thing a couple of burly men carrying bludgeons was something else again ealstan made a point of setting down his olive branch before he got close to them hello friend one of them said with a polite nod and a smile that didnt quite reach his eyes what can we do for you today want to buy some dishes ealstan answered my wife keeps throwing em at me and were running out the guards relaxed and laughed the one whod spoken before said this is the place all right i used to hang around with a woman like that aye she was good in bed but after a while she got to be more trouble than she was worth you know what i mean ealstan nodded i hear what youre saying but you know how it is his shrug suggested a man who was putting up with a lot for the sake of a woman laughing again the guards stepped aside to let him into the warehouse after the bright sunshine outside ealstans eyes needed a moment to adjust to the gloom within when they did he gaped at aisle on aisle of crockery every one with a sign that said sale or marked down or pybbas low prices as best ealstan could tell his boss didnt miss a trick he couldnt stand there gaping very long a woman said get out of the way and pushed past him before he could she made a beeline for a display of cups and saucers with a mustardyellow glaze ealstan thought them very ugly but pybba was going to rack up a sale no matter what he thought ealstan ambled up one aisle and down the next making as if to examine more different kinds of pottery than hed ever seen under one roof nothing he spotted on the floor of the main room gave him the slightest hint about where pybbas money was going he hadnt really thought anything would anything obvious to him would be obvious to other people too to the algarvians if pybba really was trying to fight them several doors led into back rooms ealstan eyed those as he pretended to examine dishes going through one of them might tell him what he wanted to know it also might land him in more trouble than he could afford whatever he did he wouldnt get the chance to go through more than one he was sure of that which one then from this side they all looked alike he chose the one in the middle of the back wall for not better reason than its being in the middle after fidgeting in front of it for a minute or two he opened it and walked into the back room a man sitting at a desk looked up at him ealstan scowled and said that fellow out there said this was where the jakes were at well they bloody well arent the man replied in some annoyance you dont have to bite my head off ealstan said and closed the door behind him he chose four dinner plates in a flowered pattern paid for them and left the guards nodded to him as he went he walked away from the leyline caravan stop not toward it once he was around the corner from the warehouse he doubled back and found his way to the stop to his relief a caravan car glided up a few minutes after he got to that corner he put another small silver coin in the fare box and sat down for the ride back to the heart of eoforwic the plates rattled against one another in his lap a man sitting across the aisle pointed to them and said powers below eat me if you didnt get those at pybbas best prices in town ealstan answered one of the many slogans pybba used to promote himself and his business thats the truth the other passenger said ive bought plenty from him myself who hasnt ealstan said nobody gave him any trouble the rest of the way home though a couple more people asked if hed got his plates from pybba by the time he got off at the stop closest to his flat hed started to think his boss could have occupied all of forthweg if the algarvians hadnt beaten him to it vanai wasnt deceived when he brought the plates home she asked did you learn anything while you were snooping around well no ealstan admitted but i didnt know i wouldnt before i started out he was ready to do a more thorough job of defending himself than that but vanai only sighed and dropped the subject that left him feeling bloated he had what he thought a pretty good argument trapped inside him but it couldnt get out as he went off to cast accounts for pybba the next morning he decided that argument could stay right where it was it would have done him no good had he had to use it to sweeten his boss pybba was not a man arguments could sweeten the only arguments he listened to were his own about time you got here he shouted when ealstan walked into his office ealstan wasnt late he was if anything early but pybba was there before him pybba was there before everybody he had a wife and family but ealstan wondered if they ever saw him that though was pybbas worry ealstan settled down and got to work before long pybba started shouting at somebody else he had to shout at someone the louder he yelled the more certain he seemed that he was alive halfway through the day somebody said oh hello to ealstan he looked up from endless columns of numbers and saw the man whod been behind the desk in that back room at the potter warehouse the fellow went on i didnt know you worked for pybba too pybba overheard despite the racket he always made he overheard a lot pointing to ealstan he asked the other man you know him i dont really know him no the man replied saw him at the warehouse yesterday though he was looking for the jakes was he pybba rumbled he shook his head in what looked like real regret then jerked his thumb from ealstan toward the door the gesture was unmistakable but he added two words anyhow youre fired fourteen skarnu had no trouble ambling along a road in southern valmiera as a peasant would have done he didnt look to be in much of a hurry but mile after mile disappeared behind him that wasnt so bad he wished even more though that amatu would disappear behind him no such luck there the noble whod come back from lagoan exile stuck like a burr and was just about as irritating not only that skarnu feared that amatu would get both of them caught by the algarvians or by the valmieran constables who did their bidding amatu couldnt walk like a peasant not literally to save his life the concept of ambling seemed alien to him he marched and if he didnt march he strutted he might almost have been an algarvian himself as far as swagger went maybe we ought to put some pebbles in your shoes skarnu said in something close to despair amatu looked down his nose at him not easy when skarnu stood several inches taller maybe you ought to let me be what i am and not carp so much about it he replied his voice dripping aristocratic hauteur he risked giving himself away every time he opened his mouth too skarnu had trouble putting on a rustic accent but by not saying much and by speaking in understatements when he did talk he got by amatu on the other hand always overacted he might have been the foolish foppish noble in a bad play back before the war skarnu hadnt thought such people really existed he supposed amatu had acted the same way then powers above hed probably acted the same way himself but it hadnt mattered in those days not among the aristocracy of priekule now it did skarnu had adapted as far as amatu was concerned adapting meant betraying his class being what you are is one thing skarnu said getting me caught because you wont see reason is something else again you havent got caught yet have you amatu said no thanks to you skarnu retorted you keep trying to stick your neck and mine in the noose you keep saying that amatu answered if theres so bloody much truth to it how come im still running around loose when the algarvians grabbed everybody in the underground in ventspils everybody who knew just what he was doing how come ill tell you how come skarnu said savagely because you were with me when we came back to our building thats how come if you hadnt been you would have strolled right up to the flat where we were staying and right into the redheads arms too or had you forgotten that your excellency he used amatus title of respect with as much scorn as an angry commoner might have and he succeeded in angering the returned exile too id have done fine without you amatu snarled for that matter i can still do fine without you if you want me to go off on my own im ready im more than ready part of skarnu a large selfish part of skarnu wanted nothing more but the rest made him answer you wouldnt last an hour on your own and when the algarvians nailed you and they would theyd squeeze out everything you knew and then theyd come after me youre not my mother amatu said im telling you they wouldnt catch me and im telling you skarnu broke off two algarvians on unicorns came around a bend in the road a couple hundred yards ahead skarnu lowered his voice im telling you to walk soft now by the powers above if you want to keep breathing he wondered if amatu would have the least idea what he was talking about but the returned exile had spotted mezentios men too amatu hunched his shoulders forward and pulled his head down that didnt make him walk like a peasant it made him walk like somebody who hated algarvians and was trying not to show it and sure as sunrise following morning twilight it made the redheads notice him they reined in as they came up to the two valmierans walking along the road both of them had their hands on their sticks one spoke to amatu in pretty good valmieran whats chewing on you pal before amatu could speak skarnu did it for him we just came from a cockfight he said my cousin here lost more silver than hes got he sadly shook his head at amatu i told you that bird wasnt good for anything but chicken stew would you listen not likely amatu glared at him but then given what hed said amatu had plausible reason to glare at him the algarvian who spoke valmieran translated for his companion who evidently didnt they both laughed skarnu laughed too as he would have at the folly of a silly cousin the redhead who knew valmieran said never bet on cockfights you cant tell what a cock will do any more than you can with a woman he laughed again on a different note i know what i want my cock to do he tried to translate that into algarvian too but the pun must not have worked in his own language because his pal looked blank skarnu managed a laugh too to show he appreciated the troopers wit then he asked can we go on now sir aye go but keep your cocks out of mischief like a lot of people the algarvian ran what had been a good joke into the ground he laughed again louder than ever skarnu smiled amatu kept on looking mutinous the algarvian cavalrymen dug their knees into their mounts barrels and flicked the reins the unicorns trotted on down the road cocks amatu snarled when the redheads were out of earshot i ought to put a curse on theirs go ahead and try if you want to waste your time skarnu answered youre no trained mage and theyre warded against all the little nuisance spells same as we were you want to kill a soldier you have to blaze him or cut him that wasnt strictly true sacrifice enough men and women kaunians from forthweg say or unkerlanter peasants and you could power a spell that would kill plenty of soldiers skarnu knew as much he preferred not to think about it amatus mind traveled along a different ley line one that ran straight toward the sewers the way you talked to those fornicating whoresons anybody would think you wanted to suck their skarnu knocked him down when amatu surged to his feet murder blazed in his eyes he rushed at skarnu fists flailing he had courage skarnu had never doubted that but as a dragonflier amatu had never learned to fight in the hard and ruthless school of ground combat skarnu didnt waste time on fisticuffs he kicked amatu in the belly instead oof amatu folded up like a concertina skarnu did hit him then with an uppercut that straightened him again amatu had grit he didnt go down even after that but he was in no condition to fight anymore as he stood swaying skarnu hit him once more a blow he could measure carefully now amatu crumpled he tried to get up again skarnu kicked him in the ribs not quite hard enough to break them so he gauged it anyhow if he was wrong he wouldnt lose any sleep over it amatu still tried to get up skarnu kicked him yet again rather harder this time amatu groaned and flattened out skarnu kicked him once more for good measure and got another groan then he bent down and took away amatus knife were through he said evenly im going my way you find yours if you come after me from now on ill kill you have you got that by way of reply amatu tried to hook an arm around skarnus ankle and bring him down skarnu stamped on his hand amatu howled like a wolf when the howl turned into words he cursed skarnu as vilely as he could save it for the algarvians skarnu told him you came back across the strait to fight them remember all youve done since you got here was make trouble for everybody else whos fighting them now youre on your own do whatever you bloody well please amatu answered with a fresh flurry of obscenities he aimed more of them at krasta than at skarnu maybe he thought that would make skarnu angrier if he did he was wrong in skarnus mind hed been calling his sister worse things than any amatu came up with ever since he found out she was sleeping with an algarvian im leaving you your silver skarnu said when amatu finally flagged as far as im concerned you can buy a rope and hang yourself with it its the best thing you could do for the kingdom he walked away from amatu even as the returned exile reviled him again however much amatu cursed though he didnt get up and come after skarnu maybe he was too battered maybe he believed skarnus warning if he did he was wise for skarnu meant every word of it when skarnu went round the bend in the road from which the algarvian cavalrymen had come he looked back over his shoulder one last time amatu was on his feet by then but going in the opposite direction the direction the men on unicornback had taken skarnu nodded in somber satisfaction with any luck at all he would never see amatu again he also tried to make sure luck wouldnt be the only factor involved whenever he came to a crossroads he went right or left or straight ahead at random by the time evening approached he was confident amatu would have no idea where he was for that matter he had no sure idea where he was himself a couple of big roughcoated dogs ran out from a farmhouse and barked at him his hand went to one of the knives on his belt he didnt like farm dogs which would often try to bite strangers here though they subsided when the farmer came after them and shouted down thanks friend skarnu said from the roadway he glanced at the sun no he couldnt go much farther before darkness overtook him he turned back to the farmer will you let me chop wood or do some other chores for supper and a night in your barn he hadnt intended to end up here nor anywhere very close to here the farmer hesitated skarnu did his best to look innocent and appealing a lot of people didnt trust anyone these days if the fellow said no hed have to lie up under a tree or wherever else he could find makeshift shelter but the farmer pointed theres the woodpile theres the axe lets see what you can do while the light lasts he didnt promise anything clever or just tightfisted skarnu wondered aloud he said fair enough and got to work by the time the sun went down hed turned a lot of lumber into firewood not bad the farmer allowed youve done it before id wager he brought skarnu bread and sausage and plums and a mug of what was obviously homebrewed ale then said you can stay in the barn tonight too thanks skarnu chopped more wood in the morning and the farmer fed him again never once though did skarnu set eyes on the mans wife and whatever children he had that saddened him but left him unsurprised things worked so these days he grimaced over by pavilosta not so far away he had a child himself or would soon he wondered if hed ever get to see it setubal the conductor shouted as the leyline caravan slid into the depot at the heart of lagoas capital all out for setubal folks this is the end of the line to fernao newly arrived in the great city after months in the wilds of southeastern kuusamo that was true in more ways than one hed been staring out the window in astonished wonder ever since the caravan began gliding through the outskirts of setubal were there really so many people so many buildings in the whole world let alone in one city it seemed incredible leaning on his cane and carrying a carpetbag in his other hand he made his way out of the caravan car he knew no little pride in managing so well his bad leg would never be what it had been before he was injured down in the austral continent but he could use it aye he limped he would always limp but he could get around noise smote him like a bursting egg when he got down on the platform powers above he muttered had setubal always been like this it probably had no it surely had hed lost his immunity to the racket by going away he wondered how and how fast he could get it back soon he hoped through the din he heard someone calling his name his head turned this way and that as he tried to spot the man he looked for someone waving but half more than half the people on the platform were waving and then he did spy brinco the secretary to the lagoan guild of mages they fought their way toward each other through the crowd and clasped each others wrists in the traditional style of all algarvic peoples when they finally came facetoface good to see you moving so well brinco said a grin stretched across his plump face more often then not fernao knew the jolly fat man was a myth in brinco the clichй lived good to be moving so well believe me fernao told him let me take your bag brinco said and did let me clear a path you follow along behind a cab is waiting well get you to the guild hall and and grandmaster pinhiero will grill me like a bloater fernao said brinco laughed at that but didnt deny it the secretary shouldered a man out of the way fernao was perfectly content to follow him he got the feeling brinco could have cleared a path through the icebergs that swelled from the shores of the austral continent every winter absently he asked do you know the name habakkuk aye brinco answered over his shoulder i also know you shouldnt and that you shouldnt throw it around where others might hear it since i do know of it will you tell me more not here not now brinco said later perhaps should the grandmaster judge that wise a skinny little fellow caromed off his chest im so sorry he told the man his voice oozing false sympathy when fernao tried to bring up habakkuk again brinco didnt seem to hear him his deafness was patently false too but fernao couldnt do anything about it the cab had a closed body but fernao gritted his teeth at the racket that came through he peered out the windows every so often he noticed missing buildings or a couple of times blocks of buildings that had been standing when he left for the wilds of the naantali district i see the algarvians still keep paying us calls he remarked aye every now and again brinco agreed not so much lately theyve sent a lot of the dragons they did have up in valmiera west to fight the unkerlanters he was some years older than fernao but his grin made him look like a boy by all accounts the dragons arent helping them much there too bad fernao said it is a pity isnt it brinco said grinning still but the grin slipped by what i hear we were lucky they didnt get the chance to serve us as they served yliharma not just yliharma fernao said grimly they used that cursed magecraft against us too you know thats why we havent got siuntio working with us anymore if it hadnt been for him i wouldnt be here talking to you now none of the mages over there would be here talking to anybody now how did he how did the lot of you withstand that vicious spell even in so far as you did brinco asked siuntio and ilmarinen rallied us fernao answered siuntio seemed to carry the whole world on his shoulders for just long enough to give the rest of us a chance i dont know another mage who could have done it brinco grunted and gave him a sidelong look for a moment fernao had trouble understanding why then he realized how hed miffed the guild secretary siuntio of course wasnt a lagoan fernao shrugged for a long time now hed been the only lagoan working on the largely kuusaman project they hadnt sneered at his blood and he didnt care to sneer at theirs here yare gents the hackman reining in in front of the great neoclassical hall that housed the lagoan guild of mages still looking unhappy brinco paid the fare fernao had wondered if hed be stuck with it but brinco carried his carpetbag up the white marble steps to the colonnaded entranceway and seemed in good spirits as he led fernao back toward grandmaster pinhieros office the trip took longer than it might have fernao kept greeting and getting greetings from colleagues he knew once past greetings though conversations flagged fernao wasnt the only one who said i wish i could tell you what im working on these days hed heard half a dozen variations on the theme by the time brinco ushered him in to see pinhiero welcome home the grandmaster said rising and coming out from behind his desk to clasp fernaos wrist pinhiero was in his sixties his oncered hair and mustache mostly gray now he wasnt a great mage his name would never go into the reference books as siuntios already had but he had gifts of his own not least among them political astuteness after he poured wine for fernao and helped him ease down into a chair he asked well is it what we thought it was no fernao answered which made pinhiero blink fernao sipped the wine enjoying the grandmasters discomfiture then he said its more or it can be more if we ever learn to control it pinhiero leaned forward as a falcon might on catching sight of a mouse i thought so he breathed if it were less they would have said more he blazed out a question as if it were the beam from a stick will it match mezentios foul magics in force aye fernao said again though the question is control that will take time i dont know how long but it wont happen tomorrow or the day after tomorrow either and meanwhile of course the war grinds on pinhiero said sooner or later lagoas and kuusamo will be fighting on the mainland of derlavai will these spells be ready when that day comes grandmaster i havent the faintest idea fernao answered for one thing i dont know when that day will come maybe you know more about that than i do i hope so you could hardly know less i know what i know pinhiero said if you dont know i daresay there are reasons why you dont arrogant old thornbush fernao thought but hed already known that aloud he said no doubt youre right sir the other trouble of course is that no one has any sure knowledge of when the cantrips will be ready to use in war and not as an exercise in theoretical sorcery you had better hurry up the grandmaster warned as if it were fernaos fault and no one elses that the project wasnt advancing fast enough to suit him while you play with your acorns and rats and rabbits the world around you moves on aye and at an ever faster clip too fernao did his best to look wise and innocent at the same time thats what habakkuk is all about eh one of the things pinhiero said and then too late and how do you happen to know of habakkuk i would have trouble telling you that sir fernao answered more innocently than ever the world has moved on so fast since i heard about it that ive forgotten pinhieros green eyes flashed he wasnt used to being on the receiving end of sarcasm and didnt seem to like it much his lips drew back from his teeth in what was as much snarl as smile you would have done better to forget the thing itself but i dont suppose we could expect that of you not likely fernao agreed will habakkuk be ready when we need to go back to the mainland oh sooner than that pinhiero said or it had better be if not some fancy sorcerous talent will find itself shorter by a head he hadnt told fernao anything about what habakkuk actually was merely that it was important which the mage already knew and now he continued whether it is or it isnt though its got nothing to do with you this project you are working on is rather different wouldnt you say you do have some idea of what youre doing there youd bloody well better i think i may fernao said tightly good the grandmaster told him heres what well do well put you up in a room in the guild hall here with a cot and everything mind and you can draft a report for us let us know what the kuusamans are doing and how theyre doing it start at the beginning and dont leave anything out that isnt why i came back to setubal fernao said in something approaching horror its not the only reason i came back anyhow grandmaster pinhiero was implacable your kingdom needs you it came close to a kidnapping pinhiero didnt actually have four burly mages drag fernao off to the room but he made it plain that he would unless fernao went there on his own when fernao stuck his head out a little later he discovered one of those burly mages standing in the hallway he nodded to the fellow and withdrew again he couldnt sneak away then and he couldnt very well magic his way free either not with so much of the sorcerous talent in the world right here master ilmarinen might have tried and being master ilmarinen might have succeeded fernao knew his own talents werent up to such sorcery having no other choice he settled down and wrote as long as he was doing what pinhiero wanted the grandmaster took care of him whatever he wanted in the way of food and drink came up from the kitchens in the blink of an eye mages fetched sorcerous tomes from the guildhall library whenever he needed to check a point if he felt like soaking for an hour in a tub full of steaming water he could and once even though he hadnt made any such request a very friendly young woman visited the room she shook her head when he tried to give her something its all arranged she said the grandmaster told me hed turn me into a vole if i took even a copper from you by the melodramatic way she shivered as she put her kilt back on she believed pinhiero would do just as hed said pinhiero would never waste an important natural resource like that fernao said which made the girl smile as she left fernao went to sleep that night with a smile on his face too but in the morning after breakfast he had to go back to writing he started to look forward to returning to the naantali district he hadnt had to work nearly so hard there sooner or later talsu knew he would run into kugu the silversmith again skrunda wasnt a big city where they might easily have avoided each other and sure enough one day in the market square talsu came facetoface with the man whod betrayed him to the algarvians talsu was haggling with a farmer selling salted olives and paid little attention to the man buying raisins at the next stall till the fellow turned around he and kugu recognized each other at the same instant kugu might have been a treacherous whoreson and an algarvian puppet but he had his share of nerve and more good morning he said to talsu as coolly as if he hadnt had him flung into a dungeon its good to see you here again its good to be here again talsu answered all the while thinking i cant wring his neck here in the middle of the market square people would talk he couldnt even glare so fiercely as he wanted to if he roused kugus suspicions the algarvians would seize him again im glad youve seen the light of day in the metaphorical as well as the literal sense of the words kugu said before studying classical kaunian with kugu talsu would have had no idea what a metaphor was but hed learned more than metaphors from the small precise silversmith he just nodded now if kugu wanted to think him a traitor to jelgava too well so what a lot of people thought that what difference could one more make kugu nodded too as if hed passed a test maybe he had the silversmith said one of these days well have to have a talk id like that talsu said id like to learn some more of the old language too would you kugu said well perhaps it can be arranged but now if you will excuse me he went back to looking at raisins i know what hell want hell want me to help him trap other people who dont think jelgava ought to have an algarvian king talsu wondered how many of the people whod been studying classical kaunian with kugu remained outside of algarvian dungeons some still would he was sure of that if people kugu taught started disappearing every week or so the ones who remained at large wouldnt take long to realize what was going wrong you going to buy those olives pal or are you just going to gawk at them asked the farmer by whose cart talsu stood talsu did end up buying the olives running into kugu left him too distracted to haggle as hard as he should have the farmer didnt bother hiding a selfsatisfied smirk as talsu gave him silver when talsus wife and mother found out what hed paid they would have something sharp to say to him he was mournfully certain of that and he proved right in short order too laitsina said do you think your father mints the coins himself no he wouldnt put mainardos face on them talsu answered giving his mother a better comeback than hed had for the farmer you could have got a better price than that at my fathers shop gailisa said reproachfully after she came back from working there i have an excuse anyhow talsu said his wife raised an eyebrow by her expression no excuse for spending too much on food could possibly be good enough but then talsu explained i ran into kugu in the market square oh gailisa said a moment later she repeated the word in an altogether different tone of voice oh kugu wouldnt have wanted to hear the way it sounded the second time gailisa went on did you leave him dead and bleeding there regretfully talsu shook his head i had to be polite if id done what i wanted to do id be back in the dungeons now not here i suppose so his wife sighed i wish you could have im surprised he didnt try to talk you into trapping people along with him he must think youre safe as a matter of fact he did drop a hint or two talsu said at that gailisa let out such a furious squawk everyone else hurried up to find out what was wrong talsu had to explain all over again which led to more furious squawks traku said dont go back and study the old language with him again dont have anything to do with him if you can help it i would like to learn more classical kaunian talsu said if the redheads think its worth knowing and they do we ought to know it too fair enough his father nodded but dont study with that son of a whore of a silversmith find somebody else who knows it or find yourself a book and learn from that i was thinking that if i got close to him talsus voice trailed away no no no and no traku said if you hang around him and something happens to him what will the algarvians do blame you thats what thats not what you want is it it had better not be ah talsu murmured his father made an uncomfortable amount of sense he did want something to happen to kugu and he didnt want mezentios men to pin it on him but after a little thought he said i may not have as much choice as id like if i act like i cant stand the bugger thats liable to be enough to get him to give me to the algarvians all over again gailisa spoke up just tell him youre too busy working to go out of nights he wont be able to say a word about that the way the algarvians squeeze us these days everybody has to run as fast as he can to stay in one place thats not bad talsu said its not even a lie either maybe you wont see him at all his mother said ill send ausra to the market instead of you for a while and i dont suppose master kugu would have the crust to stick his nose through this door after the trouble he caused you the trouble he caused every one of us ausra stuck out her tongue at talsu see now im going to have to do your work she said youd better find a way to make that up to me i will he said which looked to astonish his sister in fact he only half heard her he was thinking about ways to make things up to kugu ways to make something dreadful happen to the silversmith without drawing suspicion to himself gailisa must have seen as much that night while they lay crowded together in their narrow bed she said dont do anything foolish i wont talsu hugged her to him the only really foolish thing i ever did was trust him in the first place i wont make that mistake again any time soon the next morning his father remarked you dont want to do anything right away you know who says i dont want to talsu answered they sat side by side in the tailors shop working on heavy wool quilts for a couple of algarvians who would be going from warm sunny jelgava to unkerlant a land that was anything but traku looked at him in some alarm he went on i wont because it would give me away but that doesnt say anything about what i want to do all right traku said and then a moment later no curse it it isnt all right look what you made me do you frightened me so there my finishing spell went all awry the pleat hed sewn by hand was perfectly straight the spell should have made all the others match it instead they twisted every which way as jagged as the skyline of the bratanu mountains on the border between jelgava and algarve im sorry talsu said sorry sorry doesnt cut any cloth i ought to box your ears traku grumbled now im going to have to remember that spell of undoing powers above i hope i can i havent had to use it in a while i ought to make you rip all these seams out by hand is what i ought to do still fuming talsus father muttered to himself trying to make sure he had the words to the spell of undoing right talsu would have offered to help but wasnt sure he could no good tailor needed the spell of undoing very often when traku did begin his new chant talsu listened intently no he hadnt had all the words straight he would now though after calling out the last command traku grunted in relief there thats taken care of anyhow no thanks to you either he glared at talsu now i get to do the finishing spell over again youre going to cost me an hours work with your foolishness i hope youre happy happy no but talsu glanced over to his father dyou suppose we could build the spell of undoing into some of the clothes we make for the redheads so their tunics and kilts would fall to pieces say six months after they got to unkerlant we could maybe but i wouldnt traku shook his head you dont shit where you eat and we eat with the clothes we make talsu sighed all right that makes sense i wish it didnt we have to be able to do something about the algarvians doing something about our own people who suck up to them would be even better traku said algarvians cant help being algarvians any more than vultures can help being vultures but when people in your own town people youve known for years suck up to mezentios men thats cursed hard to take with a nod talsu went back to the kilt he was working on thinking about the jelgavans who sucked up to the redheads inevitably brought him back to thinking about kugu his hands folded into fists he wanted to ruin the silversmith more he wanted to humiliate him but he wanted to do it in a way that wouldnt put him back inside a dungeon an hour later he came up with nothing that suited him then nor in the couple of days that followed he was walking home from taking a cloak to a customer an actual jelgavan customer not one of the occupiers when he ran into kugu on the street as they had in the market square they eyed each other warily kugu said i gave my lessons last night i wondered if you would come by when you didnt i missed you my wife and family took things the wrong way talsu answered they dont understand how things are in the bigger world so im having to be quiet about my change of heart if you know what i mean i dont want to stir anybody up and so i think id be smarter to stay home for a while kugu nodded swallowing the lie as smoothly as if it were truth aye that can prove troublesome he agreed perhaps you could arrange to have something happen to one of them perhaps i could arrange to have something happen to you you son of a whore talsu thought but all he said was people would wonder about it you know well so they would the silversmith admitted and that kind of gossip would make you less useful well think of something sooner or later im sure useful am i went through talsus mind well see about that by the powers above he smiled at kugu so we will vanai hated it when ealstan was gloomy she did her best to cheer him up saying youre bound to find more work soon am i he sounded anything but cheered pybba wasnt joking curse him after he gave me the sack he slandered me to everybody he knew finding anybody wholl trust me not to steal hasnt been easy powers below eat pybba vanai said in lieu of saying something like why didnt you keep your nose out of his business when he told you to the good sense in a question like that was plain to see but it didnt help her now shed said the same thing before and ealstan hadnt wanted to listen the powers below will eat us if i dont start bringing in more money again his voice was raw with worry were all right for a while yet vanai said which was true we got ahead of the game when you did so well there for a while and i spent a lot of time being poor i know how not to spend very much her husband drained his breakfast cup of wine he made a face vanai understood that it was about as cheap as it could be while staying this side of vinegar shed already started economizing with a sigh he said ill go out and see what i can scrape up ill give it another few days after that if nobody wants me to cast books for him anymore he shrugged my brother spent the last couple of years of his life building roads theres always work for somebody with a strong back he got up gave vanai a quick kiss and went out the door as she washed bowls and mugs she remembered her grandfather after major spinello set him to work building roads outside oyngestun a few days of that had almost killed brivibas a few weeks of it surely would have and so shed started giving herself to spinello to save brivibas from the road crew because of all that the notion of ealstan building roads filled her with irrational dread at least i know its irrational she thought small consolation but consolation nonetheless ealstan was young and strong not an aging scholar and he was forthwegian not kaunian an overseer wouldnt be tempted to work him to death for the sport of it she looked in the pantry and sighed she hadnt wanted to go shopping today but she couldnt very well cook without olive oil and only a little was left in the bottom of the jar a yawn followed the sigh more than a little ruefully she looked down at her belly the baby didnt show yet but it did still leave her tired all the time before she left the flat she renewed the spell that kept her looking like a forthwegian she wished shed done that while ealstan was still there aye the spell had become second nature to her but she liked to be reassured that shed done it right if she ever did make a mistake she wouldnt know till too late silver clinked sweetly as vanai put coins in her handbag she nodded to herself shed told ealstan the truth money wasnt a worry yet and wouldnt be for a while she still found the handbag a minor annoyance trouser pockets were more convenient for carrying things but forthwegian women didnt wear trousers if she wanted to look like a forthwegian she had to dress like one too shed just lifted the bar from the door when someone knocked on it she jerked back in surprise and alarm she hadnt expected visitors she never expected visitors visitors meant trouble who is it she asked hating the quaver in her voice but unable to hold it out mistress thelberge a mans voice deep and gruff unquestionably forthwegian no algarvian trill aye cautiously vanai opened the door the fellow standing in the hallway was a vigorous fifty with shoulders like a bulls shed never seen him before who are you what do you want he drew himself up straight pybbas the name he rumbled now where in blazes is your husband he spoke as if vanai might have had ealstan in her handbag hes not here she said coldly hes out looking for work thanks to you hell probably have a hard time finding any what more do you want to do to him i want to talk to him thats what the pottery magnate answered vanai set a hand on the door as if to slam it in his face why should he want to talk to you pybba reached into his belt pouch he pulled out a coin and tossed it to her here thisll give him a reason he said as she caught it she stared at the coin in her hand it was gold vanai couldnt remember the last time shed seen a goldpiece let along held one silver circulated far more freely in forthweg than gold and brivibas back in oyngestun had not been the sort of man who attracted any of the few goldpieces the kingdom did mint i dont understand vanai said you just sacked ealstan why this she held up the gold coin it lay heavier in her hand than silver would have because ive learned some things i didnt know when i gave him the boot thats why pybba replied for instance hes got he had a brother named leofsig isnt that so vanai stood mute she didnt know where the pottery magnate was going with his questions or why he was asking them pybba seemed to take her silence for agreement for he went on and some son of a whore from plegmunds brigade killed his brother isnt that right he didnt know everything he didnt know that the fellow from plegmunds brigade whod killed leofsig was ealstans and poor leofsigs first cousin but he knew enough vanai asked whats this to you its worth gold to me to see him thats what it is you tell him so pybba said aye tell him just that and keep the money whether he decides he wants to see me or not hell be stubborn i know cursed well he will some ways he reminds me of the way i was back in my puppy days he laughed dont tell him that itll just put his back up so long sweetheart ive got work to do without another word he hurried toward the stairs vanai got the idea he always hurried she went through the rest of the day in a daze she didnt want to take the goldpiece with her when she went down to the market square to buy oil but she didnt want to leave it back in the flat either she knew that was foolish aye it was worth sixteen times its weight in silver but the flat already held a good deal more than sixteen times as much silver as there was gold in that one coin the nervousness persisted even so when she got back with the olive oil the first thing she did was make sure the gold coin was where shed left it then she had to wait for ealstan to come home the sun seemed to crawl across the sky it was sinking down behind the block of flats across the street when he finally used the familiar coded knock one glance at his face told vanai hed had no luck about time for me to start paving roads looks like he said glumly pour me some wine will you if i get drunk i wont have to think about what a mess im in instead of pouring wine vanai brought back the goldpiece and displayed it in the palm of her hand as ealstans eyes widened she said things may not be quite so bad where ealstan coughed he had to break off and try again speaking carefully he asked where did that come from from pybba vanai answered and her husbands eyes got wider still handing him the goldpiece she went on he wants to talk with you ealstan tossed the coin up into the air that means this is probably brass he said as he caught it vanai shook her head ealstan didnt push it he knew the heft of gold when he felt it too he scowled in bewilderment what does he want what can he want for me to come in so he can gloat i dont think so vanai said he knows about leofsig she explained what pybba had said finishing he said that whole business with your family was why he wanted to see you again i dont understand ealstan muttered as if he didnt want to admit that even to himself he gave the goldpiece back to vanai what do you think i ought to do he asked her youd better go see him she replied shed been thinking about that ever since pybba left i dont think you have any choice not after this before he could indignantly deny that and insist that he could do as he pleased she forestalled him by choosing that moment to get the wine after all leaving him by himself to think for a minute or two when she brought it back she asked can you tell me im wrong no he said darkly and gulped down half the cup at once but powers above how i wish i could let me get supper ready vanai chopped cabbage and onions and radishes and dried mushrooms adding crumbly white cheese and shaved bits of smoked pork for flavor she dressed the salad with spiced vinegar and some of the olive oil shed bought along with bread and more oil and some apricots it made a quick reasonably filling meal her own appetite was pretty good and everything looked like staying down she still had occasional days when she gave back as much as she ate but they were getting rarer ealstan seemed so distracted she might have set anything at all before him halfway through supper he burst out but how am i supposed to trust him after this vanai had no trouble figuring out who him was dont she answered do what business you have to or you think you should with him but that hasnt got anything to do with trust even if you go back to work for him hes just your boss hes not your father aye ealstan said as if that hadnt occurred to him maybe it hadnt hed looked for great things from pybba hed looked too hard for great things from pybba in fact maybe now he would see the pottery magnate as a man not a hero when they made love later that evening ealstan didnt show quite the desperate urgency hed had lately he seemed a little more able to relax and enjoy himself because he did vanai did too and she slept well afterwards of course she would have slept well afterwards even if she hadnt enjoyed herself making love carrying a child was the next best thing to getting hit with a brickbat for ensuring sound sleep in the morning after more bread and oil and a cup of wine ealstan said im off to see pybba wish me luck i always do vanai answered then she had nothing to do but wait shed done so much of that since coming to eoforwic she should have been good at it sometimes she even was but sometimes waiting came hard this was one of those days too many things could go very wrong or very right she had no control over any of them she hated that the longer she waited for ealstan the more worried she got waiting all the way into the early evening left her something close to a nervous wreck when at last he knocked she all but flew to the door she threw it open well she said well he answered grandly breathing wine fumes into her face well sweetheart i think were back in business back in business aye he savored the phrase and what a business it is too the summer before the fight in the forests of western unkerlant had been as grand as the attacking gyongyosians could make it theyd driven the goateating unkerlanters before them almost breaking through into the open country beyond the woods now now istvan counted himself lucky that the unkerlanters werent driving his own countrymen west in disorder king swemmels men seemed content to harass the gyongyosians without doing much more ill tell you what i think it is corporal kun said one evening of course you will istvan said youve always got answers you do whether you know the question or not here the questions simple kun said szonyi boomed laughter then its just right for you by the stars he hugged himself with glee proud of his own wit kun ignored him and went on talking to istvan remember how people were saying the unkerlanters would hit us hard if they got into trouble with algarve he waited for his sergeant to nod before going on since they havent hit us doesnt it follow that they didnt get into trouble against the algarvians istvan plucked at his beard that sounds like it ought to make sense but our allies have hammered unkerlant two summers in a row why shouldnt they be able to do it again if you hit a man but you dont knock him down and kick him till he quits pretty soon hes going to start hitting you too kun said thats what the algarvians did now were going to see how well they stand getting hit thats my guess anyhow before istvan could reply a sentry called a challenge halt who comes everybody in the redoubt grabbed for his stick i captain frigyes came the answer and the gyongyosian soldiers relaxed advance and be recognized the sentry said and then a moment later come ahead sir frigyes scrambled down into the redoubt nodding to istvan he asked all quiet in front of you sergeant aye sir istvan answered swemmels whoresons are sitting tight and so are we but you know about that i guess everything worth having is heading for the islands to fight the stinking kuusamans the company commander nodded his every motion was sharp abrupt so was the way he thought he was a good soldier but istvan often missed the more easygoing captain tivadar and he didnt want to think what would have happened had frigyes been the officer who discovered hed inadvertently eaten goat everything worth having is heading for the islands frigyes agreed that includes us we pull out of line here tomorrow after sundown the whole regiment no the whole brigade for a moment none of the soldiers in the redoubt spoke several of them stood there with their mouths hanging open istvan didnt realize he was one of those till he had to shut his before he could start talking where will we go sir and wholl take our places here frigyes broad shoulders moved up and down in a shrug well go where they send us and i dont know whos coming in to deal with swemmels goateaters i dont care theyre not my worry anymore somebody else will kill them thats all i need to know anybody here ever fight against the kuusamans istvan stuck up his hand so did kun and szonyi aye sir they chorused on obuda istvan added ill pick your brains as we head west then frigyes said i know the unkerlanters but those scrawny little slanteyes who follow the seven princes are a closed book to me he turned and went up the sandbag steps and out of the redoubt over his shoulder he added have to let the rest of the squads know then he was gone his footsteps were still receding when all the soldiers in istvans squad started talking at once he let them babble for a little while but only for a little while then he made a sharp chopping motion with his right hand enough he said the captain told us to be ready to move out tomorrow after sunset and thats what were going to do anybody who cant get ready by then he smiled his nastiest smile all teeth and flashing eyes well leave behind for the unkerlanters to eat theyre pulling the whole brigade out of the line kun said in wondering tones they cant be putting another brigade in thered be no point to that if they had another brigade to put in theyd have sent that one to the islands instead of us the unkerlanters are quiet szonyi said weve been talking about how quiet they are but how long will they stay quiet once were gone the youngster named lajos asked undoubtedly beating kun to the punch like the captain said thats not our worry anymore istvan said one way or another the generals will deal with it weve got to start thinking about the kuusamans he didnt care for that notion theyd come unpleasantly close to killing him a couple of times on obuda now theyd get more chances when istvan thought of the kuusamans he thought of going into action against them as soon as he left the redoubt reality proved more complex as reality had a way of doing along with the rest of the brigade istvans regiment pulled out of the line when ordered he didnt see any inexperienced young men trudging forward wideeyed and eager as befitted a warrior race to take their places it was nighttime of course maybe that made a difference maybe he tried to make himself believe it having left their positions at night presumably to keep the unkerlanters from realizing they were going they got no sleep they got no sleep the next day either but kept tramping west through woods that seemed to go on forever by the time istvan finally was allowed to stop and rest he was readier to fight his own officers than he ever had been to fight the kuusamans the brigade had to march through the woods for most of a week before they got to a ley line there might have been others closer but they hadnt been charted this whole stretch of the world was far far off the beaten track and then the weary men had to wait till enough caravan cars accumulated to carry them all west it could be worse kun said as the squad did at last climb aboard one they could have decided to make us march the whole way across the ilszung mountains and all why not we fought our way across em coming east shut up curse you istvan said dont let any officers hear you saying something like that or theyre liable to take you up on it he didnt see the leyline caravan leave the forest by then he was asleep his chin on his chest when he woke again the mountains were near and then the caravan traveled over mountains and through mountain valleys for the next couple of days much of the terrain reminded istvan achingly of his own home valley many of the villages with their walls and their fortresslike steeproofed houses of gray stone could have been kunhegyes where hed grown up but kunhegyes lay far from any ley line some of the men from the mountains of eastern gyongyos had never seen the plains that led down to the bothnian ocean the only flat ground theyd ever known was that of the great woods of western unkerlant and they exclaimed in wonder to see farmland stretching from one horizon to the other kun looked at istvan over the tops of his spectacles i thought youd be oohing and ahhing with the rest of the backcountry lads he remarked then youre not as smart as you like to think you are istvan retorted didnt i come this way before when they threw me onto a ship and sent me to obuda kun thumped his forehead with the heel of his hand aye of course you did and im a naturalborn idiot i must be down in the flatlands towns got bigger and closer together istvan had all he could do not to marvel at the sight of so many buildings all in the same place and at the sight of tall towers climbing toward the stars how do so many clans live together in one place without feuds tearing them to pieces he asked kun youre a city man so you ought to know what you have to understand is a lot of people move to the cities from out of the countryside the former mages apprentice answered some of them are younger sons and the like men who wont get a fair share from their family plots and others are the men who want to find out if they can get rich the odds are slim in town stars above know thats so but itll never ever happen on a farm i suppose youre going somewhere with this but im not following you not yet istvan said bear with me kun told him in your valley your clans been living next to its neighbors for hundreds of years everybody remembers who did what to whom and why since the stars first shone some of the clan quarrels are that old too am i right or am i wrong oh youre right of course istvan said thats how things are ha kun pounced but its not how things are in the cities or not so much if you move away from most of the people in your clan you move away from most of the old squabbles too you get to know a man for what he is himself not for whether his grandfathers greatuncle stole three hens from your cousins greatgrandma do you see what im saying what it sounds like is the army except without the discipline in the army istvan said here i do what i do because the officers tell me to and you do what you do because i tell you to and the troopers do what they do because you tell them to back in my valley my place in the clan tells me what to do i always know whats expected if you understand what im saying he waited for kun to nod then went on but if youre living in the city away from your clan how do you know what to do or how to act who tells you i tell myself kun answered thats what cities are all about making your own choices i mean theyre changing the face of gyongyos too istvan disapproved of change on general principles in that he reckoned himself a typical gyongyosian his eyes slid over to kun who smiled as if knowing what he was thinking as far as istvan was concerned kun was no typical gyongyosian and a good thing too he thought what kun might be thinking of him never entered his mind they slid through gyorvar the next morning heading down to the docks all the chief rivers watering the gyongyosian plain came together at gyorvar and went down as one to the not far distant sea istvan didnt think about that he craned his neck to get a glimpse of ekrekek arpads palace before his first trip through the capital hed imagined it as a tower taller than any mountains a tower from which the ekrekek could reach out and touch the sacred stars if he so desired it was nothing of the sort being pavilions of gleaming marble scattered across parkland but lovely nonetheless hed remembered that and then after istvan got his glimpse the leyline caravan stopped at the docks which were anything but lovely hed remembered that too the battered transports waiting to take his comrades and him across the sea were even more unlovely than the ones he remembered from his last trip through gyorvar he didnt know what that meant nothing good probably little by little cornelu was learning to read lagoan hed never thought he would do that but he turned out to have a powerful incentive the better he read the more readily he could learn of unkerlants advances in the west anything that told him of algarves troubles was worth investigating in detail he might not have liked lagoas language but he liked what was being said in it when he took janira out to a band concert though he stuck to sibian saying mezentios men are finally starting to pay for their folly good she answered in the same language she had an odd accent part lowerclass part lagoan her father balio was a sibian fisherman whod settled in setubal after the six years war married a local woman and started an eatery janira was in fact more fluent in lagoan that she spoke sibian at all helped endear her to cornelu aye he said fiercely and squeezed her hand may they be driven back on every front may they be driven from sibiu may they stop dropping eggs on setubal janira said fathers only just starting to get back on his feet an algarvian egg had wrecked the eatery where balio had cooked and janira served she went on everything is more expensive in the new place im sorry cornelu said and he was that meant she had to work even more than she had before which meant she had fewer chances to see him since his own duties often kept him from seeing her their romance if that was the name for it had advanced only by fits and starts of course cornelu was also a married man at least technically he hoped his little daughter brindza was doing well back in tirgoviste town he hoped no such thing for his wife not after costache had taken up with at least one of the algarvian officers whod been billeted on her standing in line with janira cornelu tried to put all that out of his mind the line snaked forward in the darkness he passed through a couple of black curtains before emerging into light and paying the fee for himself and janira they both held out their hands one of the feetakers stamped them with red ink to show theyd paid then they hurried into the concert hall it was filling fast cornelu spotted a couple of seats he went for them as ferociously as if charging on leviathanback there he said in something like triumph as he and janira reached them just ahead of a lagoan couple janira smiled i can see why all your enemies must fear you she said sitting down beside him cornelu smiled too the main reason my enemies fear me is that they do not know my leviathan and i are there till too late sometimes they never find out what happened to them sometimes they do realize and it is the last thing they ever know you sound so happy about it janira said with a small shiver i am happy about it he replied they are algarvians they are the enemies the occupiers of my kingdom they are the enemies of this kingdom too i know i understand all that she hesitated then went on its only that i havent heard you sound really happy very often its strange when you sound that way and it has to do with killing oh cornelu contemplated that for a moment i should probably be ashamed but aside from that i have not had much to be happy about lately just before he turned the evening into a disaster even as it began he redeemed himself with a handful of words present company excepted of course janira who had started to cloud up relaxed and leaned her head on his shoulder they both applauded when the musicians came out on stage lagoan music was on the whole delicate like that of the other algarvic kingdoms it didnt thump and harangue the way kaunian music did a couple of things set it apart though for one it was generally more cheerful than anything cornelu would have been likely to hear in sibiu of course the lagoans had more reason to be cheerful they lived farther away from algarve and for another theyd borrowed triangles and bells from their kuusaman neighbors which gave their pieces an almost fantastical feel to cornelus ears janira enjoyed the music that was plain cornelu applauded a little more than dutifully when the concert ended seeing his companion having a good time let him have a good time at one remove that was almost as good as the real thing even in the darkness imposed on it to keep from offering targets to algarvian dragons setubal remained a busy place after dark the lagoans seemed to think they could use noise to make up for the lack of light everybody shouted at the top of his lungs carriages carried little bells to warn other carriages they were there leyline caravan cars moved slowly and clanged big deeptoned bells as ships would during thick fog from what the news sheets said people walked in front of them every so often anyhow walking in front of even a slowmoving caravan car usually produced a funeral but the alternative to going out in pitch darkness was staying at home and the folk of setubal didnt fancy that as far as cornelu was concerned the cacophony of shouts and most unmusical bells of all sizes and tones might as well have canceled the concert powers above he muttered i wouldnt be surprised if algarvian dragonfliers could hear setubal even if they cant see it janira had a sibian father aye she spoke the language of the island kingdom aye but she proved herself a true lagoan by the way she navigated the dark streets back to the flat she shared with balio here we are she said at last if you say so cornelu answered for all that i can tell by looking we might be going into king vitors palace janira laughed no she said thats down the street and its not half so fine a place as this she laughed again why you can see for yourself to cornelu a sober literalminded man not much given to whimsy that meant nothing for a moment then he got the joke and laughed too he took her in his arms their lips had no trouble finding each other in the darkness his hands slid along the length of her she let him lift her kilt and stroke her there but then she twisted away janira he said hoarsely they could have done anything at all right there and no one but the two of them would ever have known not now she said not yet im not ready cornelu good night he heard her footsteps on the stairs the door to her block of flats opened then it closed he kicked at the slates of the sidewalk she wasnt teasing him leading him on he was sure of that one of these days when she was ready they would go further but why not tonight he muttered kicking at the sidewalk again in the blackness he could have reached under his own kilt and relieved some of his agitation too but he didnt instead he set out for his dockside barracks not being a native of setubal he didnt unerringly find his way to them he did manage to get aboard one of the many leyline caravans gliding through the streets of the city it wasnt any of those that went down to the harbor district but it took him to a stop where he could catch a caravan that would carry him where he needed to go he felt pretty good about that he didnt feel so good when reveille pried him out of his cot the next morning yawning he staggered to the galley and gulped cup after cup of strong tea one of his fellow exiles teased him youll be pissing all day long i probably will cornelu agreed yawning again at least all the running to the jakes and back will keep me awake must have been quite a night last night his countryman sounded jealous not so bad cornelu said janira had she heard that would have been irate it implied hed had his way with her which he hadnt but she wasnt there and the other sibian was and so cornelu boasted a little he was going back for yet another mug of tea when a lagoan officer hed never seen before strode briskly into the mess hall suspicion flamed in cornelu an unfamiliar lagoan with something on his mind was the last thing he wanted to see early in the morning or any other time of day either sure enough the lagoan spoke up in his own language how many of you understand me about half the sibians raised their hands cornelu followed well enough but kept his down the lagoan switched to algarvian how many of you understand me now this time cornelu raised his hand so did most of his countrymen one of them called out in his own language why dont you speak sibian if you want to talk to us the lagoan ignored that lagoans were generally good at ignoring anything they didnt want to hear in algarvian the fellow continued you will all report to the admiralty offices after breakfast for an important briefing whats it about cornelu called he got no answer he hadnt really expected one having delivered his message the lagoan officer turned on his heel and marched away muffled curses followed him and some that werent so muffled highhanded son of a whore one of the exiles said and everybody else nodded lagoans were like that but the sibians all tramped over to the admiralty offices at the required time too cornelu wondered what sort of orders or lies they would hear from the lagoan officers in charge of getting the most out of them cornelu sometimes thought the lagoans were as intent on using up the sibians as they were on using them he shrugged he couldnt do anything about that at the admiralty a grizzled lagoan petty officer whose ribbons and medals declared that hed fought bravely during the six years war spoke to the sibians down the hallway to the conference room unlike a lot of his countrymen including plenty with fancier ranks and fancier educations he spoke sibian not algarvian he even had a facaceni accent where did you learn my language cornelu asked him always a bit of dealing going on the lagoan answered and said no more smuggler cornelu guessed whether he was right or wrong he couldnt do anything about it now gold letters over the entrance to the conference room proclaimed that it was named for admiral velho one of lagoas heroes in the last naval war against sibiu a couple of hundred years before assembling sibians here to listen to whatever the lagoans had to say struck cornelu as less than tactful but the lagoans had been less than tactful ever since the sibian exiles arrived cornelu turned to complain to one of his countrymen as he started into the conference room but stopped with the words unuttered one look at the map on the far wall swept them out of his head the other sibians were pointing and staring too their talk rose to an excited buzz a lagoan officer in tunic and kilt darker than the sibian seagreen stood beside the map have we got your attention he asked the exiles in algarvian for once cornelu didnt care with that map in front of him he would listen to anything fifteen to sing a song of victory words bubbled inside garivald like stew bubbling in a pot over a hot fire the day they thought theyd never see he paused waiting for the next couplet to form they thought theyd hit us hard in summer but now we know their days are numbered he shook his head that wouldnt do not even with music to make the bad rhyme and scansion less obvious he cast about for a better line before he could find one the unkerlanter regular named tantris came up to him whatever line might have taken shape flew away instead he gave tantris a dirty look the regular ignored it he said we need to strike the followers of raniero the pretender to show them they arent safe even though his majestys troops havent yet started taking grelz back from the invaders can we do it youre asking me now garivald said intrigued tantris nodded garivald persisted youre not giving orders youre not saying you know everything and i dont know anything the way you did before i never said that tantris protested no garivald glowered at him wheres gandiluz then dead thats where dead because you wouldnt listen to me when i told you sadoc could no more work magic than a bullfrog can fly you had it all planned the two of you but you werent quite as efficient as you thought were you tantris gave him a long expressionless look you do want to have some care in how you speak to me garivald wanted nothing of the sort tantris put him in mind of all the inspectors and impressers hed had to obey his whole life long but he didnt have to obey this whoreson the band of irregulars in the woods west of herborn was his not tantris one word from him and the regular soldier would meet with an unfortunate accident garivald smiled power was heady stuff tantris nodded as if garivald had spoken his thoughts aloud everything gets remembered you know tantris said everything with his majestys armies moving forward again debts will be paid every single one of them before very long grelz will find out exactly what that means birds chirped leaves were green the sun shone brightly but just for a moment winter lived in garivald he held the whip hand right now but behind him stood only his irregulars behind tantris stood the whole great apparatus of unkerlanter intimidation reaching all the way back to the throne room in cottbus and to king swemmel himself which carried more weight in the end garivald knew too mournfully well with a sigh he said we hate the redheads and the traitors worse than we hate each other wed better anyhow aye wed better tantris smile was crooked and wed better show the traitors that were still in business around these parts their hearts will be down in their boots anyhow with the algarvians falling back toward the borders of grelz a lot of them will be looking for ways out of the fight their hearts wont be in it anymore maybe garivald said some of them follow king raniero false king raniero tantris broke in false king raniero garivald agreed dutifully some of them follow him for the sake of a full belly or a place to sleep at night but some of them he paused wondering how to say what needed saying without putting his own head in the noose some of them you know really mean it tantris nodded those are the ones who really need killing we cant let people think they can side with the redheads and against our kingdom and get away with it this isnt a game were playing here theyd get rid of every one of us if they could and we have to treat them the same way garivald nodded every word of that was true however much he wished it werent what have you got in mind he asked if its something we can do well do it he couldnt resist a last jab if its more of sadocs magic maybe youd better think again tantris winced the lightning sadoc had called down could have seared him instead of gandiluz it could have seared garivald too garivald knew what had saved him though sadoc had aimed the lightning his way and sadoc had proved he couldnt hit what he was aiming at no more magic tantris said with another shudder what i have in mind is hitting one of the villages around the woods that the grelzers garrison if we kill a few algarvians in the fighting all the better all right garivald said as long as you dont want to make us stand and fight if they turn out to be stronger than we expect going in king swemmel was liable to reckon it efficient to get rid of men bold enough to be irregulars at the same time as he was fighting the grelzers if that had occurred to tantris he didnt show it he said whatever you think best as long as we strike the blow garivald scratched his chin whiskers rasped under his fingers he still shaved every now and then but only every now and then and he had the fair or rather the dark beginnings of a beard after some thought he said lohr thatll be the place well have the easiest time hitting its not very far from the woods and the garrison there isnt very big aye lohr suits me well enough tantris said i was blooded in this band between lohr and pirmasens garivald said we ambushed a squad of algarvian footsoldiers marching from one to the other i dont think there are any redheads down there these days theyve mostly gone west and they leave it to the traitors to hold down the countryside our job is to show em that wont work tantris said two nights later the irregulars left the shelter of the woods and marched on lohr actually it was more of a straggle than a march they ambled along in a column tramping down the dirt road toward the village garivald posted a couple of men whod grown up by lohr in the vanguard and another at the rear they were the best local guides in the darkness and if something went wrong somewhere between the van and the rear he would find himself walking beside obilot she said fighting grelzers isnt the same as fighting algarvians its like drinking spirits cut with too much water we hurt the algarvians when we hit the grelzers too garivald said i know she answered its still not the same i dont want to hurt algarvians by hurting grelzer traitors i want to hurt algarvians by hurting algarvians she kicked at the ground as if it were one of mezentios soldiers not for the first time garivald wanted to ask what the redheads had done to her not for the first time he found he lacked the nerve he kept marching when they started to near lohr tantris came over to him and said we ought to get off the road now and go by way of the fields if the traitors have sentries theyll be less likely to spot us so he still wasnt giving orders hed lost some of his arrogance sure enough and his advice made sense garivald nodded and said aye well do it he gave the orders no sentries challenged them garivalds confidence began to rise no one had betrayed the attack to the men who followed king raniero he and his irregulars often knew what the grelzers would do as soon as ranieros men did but that coin had two sides who in my band is a traitor was a question that always ate at him dawn had just begun to turn the eastern sky gray when they came up to lohr a man from the vanguard pointed out three or four houses those are the ones the grelzers use he whispered to garivald he spoke with great confidence garivald assumed someone in the village had told him sure enough this business of civil war was as much a matter of listening and hearing as it was of fighting forward garivald called softly and the irregulars loped into the sleeping village dogs began to bark a little white one ran yapping at garivald and made as if to bite his ankle he blazed it it let out a low wail of pain then fell silent he kicked its body aside and ran on a couple of villagers and a couple of grelzer soldiers came out to see what the fuss was about in the dim light none of the irregulars tried to figure out who was who they just started blazing it wasnt a battle it wasnt anything like a battle in a very few minutes lohr was theirs the survivors they captured from the squad of grelzers made garivald sad they could as easily have fought on his side as for the algarvian puppet king of grelz but theyd made the other choice the wrong choice as it turned out and they would have to pay for it tantris was looking at him as if wondering whether he had the stomach to give the order he did saying blaze the traitors a moment later he added blaze the firstman too hes been in bed with the algarvians ever since they got here none of that took long either before the sun had risen the irregulars were on their way back to their forest fastness tantris came up to him saying very neat you see what you can do garivald nodded i also see you werent joggling my elbow the way you did when you tried to use sadoc for more than he could give do i have to tell you again that everything you say will be remembered tantris asked do you care to remember that i told you the truth garivald answered he stepped up his pace tantris didnt try to stay with him he caught up with obilot just as the sun came red over the horizon her eyes he thought shone brighter than it did we did well there even if they were only grelzers she said aye garivald nodded her words werent much different from what tantris had given him but warmed him far more he could have done without the regulars approval at times he would gladly have done without the regular altogether but what obilot thought mattered to him all at once hardly thinking what he was doing he reached out and took her hand she blinked garivald waited to see what would happen next if she decided she didnt like that she was liable to do something much more emphatic than just telling him so but she let his hand stay in hers all she said was took you long enough i wanted to be sure he answered though hed been anything but then he took his hand away not wanting to push too hard the band got back under the trees without having lost a man or a woman either garivald left sentries behind to warn of a grelzer counterattack if one came the rest of the irregulars returned to the clearing for as much of a celebration as they could manage though a lot of them wanted nothing but sleep garivald caught obilots eye again he wandered into the woods if she followed she did if she didnt he shrugged pushing obilot when she didnt care to be pushed was a good way to end up dead but she did follow when they found a tiny clearing far enough from the main one they paused and looked at each other are you sure garivald asked hed been away from his wife and family for more than a year obilot nodded he thought she had no family left alive though he wasnt sure he took her in his arms none of what they said to each other after that had anything to do with words flying over the plains of southern unkerlant count sabrino felt a strong sense of having done all this before by the way things looked the war against unkerlant the war the algarvians had thought they would win in the first campaigning season would go on forever his mouth twisted appearances were liable to be deceiving but not in the way for which his countrymen would have hoped if theyd broken through to cottbus if theyd broken past sulingen maybe even if theyd torn the heart from the unkerlanter defenses in the durrwangen bulge but they hadnt they hadnt done any of those things and how many algarvian behemoths lay rotting on the battlefields of the durrwangen salient sabrino couldnt have said not to the closest hundred not even to the closest five hundred not to save his own life but he knew the answer just the same too many these days the algarvians had to hold on tightly to the behemoths they had left if they incautiously threw them away theyd have none at all oh that wasnt quite true but it came all too close and it would be at least another year more likely two or three before new beasts came off the breeding farms in anything like adequate numbers meanwhile meanwhile the unkerlanters still had behemoths and to spare and they handled them better than they had when the war was new why not sabrino thought bitterly theyve spent the past two years learning from us they had behemoths more came from their breeding farms in a steady stream how many breeding farms did they have there in the far west beyond the reach of any algarvian dragon those same two words formed again in sabrinos mind too many they had footsoldiers in endless profusion too and they had mages willing to be as ruthless as maybe more ruthless than any who served king mezentio no wonder then that sabrino was flying a good deal north and east of durrwangen these days the unkerlanters were the ones moving forward now his own countrymen the ones who tried to slow them tried to stop them tried to turn them back he wished they would have had more luck at it the algarvians did have a counterattack going in now a blow at the flank of an advancing unkerlanter column sabrino knew a certain somber pride as he watched the footsoldiers down there far below crumple up the unkerlanters they were still better versed in the art of war than king swemmels men where they gained anything close to local equality they could still drive the foe before them he spoke into his crystal forward if we take out their eggtossers our boys may be able to pin the unkerlanters against the river and do a proper job of chewing them up captain orosio said cant hurt to try sooner or later weve got to stop these bastards might as well be now thats right weve got the edge here wed better take advantage of it sabrino said nothing of conquest he said nothing of driving the enemy back to durrwangen let alone to sulingen or cottbus his horizons had contracted a local victory an advance here instead of a retreat would do well enough for now he spotted the eggtossers in what had been a field of rye but was now overgrown and full of weeds the dragonfliers of his wing behind him he dove on them for a few splendid minutes everything went the way it had back in the first days of the war one after another the algarvians released their eggs and then rose into the sky once more looking over his shoulder sabrino saw the bursts of sorcerous energy send the enemy eggtossers and their crews flying in ruin thats the way to do it he said the enemy would have a harder time hurting the algarvian soldiers on the ground he and his wing flew on toward the west gaining height there was the river sure enough he spoke into the crystal again well turn around and flame the crews we might have missed with our eggs then back to the dragon farm and well get ourselves some rest rest he laughed he had trouble remembering what the word meant he patted the scaly side of his dragons neck the vicious stupid beast had trouble remembering too of course it had trouble remembering everything no sooner had that thought struck him than he spied the unkerlanter dragons winging their way up out of the south straight for his wing they were very fast and flew in good formation some of swemmels top dragonfliers mounted on prime beasts it was an honor of sorts though one sabrino could have done without he shouted into the crystal warning his men the unkerlanters had the advantage of numbers and the advantage of height as well as the advantage of fresh dragons all sabrino and his men had left to them was the advantage of skill up till now it had always sufficed to let them hurt the foe worse than he hurt them to bring most of them back safe to whichever dragon farm they were using that day one more time by the powers above sabrino said and swung his dragon toward the closest unkerlanter however weary it was it still hated its own kind its scream of rage proved as much sabrino blazed one of king swemmels dragonfliers off the back of his mount the dragon without control went wild and struck out at the beast closest to it which was also painted unkerlanter rockgray sabrino whooped hed just made life harder for the foe and then his own dragon twisted and convulsed beneath him bellowing in the agony hed inflicted on so many of his enemies while hed been dealing with the foe in front of him hed let an unkerlanter dragon get close enough to his rear to flame in any sort of even fight it would have been a rookie mistake outnumbered as his countrymen were it had to happen every so often so he told himself at any rate excuses aside though it was liable to kill him his dragon he saw at once wouldnt be able to stay in the air he looked back sure enough its right wing was badly burned the only consolation he could draw was that it didnt plummet to earth at once which would have put an immediate end to his career too he tried to urge it back toward the east toward the algarvian lines but lost in its private wilderness of pain the dragon paid no attention to the increasingly frantic signals he gave it with the goad it flew straight for the river the water is cold it must have thought it will feel good on my hurt wing no you miserable stupid stinking thing sabrino howled youll drown and youll drown me too he pounded at it with the goad maybe he did a little good instead of coming down in the water the dragon landed on the riverbank sabrino unfastened his harness and leaped off its back as it waded into the stream only then did he realize it had come down on the western side of the river putting that stream and several miles of enemyheld country between himself and his countrymen fast as he could he got out of the furs and leather he wore to ward himself against the chill of the upper air drawn by the dragon unkerlanter soldiers were trotting toward him they would finish him off if they got the chance he didnt want to give it to them clad only in his drawers and clutching his stick he plunged into the river he struck out for the eastern bank swimming as strongly as he could even in late summer the water was bitterly cold the unkerlanters shouted and started blazing puffs of steam rose from the river not far from sabrino their beams were plenty to boil it here and there but they didnt get close enough to the waters edge to blaze with any great accuracy for a while sabrino simply accepted that he wasnt about to look back to see what was going on but then he didnt have to his wounded dragons bellows of pain and rage told him everything he wanted to know swemmels soldiers would have to stalk it and kill it before they could worry too much about him and although it couldnt fly it remained deadly dangerous on the ground sabrino thought he could safely concentrate on his swimming he was worn when he splashed up onto the eastern bank he lay there for a couple of minutes gathering his strength im getting too old for these games he thought but he wasnt so old that he felt like dying once he got his wind back he climbed to his feet and started east somehow or other he would have to get through the unkerlanter line and back to his own first things first he dove behind some bushes a squads worth of unkerlanters were trotting toward the river they were pointing at the dragon and didnt see him he supposed they were going to have some fun blazing at it they couldnt do it much harm not from this side of the stream of course it couldnt flame them over here either once theyd gone past him sabrino scurried east again he found the unkerlanter in the bushes by almost stumbling over him the fellow was squatting his tunic hiked up his stick beside him on the ground he stared at sabrino in the same horror and astonishment as sabrino felt on coming across him then he grabbed for his stick sabrino blazed first the unkerlanter let out a moan and toppled sabrino put on his rockgray tunic and his boots which were too big he didnt look anything like an unkerlanter but he wouldnt stand out so much at long range wearing the tunic the man hed killed had some flat barley cakes in his belt pouch sabrino wolfed them down should i lie low till nightfall he wondered in the end he didnt dare his dragon would draw more unkerlanters the same way amber drew feathers and bits of paper the farther away from it he got the better and every step put him one step closer to his countrymen one step closer to the unkerlanters main line too he thought but he kept moving it almost cost him his life a couple of unkerlanters spotted him and started running after him he blazed one of them then ran like blazes himself but the other soldier seemed to take two strides for every one of his im much too old for this sabrino thought heart thudding fit to burst the unkerlanter kept blazing as he ran he couldnt aim very well doing that he charred lines in the grass and shrubs all around sabrino but then his beam caught the algarvian dragonflier high in the back of the left shoulder with a howl of pain sabrino fell forward on his face with a howl of triumph swemmels soldier dashed up to finish him off and took a beam right in the chest wearing a look of absurd indignant surprise he crumpled never try to trick an old fox sabrino panted right at the moment he felt like the oldest fox in the world he robbed this unkerlanter too and then cut the dead mans tunic into strips to bandage his wound it hurt but he didnt think it too serious he also stuffed cloth into the toes of the boots hed stolen to make them fit better now he did hide till midnight the unkerlanter had an entrenching tool on his belt sabrino dug himself a scrape awkwardly and painfully with only one arm working well and waited for darkness it came sooner than it would have at the height of the fighting for the durrwangen bulge fall was on the way and then another savage unkerlanter winter when night arrived he scurried forward he favored his left side which had stiffened up every time he heard an unkerlanter voice he froze the front fortunately was fluid hereabouts the unkerlanters and his own men had foxholes and outposts not solid trench lines a determined no a desperate man could sneak between them dawn was painting the east red when someone called out a nervous challenge halt who comes sabrino almost wept the challenge was in algarvian a friend he said a dragonflier blazed down behind the enemys line silence then advance and be recognized hands high because of the wound sabrinos left hand didnt want to go high he raised it despite the pain moving forward as if surrendering he let his own side capture him here you go constable a baker offered bembo a slice of cheese pie try this and tell me what you think dont mind if i do bembo never minded taking free food and drink from the shops and taverns on his beat hed done it in tricarico and he did it here in gromheort too he took a big bite and chewed thoughtfully not bad he said and took another bite to prove it what alls in it two kinds of cheese the baker began he spoke good algarvian aye i know that bembo said impatiently what livens it up well theres garlic and onions and leeks the baker said and bembo nodded each time then the forthwegian looked sly and set a finger by the side of his nose and theres a mystery ingredient i dont know whether i ought to tell you or not by then bembo was finishing the slice of pie youd better he said his mouth full youll be sorry if you dont had the whoreson given him mouse turds or something like that surely not if he had he wouldnt have told bembo at all all right ill talk the baker said as if he were a captive bembo was belaboring its dried chanterelle mushrooms youre kidding bembos stomach did a slow lurch like all algarvians he thought mushrooms disgusting forthwegians on the other hand were wild for them and put them in everything but tea bembos hand fell to the leather grip of his bludgeon i ought to loosen your teeth for you feeding me those miserable things why the forthwegian asked in what sounded like honest bewilderment you just said you liked the pie bembo could hardly deny that he did his best i liked it in spite of the mushrooms not because of them how do you know be honest constable how do you know the baker speared a mushroom out of the pie with the point of the knife hed used to slice it he offered it to bembo how can you really know till you try id sooner eat a snail bembo said which was true he liked snails fine especially in butter and garlic the forthwegian baker made a horrible face bembo laughed at that and wagged a finger at the fellow you see im not the only one but the mushroom remained on the end of the knife a mute challenge to his manhood he scowled but then he ate it the little boys way of handling such an unfortunate situation would have been to gulp the mushroom down without tasting it bembo was tempted to do just that but made himself chew slowly and deliberately before swallowing well the baker demanded what do you think i think you forthwegians get too worked up over the cursed things thats what bembo answered not a whole lot of taste any which way these are just the dried ones the baker said when the fall rains come and the fresh mushrooms start growing then he sighed as bembo might have sighed over the charms of a beautiful woman bembo was convinced he could have a lot more fun with a beautiful woman than any forthwegian could with a mushroom well im off he said wiping greasy fingers on his kilt no surprises next time mind you or youll get a surprise you wont like so bloody well he went on his way hoping hed put a little fear into the bakers heart the strangled guffaw he heard as he closed the door behind him made him doubt it he wasnt usually the sort who roused fear in people oraste now oraste even roused fear in bembo his partner bembo swaggered along every now and then flourishing his club oraste at the moment roused fear in nobody he was down with a nasty case of the grippe bembo hoped he wouldnt catch it he feared he would though people who worked with people who got sick often got sick themselves nobodyd ever quite figured out why it probably had something to do with the law of similarity or maybe its the law of contagion bembo thought contagion get it he laughed without oraste at his side he had to tell jokes to himself he found them funnier than oraste would have he was sure of that seeing a company of algarvian footsoldiers tramping toward the leyline caravan depot he stuck up his arm to halt traffic on the cross street his countrymen cursed him as they passed by now he was used to that they were on their way to unkerlant and he got to stay here in gromheort the way things were in unkerlant these days he wouldnt have wanted to go there himself behind the algarvians came another company in uniform bearded forthwegians whod joined plegmunds brigade their countrymen forced to wait at the cross street while they passed cursed them more foully than the algarvian soldiers had cursed bembo disciplined and stolid the new recruits for the brigade kept on marching they puzzled bembo if some foreign king occupied algarve he couldnt see himself volunteering to fight for the fellow of course im a lover not a fighter he thought he wouldnt have said that aloud had oraste been tramping along beside him his partner seldom found his jokes funny but oraste would have howled laughter at that a little storefront had a big sign in unintelligible forthwegian below it in smaller letters were a couple of words of perfectly understandable algarvian healing charms the paint that served as their background was a little newer a little cleaner than the rest of the sign bembo wondered if the sign had said the same thing in classical kaunian before gromheort changed hands he might have walked on by had he not chosen that moment to sneeze he didnt want to spend several days on his cot aching and feverish and generally feeling as if hed stepped in front of a leyline caravan car if a charm would stop his sickness before it really got started he was all for it he went inside two men and a woman sat in a gloomy nasty waiting room they all looked up at him in varying degrees of alarm hed expected nothing less relax he told them hoping they understood algarvian after the baker he was feeling spoiled im here for the same reason you are one of the men murmured in forthwegian the other two people eased back into their seats the woman chuckled nervously the man who knew some algarvian asked and why is that to keep myself from coming down with the grippe of course bembo answered he sneezed again powers above i hope im not too late oh the man said he translated once more the other man said something they all smiled the man patted the chair next to him here you can go next thanks bembo took such privileges for granted he sat down a few minutes later the door to the back room opened a man and a woman came out the man took one look at bembo and scooted past him out the front door and onto the street that didnt surprise bembo either the fellow was the type who would have dealt with constables before the woman looked bembo up and down too after a brittle silence she asked what you want in halting algarvian before bembo could speak the man sitting by him said hes after your famous cure for the grippe ah the woman nodded she pointed to bembo you come with me aye mistress he answered and followed her into the back room it had the impressive disorder hed seen before among mages of a certain type although he would have been mightily surprised if she held any formal ranking when she gestured he sat down in one of the chairs she sat in the other which faced his grippe eh she said thats right bembo agreed my partners down with it now and i dont want to catch it myself nodding again she set her hand on his forehead her palm was cool and smooth she clicked her tongue between her teeth you just in time i hope she said have i got a fever bembo asked anxiously she held up her thumb and forefinger little one she answered now little one you not worry i fix she reached for a book it was bembo saw in kaunian he gave a mental shrug algarvian mages used the classical tongue too after reading she rummaged through her sorcerous supplies had she not been a mage of sorts bembo would have thought of the stuff as junk she bound a small reddish rock and a bit of something fibrous into a silk bag then hung it round his neck by a cord then she put a couple of teeth one needlelike the other thicker but still sharp into another little sack and set that in his breast pocket bloodstone and sea sponge good against fever she said likewise fangs of serpent and crocodile she stood and set both hands on top of his head some of her chant was in forthwegian some in kaunian when she was done she gave bembo a brisk nod and held out her right hand palm up one broad silver bit he started to growl but angering a mage even a lesser one was foolish he paid not only did he pay he said thank you it wasnt what he was thinking the healer had to know that but nobody could blaze you for thinking she said youre welcome when he came out into the front room conversation stopped most abruptly a couple of new people had come in while the healing mage was helping him he thought they were talking back and forth in kaunian but he hadnt heard enough to be sure he strode past them and out onto the street again the more he walked his beat though the more worried he got if that was a place where disguised kaunians gathered had the healer tried to cure him or curse him when he got back to the barracks he put the question to a mage attached to the constabulary lets see the amulets she gave you the fellow said bembo showed them to him he nodded the substances are what they should be i can check whether the spell was perverted some sort of way the mage chanted cocked his head to one side as if listening and chanted some more he glanced over at bembo far as i can tell friend youre not likely to get the grippe for a while everythings as it should be good bembo said the way things are nowadays you cant be too careful well im not going to tell you youre wrong there the mage said but everythings fine this time bembo intended to stop in and thank the healer and probably frighten the life out of her customers when he walked his beat the next day but when he came to the little storefront the door was ajar he stuck his head inside the door to the back room stood half open too he went back and peered into the gloom no lamps shining now and no litter of sorcerous apparatus there either the mage was gone and shed cleaned out all her stuff bembo sighed he wasnt even very surprised he patted the amulets shed given him shed been honest and then shed decided she had to run away shows what honestys worth bembo muttered and if that wasnt a demon of a thought for a constable to have he didnt know what was spinello not only walked through the streets of trapani with a limp he walked through them with a cane from what the healers said he might get rid of the cane one day before too long the limp though the limp looked to be here to stay there were compensations he got pitying glances from women and pity for a man of enterprise might easily be turned to some warmer emotion the wound badge he wore on his tunic now supported a gold bar hed been awarded the algarvian sunburst second grade for gallantry in the face of the enemy to go with his frozenmeat medal and he had a colonels three stars on his collar patches when he went back to the front hed probably end up commanding a brigade he tried to straighten up and walk as if he hadnt been wounded he could do it for a couple of steps at a time after that it hurt too much he would have traded rank and decorations for the smooth stride hed once enjoyed in a heartbeat in half a heartbeat by the powers above he thought but the powers above didnt strike bargains like that worse luck going up the stairs to the royal cultural museum made sweat spring out on his forehead by the time he climbed them all and strode into the great rococo pile of a building he was biting his lip against the pain the ticketseller a nicelooking young woman gave him a smile that could have been promising but when spinello said hello to her he tasted blood in his mouth he went on by his own face grim as always he made for the large gallery housing artifacts from the days of the kaunian empire the spare even severe sensibility informing those busts and pots and coins and sorcerous tools and other articles of everyday life was as far removed from that inspiring the building in which they were housed as it possibly could have been and yet all things considered spinello preferred elegant simplicity to equally elegant extravagance as he always did in this gallery spinello paused in front of a twohandled drinking cup whose lines had always struck him as being as close to perfection as made no difference neither illustration nor memory ever did it justice every so often he had to see it in the fired clay to remind himself what human hand and human will could shape spinello isnt it he was so lost in contemplation he needed a moment to hear and recognize his own name then he turned and stared at the aged savant whod been leaning on a cane longer than he had been alive his own bow was awkward but heartfelt master malindo he exclaimed what an honor what a pleasant surprise what a pleasant surprise to see you still breathing was what he meant malindo had been too old to serve in the six years war which surely put him up past ninety now i go on malindo said in a creaky voice are those a colonels stars i see aye spinello drew himself up with what he hoped was pardonable pride a man of valor a man of spirit malindo murmured he paused perhaps trying to find what hed meant to say he is old spinello thought but then quite visibly the savant did find it and have you fought in the west aye spinello repeated this time in a different tone of voice malindo reached out with his free hand all wrinkled and veiny and set it on the one spinello used to hold his cane then tell me i beseech you by the powers above that what we hear of algarves dealings with kaunians dealings with the descendants of those who created this he wagged a finger at the cup is nothing but a lie a filthy lie invented by our enemies spinello couldnt nerve himself to lie to the old man but he couldnt nerve himself to tell malindo the truth either he stood mute malindo sighed he took his hand away from spinellos what shall become of us he asked spinello didnt think the old man was talking to him malindo heaved another sigh then slowly shuffled down the exhibit hall try as he would spinello couldnt contemplate the cup the same way after that the other kaunian artifacts seemed somehow different too cursing under his breath he left the royal cultural museum much sooner than hed intended to he wondered if he would ever be able to go back two nights later though he hired a cab to take him through the darkened streets of trapani to the royal palace the last time he was wounded hed been too badly hurt to attend any of king mezentios receptions this time while not yet fit for field duty he could and did display himself before his sovereign a somber servitor checked his name off a list an even more somber mage muttered charms to test his cane before allowing him to go forward i havent got a knife in there nor a stick either spinello said i could have told you as much had you asked the mage bowed no doubt your excellency an assassin could have told me as much too but he would have been lying best to take no chances eh i suppose not spinello agreed with rather poor grace but he added you didnt fret about such things when the war was new the mage shrugged times are different now sir he waved spinello past him spinello went what the fellow meant of course was the war news sounded a lot better then who would have wanted to harm king mezentio when algarves armies drove everything before them no one save perhaps some foreign hireling nowadays nowadays there might well be algarvians whod lost enough to seek to avenge themselves on their sovereign spinello hoped not but had to admit mezentio was right to use the mage to help keep himself safe viscount spinello a flunky bawled after spinello murmured his name and rank to the man a few heads turned his way most of the people already in the reception hall went on with what they were doing a viscount limping along with the help of a cane was neither exotic nor prominent enough to be very interesting officers and civilian functionaries drank and gossiped and eyed one anothers women the women drank and gossiped and eyed one anothers men and everyone of course eyed king mezentio who drifted through the room talking now with one man now with another or yet again with one of the betterlooking women there after asking for a glass of wine and sipping it spinello looked at it in some surprise something wrong sir asked the servitor behind the bar wrong no spinello shook his head but ive poured down too much in the way of unkerlanter spirits i think any drink that doesnt try to tear off the top of my skull hardly seems worth bothering with ha thats the truth by the powers above a soldier behind him boomed the fellow also leaned on a cane but would have been monstrous tall if straight he wore a brigadiers rank badges and had three gold bars under his wound badge he went on after that stuff they brew from turnips and barley wine isnt good for much but making you piss a lot it does taste good spinello said sipping again for all the jolt it carried it could have been water with a snort the brigadier said my mistress tastes good too but thats not why i eat her had spinello been drinking then he would have sprayed wine over everything in front of him as it was he laughed loud enough to turn several heads his way one of those heads belonged to king mezentio he came over and asked and what is so funny here your majesty youll have to ask my superior here spinello answered he made the joke and i would never dream of stealing it from him while hes close enough to listen to me do it amusement flashed in mezentios hazel eyes he turned to the brigadier giving spinello the longnosed profile already familiar to him from the coins in his belt pouch well your excellency repeating himself didnt embarrass the brigadier one bit and he made the king laugh aye thats good thats very good mezentio said i thought so spinello said since he hadnt made the joke he had to take credit for laughing at it but maybe the wine hed drunk had made him bolder than hed believed for he heard himself asking and when do we start making the unkerlanters laugh out of the other side of their mouths again your majesty if you have a way to do that colonel leave a memorial with my officers mezentio replied i assure you they will give it their closest attention he means it spinello realized a wintry notion if ever there was one the brigadier must have had the same thought too for he exclaimed we should have been readier when we struck them then now mezentio looked right through him thank you for your confidence in us carietto the king said for all the world as if he were swemmel of unkerlant or perhaps twins spinello hadnt known the brigadiers name but mezentio did carietto plainly would never ever advance in rank again spinello said your majesty what can we do keep fighting king mezentio said at once make our foes bleed themselves white and they will hold on till our mages strengthen their sorceries and they will never admit we can be defeated fight with every fiber of our being so that victory comes to us and it will he sounded very sure very strong spinello saluted so did brigadier carietto not that it would do him any good with a grin spinello said there may not be any kaunians left by the time were through and so what mezentio said how better to serve our ancient oppressors than to use them as weapons against the western barbarians algarve must save derlavaian civilization colonel and it will he had a brandy in his hand he knocked it back and strode away so much for old malindo spinello thought the savant briefly had made him feel guilty mezentio made him feel proud pride was better he glanced over at carietto the brigadier looked like a man refusing to acknowledge he was wounded he had pride too when he went back to the fighting spinello didnt think he would let himself live long what were you talking about with the king that wasnt carietto but a woman about spinellos own age she had a wide generous mouth a nose with a tiny bend that made it more interesting than it would have been otherwise and a figure her tight tunic and short kilt displayed to advantage spinello bowed the war nothing important he bowed again i would sooner talk about you milady i am spinello and your name is fronesia she held out her hand after bowing over it once more spinello kissed it and whose friend are you milady fronesia he asked as lovely as you are you must be someones she smiled a colonel of dragonfliers friend she answered but sabrino has been in the west forever and a day and i grow lonely to say nothing of bored when i got myself invited here tonight i hoped i would find a new friend was i right algarvian women had a way of coming straight to the point so did algarvian men milady with your looks spinellos eyes traveled her curves you could have an array of friends did you so choose if you want one in particular i am at your service fronesia nodded if youre as generous as you are wellspoken we should get on very well indeed colonel spinello there is generosity and then there is generosity spinello looked her up and down again my flat isnt far from here colonel fronesia said shall we go back there and talk about it as long as were there we might as well talk too spinello agreed laughing they left together ealstan had come up in the world from bookkeeper hed advanced all the way to conspirator if that wasnt progress he didnt know what was i wish id found you a long time ago he told pybba no no no his boss shook his head wish wed been strong enough to give the stinking algarvians a good boot in the balls when the war first started then we wouldnt have to play all these stupid games the pottery magnate was playing enough of them ealstan had thought as much when he first found the discrepancies in pybbas books hed hoped as much but even he hadnt had any notion of how deeply pybba was involved in resisting king mezentios men in forthweg nothing but admiration in his voice he said i dont think anybody can write anything nasty about the algarvians on a wall anywhere in eoforwic unless you know about it before it happens thats the idea pybba sounded smug his usual growl with a purr mixed into it the purr disappeared as he went on now shut up about what youre not supposed to be talking about and get back to work if i dont make any money i cant very well put any money into giving the redheads a hard time now can i back to work ealstan went and utterly mundane work it was too but he didnt care hed scratched his itch to know hed done more than that hed started working to help drive mezentios men out of his kingdom what more could he want nothing or so he thought if fighting the algarvians also meant keeping track of invoices on fiftyseven different styles of teacup and it did he would cheerfully do that if it wasnt his patriotic duty he didnt know what it was and the news sheets had got very vague about how the fighting in unkerlant was going he took that as a good sign hed been working in his new capacity for a few weeks when something odd struck him that was almost literally true he was walking home in the first rain of fall when the thought came to him the mushrooms will be springing up he told vanai when he got back to their flat thats true she clapped her hands together and ill be able to go hunting them this year staying cooped up in the middle of mushroom season is something that shouldnt happen to anyone thanks to your sorcery it wont happen to nearly so many people ealstan said went over and gave her a kiss then he paused scratching his head what is it vanai asked nothing ealstan answered or i dont think its anything anyway vanai raised an eyebrow but rather to his relief she did no more than raise an eyebrow she didnt constantly push at him for which he was duly grateful maybe that was because shed never been able to push at her grandfather by all the signs one of the least pushable men ever born if so it was one of the few things for which ealstan would have thanked brivibas had he been able and by all the signs brivibas wouldnt have appreciated his thanks a couple of days later in casual tones ealstan said to pybba occurs to me youre missing something oh the pottery magnate raised a shaggy eyebrow whats that whatever it is youll tell me youre the one who knows everything after all ealstans cheeks heated he hoped his beard kept pybba from seeing him flush but flushed or not he stubbornly plowed ahead you want to do the redheads the most harm you can right not much point to kicking em halfway in the balls is there his boss returned and laughed at his own joke ealstan chuckled too but went on well then you are missing something who hates mezentios men more than anybody pybba jabbed a thumb at his own thick chest i do by the powers above but ealstan shook his head you dont hate them worse than the kaunians do he said and i havent seen you doing anything to get the blonds to work alongside us forthwegians what they owe the algarvians kaunians blonds the pottery magnate might never have heard the names before he scowled werent for the miserable kaunians we wouldnt have got into the war in the first place oh by the powers above ealstan clapped a hand to his forehead the algarvians have been saying the same thing in their broadsheets ever since they beat us do you want to sound like them theyre whoresons aye the algarvians i mean but that doesnt make em wrong all the time pybba said id sooner trust my own kind thank you very much kaunians are people too ealstan said his father had been saying that for as long as he could remember long enough to make him take it for granted anyway but even if he took it for granted hed already seen that few of his fellow forthwegians did pybba proved not to be one of those few he patted ealstan on the back and said i know you used to cast accounts for that halfbreed musician i suppose thats why you think the way you do but most kaunians are nothing but trouble and you can take that to the bank well kick the algarvians out on their arses well bring king penda back and everything will be fine most kaunians are nothing but trouble and you can take that to the bank what would pybba say if he knew ealstans wife whom hed met as thelberge was really named vanai he cant find out ealstan thought an obvious truth if ever there was one now get yourself back to work pybba said ill do the thinking around here you just cast the accounts right ealstan said tightly he almost threw his job in the pottery magnates face then and there but if he left now pybba would realize his reasons had to do with kaunians he couldnt afford that as he went back to the ledgers tears of rage and frustration made the columns of numbers blur for a moment he blinked till they went away hed found the underground and now he found he didnt fit into it that hurt almost too much to bear when he got home that evening he poured out his troubles to vanai no you cant quit his wife said even if pybba has no use for kaunians if he has his way people will despise us the forthwegians will anyway if the algarvians win we wont be around to despise that makes things pretty simple doesnt it its not right ealstan insisted vanai kissed him of course its not but life hasnt been fair to us since the kaunian empire fell why should it start now if pybba and king penda win at least we get the chance to go on what ealstan wanted to do was get drunk and stay drunk and if that doesnt prove im a forthwegian what would he thought he didnt do it he drank less wine with his supper than usual in fact but the temptation remained he felt pybbas eye on him all the next morning he went about his work as stolidly as he could and made no waves whatever in the face of vanais relentless pragmatism he didnt see what else he could do when he didnt come out with anything radical pybba relaxed a little and then a couple of days later ealstan jerked as if stung by a wasp he looked around for pybba when he caught the pottery magnates eye pybba was the one who flinched youve got that crazy look on your face again he rumbled mad ealstan the bookkeeper thats you or thats what theydve called you if you lived in king plegmunds time anyway thinking of king plegmunds time only made ealstan scowl no matter how glorious it had been for forthweg to him plegmunds time meant plegmunds brigade and plegmunds brigade meant his cousin sidroc whod killed his brother thinking of plegmunds brigade only convinced him his idea would work he said can we go into your office this had better be good pybba warned ealstan nodded with obvious reluctance his boss headed for the office ealstan followed him pybba slammed the door behind them go ahead youd best knock me right out of my boots i dont know whether i can or not ealstan said but i dont think were doing everything with magecraft that we ought to be youre right the pottery magnate agreed i should have turned you into a paperweight or something else that cant talk a long time ago ignoring that ealstan plowed ahead a mage could write something rude on one recruiting broadsheet for plegmunds brigade and then use the laws of similarity and contagion to make the same thing show up on every broadsheet all over eoforwic we are doing some of that kind of thing pybba said not enough ealstan returned not nearly enough pybba plucked at his beard itd be hard on the mage if the redheads caught him he said at last itd be hard on any of us if the redheads caught him ealstan answered are we lawnbowling with the algarvians or fighting a war against them the pottery magnate grunted lawnbowling eh all right mad ealstan get your arse back to your stool and start going over my books again that was all he would say ealstan wanted to push him harder but decided hed already done enough or perhaps too much he went back to the books pybba kept on calling him mad ealstan which earned him some odd looks from the other men who worked for the magnate ealstan didnt let that worry him if you werent a little bit crazy you couldnt work for pybba very long when the next payday came pybba said here make sure this goes on the books and gave him another bonus it was less than hed got after being asked to look the other way about the discrepancies hed found in pybbas accounts but it was a good deal better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick a few days later the algarvians plastered a new recruiting broadsheet for plegmunds brigade all over eoforwic a fight to the finish it said two days after that all those broadsheets suddenly sported a crude modification a fight for the finished the algarvians had paid forthwegian laborers to put them up now they paid forthwegians to take them down again aye mad ealstan the bookkeeper by the powers above pybba said ealstan didnt say anything at all he didnt say anything when pybba gave him one more bonus the following payday either nobody but him noticed the bonus and nobody noticed his silence either most people were silent around pybba most of the time and only exceptions got noticed ealstan knew what hed done and so did the magnate nothing else mattered skarnu settled into a furnished room in the little town of jurbarkas with the air of a man whod known worse when the silver in his pockets began to run low he took odd jobs for the farmers around the town he quickly proved he knew what he was doing so he got more work than a lot of the drifters who looked for it in the market square getting out into the countryside let him visit the farm near jurbarkas run by a man who worked with the underground after visiting skarnu wished he hadnt those fields grew rank and untended the farmhouse stood empty three words had been daubed on the door in whitewash now rain streaked and fading night and fog wherever the farmer had gone he wouldnt be coming back skarnu hurried back to town as fast as he could jurbarkas wasnt far from pavilosta that thought kept echoing and reechoing in skarnus mind if merkela hadnt had her baby his baby yet she would any day now but if he showed himself around those parts he would be recognized even if the redheads didnt catch him he might give them the excuse they needed to write night and fog on merkelas door he didnt want to do that no matter what he wondered if amatu would come after him but as day followed day and nothing happened along those lines he began to feel easier there the returned exile was somebody elses worry now he did wonder a little that no one from the underground tried to get hold of him but even that didnt worry him so much hed spent three years sticking pins in the algarvians he was willing even eager to let somebody else have a turn he stood in the market square at sunrise one morning despite the mug of hot tea hed bought from a small eatery there he shivered a little fall was in the air even if the leaves hadnt started turning yet farmers came into town early though to get a full days work from whomever they hired there and to keep from losing too much time themselves a fellow who wasnt a farmer walked up to skarnu and said hello pavilosta only a man from the underground would have called him by the name of the hamlet near which hed lived well well he answered hello yourself zarasai that was also the name of a town not a person he didnt know the other mans real name and hoped the fellow didnt know his what brings you here somebody got wind that you were in these parts even if you have been lying low answered the other fellow from the underground i just came around to tell you lying lows a real good idea these days oh skarnu said thats right the man from zarasai nodded weve got trouble on the loose some madman is leaking to the redheads leaking like a cursed sieve skarnu rolled his eyes just what we need as if life werent hard enough already that got him another nod from the fellow who called himself zarasai skarnu asked who is the whoreson are we trying to kill him of course were trying to kill him you think were bloody daft zarasai answered but the algarvians are taking good care of him if i were in their boots curse them id take good care of him too as for who he is i havent got a name to give him but they say hes one of the fancytrousers nobles who came back across the strait of valmiera from lagoas to fight mezentios men then he changed his mind he should have stayed down there in setubal powers below eat him powers below eat me skarnu exclaimed the man from zarasai raised a questioning eyebrow skarnu said thats got to be amatu the blundering idiot kept trying to get himself and everybody with him including me killed he couldnt help acting like one of those nobles who want commoners to bow and scrape before em thats what he was is we finally fought about it i gave him a good thumping and we went our separate ways i came here and i guess he went to the redheads i can see how you wouldnt have had any use for him zarasai said but hes singing like a nightingale now weve lost at least half a dozen good men on account of him and even a good manll sing sometimes if the algarvians work on him long enough and hard enough so well lose more too no doubt about it curse him skarnu repeated he wasnt important enough in the underground to suit him hes important to the algarvians all right the way a hooks important to a fisherman zarasai said sooner or later hell run out of names and places after that mezentios men will probably give him what he deserves they couldnt possibly skarnu didnt try to hide his bitterness mm maybe not the other underground leader said but youre safe here i think if you parted from him he wont know about this place right sit tight and well do our best to ride things out i wish the redheads had caught him and not lauzdonu over in ventspils skarnu said hes not a coward i dont think he would have had much to say if theyd just captured him but hes a spoiled brat he couldnt have everything he wanted from us and so he went to get it from the algarvians aye hed sing for them sure enough youve given us a name zarasai said thatll help when we listen to the emanations from the algarvians crystals maybe well hear it so well know what theyre doing with him maybe hell have an accident aye maybe he will heres hoping he does anyhow he slipped away skarnu didnt watch him go the less skarnu knew about anyone elses comings and goings the less the algarvians could tear out of him if they caught him and squeezed lie low sit tight ride it out at first that all seemed good advice to skarnu but then he started to wonder and to worry hed spent a lot of time with amatu before they had their break how much had he said about merkela had he named her had he mentioned pavilosta if he had would amatu remember that seemed only too likely and if he remembered what would make him happier than betraying skarnus lover to the algarvians nothing skarnu could think of if he sat tight if he lay low he might save himself and abandon merkela abandon the child hed never seen and not quite incidentally abandon his old senior sergeant raunu to the tender mercies of mezentios men to say nothing of the kaunian couple from forthweg whod escaped the sabotaged leyline caravan that was carrying them to their death ever since hed fled merkelas farm hed told himself he would endanger her if he went back now he decided she would face worse danger if he stayed away he left jurbarkas without a backwards glance and went off down the road toward pavilosta with a smile on his face he slept in a haystack that night and had a chilly time of it fall was on the way sure enough because the night was cold he woke in predawn grayness and got moving before the farmer knew hed been there after an hour or so he came on a roadside tavern and paid the proprietor an outrageous price for a sweet roll and a mug of hot herb tea thick with honey thus fortified he set out again before long the road grew familiar if he stayed on it he would go straight into pavilosta he didnt want to do that too many of the villagers knew who he was the fewer folk who saw him the fewer who might betray him to the algarvians and so he left the road heading down one narrow dirt track that looked no different from any of the others the path and others into which it led took him around pavilosta and toward merkelas farm he nodded to himself whenever he chose a new track he knew these winding lanes as well as he knew the streets of priekule soon he thought very soon but the closer to the farm he got the more fear fought with hope what would he do if he found only an empty abandoned farmhouse with night and fog scrawled on the door or the wall beside it go mad was the answer that sprang to mind setting one foot in front of the other took endless distinct efforts of will powers above he said softly rounding the last bend there it is tears sprang into his eyes tears of relief for smoke rose from the chimney the fields were golden with ripening grain the meadows emerald green and that solid stolid figure with the crook keeping an eye on the sheep as they fed could only belong to raunu skarnu hurried forward and climbed over the sunfaded wooden rails of the fence raunu trotted toward him plainly ready to use that crook as a weapon here now stranger he shouted in a voice trained to carry through battlefield din what in blazes do you want i may be shabby sergeant but im no stranger skarnu answered raunu stopped in his tracks skarnu thought he might come to attention and salute but he didnt no captain youre no stranger he agreed but youre an idiot to show your face in these parts theres a hefty price on your head there is nobody ever gave a fart about a sausagesellers son he jerked a thumb at himself but a rebel marquis the redheads want you bad theyre liable to care about you if youre here skarnu said you and merkela and the kaunians from forthweg he took a deep breath how is she well enough though shell have that baby any day now raunu replied skarnu nodded but cursed softly under his breath thatll make moving fast harder but we have to do it i think im pretty sure this place has been betrayed to the algarvians in three or four sentences he told of amatu and what the other noble had done raunu cursed too with a sergeants fluency youre right we cant stay come on back to the house with me and tell your lady merkela and pernavai were kneading bread dough when raunu and skarnu walked in merkela looked up in surprise why arent you out in the she broke off abruptly when she saw skarnu behind the veteran sergeant what are you doing here she whispered and then hurried to him she moved awkwardly she was as raunu had said very great with child when skarnu took her in his arms he had to lean forward over her swollen belly to kiss her she was almost as tall as he you have to get away he said the algarvians know about this place or they may anyhow and he told the story of amatu again merkela cursed as vividly as skarnu had nobles like that if the redheads had smashed them plenty of people would be glad to follow mezentio her fury made skarnu ashamed of his own high blood before he could say anything she went on aye we have to leave pernavai fetch vatsyunas the woman from forthweg nodded shed come to understand valmieran well enough even if she still spoke much more classical kaunian she hurried off to get her husband well need to take the wagon skarnu said to merkela you cant get far on foot he too cursed amatu with all the venom he had in him that did no good itll make us easy to spot easy to catch merkela protested so would having you die by the roadside skarnu growled and she subsided they didnt run into a squad of algarvians rushing to seize them as they rattled away from the farm as far as skarnu was concerned that put them ahead of the game right there sixteen count lurcanio bowed to krasta by your leave milady i should like to invite a guest to supper with us tonight he said a nobleman a valmieran nobleman to be perfectly plain he was scrupulous about remembering that the mansion and the serving staff were in fact krastas he was more scrupulous about such things than a good many of his countrymen had he chosen to commandeer rather than ask what could she have done about it nothing as she knew all too well that was the essence of being occupied and so she said well of course who is it she did hope she wouldnt have to endure one of the savage backwoods boors who seemed so fond of algarves cause the idea of valmierans fighting under mezentios banner still left her queasy but lurcanio answered a count by the name of amatu affable fellow i find if a bit full of himself oh amatu i know him aye krasta didnt sigh in relief but she felt like it hes from right here in priekule but her voice trailed away she frowned a little i havent seen him or i dont recall seeing him in a very long time that held an unspoken question something on the order of if he hasnt come to any of the functions that have gone on since algarve occupied valmiera whats he doing here now some nobles in the capital still stubbornly kept themselves aloof from mezentios men krasta wondered how lurcanio would have gone about inviting one of them for supper hes been away from the capital for some time lurcanio replied hes very glad to be home again though i will say i should certainly hope so krasta exclaimed why would anyone who could live in priekule care to go anywhere else lurcanio didnt answer from which she concluded he agreed with her though nothing else in valmiera seemed to her sense of superiority remained invincible she went off to browbeat the cook into outdoing himself for a noble guest aye milady nothing but the best the cook promised his head bobbing up and down with a show of eagerness to please ive got a couple of fine beef tongues in the rest crate if those would suit you for the main dish the very thing krastas smile was not without a certain small malice algarvians had a way of looking down their noses at robust valmieran cooking lurcanio could eat tongue tonight and like it or at least pretend she made sure the rest of the menu was along the same lines fried parsnips with butter sour cabbage and a rhubarb pie for dessert nothing spare and algarvian tonight she told the cook tonight the guest is a countryman just as you say milady so itll be he replied well of course krasta said as long as she wasnt dealing with lurcanio her word remained law on her estate having made sure of the cook she went up to her bedchamber shouting for bauska as she went the maidservant never got there fast enough to suit her im sorry milady she said when krasta shouted at her rather than for her my little girl had soiled herself and i was cleaning her off krasta wrinkled her nose is that what i smell she said which was unfair bauska took good care of her bastard by an algarvian officer and the baby was not only cheerful and happy but gave promise of good looks krasta however worried very little about fairness she went on count amatu is coming to supper tonight and i want to impress him what shall i wear how do you want to impress him bauska asked krasta rolled her eyes as far as she was concerned only one way mattered bauska set out a gold silk tunic that looked transparent but wasnt quite and a pair of dark blue trousers in slashed velvet with side laces to get them to fit as tightly as possible she added you might wear the black shoes with the heels milady they give your walk a certain something it wouldnt have otherwise my walk already has everything it needs krasta said but she did wear the shoes they were even more uncomfortable than the trousers which bauska took savage pleasure in lacing till krasta could hardly breathe the serving woman looked disappointed when krasta condescended to thank her for her help the way colonel lurcanios eyes lit up when krasta came downstairs was its own reward he set a hand on the curve of her hip perhaps i should send amatu away and keep you all to myself tonight perhaps you should she purred looking up at him from under halflowered eyelids but he laughed and patted her and shook his head no hell be here any moment and i truly do want the two of you to meet so long as i am chaperoning you may have more in common than you think what does that mean krasta asked i dont like it when you make your little jokes and i dont know whats going on youll know soon enough my sweet i promise you that lurcanio said more in the way of reassurance than he usually gave her count amatu knocked on the door a few minutes later he bowed over krastas hand then clasped wrists algarvian style with lurcanio he was thinner than krasta remembered thinner and somehow harsher he knocked back a brandy and nodded that opens your eyes he said and then ive had my eyes opened lately by the powers above that i have how do you mean krasta asked amatu glanced over to colonel lurcanio then asked her have you seen your brother lately skarnu krasta exclaimed as if she had some other brother too count amatu nodded no she said i havent seen him since he went off to fight in the war that was true ive never been sure since whether he was alive or dead that was anything but true though she didnt think lurcanio knew it she knew her brother was alive and still doing something to resist the algarvians but what did amatu know she did her best to sound intrigued and pleased as she asked why have you seen him where is he oh ive seen him all right amatu didnt sound pleased about it either after muttering something under his breath that krasta perhaps fortunately didnt catch he went on hes down in the south somewhere mucking about with those miserable bandits who dont know a lost cause when they see one is he i had no idea krasta was very conscious of lurcanios eye on her hed invited amatu here to see what she would do when she got this news she had to let it seem a surprise i wish hed chosen differently and part of her did had he chosen differently she wouldnt have had to think about how shed chosen one way and another shed learned too much about what the algarvians were doing that left her unhappy with herself not a feeling she was used to having theyre hopeless useless worthless the bandits i mean amatu said with fine aristocratic scorn but your brothers having a fine time slumming i will say hes knocked up some peasant wench and he couldnt be prouder if hed taken one of king gainibus daughters to bed now krasta drew herself up very straight skarnu and some woman off a farm i dont believe you she didnt think her brother immune to lust bad taste however was an altogether different question but amatu said only shows what you know i heard him with my own ears heard more than i ever want to believe you me hes as head over heels as if hed invented this tart and ill take oath on that by the powers above he meant it krasta could see could hear as much she asked how do you know all this if hes with these bandits were you with them too for a little while amatu answered i spent some time down in lagoas when i came back across the strait to valmiera i fell in with those people for a bit but they havent got the faintest idea what theyre doing to the kingdom they didnt want to listen to anybody who tried to tell them otherwise either they didnt want to listen to you and thats why you went over to the algarvians krasta thought she knew cattiness when she heard it it came around too often in her own circle to let her mistake it she was saved from having to say anything when a servant announced milady lords supper is ready amatu ate with good appetite and did a good deal of drinking too when lurcanio saw what the bill of fare was he sent krasta a reproachful look she gave back her own most innocent stare and said dont you fancy our hearty valmieran recipes i certainly do amatu said and helped himself to another slice of tongue he took a big spoonful of the onions the cook had boiled in the pot with the beef tongues lurcanio sighed as if to say that even his own tool had turned in his hand and cut him krasta hid her smile after demolishing half the rhubarb pie himself amatu took his leave lurcanio sat in the dining hall still sipping a cup of tea he remarked you did not seem very excited about the news he had of your brother krasta shrugged he seemed more interested in throwing it in my face than in really telling me anything about skarnu so i wouldnt give him the satisfaction he doesnt like skarnu much does he one need hardly be a firstrank mage to see that lurcanio remarked your brother i gather gave amatu a good set of lumps before the count decided he might be better served on the algarvian side did he krasta said well good for him i never claimed amatu was the most lovable man ever born though he does love himself rather well would you not agreed lurcanio said someone has to i suppose krasta said he makes one sweet as ever lurcanio said and krasta smiled as if at a compliment her algarvian lover went on what do you think of what he did have to tell you i cant believe my brother would take up with a peasant girl krasta said its beneath his dignity it also happens to be true lurcanio said her name is merkela we were going to seize her to use her as a lure to draw your brother but she seems to have got wind of that for she fled her farm what would you have done with skarnu if youd caught him krasta didnt want to ask the question but didnt see how she could avoid it squeezed him for what he knew about the other bandits of course lurcanio answered we are fighting a war after all still we wouldnt have done anything ah drastic if he had come out and told us what we needed to learn does amatu look much the worse for wear well no krasta admitted there you are then lurcanio said but krasta wondered if it were so simple amatu unless she misread things had had a bellyful of algarves foes and had gone to the redheads of his own accord no wonder theyd taken it easy on him then skarnu wouldnt have had that on his side of the ledger i went to the redheads of my own accord too krasta thought no wonder theyve taken it easy on me then to her amazement indeed to something not far from her horror she burst into tears had sidroc sat any closer to the fire his tunic would have started smoldering fall here in southern unkerlant was as bad as winter back in gromheort hed seen what winter was like here he never wanted to see it again but he would and soon if he lived long enough he didnt want to think about that he didnt want to think about anything all he wanted was the simple animal pleasure of warmth a pot atop the fire was starting to bubble pretty soon hed have the animal pleasure of food too for the moment and what else mattered in a soldiers life things werent so bad sergeant werferth got to his feet and stirred the pot with a big iron spoon that had come from an unkerlanter peasant hut pretty soon he said settling back down on his haunches again good sidroc said a couple of other men from plegmunds brigade nodded werferth let out a long sigh we were that close to smashing them he said holding up his thumb and forefinger almost touching that close curse it ceorl held up his thumb and forefinger the same way im about that close to starving the ruffian said that close curse it everybody laughed even werferth whose dignity as an underofficer was menaced even sidroc who still despised ceorl whenever the two of them werent fighting the unkerlanters werferth said i told you itd be done soon did you think i was lying somewhere off in the distance not too far eggs burst everyones head came up as the soldiers gauged the distance and direction of the noise ours sidroc judged he waited to see if anybody would argue with him when no one did he relaxed a little werferth said powers below eat me if i know how we figure out whos tossing those eggs and what it means the way things have been going were not even sure where in blazes were at somewhere this side of the gifhorn river sidroc said somewhere this side of the western border of grelz too or wed have those fellows in the dark green tunics fighting on our side they were somewhere a long way north and west of durrwangen but he didnt mention that everybody around the fire already knew it too well we hope we would anyhow werferth said from what i hear the grelzers are getting shaky fairweather friends ceorl spat into the campfire blaze a few of em to remind the rest who they work for and they wont give you much trouble sidroc found himself nodding even though ceorl was the one whod said it it made good sense to him werferth stirred the pot again lifted out the spoon to taste a mouthful and nodded its done the stew was cabbage and buckwheat groats and turnips and meat from a dead unicorn all boiled together with some salt back in gromheort sidroc wouldnt have touched it here he wolfed it down and held out his mess tin for more his comrades were doing the same so he didnt get much of a second helping a sentry called out a challenge the forthwegians by the fire grabbed for their sticks nobody from plegmunds brigade ever left his weapon out of reach not even for a moment anybody who did that in this country was asking to get his throat cut but the answer came back in algarvian you are plegmunds brigade is it not so ive got letters for you soldiers post they greeted him almost as enthusiastically as if he were a woman of easy virtue he got whatever stew was left in the pot and a swig of spirits from somebodys water bottle once he figured out which squad from which company they were he started passing out letters some of them got passed back to him with remarks like hes dead or he got wounded and taken off a couple weeks ago that took the edge off the excitement of seeing mail sidroc leaped in the air when the algarvian called his name he hadnt heard from gromheort in a long time the only person there who cared to write him was his father the rest of his family were either dead or hated him and that ran both ways sure enough the envelope the redhead handed him bore his fathers familiar handwriting it also bore a prewar forthwegian value imprinted in one corner and a green handstamp that said military post over it people who collected envelopes might have paid a fair bit of silver for this one sidroc wasnt any of those people and so he tore it open to get at the letter inside my dear son his father wrote it was good to hear from you and good to hear that you came through the hard fighting around durrwangen safe i hope this finds you well powers above grant it be so i am well enough though a toothache will send me to the dentist when it gets bad enough after i got your last letter i paid a call on your dear uncle hestan sidroc grunted at that ealstan and leofsigs father wasnt dear to him these days nor he to hestan his own father went on i told him what you had to say to me about the kaunian wench named vanai and about the way his precious son ealstan had been panting after her for years i also told him she was an algarvian officers plaything in oyngestun he only shrugged and said he didnt know anything about it he said he hadnt heard a word from ealstan since the day you got hit in the head however that happened and the selfrighteous little brat disappeared however that happened i dont believe him but you know hestan too well the same as i do he never tells his face what he is thinking a lot of people think he is clever just because they dont know whats going on inside his head and he may even be clever but he is not as smart as he thinks he is ha thats the truth by the powers above sidroc said as if his father were standing there beside him i am afraid i will never be able to get to the bottom of this by myself the letter went on maybe i will see if the algarvians are interested in getting to the bottom of it for me hestan is my own flesh and blood but that gets hard to remember after all the names hes called me since things went sour between you and his sons you are everything i have left stay safe stay warm be brave i know you will love your father powers below eat uncle hestan sidroc muttered powers below eat ealstan too hed always suck up to the schoolmasters and id get the stripes whos it from sidroc sergeant werferth asked anything juicy in it the soldiers who got letters from sweethearts often read out the livelier bits to amuse their comrades but sidroc shook his head not a thing its just from my old man well is he getting any ceorl demanded sidroc shook his head again and put the letter in his belt pouch ceorl looked to be about to say something else sergeant werferth set him to gathering more wood to throw on the fire werferth knew sidroc and ceorl had no love lost between them he did his best not to give them any chance to quarrel halt who goes there the sentry called again i have the honor to be captain baiardo another algarvian answered do you have the honor to be the men of plegmundos no plegmunds brigade aye the sentry answered advance and be recognized sir sidroc turned to sergeant werferth too bad they wouldnt let you keep the company sergeant youve done as well with it as any of the redhead officers they put over us thanks werferth shrugged what can you do they give the orders but baiardo when he came up to the fire proved not to be the new company commander along with his rank badges he wore that of a mage he was an officer by courtesy not by blood and it took a lot of courtesy to reckon him an officer he looked like an unmade bed whos in charge here he asked peering from one forthwegian to another the men of plegmunds brigade wore their own kingdoms markings of rank sergeant werferths single chevrons couldnt have meant anything to baiardo i am sir werferth said resignedly what do you want i need a volunteer baiardo said silence fell on the forthwegians they had seen plenty to teach them that the war was bad enough when they did what they had to do doing more than they had to do only made it worse baiardo looked expectantly from one soldier to the next maybe he hadnt seen all that much himself nobody could tell him no not straight out he was an algarvian and an officer well an officer of sorts to boot at last sergeant werferth pointed to sidroc and said hell do whatever you need sir splendid baiardo clapped his hands in what looked like real delight sidroc thought it anything but splendid he glared at baiardo and werferth in turn glaring of course was all he could do whatever happened to him would be better than what hed get for disobeying an order with a sigh he asked the algarvian mage what do you need from me sir if baiardo noticed his reluctance he didnt let it show here he unslung his pack and handed it to sidroc carry this come with me hes arrogant enough to make a proper algarvian sidroc thought the pack might have been stuffed with lead he carried it and his own pack and his stick and followed baiardo away from the fire the mage blithely strode southwest after a little while sidroc said sir if you keep going youll see the unkerlanters closer than you ever wanted to their lines are close baiardo sounded as if that hadnt occurred to him you might say so aye sidroc answered dryly baiardo clapped his hands again powers above keep quiet sidroc hissed are you trying to get both of us killed as far as he was concerned baiardo was welcome to do himself in but sidroc resented being included in his suicide but the mage shook his head and said no set down the pack an order sidroc was glad to obey baiardo took from the heavy pack a laurel leaf of the sort often used in forthwegian cookery and a small dazzlingly bright opal he wrapped the stone in the leaf and chanted first in algarvian then in classical kaunian sidroc stared for the mages outline grew hazy indistinct at last baiardo almost disappeared stay here he told sidroc wait for me still in that wraithlike state he started for the unkerlanters line how long do i wait sidroc wondered baiardo wasnt fully invisible if swemmels soldiers were alert they would spot him if they did sidroc was liable to have a very long wait indeed muttering a curse under his breath he started digging a hole he felt naked on the unkerlanter plain without one the dirt he dug up made a breastwork in front of his scrape it wouldnt protect him if a regiment of unkerlanters came roaring after baiardo but it might keep a sniper from parting his hair with a beam hed just scrambled down into the hole when a voice spoke out of thin air behind him we can go back now he whirled and there stood baiardo as haggard and unkempt as ever putting the laurel leaf and the opal back into his pack the mage added i got what i came for and you almost got blazed before you could deliver it whatever it was you cursed fool sidroc said angrily dont you have any sense at all baiardo gave that serious consideration i doubt it he said at last it doesnt always help in my business they trudged back toward the fire baiardo pleased with himself sidroc still a little maybe more than a little twitchy the mage he noticed had sense enough not to carry his own pack when he didnt have to he left that to sidroc welcome back people kept telling fernao in kuusaman and in classical kaunian some of them added how well you are moving thank you fernao said over and over the mages and the cooks and maids in the hostel in the naantali district were just being polite and he knew it he would never move well again not as long as he lived maybe he was moving a little better than he had when he went off to setubal maybe he remained imperfectly convinced ilmarinen helped him put things in perspective the master mage patted him on the back and said well after so much time off in that miserable little noaccount excuse for a city you must be glad to come back here to a place where interesting things are happening his classical kaunian was so fast and colloquial so much like a living language in his mouth that at first fernao thought he meant the naantali district was the sleepy place and setubal the one where things happened when he realized ilmarinen had said the opposite he laughed out loud you always have that knack for turning things upside down he told the kuusaman mage his own kaunian remained formal a language he could use but not one in which he felt at home i dont know what youre talking about ilmarinen answered i always speak plain sense is it my fault the rest of the world isnt ready to see it most of the time pekka came into the dining room in time to hear that a madmans ravings always seem sensible to him she remarked not without affection ilmarinen snorted and waved to a serving woman a mug of ale linna he called before turning back to pekka you sound as if sense were sensible in magecraft a thing has to work it doesnt have to be sensible oh nonsense fernao said otherwise theoretical sorcery would be a dry well a lot of the time it is ilmarinen retorted reveling in his heresy a lot of the time what we do is figure out after the fact why an experiment that had no business working did work in spite of what we wrongly thought we knew he waved if that werent so what would we all be doing here fernao hesitated ilmarinen enjoyed tossing eggs into a conversation but being outrageous wasnt necessarily the same as being wrong pekka now wagged a finger under ilmarinens nose as if he were a naughty little boy we can also go from pure theory to practical sorcery if that isnt sense what is it luck ilmarinen answered and speaking of luck linna came up with the mug of ale here it is now thank you sweetheart he bowed to the serving girl he hadnt given up chasing her or maybe he had while fernao was away and then started up again you never could tell with ilmarinen linna went off without a backwards glance plainly the next time ilmarinen caught her would be the first whatever else fernao couldnt tell about the master mage that was glaringly obvious ilmarinen took a long pull at the ale curse king mezentio he ground out curse him and all his clever mages now the rest of the world has to deal with the question of how in blazes to beat him without being as vile as he is king swemmel worries about that not at all fernao pointed out which only prompted ilmarinen to make a horrible face at him we are still fighting king mezentio too and we have resorted to none of his barbarism pekka said primly ilmarinen got down to the bottom of his mug and smacked it down on the table almost hard enough to shatter it he said weve also got the luxury of the strait of valmiera between us and the worst mezentio can do the unkerlanters poor buggers dont whatll we do when weve got big armies in the field against algarve a good deal of the answer to that depends on whether we succeed here would you not agree fernao said pekka nodded she agreed at any rate but ilmarinen contrary as usual said suppose we fail here sooner or later well still have big armies in the field against the algarvians sure as mezentios got a pointy nose theyll start killing kaunians to try to stop us what do we do then that was a large important question the only time the lagoans and kuusamans had had a large army in the field against algarve after mezentios men unveiled their murderous magic was down in the land of the ice people sure as sure the algarvians had tried to turn back their foes by butchering blonds but the magic had gone wrong there on the austral continent it had come down on the algarvians heads not those of their foes that wouldnt happen on the mainland of derlavai too many massacres had proved as much pekka said we cannot match them in murder that is the best argument i know for mastering them with magecraft suppose we fail ilmarinen repeated well be fighting mezentios men even so what do we do when they start killing we had better think about that you know i dont mean us here alone but also the seven here and king vitor and his counselors in that small town of yours fernao the day is coming weve all heard the name habakkuk no use pretending we havent i have heard the name but i do not know what it means fernao said my husband works with habakkuk and i do not know what he does pekka added i do not ask any more than he asks me what i do you are the soul of virtue ilmarinens voice was sour well i know because i have no virtue save perhaps that of thinking backwards and upside down i will spare your tender virgin ears the details but i trust i do not shock you when i say habakkuk isnt intended to make mezentio sleep easier of nights if mezentio can sleep at all after the things he has done his conscience is made of cast iron fernao said and doubtless he can so doubtless it is all right then ilmarinen took his usual pleasure in making himself as difficult as possible thanks to habakkuk among other things we come to grips with algarve on land mezentios mages kill kaunians to throw us back what comes next there are blocking spells fernao said if you and siuntio had not used them then we probably would not be here to have this discussion aye they helped some ilmarinen answered how would you like to be a foolish young man more balls than brains trying to kill other foolish young men in a different uniform with your mages helping you with a spell that leaks as much as it shields before very long wouldnt you sooner take after them than after the enemy soldiers i would and i wouldnt take long to get there either master ilmarinen you have just shown why we so badly have to succeed pekka said no the master mage shook his head ive shown why we so badly need to succeed but have to he shook his head again life does not come with a guarantee except that it will end what i tried to show you was that wed better find some answers somewhere else in case we dont find them here but you dont want to listen to that and so he got to his feet gave fernao and pekka nicely matched mocking bows and departed i am always so grateful for such encouragement pekka said as am i fernao agreed he made as if to rise and follow ilmarinen and now if you will excuse me i think i shall go back to my room and slit my wrists pekka stared at him then laughed when she realized he was joking be careful with what you say she warned i took you seriously for a moment he asks interesting questions does he not fernao said if he were as interested in answering them as he is in asking them he shrugged if that were so he would not be ilmarinen no he would come closer to being siuntio pekka said and siuntio is the mage we need most right now every day without him proves that her hands folded into fists powers below eat the algarvians curse their magic fernao nodded but the question ilmarinen had posed kept rattling around in his mind whether he wanted it to or not if we fail here how do our kingdoms beat the algarvians without sinking into the swamp that has already taken them i do not know pekka said if we do sink down into the swamp with the algarvians does it matter in the end whether we win or lose to us aye it matters fernao held up a hand to show he hadnt finished and to keep pekka from arguing to the world it probably does not pekka pondered that then slowly nodded if algarve beats unkerlant we have mezentios minions eyeing us from across the strait of valmiera and if unkerlant beats algarve we have swemmels minions eyeing us instead but the one set would not be much different from the other would it the algarvians would tell you more about the differences than you would ever want to hear fernao answered so would the unkerlanters my opinion is that they would not matter much i think you are right pekka said you see through the show to the essential that is what makes you a good mage thank you fernao said praise from the praiseworthy is praise indeed that was a proverb in classical kaunian he brought it out as if hed thought of it on the spur of the moment kuusamans were swarthy he couldnt be sure whether pekka blushed but by the way she murmured you do me too much honor he judged hed succeeded in embarrassing her he didnt mind he wanted her to know he thought well of her even more he wanted her to think well of him he wished he could come right out and say that he knew he would ruin everything if he did he sighed both because of that and for other reasons one way or another he said the world will not be the same after this war ends pekka thought about that then shook her head no one way and another the world will not be the same after this war ends we are changing too many things ever to be the same again true enough fernao said too true if anything he waved in the direction of the blockhouse if all goes well we help set the tone of the changes that is no small privilege that is no small responsibility pekka sighed i wish it were not on my shoulders but what we wish for and what we get are not always the same i know that i can deal with the world the way it is no matter how much i wish it were otherwise fernao inclined his head to her we are lucky to have such a leader part of that was flattery a larger part was anything but if we were lucky we would still have siuntio pekka answered whenever we run into trouble i ask myself how he might fix it i hope i am right more often than i am wrong you could do worse fernao said i know pekka said bleakly and one of these days i probably will try as he would fernao found no flattering answer for that when istvan looked up at the night sky from the island of becsehely he had no trouble seeing the stars the didnt glitter so brilliantly as they did in the clear cold air of his own mountain valley but they were there from horizon to horizon it almost seems strange he remarked to szonyi after so long in the accursed woods of western unkerlant id got used to seeing a star here a star there but most of them blotted out by branches overhead aye szonyis fingers writhed in a sign to avert evil me too no wonder i felt forsaken by the stars while i was there no wonder at all some of istvans shiver had to do with the night air which was moist and chilly more sprang from dread and loathing of the forest he and his companions had finally escaped there are places in those woods that no star saw for years at a time cant say that here szonyis waved encompassed all of becsehely not that there was a whole lot to encompass its not much like obuda is it before we got to this place i always thought well an island is an island you know what i mean but it doesnt look like it works that way the gold frame to captain kuns spectacles glittered in the firelight as he turned his head toward szonyi after you had one woman he asked did you think all women were the same too he probably wanted to anger szonyi but the big trooper just laughed and said after my first one aye of course i did i found out different pretty fast now im finding out different about islands too hes got you there kun istvan said with a laugh i suppose so if youre daft enough to assume one island is like another to begin with kun answered enough istvan put a sergeants snap in his voice lets hope this island wont be anything like obuda lets hope and lets make sure we dont lose it to the stinking kuusamans the way we lost obuda he peered west through the darkness as if expecting to spot a fleet of kuusaman leyline cruisers and patrol boats and transports and dragon haulers bearing down on becsehely gyongyos had lost a good many islands besides obuda to kuusamo this past year ekrekek arpad had vowed to the stars that the warrior race would lose no more i am the instrument of arpads vow istvan thought an instrument of his vow anyway in the forests of unkerlant hed often feared that the ekrekek had joined the stars in forsaking him here by contrast he felt as if he were serving under his sovereigns eye after a while he wrapped himself in a blanket and slept when he woke he wondered if ekrekek arpad had blinked a thick fog covered becsehely all the kuusaman ships in the world could have sailed past half a mile offshore and he never would have known it more fog streamed from his nose and mouth every time he exhaled when he inhaled he could taste the sea almost as readily as if he were a fish swimming in it not far away a bell began ringing istvans stomach rumbled follow your ears boys he told the troopers in his squad try not to break your necks before you get there his boots scrunched on gravel and squelched through mud as he made his own way toward the bell the fog muffled his footsteps it muffled the bell too and the endless slap of the sea on the beach perhaps a quarter of a mile away becsehely was low and flat had it not lain along a ley line it wouldnt have been worth visiting at all but then as far as istvan was concerned the same held true for every island in the bothnian ocean there was the cookfire and there was a queue of men with mess kits istvan took his place in it the man in front of him turned and said good morning sergeant oh istvan said good morning captain frigyes im sorry sir a man wouldnt know his own mother in this fog cant argue with you there his company commander replied youd almost think the kuusamans magicked it up on purpose sir istvan said in some alarm you dont suppose frigyes shook his head no i dont suppose that our mages would be screaming their heads off were it so they arent that means it isnt istvan considered aye that makes sense he peered out into the fog with new suspicion just the same a boredlooking cook filled his mess tin with a stew of millet and lentils and bits of fish he ate methodically then went down to the beach and washed the tin in the ocean becsehely boasted only a handful of springs fresh water was too precious to waste on washing toward midmorning the fog lifted the sky remained gray so did the sea becsehely seemed gray too most of the gravel was that color and the grass and bushes fading in the fall were more yellowish gray than green an observation tower stood on the high ground such as it was at the center of the island sentries with spyglasses swept the horizon not that they would have done much good in the swaddling fog but dowsers and other mages stood by to warn against trouble then istvan hoped whatever warning they might give would be enough a dragon flapped into the air from the farm beyond the tower istvan expected it to vanish into the clouds but it didnt it flew in a wide spiral below them one more sentry to spy out the kuusamans before they drew too close to becsehely sentries were all very well but istvan turned to captain frigyes and said i wish we had more dragons on this starsforsaken island sir well sergeant so do i when you get right down to it frigyes answered but becsehely doesnt have enough growing on it to support much in the way of cattle or pigs or even he made a revolted face goats that means we have to ship in meat for the dragons same as we have to bring in food for us we can only afford so many of the miserable beasts miserable is right istvan remembered unpleasant days on obuda mucking out dragon farms with a frown he went on the stinking kuusamans bring whole shiploads of dragons with em wherever they go i know that we all know that much too well in fact frigyes said its one of the reasons theyve given us so much trouble in the islands well be able to do it ourselves before too long thatd be about time sir istvan said well be able to do it before too long was a phrase that had got a lot of gyongyosian soldiers killed before their time we are a warrior race frigyes said disapproval strong in his voice we shall prevail aye sir istvan answered he couldnt very well say anything else not without denying gyongyos heritage but hed seen over and over again on obuda and in the woods of western unkerlant that warrior virtues however admirable could be overcome by sound strategy or strong sorcery despite the tower despite the dragons despite the dowsers no one on becsehely spied the approaching kuusaman flotilla till it launched its dragons at the island mist and rain clung to becsehely thwarting the men with the spyglass thwarting the dragonfliers and even thwarting the dowsers who had to try to detect the motion of ships through the motions of millions of falling raindrops dowsers had techniques for noting one kind of motion while screening out others maybe the kuusamans had techniques for making ships seem more like rain whatever the explanation the first thing the garrison knew of the flotilla was eggs falling out of the sky and bursting all over the island the observation tower went down in ruin when a lucky hit smashed its supports more eggs burst near the dragon farm but the dragonfliers got at least some of their beasts into the air to challenge the kuusamans frigyes whistle wailed through the din to the beach he yelled stand by to repel invaders come on you lugs istvan shouted to his squad if they dont make it ashore they cant hurt us right more eggs burst close by making all the gyongyosians dive for holes in the ground as dirt pattered down on them szonyi said who says they cant come on istvan repeated and they were up and running again he and kun and szonyi too had spent a lot of time harping on how important it was to keep the kuusamans from landing he knew a certain amount of pride that the rest of the squad took them seriously everybody loved the stars but no one wanted them to take and cherish his spirit right then the kuusaman dragons had already given the trenches by the beach a pretty good pounding istvan wasnt fussy any hole in the ground whether a proper trench or the crater left by a bursting egg would do fine he jumped down into one then peered out again wondering how close the invasion fleet was and what sort of defending vessels gyongyos had in these waters he remembered only too well how the kuusamans had fought their way onto the beaches of obuda he spied no enemy ships gliding along the ley line toward becsehely no landing boats leaving larger ships and approaching the island on a broad front propelled by sails or oars corporal kun saw or rather didnt see the same thing and spoke with some relief just a raid from their dragon haulers aye istvan sounded relieved too the dragons might kill him but without landing boats in the water there wasnt the certainty of a lifeanddeath struggle for the island sooner or later the accursed beasts would fly back to the ships that had brought them and the raid would end demon of a lot of dragons overhead for just a raid kun said that was also true istvan shrugged they must have brought more of those ships along than usual arent we lucky and then they were lucky for one of the heavy sticks mounted on becsehely blazed a kuusaman dragon out of the sky it fell into the sea just offshore and thrashed out its death agony there painted pale blue and light green it might almost have been a sea creature itself if its dragonflier hadnt been dead when it smashed down its writhings would surely have crushed him eventually a soldier managed to blaze the dragon through one of its great glaring eyes it shuddered and lay still a moment later another dragon plunged into the sea and then one onto the stony soil of the island behind istvan he shook his fist in triumph by the stars nothings going to come cheap for the stinking kuusamans here the foe must have decided the same thing for the dragons flew off toward the west only later did istvan pause to wonder whether becsehely was worth having for anybody at all talsu walked through the streets of skrunda thinking about spells of undoing there had to be a way to get more out of them than hed yet seen he was convinced of that but he wasnt yet sure what it might be a newssheet vendor waved a leaf of paper at him gyongyos crushes kuusaman air pirates the fellow called read the whole exciting story instead of answering talsu just kept walking if hed said no the vendor would have done his best to turn it into an argument hoping to entice him to buy the news sheet that way but silence gave the fellow nothing to grip he glared at talsu talsu ignored that too as soon as he turned a corner though he cursed under his breath the vendor had made him fall away from the ley line his thought had been following whatever the answer hed sought he wouldnt find it right away fine silversmithing by kugu a shopfront sign said and then below in smaller letters jewelry made and repaired custom flatware pots amp bowls our specialty the shop was closed pestholes and betrayals our specialty talsu muttered under his breath he wanted to let his face show exactly what he thought of the silversmith but he couldnt even do that because he was meeting kugu for supper at an eatery that should be he brightened there it is hed walked past the dragon inn any number of times hed never gone inside not till now it came as close to being a fine eatery as any place skrunda boasted his nostrils twitched at the smell of roasting meat as he opened the door he didnt suppose the inn cooked with a real dragon stoves and grills surely gave better to say nothing of safer results but food and flame did come together here his belly rumbled he didnt eat much meat back home as if by sorcery a waiter appeared at his elbow may i help you sir the tone was polite but wary he got the feeling hed be out on the street in a hurry if the fellow didnt like his answer but the waiter relaxed when he said im dining with master kugu ah of course come with me then if youd be so kind the gentleman is waiting for you the waiter led him to a booth in the back where kugu did indeed sit waiting with a bow the fellow said enjoy your meal sir and vanished as suddenly as hed appeared kugu rose and clasped talsus hand good of you to join me he murmured let me pour you some wine he did then raised his goblet in salute your very good health thanks and yours with straightfaced hypocrisy talsu drank his eyebrows rose he didnt get to enjoy wine like this at home a fullbodied vintage with just a touch of lime to give it the tartness jelgavans craved he thought he could get tiddly on the bouquet alone order whatever suits your fancy its my pleasure kugu said the leg of mutton is very fine if you care for it they dont stint the garlic that sounds good talsu agreed and he did choose it when the waiter came back with an inquiring look on his face so did kugu talsu had all he could do not to gape like a fool when his supper arrived aye that much meat could have fed his father and mother and sister and wife and him to boot for a couple of days or so he thought it was tender as lamb but far more flavorful it seemed to melt off the bone in an amazingly short time nothing but that bone remained on the plate i trust that met with your approval kugu asked as the waiter carried the plate away the silversmith had also demolished his supper talsu nodded he was too full to speak but he discovered he still had room for the brandied cherries the man brought back they were potent after only three or four his eyes started to cross kugu ate them too but they didnt look to bother him he said shall we get down to business aye we might as well talsu agreed he would have agreed to anything about then regardless of how he felt about the silversmith kugus smile reached his mouth but not his eyes you alarmed the occupying authorities you know how could i have done that talsu asked powers above i was in a dungeon i was about as alarming as a mouse in a trap mice dont write denunciations kugu said patiently as if hed had nothing to do with talsus ending up in a dungeon you named people the algarvians thought were safe they did some checking and found out that some of those people werent so safe after all do you wonder that they started worrying talsu shrugged if id told them a pack of lies id still be in that miserable place and i remember who put me there aye i remember i understand that the silversmith said more patiently still but when they found out theyd trusted some of the wrong people they started checking everybody theyd trusted they even checked me if you can imagine talsu didnt trust himself to say anything to that any reply he gave would have sounded sardonic and he didnt dare make kugu any more suspicious than he was already he sat there and waited kugu nodded as if acknowledging a clever ploy he went on and so you see we have to show we can work together then the algarvians will know they can trust both of us thats something they need to know theres a lot of treason in this kingdom he spoke very earnestly as if he meant treason against jelgava rather than treason against her occupiers maybe he confused the two maybe talsu had come closer to getting him in serious trouble than hed thought possible too he hoped so he wanted kugu in serious trouble however it happened he wasnt the least bit fussy about that what have you got in mind he asked kugu returned a question for a question do you know zverinu the banker i know of him who doesnt talsu answered he didnt point out how unlikely it was for a tailors son to have made the acquaintance of probably the richest man in skrunda that will do kugu said maybe he really did know zverinu talsu had seen that he knew some surprising people for now he went on if we both denounce him a few days apart the algarvians are bound to haul him in that will make us look good in their eyes itll make us look busy if you know what i mean has he done anything that needs denouncing talsu asked if kugu said aye he would find some excuse not to do anything of the sort but the silversmith only shrugged as talsu had a while before who knows by the time the algarvians are done digging though theyll find something you can bet on that talsu abruptly wondered if hed be sick all over the table in front of him this was fouler than anything hed imagined it felt like wading in sewage worse still was being unable to show what he thought he spoke carefully the algarvians are liable to know i dont know anything about zverinu not if you phrase the denunciation the right way kugu taught treason with the same methodical thoroughness he gave classical kaunian you can say you heard him on the street or in the market square or any place where you could both plausibly be you can even say you had to ask somebody who he was thats a nice touch in fact it makes things feel real ill see what i can come up with talsu gulped the fine wine kugu was buying that first denunciation had got him out of the dungeon but it hadnt got him out of trouble if anything it had got him in deeper all right kugu emptied his own goblet dont take too long though theyre keeping an eye on both of us its a hard cold world and a man has to get along as best he can a man has to get along as best he can talsu had lived by that rule in the army the idea of living by it to the extent of turning against his own kingdom filled him with loathing but all he said was aye here he was getting along with kugu as best he could till he found some way to pay back the silversmith kugu set coins on the table some with king donalitus image more with that of king mainardo the younger brother of king mezentio if nothing else talsu had made him spend a good deal of his or perhaps algarves money that wasnt so bad but it wasnt enough not nearly in the cool evening twilight outside the eatery kugu asked do you want to lead off with your denunciation or shall i go first you go ahead talsu answered yours will be better than mine its bound to be so mine can add on to what youve already said the longer he delayed the more time he had to come up with something to undo kugu but the silversmith took talsus flattery if that was what it was as no more than his due nodding he said i give my language lessons tomorrow ill work on mine over the next couple of days after that and turn it in that gives you plenty of time to get something ready all right talsu said though it wasnt id better get back before curfew catches me before long you wont need to worry about that kugu said people will know who you are confident as if he were a redhead he strode away so did talsu less confidently he was thinking furiously as he went back to his fathers tailors shop and his room above it he kept right on thinking furiously all the next day he was thinking so hard he wasnt worth much at work traku scolded him how many times are you going to use the undo spell son the idea is to get it right the first time not to see how many different kinds of mistake you can fix im sorry talsu didnt like lying to his father but he didnt know what else to do he wanted to see just how many things he could undo and in how many ways his father and his mother and his sister and gailisa all squawked at him when he went out that night but he did a good job of pretending to be deaf he also did a good job of evading patrols as he made his way to kugus house skrunda was his town in the mandatory darkness of night he knew how to disappear he didnt knock on kugus door he waited across the street hidden in a deeper shadow several language students went in they didnt see him any more than the algarvian constables had he lurked there till he was sure kugu would be immersed in his classical kaunian lesson and then very quietly he began to chant odds are im wasting my time he thought undoing spells were funny business could he make what worked with cloth work on a man too hed twiddled up a spell as best he knew how but he knew he didnt know much could he really undo kugus mask of virtue and patriotism and make him reveal himself to the men he taught for what he really was even if he could would he ever know hed done it might he have to write his denunciation even if he succeeded he hadnt known if he would get answers to any of those questions but he got answers to all of them and in short order too without warning furious shouts and screams from inside kugus house shattered the stillness of the night crashes and thuds followed immediately thereafter the front door flew open the silversmiths students fled into the night talsu slipped away too still unseen he wondered how by word or deed hed made kugu betray himself he would never know and it didnt matter but he still wondered when he got back home he found his whole family waiting anxiously for him he grinned greeted them with two words hes undone and laughed loud and long the crystallomancer nodded to rathar go ahead lord marshal his majesty awaits you so i see rathar said king swemmels pale longfaced image peered out of the crystal at him he took a deep breath and went on your majesty as i greet you i stand on the soil of the duchy of grelz ah the kings eyes glittered we are pleased to hear that marshal aye we are very pleased indeed rathar bowed so i hoped and the algarvians continue to fall back before us he might as well not have spoken for the king talked right through him we would have been better pleased still though had grelz never fallen to the invader in the first place so would i your majesty that was true even if rathar knew how lucky unkerlant was to have survived the first dreadful year of fighting against the redheads your armies are doing their best to make amends aye the king sounded as if that best were not nearly good enough but then he brightened inside grelz he murmured at least half to himself the time comes for a great burning and boiling and flaying of traitors as you say your majesty rathar knew there were traitors aplenty in grelz his men had already run up against grelzer soldiers men of good unkerlanter blood wearing dark green tunics and fighting for raniero the algarvian puppet king some of those companies and battalions broke and fled when the first eggs burst near them some fought his men harder and with more grim determination than any algarvians that was what swemmels reign had sown and what it now reaped if swemmel himself realized as much he gave no sign of it carry on then marshal he said purify the land purify it with fire and water and sweetedged steel before rathar could answer the kings image disappeared the crystal flared and then became nothing but an inert globe of glass do you require any other connections lord marshal the crystallomancer asked what rathar said absently then he shook his head no not right now he took his umbrella and left the ruined house where the crystallomancer had set up shop rain thrummed on the umbrellas canvas when he stepped outside his boots squelched in mud two years before the fall rains and mud had slowed mezentios men on their drive toward cottbus now they slowed the unkerlanters in their assault on the invaders rain and mud were impartial curse them rathar thought squelching again every house in this village was wrecked to a greater or lesser degree the algarvians had fought hard to hold the place before sullenly stubbornly withdrawing curse them too rathar thought nothing in this summers drive toward the east had been easy the redheads never had enough men or behemoths or dragons to halt his men for long but they always knew what to do with the ones they had despite the rain the stench of death was strong here eggs burst somewhere not far away no the redheads hadnt given up nor the grelzers they led either if they could stop the unkerlanters they would and if they couldnt they would make king swemmels soldiers pay the highest possible price for going forward hed seen that too urra a peasant shouted as rathar walked down the street toward what had probably been the firstmans house rathar nodded at him and went on the peasant was grayhaired and limped maybe hed been wounded in the six years war that might keep swemmels impressers from hauling him into the army once the front moved a little farther east the younger haler men in the village though those of them that were left would probably be wearing rockgray and carrying sticks before long those of them that were left a sour expression on his face rathar surveyed the village aye it had been fought over but hed been through plenty of other villages that had been fought over once the fighting was over the peasants came back from wherever theyd been hiding and got on with their lives here in grelz a lot of them didnt a lot of them fled east with the retreating algarvians hed seen some of that before in lands to the south and west hed never seen it to the degree he was seeing it here however how bad would it be if the algarvians had set up a local noble as king and not king mezentios first cousin he wondered no way to know of course but he suspected it would have been a good deal worse as things were a lot of grelzers still remained loyal to the throne of unkerlant had they had one of their own set above them not some foreign overlord algarvians were arrogant it was their worst failing they hadnt thought they would need to worry about how the grelzers felt and so raniero got to wear a fancy crown and call himself king and plenty of men who might have put up with a grelzer puppet went into the woods and fought for swemmel rathar stomped on over to the firstmans house scraping mud from his boots off against the doorsill general vatran looked up from a mug of tea fortified tea for rathars nose caught the tang of spirits well vatran asked i trust his majesty was pleased to learn where we are aye so he was rathar agreed much easier to explain advances than retreats by the powers above i believe it vatran lifted his mug in salute may we have many more advances to explain then that would be very fine rathar raised his voice a little ysolt can i get a mug of tea too and a good slug of whatever vatran poured into it coming up lord marshal the headquarters cook had been plucking a chicken now she went over to the brass kettle hanging above the fire and poured tea for rathar as she brought it to him she went on youll have to pry the brandy out of the general thats his not ours she went back to the bird rolling her formidable haunches as she walked rathar held out the mug to vatran how about it general vatran undid the flask he wore on his belt here you go lord marshal if this doesnt make your eyes open wide youre dead rathar undid the stopper sniffed and then coughed thats strong all right he poured some into the tea and handed the flask back to general vatran with caution exaggerated enough to make vatran laugh he raised the mug to his lips ahh he said well youre right thats the straight goods you bet it is itll put hair on your chest vatran pulled open the neck of his tunic and peered down at himself works for me anyway rathar knew vatran had a thick thatch of white hair there most unkerlanter men were pretty hairy of course most unkerlanter men drank a good deal too maybe the one had something to do with the other vatran said all right now that were inside grelz what does the king want us to do next purify the land he said rathar answered and took another sip of tea he coughed again pouring these spirits over it ought to do the trick there while vatran laughed once more the marshal went on past that he didnt give any detailed orders good vatran murmured but only after glancing around to make sure ysolt was out of earshot rathar nodded he hated nothing worse than swemmels trying to direct the campaign from cottbus the king often couldnt resist sticking his oar in but he usually made things worse not better in more normal tones vatran asked what have you got in mind then i want to strike for herborn rathar said that made vatrans bushy white eyebrows fly up toward his hairline rathar had been sure it would which was one of the reasons he hadnt mentioned it till now during the fall mudtime lord marshal vatran said do you really think weve got a chance of bringing it off i do by the powers above rathar answered and one of the reasons i do is that the algarvians wont think wed dare try were better in the mud the same as were better in the snow we have to be we deal with them every year if we can crack the crust and get a couple of columns moving fast we can cut off a lot of redheads thats the game they like to play against us vatran said its a good game rathar said and ill tell you something else too its a lot more fun when youre on the giving end than when youve got to take it thats the truth vatran boomed getting our own back feels pretty cursed good bugger me if it doesnt but speaking of buggers what about the grelzers theyre flesh of our flesh bone of our bone they know what to do in mud and snow even if mezentios men dont rathar cursed youre right he said reluctantly but i still think we can do it from everything weve seen the grelzers are just footsoldiers theyre light on horses and unicorns they havent got any behemoths the scouts have seen and they havent got much in the way of eggtossers the redheads have been using em to hold down the countryside not to do any real fighting send general gurmun through em with a column of behemoths and theyll shatter like glass heres hoping vatran rubbed his chin considering it could be i suppose youre really going to try it aye im really going to try it even if it doesnt go the way we hope it will the algarvians cant knock us back very far rathar cocked his head to one side in some astonishment listening to what hed just said vatrans face bore a bemused look too you know i think you may be right he said thats what the cursed redheads were saying about us a couple of years ago i know rathar said they turned out to be wrong we have to keep hammering them thats the best hope weve got of turning out to be right he nodded to himself sure enough im going for herborn command me then lord marshal vatran said if youve got the stomach for pushing forward even through mud ill help you ram the knife home good rathar told him ill need all the help i can he broke off and turned toward the front door through which a panting young lieutenant of crystallomancers had just come hello whats this about lord marshal the young officer saluted were getting reports from the front that the algarvians have started pulling some of their units out of the line and taking them back to the east what rathar exclaimed why in blazes are they doing that have they forgotten theyre still fighting us i dont know why sir the crystallomancer said i just know whats reported to me well whatever the reason rathar smacked his fist into the palm of his other hand whatever the reason well make em pay for it seventeen come on my beauty cornelu urged his leviathan forward as if he were urging a lover into his bedchamber come on my sweet he stroked he caressed he cajoled trying to get every bit of speed he could out of the beast and the leviathan gave him everything he asked which was more than he could say about janira back in setubal on it swam toward sibiu toward if the powers above proved kind a return from exile after close to three and a half bitter years this time he murmured this time i wont swim up onto tirgoviste because i had my mount killed out from under me this time this time he caressed the words too if the powers above be kind im coming home to a free kingdom a freed kingdom anyhow he ordered the leviathan up into a tailstand so he could see farther there straight ahead lay sigisoara the easternmost of sibius five main islands he wished hed been ordered to tirgoviste but his wishes counted for nothing in the eyes of the lagoan admiralty and there coming along every ley line that bore on the islands of sibiu from east southeast and south glided perhaps the largest fleet the world had ever seen sibian and kuusaman warships of every size shepherding transports full of soldiers cornelus was but one of a pod of leviathans helping to protect both the transports and the warships and there overhead also warding the grand fleet from algarvian attack flew the greatest swarm of dragons cornelu had ever seen he didnt know how it measured in the historical scheme of things he did know hed never seen so many dragons accompanying a naval expedition he couldnt imagine how the lagoans and kuusamans had got so many of the huge fractious beasts aboard ship all at once as if drawn by a lodestone his head swung to the left toward the south he stroked the leviathan commanding it to stay up on its tail longer so he could get a better look at first his hand went to the rubber pouch he wore on his belt he intended to get out his crystal and scream a warning to the fleet of all things the ships didnt need a great drifting iceberg in their midst was among the worst after a moment though he realized the iceberg wasnt drifting instead it glided east along the ley line under at least as much control as a cruiser its upper surface wasnt sharp and jagged as it would have been in nature but low and smooth and flat even as cornelu watched a dragon landed on the ice and two more both painted in lagoan scarlet and gold took off a chunk of ice that size could carry a lot of dragons aye and their handlers too for a couple of heartbeats cornelu simply gaped at that then he remembered a name hed heard on his journey down to the mages base at the eastern edge of the land of the ice people habakkuk he exclaimed he didnt know that that name went with the icebergturneddragonhauler but it struck him as a good bet what else but ice would those mages have been working on down there on the austral continent he still had no idea why theyd had him bring egg casings full of sawdust to their base if i ever see one of them again ill have to ask he thought right now he had more urgent things to worry about he let his leviathan slide back down into the sea which it did with an indignant wriggle that told him it thought hed made it stand on its tail far too long i am sorry he told it you dont understand how strange that iceberg is the leviathan wriggled again as if to say an iceberg is an iceberg what else can it be up till hed seen this one cornelu would have thought the same thing now he saw that the question had a different answer but it wasnt one he could explain to his mount with a snap of its toothy jaws the leviathan gulped down a squid as long as his arm then it swam on did it think cornelu had arranged the treat he didnt know it couldnt tell him but it didnt complain when a few minutes later he ordered it to lift its head and him high out of the water again sigisoara island was closer now close enough to let him see flashes of light and puffs of smoke as eggs burst near its south and eastfacing beaches boatloads of kuusaman and lagoan soldiers were leaving the transports and making for those beaches cornelu yelled himself hoarse as the leviathan sank back into the sea tears stung his eyes tears that felt more astringent than the endless miles of salt water all around at last he murmured by the powers above at last he wished the sibians could have freed themselves that failing having others even having lagoans restore their freedom struck him as good enough he shook a fist to the northwest in the direction of trapani take that mezentio he thought aye take that and more besides here and there eggs burst among the oncoming boats some of the algarvians still on sibiu were trying to give rather than take an algarvian dragon swooped down on a landing boat flamed all the lagoans in it and left it burning on the water a couple of kuusaman dragons drove the enemy beast away but too late too late still mezentios men werent putting up much of a fight more than a year and a half before cornelu had been part of the force that raided sibiu to distract the algarvians while another fleet carried a lagoan army to the land of the ice people then the enemy had hit back hard had that raid been an invasion it would have failed miserably now now the algarvians didnt seem to have so much with which to strike the invaders cornelu had seen as much on his last trip to sibiu on leviathanback his laugh was hard and cold thats what you get for taking on unkerlant he said and laughed again algarve had been recruiting sibians to help fight its battles when he was there he supposed they would mostly have gone to unkerlant too the fools how many of them crouched low in holes in the ground along with their algarvian overlords looking at vengeance here out on the ocean however many traitors there were cornelu wished he could kill them all himself since he couldnt he hoped the dragons overhead the eggs tossed from the warships ashore and the soldiers landing on the beaches would do the job for him hed had his hopes dashed too many times in this war his hopes for how the war would go his hopes for his kingdom his hopes for his marriage and his happiness he was afraid to have hopes any more for fear something would go wrong and ruin them anew did king burebistu have hopes like gainibu of valmiera hed been an algarvian captive the past three years and more like gainibu he probably counted himself lucky that mezentio hadnt booted him off the throne and replaced him with some algarvian royal relative he wanted to get out of his hair what was the king of sibiu doing now something useful rallying the people in the palace against the algarvian occupiers maybe if sibiu was lucky just maybe but then cornelu stopped worrying about burebistu or anything farther away than the algarvian leyline frigate sliding down from the north toward the landing boats its eggtossers and heavy sticks tore at the invaders no lagoan or kuusaman warships were close enough to deal with it right away i am cornelu said and then to his leviathan we are he urged his mount forward the frigate was faster than the leviathan but if he could get to the ley line ahead of the ships path and wait if he could do that he might give a good many of mezentios men a very thin time of it indeed he slid under the leviathans belly ready to loosen the egg slung there and fasten it to the frigates hull but he reached the ley line just too late the frigate had already glided past he couldnt even curse not underwater but red rage filled his thoughts as much from rage as for any other reason he ordered the leviathan after the leyline frigate as long as the frigate kept going it would leave the leviathan behind it was after all steel and sorcery not mere flesh and blood but the frigate slowed when it got in among the landing boats with so many targets all around its captain wanted to make sure he missed none eggs started bursting near the frigate from ships that had seen the danger to the soldiers but none struck home if one of those eggs burst too close to the leviathan it could do as much harm as if the algarvians tossed it that was cornelus first thought his second was if one of those eggs bursts too close to me but he had his duty and a fine warm hatred of mezentios men to boot he urged the leviathan forward now he muttered and tapped out the intricate signal that ordered the animal to dive deep and come up under the frigates hull when it did he was waiting he freed the egg from its sling and attached it to the algarvian warship sorcery and lodestones held it to the ship he sent the leviathan away as fast as it would go more eggs burst close by which frightened it into swimming faster he was glad it did that meant it had got plenty far away when the egg hed affixed to the frigate burst it was a larger egg than the ones being tossed cornelu had no doubt which one it was he urged the leviathan to the surface and looked back when he saw the leyline frigate sinking with a broken back he pumped a fist in the air and shouted take that you son of a whore a moment later a puff of steam roiled the seawater by him and then another and another soldiers in the surviving landing boats were blazing at him not sure whose side he was on and not inclined to take chances finding out he ordered the leviathan to submerge once more he didnt suppose he could blame the kuusamans and lagoans bobbing on the sea blame them or not though he didnt want them killing him they blazed at him again when the leviathan surfaced once more but by then he was too far away for their beams to be dangerous and by then he was cheering again for boats were beaching themselves on sigisoara and soldiers scrambling out of them he approved of the soldiers as long as they were going after the algarvians and not him more algarvian patrol boats came forth these from the harbor at lehliu the port on the southeast coast of sigisoara none got close enough to do the landing boats any harm though their crews pressed the attack with typical algarvian dash and courage kuusaman dragons sank a couple while wellpositioned warships wrecked the rest as the day drew to a close cornelu used his crystal to call the lagoan officer in charge of leviathan patrols the very man as it happened whod introduced the plan for the attack on sibiu to him and his fellow exiles in the admiralty offices in setubal how do we fare sir cornelu asked i am not going to approach a leyline cruiser to try to find out the sailors would slay me before they bothered asking questions you think so eh the lagoan said in algarvian which probably gave his security mages nightmares well youre probably right we fare very well as a matter of face mezentios men werent expecting us werent expecting us at all by every sign we can gather sigisoara and tirgoviste are ours already or near enough as makes no difference well hold all five islands by this time tomorrow and well be able to hold them against anything algarve is likely to throw at us as far as i can see commander your kingdoms on the way to being free would sibiu truly be free with lagoan and kuusaman soldiers holding the algarvians at bay it was bound to be freer for now that would do powers above be praised cornelu said i can go home again he could aye he needed a moment to remember that he might not want to an early fall rain early for bishah at any rate had turned the road between hajjajs estate in the hills and the capital of zuwayza to mud the foreign minister was almost perfectly content to stay where he was his contentment would have been complete had the roof not developed a couple of what seemed like inevitable leaks there ought to be an ordinance against roofers as against any other frauds and cheats he fumed and of course they cant come out to fix the damage till the rain stops at which point no one needs them anymore he was content to be isolated from bishah aye he didnt care so much to have bishah isolated from him his majordomo didnt point that out instead tewfik said well young fellow its not so bad as it could be when you get as old as i am youll realize that hajjaj was no youngster himself was anything but a youngster in fact but he was likely to be dead by the time he got as old as tewfik the family servitor looked ready to go on forever a younger sprier servant came up to them and told hajjaj your excellency your secretary would speak to you by crystal im coming hajjaj said run on ahead and tell him ill be right there the servant perhaps a third of hajjajs age hurried away the zuwayzi foreign minister followed at a more stately pace stately he thought thats a prettysounding word old men use when they mean slow hajjajs back twinged when he sat down on the carpet in front of the crystal hello your excellency qutuz said from out of the globe of glass how are you today fine thanks except that my roof leaks and the roofers are thieves hajjaj replied whats come up something had to have or qutuz wouldnt have called him on the crystal unlike in person he didnt have to go through long courtesies before getting to the point qutuz said your excellency i have waiting on another crystal minister hadadezer of ortah he wishes to speak with you and was disappointed to learn you hadnt come down to the palace today i have a mage waiting to transfer his emanations to your crystal there if you give me leave by all means hajjaj said at once talking with the ortaho is always a treat because of the swamps and mountains that warded ortah it had always been all but immune to pressure from the outside even though it lay between algarve and unkerlant ortaho foreign relations were a luxury not a necessity as they were in the rest of the world hajjaj couldnt help wishing zuwayza might say the same he asked do you know what he has in mind no your excellency qutuz shook his head but just let me give the word to the mage here and you can find out for yourself he turned away and said go ahead to someone hajjaj couldnt see a moment later qutuzs image faded from the crystal but light didnt flare from it as it would have were the etheric connection broken after a pause of a few heartbeats a new image formed in the crystal that of a man whose long white beard began to grow just below his eyes and whose hairline was hardly separable from his eyebrows most savants reckoned the ortahoin cousins to the ice people of the austral continent hajjaj gave hadadezer a seated bow good day your excellency he said in algarvian a language the ortaho minister also used as always it is a privilege to speak to you i should be delighted to enjoy the privilege more often you are too kind hadadezer replied you will i hope remember our conversation this past winter aye i do indeed hajjaj said sulingen had been on the point of falling then it was a worrisome time worrisome the minister from ortah nodded the very word it surely was you may perhaps also remember the concerns of my sovereign king ahinadab i do recall them hajjaj agreed soberly you are perhaps wise not to speak of them too openly it is probably that no one but ourselves is picking up these emanations but it is not certain ahinadab had worried that for the first time in generations war might bear down on his kingdom in the aftermath of the algarvian defeat to hajjaj that proved the king of ortah was no fool now speaking like a man in mortal torment hadadezer said what king ahinadab feared has now come to pass algarvian soldiers have begun retreating into ortah to escape the unkerlanters and king swemmels men are hard on their heels oh my dear fellow hajjaj said as he had the winter before when hadadezer spoke of his sovereigns concern do i understand then that ortah lacks the strength to keep them out ever so mournfully the ortaho minister nodded king ahinadab has sent protests in the strongest terms to both trapani and cottbus his eyebrows they were separate from his hair after all bristled in humiliated fury ortah is a kingdom not a road more bristling but neither mezentio nor swemmel pays the least attention each in fact demanded that we declare war on the other oh my dear fellow hajjaj said again zuwayza lacked ortahs natural defenses and had had to suffer some generations of unkerlanter overlordship but king shazli didnt have to worry about getting attacked by both sides at once with real curiosity hajjaj asked what will your sovereign do i do not know hadadezer answered king ahinadab does not yet know either if we say aye to either kingdom we put ourselves in that kings hands and make an enemy of the other and if you say no to both kings you make enemies of them both hajjaj said my sovereign is only too painfully aware of that as well hadadezer said as i told you last winter i am no skilled diplomat ortah has no skilled diplomats we have never needed skilled diplomats the land is our shield but with so many behemoths and dragons about with so much more strong magecraft loosed in this war we cannot be sure the land will ward us anymore i think you are wise to worry hajjaj agreed in this war men have taken nature by the neck and not the other way round or not nearly so much as when men knew less than they do today oh nature could still work its will and he knew as much every algarvian whod fought through an unkerlanter winter would have agreed with him too so would the unkerlanters whod invaded desert zuwayza still what hed said was more nearly true than not hadadezer said because we of ortah are no diplomats my king bade me ask you the finest of the age what you would do in his place you do me too much honor hajjaj murmured as he had when hadadezers image first appeared before him he bowed where he sat the ortaho minister inclined his head in turn carefully hajjaj said i am not in your kings place nor can i be i understand that he also understands it hadadezer replied he makes no promises to follow what you propose still he would know very well now hajjaj spoke with some relief he wouldnt have wanted the responsibility for the ortahoin blindly obeying whatever he said after he thought for a bit he started ticking off points on his fingers you could fight as best you can or you could flee into the most rugged parts of the land and let the rest be a road no hadadezer said firmly if we did that we would never recover the land we gave up once the fighting ended what makes you think you will keep it all anyhow hajjaj wondered but he said that could be you could stay neutral and hope for the best or you could pick one side or the other if you choose the winner you may not be devoured afterwards if you pick the loser well with your landscape you still may not be devoured afterwards that is better luck than most kingdoms have hadadezer said we have been at peace a long time all we ask is to be let alone but who will hear us when we ask it no one not a soul the world has become a cruel hard place i wish i could say you were wrong your excellency hajjaj answered sadly but i fear worse i know you are right i also fear things will get worse before they get better if they ever get better i fear the same the ortaho minister said you will give my king no advice i have set forth the courses he might take hajjaj said in propriety i can do no more than that with obvious reluctance hadadezer nodded very well i understand how you might feel that way though i would be lying if i said i did not wish you to go further thank you for your time and for your patience your excellency i bid you good day his image faded out of the crystal once more though it did not flare the etheric connection remained intact after a moment hajjaj saw qutuzs face again were you able to listen to any of that the zuwayzi foreign minister asked aye your excellency qutuz suddenly looked anxious why would you rather i hadnt no no it doesnt matter i doubt marquis balastro would kidnap you and torture you or offer you lickerish algarvian lasses to find out what hadadezer had to say its only that hajjajs voice trailed away he was more than a little horrified to find himself on the edge of tears wasnt it the saddest thing you ever heard that it was his secretary said poor fellow hasnt a clue by the way he made it sound his king hasnt a clue either not a clue in the whole kingdom or his excellency wouldnt have come crying to you no none hajjaj agreed ortahs been able to stay apart from the rest of derlavai too long nobody there knows how to do anything else with seeming irrelevance he added i read an account once of an island the valmierans i think it was the valmierans found in the great northern sea qutuzs eyebrows rose your excellency he asked obviously hoping hajjaj would make himself clear the zuwayzi foreign minister did his best it was an uninhabited island uninhabited by people anyhow it was full of birds that looked like big doves doves the size of dogs so big they couldnt fly if i remember rightly the valmierans called them solitaires or maybe it was solitary island i havent thought of it in years why couldnt they fly qutuz still sounded confused theyd lost the need you might say they had no enemies there hajjaj replied the ortahoin whove lost the need to deal with their neighbors put me in mind of them ah qutuz still didnt seem altogether clear about where his superior was going but he found the right question to ask what happened to these big birds then hajjaj grimaced they were good to eat the valmierans hunted them till none was left they couldnt get away after all the island wasnt very big and they couldnt fly to another one all we know of them now we know from a few skins and feathers in a museum in priekule he paused if i were you i wouldnt tell this tale to hadadezer i promise qutuz said solemnly when pekka walked into the refectory in the hostel in the naantali district she found fernao fighting his way through a kuusaman news sheet what with the news sheet a kuusamanlagoan lexicon and almost incidentally the grilled herring and scrambled eggs and hot tea in front of him he was as busy a man with breakfast as pekka had ever seen somehow he wasnt too busy to notice her come in he smiled at her and waved the news sheet in the air almost upsetting his teacup habakkuk he exclaimed aye habakkuk pekka turned the word into a happy threesyllable squeak that is brilliant sorcery brilliant i say fernao spoke in classical kaunian so he wouldnt have to pause and search for a word or two every sentence sawdust and ice for strengthening the landing surface the dragons use more magecraft drawing energy from the ley lines to keep the icebergs frozen in warm seas aye brilliant sea fights will never be the same now that so many dragons can be carried across the water so quickly you talk like an admiral pekka said the term literally meant general on the ocean the ancient kaunian empire had been far stronger on land than at sea fernao waved the news sheet again i do not need to be an admiral to see what splendid magecraft went into this he read from the sheet not least because of their dominance in the air kuusaman and lagoan forces had little trouble overwhelming the relatively weak algarvian garrisons on the five main islands of sibiu you read that very well pekka said your accent is much better than it used to be how much did you understand almost all now fernao tapped the lexicon not so much before i worked my way through it all right pekka nodded if you stay here too much longer though we will make a kuusaman of you in spite of yourself though i would have to clip my ponytail there are probably worse fates and i already have some of the seeming fernao rested his index finger by one narrow slanted eye to show what he meant those eyes argued powerfully that he did have some kuusaman blood then he waved to the seat across from his at the table will you join me you must have come here to eat not to talk shop nothing wrong with talking shop pekka said as she did sit down but you will have to move that news sheet if i am to have enough room for my breakfast when a serving girl came up to her she ordered smoked salmon scrambled with eggs and her own mug of tea the tea arrived very quickly she had to wait a little longer for the rest of her breakfast as she sat chatting with fernao she noticed that neither of them said a word about leino though they both knew her husband had had a lot to do with the icebergsturneddragoncarriers that went by the name of habakkuk fernao had praised the magecraft without praising the mages who worked it as for her she was proud as could be of leino but she didnt have much to say about him to fernao any more than shed had much to say about fernao when she went home to leino but those shouldnt be inverses of each other she thought before she had much chance to wonder why shed acted as if they were ilmarinen came in and started raising a fuss why are we here he said loudly what are we doing wasting our time in the middle of nowhere i do not know about you fernao said buttering a slice of dark brown bread as for me i am eating breakfast and enjoying it too so am i pekka looked up over the rim of her mug of tea at ilmarinen do you have anything in particular in mind that we should be doing but are not master or are you just angry at the world this morning he glared at her youre not my mother youre not going to pat me on the head and tell me everythings all right and get me to go back to work like a good little boy no in fact pekka was in the habit of treating him rather as if he were uto but shed never told him that she was tempted now just to see the look on his face what would you have me do then leave me alone ilmarinen shouted loud enough to make everyone in the refectory mages and servants alike stare at him fernao surged to his feet pekka noted that he put only a little weight on his cane not so long before he couldnt have done anything without it now see here he began looming over ilmarinen sit down pekka told him her voice not sharp but flat he looked astonished of course hes astonished pekka thought he thinks hes helping me she didnt look at him she didnt repeat herself she just waited the lagoan mage sank back into his seat pekkas gaze swung back to ilmarinen i suggest you also sit down have breakfast whatever you are upset about will still be here when you have finished standing around and screaming at one another is a game for mountain apes or algarvians not for civilized men she spoke in classical kaunian partly for fernaos benefit partly because it helped her sound dispassionate like fernao before him ilmarinen sat down before he quite seemed to realize hed done it pekka waved for a serving girl she wasnt sorry the one she got was linna for whom ilmarinen still yearned she hoped the master mage wouldnt want to make a bigger fool of himself in front of the girl and he didnt he ordered breakfast much more like a civilized man than a shrieking mountain ape pekka nodded and have some tea master have some bergamot tea it will help soothe you she nodded to linna to make sure the serving girl added the tea to ilmarinens order linna hurried off and brought the tea before anything else the look she gave pekka wasnt quite conspiratorial but it came close as the fragrant leaves steeped ilmarinen muttered something under his breath what was that fernao asked though pekka wished he would have let it ride ilmarinen repeated himself a little louder seven princes and a princess pekka of naantali nonsense pekka said nonsense or maybe treason depending on whether prince renavall whose district this is finds himself in a merciful mood ilmarinen took a couple of somber sips of tea and shook his head i have no trouble disobeying princes i enjoy disobeying princes by the powers above but i obeyed you why do you suppose that is he sounded puzzled almost bewildered because you know you were making an idiot of yourself pekka suggested that seldom stops me ilmarinen answered aye we have seen as much fernao said ilmarinen turned a baleful eye his way im not the only one at this table whos doing it he snapped im just the only one whos not ashamed to admit it fernao turned very red with his fair skin the flush was easy to see something close to desperation in her voice pekka said enough she hoped she wasnt flushing too if she was she hoped it didnt show she went on master ilmarinen you came in and said we were wasting our time you said it at the top of your lungs suppose you either explain yourself or apologize suppose i do neither one ilmarinen sounded as if he was enjoying himself again pekka shrugged she kept on speaking classical kaunian if you would sooner disrupt the work than join it you may leave sir we have snow on the ground again sending you by sleigh to the nearest leyline caravan depot would be easy nothing easier in fact you could be in yliharma day after tomorrow you would not be wasting your time or ours there i am ilmarinen he said have you forgotten what he meant was do you think you can accomplish anything without my brilliance i remember all too well you make me remember all too well with your disruptions pekka answered i am the mage who leads this project have you forgotten if your disruptions cost more than you give we are better off without you no matter who you are aye fernao growled but pekka waved him to silence this is between master ilmarinen and me how now master ilmarinen do you follow where i lead here or do you go your own carefree way somewhere else she wondered if shed pushed it too hard if ilmarinen would leave in a huff if he did could they go forward he was unquestionably the most brilliant living mage in kuusamo he was also as unquestionably the most difficult she waited ilmarinen said i would like a third choice i know but those are the two you have pekka said then i obey ilmarinen said i even apologize which is not something you will hear from me every day in token of obedience he slipped out of his seat and went to one knee before pekka as if she were truly one of the seven princes and he were a woman she snorted you overact she said now in quick kuusaman rather hoping fernao couldnt follow and you know what that posture means of course i do he answered in the same tongue as he sat in the chair again but so what its fun no matter whos doing it to whom now pekka knew she was blushing very much to her relief she saw fernao hadnt caught all of the byplay she returned to classical kaunian enough of that too more than enough master ilmarinen i ask you again why do you say we are wasting our time here i expect an answer you know why both of you know why ilmarinen pointed to her and to fernao in turn our experiment brought fresh green grass here in dead of winter if we can do that we can go the other way as well we are not grass pekka said and we have no notion from which summer the grass came hither ilmarinen waved his hand that is a detail one reason we dont know is because we havent tried to find out thats why i say were wasting time fernao spoke up you were the one who showed similarity and contagion have an inverse relationship not a direct one if the relationship is not direct what works in one direction will fail in the other calculations to that effect are very plain would you not agree without experiment i agree to nothing ilmarinen said calculation springs from experiment not the other way round without the experiment of mistress pekka here the landscape would have a good many fewer holes in it master siuntio would still be alive and you would be back in lagoas where you belong that will be quite enough of that pekka snapped to her surprise ilmarinen inclined his head in another apology she had trouble believing that but she didnt know what else it could be then fernao started to say something he and pekka got on very well sometimes she feared almost too well most of the time but now she pointed her index finger at him as if it were a stick since she was sure he was about to aim a barb at ilmarinen do not even start she said sternly we have had too much quarreling among ourselves as is do you understand me aye after a moments hesitation fernao added mistress pekka he looked as apologetic as ilmarinen had for a heartbeat or two pekka simply accepted that and was glad of it then she stared down at her own hands in something very much like wonder by the powers above she thought a little more than a little dazed im leading them i really am grelz boiled and bubbled like a pot of cabbage soup too long on the fire grelzer soldiers trudged west to try to help algarve and keep the land a kingdom unkerlanter soldiers battled their way east to try to make it into a duchy once more and the peasants who made up the bulk of the population were caught in the middle as peasants all too often were during wartime some of them those who would soon have lived under puppet king raniero than fierce king swemmel fled east ahead of the oncoming unkerlanter army and the retreating algarvians and grelzers in the mud time the roads would have been bad without them with them clogging those roads the redheads and their grelzer hounds had an even harder time getting men and beasts and supplies to the front with so many strangers on the move garivalds band of irregulars could operate far more freely than they had before most of the time a strangers appearance in a peasant village brought gossip and speculation having lived his whole life up till the war in zossen a village much like any other garivald understood that in his bones but things were different now with strangers everywhere what difference did one more make our armys still moving garivald told tantris as reports from the outside world trickled into the woods where the irregulars denned not easy to press forward in the mud time i ought to know marshal rathars no ordinary soldier the unkerlanter regular replied he can make men do things they couldnt manage most of the time the grounds starting to freeze every now and then garivald said thatll make things easier at least till the first big blizzard easier for both sides tantris said when its mud weve got the edge on the redheads oh aye no doubt garivald agreed we can move a little and the stinking algarvians can hardly move at all hed intended that for sarcasm but tantris took him literally and nodded if you can get any kind of advantage no matter how small you grab it with both hands he said thats how you win for once obilot agreed with him we have the best chance to hurt the algarvians now she told garivald inside the tent the two of them had started sharing the real army is getting close mezentios whoresons will be careless of us theyll have bigger things worse things on their minds aye garivald knew he sounded abstracted he couldnt help it if the army wasnt so far away from here it was even closer to zossen zossen where his wife and son and daughter lived one of these days he would have to go back which meant that one of these days there would be no place for obilot in his life he reached for her she came to him a smile on her face they made love under a couple of blankets it was cold in the tent and getting colder at the moment when she stiffened and shuddered and her arms tightened around him she whispered his name with a kind of wonder in her voice hed never heard from anyone else he missed his wife and children but he would miss her too if this ever had to end afterwards he asked her do you think about what life will be like once the army takes back all of grelz when theres no more need for irregulars you mean she asked and he nodded she shrugged no not very much whats the point i havent got anything to go back to everything i had once upon a time the redheads smashed garivald still didnt know what shed had he supposed shed been a wife as annore was his wife back in zossen maybe shed been a mother too and maybe it wasnt just her family that didnt exist anymore maybe it was her whole village the algarvians had never been shy about giving out lessons like that curse them he muttered well do worse than curse them obilot answered or maybe better well hurt them instead she spoke of that with a savage relish at least as passionate as anything shed said while she lay in his arms and she left the woods the next morning to go spy out the roads and the nearby villages both the algarvians and the grelzers paid less attention to women than they did to men in a way that made sense for more women were less dangerous than most men but obilot was different from most women when she came back the next day excitement glowed on her face we can hurt them she said we can hurt them badly theyre mustering at pirmasens for a strike against the head of the column of regulars moving east that made tantris eyes glow aye thats what well do he said thats what were for how many of them are mustering at pirmasens garivald asked i dont know exactly obilot replied a couple of regiments anyhow algarvians and grelzers both he stared powers above he exclaimed what can we do against a couple of regiments of real soldiers theyd squash us like bugs but obilot shook her head we cant fight them no but there are only two bridges over the streams south of pirmasens if we can knock those into the water the redheads and the traitors cant get where theyre going thats right sadoc nodded the peasant who made such a disastrous mage went on im from those parts theyd have to spend a while building bridges if we take out the ones that are standing tantris nodded too tantris in fact all but licked his chops if this isnt the sort of thing a band of irregulars can do what is he asked garivald he still didnt try giving orders though maybe hed really learned we can try it aye garivald said a good thing you managed to get us a few eggs theyll help tantris actually had been worth something there back in the days when munderic led the band hed had connections among disaffected grelzer soldiers that got eggs for the irregulars garivald hadnt been able to match that but tantris being a regular had sources of supply farther west and theyd come through sadoc said i want to get out there and fight i want to make the algarvians and the traitors pay thats all ive ever wanted it wasnt any such thing once upon a time not very long before hed wanted to slay garivald with sorcery all hed managed to do was kill tantris comrade instead he was far more dangerous to the foe with a stick in his hand than with a spell maybe hed really learned too garivald scratched his chin if were going to wreck the bridges well have to move by night we cant let anybody catch us hauling eggs by daylight anyone sees us doing that were dead men tantris stirred but didnt speak garivald could guess what he was thinking that wrecking the bridges counted for more than losing a few irregulars that was probably how real soldiers had to think if not thinking that way meant garivald wasnt a real soldier he wouldnt lose any sleep over it and he saw the rest of the band nodding their heads in agreement with him they wanted to make the algarvians and their puppets suffer they didnt want to do any dying themselves some of them would no matter what they wanted garivald was pretty sure of that even as he got the irregulars moving a little past midnight he hoped they werent dwelling on it but if they wrecked those bridges south of pirmasens the enemy would have a good idea of where they were and would stand between them and the shelter of the woods getting back wouldnt be so easy getting to the bridges was another matter nights were long now long and cold and dark plenty of time for marching plenty of darkness for concealment clouds overhead threatened snow garivald hoped they would hold off thatd be just what we need he thought a bunch of tracks saying here we are come blaze us they carried four eggs two for each bridge with each egg yoked between two men with carrying poles and rope every so often new pairs would take them they werent light and garivald didnt want anyone exhausted he also sent out scouts well ahead of the main body of irregulars here of all times he couldnt afford to be surprised tantris came up to him and remarked ive seen real officers who didnt arrange their men half so well have you garivald said and the regular nodded garivald let out a thoughtful grunt no wonder the algarvians drove us so hard during the first days of the war then you may make fine songs but your mouth will be the death of you one day tantris said garivald didnt answer he just kept trudging along when the time came to take one eggs carrying poles on his shoulders for a while he did it without hesitation a real officer probably wouldnt have but he wasnt one so he didnt care he sent a runner up to the scouts with orders to swing wide around pirmasens the glow from the campfires there was plenty to warn him away from the place the runner came back with word that the scouts had already swung wide on their own garivald wondered if regular soldiers would have he didnt ask tantris when they got to the first bridge they planted an egg at each end the second bridge lay a few hundred yards upstream when they got there sadoc murmured i feel a power point all i have to do is say the word and no garivald hissed frantically to his vast relief tantris said the same thing in the same tone of voice sadoc muttered something else but the louder mutter of the rainswollen river swept it away tantris went off by himself into the darkness the eggs were his he knew the spell that would make them burst and he jealously guarded the knowledge garivald made out only one word from him now and then four nearly simultaneous roars shattered the night and shattered the bridges chunks of wood rained down on the irregulars someone let out a yowl of pain nobody would cross the river by either of those ways for a good long while but then even before garivald could order the irregulars back toward the woods challenges rang out and beams began to flicker in the night the grelzers had had patrols on the move hed just been lucky enough to miss them now now there were a lot of shouts of raniero and a lot of men rushing down from pirmasens to join the hunt for the bridgewreckers garivalds mouth went dry some grelzer soldiers would sooner surrender than fight some were very good men indeed my luck to run into that kind again he thought and they can pin us against the river we cant use those stinking bridges either the grelzers plainly intended to do just that garivald had no idea how to stop them if tantris did he kept it as secret as the bursting spell another thought ran through garivalds mind were going to die here were all going to die here a beam zipped past him for a moment the air smelled of thunderstorms no sooner had that crossed his mind than lightning smote the grelzers not once but again and again each crash of cloven air dwarfed the roars that had come from the bursting eggs no snow no rain only bolt after bolt of lightning peal after peal of thunder through those peals garivald heard someone laughing like a man possessed sadoc he realized awe or perhaps the aftereffects of lightning made the hair prickle up on his arms and at the nape of his neck hes found himself at last and then as the grelzer soldiers fled howling in fear well for sure he picked the right time as the leyline caravan glided to a stop on the eastern outskirts of eoforwic vanai squeezed ealstans hand in excitement oh i can hardly wait she exclaimed he was grinning too they both got to their feet and descended from the caravan car they both popped open umbrellas it was drizzling the misty rain hid all but the nearest houses there werent so many anyhow the city faded away into meadows and orchards and farmland exactly the sort of landscape vanai wanted now along with her umbrella she clutched a wickerwork basket ealstan had one just like it vanai jumped in the air from sheer high spirits mushrooms she squealed as if it were a magic word and so for her it was aye ealstan nodded they walked away from the caravan stop their shoes got muddy neither of them cared they both had on old pairs they werent the only ones whod got off at this stop either half a carload of eager forthwegians scattered to pursue their kingdoms favorite fall sport you dont know what this means to me vanai said once the other mushroom hunters were out of earshot maybe a little ealstan said i remember how excited you were after you found the sorcery last year just to be able to go to a park and look for mushrooms there this has to be even better it is vanai gave him a quick kiss he did try to understand in his head maybe he even succeeded there but how could he understand in his belly what being cooped up inside that flat for most of a year had been like how could he understand the fear shed felt every time somebody walked along the hall past the door a pause a knock could have meant the end for her it hadnt happened but it could have shed know that in her belly her husbands thoughts were traveling a different ley line there in the park that was where you got your forthwegian name ealstan said it was the first one that popped into my head when we ran into ethelhelm and his friends thelberge vanai tasted it then shrugged it took me by surprise then im used to it by now or pretty much so anyway everybody who calls me anything calls me thelberge these days except you every once in a while i like you as vanai he said seriously i always have you know despite the chilly drizzle that warmed her ealstan shifted his basket to the hand that also held the umbrella so he could put his free arm around her he went on youve had a better year than ethelhelm did and thats the truth i know her shiver had nothing to do with the weather either i wonder whats become of him since he ran away from everything he had nerve there in the street in eoforwic when his spell wore off he started singing and playing and bluffed his way through if hed had more nerve earlier it might not have come to that ealstan had never had much bend to him as far as he was concerned things were right or they were wrong and that was that but he wanted to stay rich even though the algarvians were running the kingdom and he ended up paying the price you cant blame him too much vanai said most people just want to get along as best they can he did better than almost anybody else with kaunian blood in forthweg for a while anyhow aye for a while ealstan sounded grim part of that vanai knew was what he reckoned friendship betrayed she said maybe we havent heard the last of him yet maybe ealstan said if he has any sense though hell go on lying low the algarvians would be on him like a blaze if he started making waves and pybba would know about him too if he were trying to give the redheads a hard time pybba hasnt heard a thing would he tell you if he had vanai asked before ealstan answered he stooped to pick some meadow mushrooms and toss them into his basket then he said would he tell me i dont know but there would likely be some sign of it in his books and there isnt you poke through a fellows books you can find all sorts of things if you know how to look you could maybe vanai said he spoke with great assurance his father had trained him well at nineteen he was a match for any bookkeeper in eoforwic and how did your grandfather train you vanai asked herself if there were need for a junior historian of the kaunian empire you might fill the bill since the algarvians have made it illegal to write kaunian and a capital offense to be kaunian youre not good for much right now she walked on for another couple of paces then stopped so abruptly that ealstan kept going on for a bit before realizing she wasnt following he turned back in surprise whats wrong nothing shed been feeling flutters in her belly the past few days maybe even the past week shed put them down to gas and a sour stomach her digestion wasnt all it might have been but this wasnt gas she knew what it was knew what it had to be nothings wrong the baby just kicked me ealstan looked as astonished as he had when shed first told him she was pregnant then he hurried back to her and set his own hand on her belly vanai looked around ready to be embarrassed but she couldnt see anyone else which meant no one else could see him do such an intimate thing he said do you suppose hell do it again how should i know vanai said startled into laughter its not anything i can make him do no i guess not ealstan sounded as if that hadnt occurred to him till she pointed it out but then with his palm still pressed against her tunic the baby did stir again within her there she said did you feel that aye now wonder filled his face what does it feel like to you vanai thought about that it doesnt feel like anything else she said at last it feels as if somebody tiny is moving around inside me and hes not very careful where he puts his feet she laughed and set her hand on top of his that really is whats going on ealstan nodded now it does seem youre going to have a baby it didnt feel quite real before somehow it did to me vanai exclaimed for a moment she was angry at him for being so dense shed gone through four months of sleepiness of nausea of tender breasts shed gone through four months without the usual monthly reminder that she wasnt pregnant but all of that she reminded herself had been her concern not ealstans all he could note from firsthand experience was this past week or so a very slight bulge in her lower abdomen and now a flutter under his hand he must have been thinking along with her there for he said i cant have the baby you know all i can do is watch she cocked her head to one side and smiled at him oh you had a little more to do with it than that ealstan coughed and spluttered as shed hoped he would she went on the baby isnt going anywhere for months even if he thinks he is well only be out here hunting mushrooms for a few hours can we do that now all right ealstan looked astonished again the baby was uppermost overwhelmingly uppermost in his thoughts he had to be amazed it wasnt so overwhelmingly uppermost in hers but shed had those months to get used to the idea while hed admitted a minute before that it hadnt seemed real to him till now come on she pointed ahead are those oaks there i think they are maybe well find some oyster mushrooms growing on their trunks maybe we will ealstan slipped his arm around her waist she still had a waist we did back there in that grove between gromheort and oyngestun he grinned at her we found all sorts of interesting things in that oak grove i dont know what youre talking about vanai said they both laughed theyd first met in that grove of oaks theyd first traded mushrooms there too and a couple of years later theyd first made love in the shade of those trees vanai smiled at ealstan a good thing it wasnt drizzling that one day or everything thats happened since would have been different thats so ealstan wasnt smiling anymore he frowned as he worked through the implications of what shed said strange to think how something you cant control like the weather can change your whole life tell it to the algarvians vanai said savagely in summer they go forward in unkerlant in winter they go back before ealstan could answer she made her own commentary to that except this year powers below eat them they couldnt go forward in summer they tried but they couldnt no ealstans voice held the same fierce gloating joy as hers nothing came easy for them this year and now theres fighting down in sibiu too i dont think thats going so well for the redheads either or theyd say more about it in the news sheets heres hoping youre right vanai said the thinner they spread themselves the better she stooped and plucked up a couple of horse mushrooms slightly more flavorful cousins to ordinary meadow mushrooms as she put them in her basket she sighed i dont think there are as many interesting kinds around eoforwic as there were back where we came from i think youre right ealstan started to add something else but broke off and looked at her with an expression shed come to recognize sure enough he said your sorcerys slipped again vanais mouth twisted it shouldnt have i renewed it not long before we walked to the caravan stop well it has her husband said is it my imagination or has the spell been fading faster since you got pregnant i dont know vanai said maybe its a good thing nobodys close by thats all now she hurried for the shelter of the oaks not that they gave much shelter with most of the leaves off the branches she took out her two precious lengths of yarn twirled them together and made the spell anew is it all right she asked aye ealstan nodded now he looked thoughtful i wonder why it isnt holding so long these days maybe because youve got more life energy in you now and so the spell has more to cover it could be it sounds logical vanai said but i hope youre wrong i hope i just didnt cast the spell quite right i could have lost the disguise on the caravan car not out here where no one but you saw me her shiver again had nothing to do with the chilly nasty weather that would have been very bad forward sergeant leudast shouted aye forward by the powers above since the great battles in the durrwangen bulge hed shouted the order to advance again and again it still tasted sweet as honey still felt strong as spirits in his mouth he might almost have been telling a pretty woman he loved her but the men holed up in the village ahead didnt love him or his comrades the ragged banners flapping in the chilly breeze there were green and gold the colors of what the algarvians called the kingdom of grelz as far as leudast was concerned that kingdom didnt exist the grelzers blazing at his company from those battered huts had a different opinion death to the traitors captain recared yelled somewhere in the long fight between durrwangen and westcentral grelz a promotion had finally caught up with him leudast couldnt remember where it didnt matter to him promotion or no recared kept doing the same job leudast kept doing the same job too and nobody would ever promote him to lieutenants rank he was sure of that he had neither the bloodlines nor the pull to become an officer death to the traitors recared cried again from behind a palebarked birch tree leudast crawled over toward recared somebody in the village saw the motion and blazed at him the ground was wet steam puffed up where the beam bit a few feet in front of his head he froze in southern unkerlant with winter coming on fast that could easily be a literal as well as a metaphorical statement after shivering for half a minute he dashed forward again and found shelter behind another tree trunk the grelzer blazed at him again and missed again death to those who follow the false king captain recared roared sir leudast said and then when recared didnt notice him right away sir eh that second time hed spoken loud enough to make recared jump the young regimental commander turned his head oh its you sergeant what do you want sir if you dont mind dont shout about death so much leudast answered it just makes the cursed grelzers fight harder if you know what i mean sometimes theyll surrender if you give em the chance recared chewed on that visibly for leudast watched his jaw muscles work at last he said but they deserve death aye most of em do leudast didnt want to argue with his superior he just wanted him to shut up but if you tell em ahead of time that theyll get it then theyve got no reason not to fight as hard as they can to keep from falling into our hands do you see what im saying the winter before recared wouldnt have now reluctantly he nodded though he said i still have to make our men want to fight havent you noticed how it is sir leudast asked advancing makes a big difference there unkerlanter eggtossers began pelting the enemyheld village leudast grinned wider at each burst and so does efficiency they see we really can lick the whoresons on the other side of course we can recared exclaimed as if the first two desperate summers of the war against algarve had never happened he knew how to take advantage of the eggtossers though he raised his voice to a shout again theyve got to keep their heads down boys so we can take em forward king swemmel and victory swemmel and victory leudast echoed also at the top of his lungs nothing wrong with that war cry nothing at all a lot of unkerlant and a good big stretch of the duchy of grelz here had been recaptured behind it recared ran forward he was brave enough and to spare leudast followed him so did everybody within earshot and then the rest of the unkerlanter soldiers who saw their comrades moving urra they shouted and swemmel and victory shouts rose from inside the village raniero and swemmel the murderer advancing unkerlanters went down some howled out cries that held no words only pain others lay very still these grelzers werent about to surrender regardless of what the unkerlanters yelled theyd buried eggs in the mud in front of their village too an unkerlanter soldier trod on one he shrieked briefly as the released energies consumed him leudast cursed his own countrymen had stalled algarvian attacks in the durrwangen salient with belt after belt of hidden eggs having the stratagem turned against them seemed anything but fair then recared pointed south of the village and said the happiest words any unkerlanter footsoldier could use behemoths our behemoths by the powers above even with snowshoes spreading their weight even with the way made easier with brush and logs spread in front of them the great beasts made slower rougher going in the mud than they had on the hard ground of summer but they moved forward faster than men could and they and their armored crewmen were much harder to kill than ordinary footsoldiers leudast said lets go with them and bypass this place once we get behind it it wont be worth anything to the grelzers anymore recared frowned we ought to go straight at the enemy hes right there in front of us and were right here in front of him where hes got the best blaze at us leudast answered when the algarvians were driving us theyd go around the places that fought hard and let them wither on the vine theyd advance where we were weak and we couldnt be strong everywhere thats so recared said thoughtfully he hadnt been there to go through most of that but he knew about it a great many of the soldiers who had gone through it were dead leudast knew how lucky he was to be among the exceptions to his relief recared nodded again blew his whistle and shouted for his men to swing south of the village and go with the behemoths the men who come after us the ones who arent good enough to fight in the first rank can mop up these traitors he declared as leudast hurried toward the behemoths he wondered if the grelzers would sally to try to stop them but the men who followed king mezentios cousin stayed under cover they knew theyd get slaughtered out in the open leudast expected them to get slaughtered anyway but now it would take longer and cost more the unkerlanters pressed on for another couple of miles before a wellaimed beam from a heavy stick left one of their behemoths kicking its way toward death in the mud another beam not so well aimed threw up a great gout of nastysmelling steam between a couple of other behemoths all the crews frantically pointed ahead when leudast saw algarvian behemoths at the edge of some woods he threw himself flat in the muck the redheads didnt seem to have so many behemoths left these days but they used the ones they did have with as much deadly panache as ever still two and a half years of war had taught king swemmels soldiers several painful but important lessons their behemoths didnt charge straight at the algarvian beasts some of them traded beams and sticks with the algarvians from a distance that let the others sidle around to the flank leudast had watched this dance of death before he knew what the right counter would be having more behemoths waiting to engage the unkerlanters trying the flanking move the algarvians didnt have them that meant they could either withdraw or die where they stood they chose to withdraw someplace else someplace where they found odds that looked better they would challenge the unkerlanters again in the meanwhile forward leudast shouted scrambling up out of the mud he wasnt that much filthier than the men around him and his voice lent him authority not long before nightfall his squad and a couple of others fought their way into a village neither the grelzers nor the algarvians defended very hard captain recared strode for the firstmans house to make his headquarters there he found the place empty the door standing open wheres the firstman he asked a dumpy woman looking out the window of the hut next door she jerked a thumb toward the east he done run off she answered her grelzer accent thick as syrup in leudasts ears he were in bed with the algarvians he were she sniffed his daughter were in bed with anything that walked on two legs and werent quite dead little slut recared nodded and went inside leudast nodded too wearily he heard that story or one just like it in every village the unkerlanters recaptured all those villages had the same look a lot of houses abandoned because the peasants had fled east to stay under algarvian protection hardly any men fit for soldiers showing themselves on the street the first few times hed heard peasants tell tales of woe hed been sympathetic now now sympathy came harder a lot of these people had run away rather than returning to king swemmels rule from what leudast had seen a lot of the ones whod stayed behind had done so only because they hadnt found the chance to flee no sooner had that thought crossed his mind than a scuffle broke out in a house not far away curses and thumps and a shout of pain think we ought to do anything about that sergeant one of his men asked leudast shrugged and then shook his head i think itll sort itself out without us when it does he proved a good prophet a couple of minutes later three middleaged men half led half dragged one of their contemporaries up before him ascovind here he done sucked up to the algarvians and to the miserable little tinpot king they made one of the captors said he ought to get whats coming to him thats a filthy lie ascovind shouted twisting and trying to break free i never done nothing like that liar all three of the men shouted at the same time one added he done told the grelzers where irregulars hid out hurt em powerful bad i bet what do you want me to do about it leudast asked the men you can save him for king swemmels inspectors when they get here or else you can knock him over the head yourselves makes no difference to me one way or the other they dragged ascovind away presently they came back and he didnt leudast had seen the like there a good many times too ascovind should have run off but hed probably thought his neighbors wouldnt turn on him when they got the chance as far as leudast was concerned that made him a fool as well as a traitor hed probably deserved whatever the other villagers had given him and he wouldnt be the only one men whod cursed king swemmel or whod just tried to get along women whod opened their legs to an algarvian or to a grelzer soldier men and women nobody much liked aye the inspectors would be busy here theyd be busy lots of places leudast was glad of his uniform nobody could suspect him of treason not for anything the soldiers took as much food as they could find they had to to feed themselves none of the villagers dared say a word these men in filthy rockgray who represented king swemmel could start calling them traitors too leudast shared some of the black bread he got with the prettiest girl he saw later she shared herself with him they hadnt made the bargain in words but it was nonetheless real recareds whistle shrilled before sunrise the next morning forward he shouted forward leudast went on toward herborn eighteen bembo was sleeping the deep restful sleep of a man with a clean conscience or perhaps of a man with no conscience when someone shattered that rest by rudely shaking him awake his eyes flew open so did his mouth to curse whoever would perpetrate such an enormity but the curses died before they saw the light of day sergeant pesaro loomed over him fat face filled with fury get your arse out of the sack you son of a whore pesaro snarled come with me this instant this instant do you hear aye sergeant bembo answered meekly and came even though he wore only his light tunic and kilt and the barracks was chilly he followed pesaro into the sergeants office where shivering he plucked up his always indifferent courage enough to ask what what is it the worst he could think of was that pesaro had found out how hed spirited away the parents of doldasai the kaunian courtesan by the fearsome expression on pesaros face this was liable to be even worse than that pesaro snatched a leaf of paper off his desk and waved it in bembos face do you see this he shouted do you uh no sergeant bembo said not unless you hold it still thus reminded pesaro did bembo read the first few lines his eyes widened by the powers above he whispered my leaves come through pesaros glare grew more baleful yet aye it has you stinking sack of moldy mushrooms he ground out your leave has come through nobody elses has not in this whole barracks not in this whole stinking town not even mine powers below eat you you get to go back to tricarico for ten mortal days and enjoy yourself in civilization while the rest of us stay stuck with the fornicating forthwegians he looked about to tear the precious paper to shreds to forestall such a disaster bembo snatched it out of his hands thank you sergeant he exclaimed i feel like a man who just won the lottery that was no exaggeration he knew how unlikely leaves were all but babbling he went on im sure yours will come through very soon not just sure positive aye he was babbling he didnt care ha pesaro tossed his head in magnificent jowlwobbling contempt go on get out of my sight ill be jealous of you every minute youre gone and if youre even one minute late coming back to duty youll pay oh how youll pay nodding doing his best not to gloat bembo fled he dressed he packed he collected all his back pay he hurried to the leyline caravan depot and waited for an eastbound caravan hed just scrambled aboard it when he realized he hadnt bothered waiting for breakfast if that didnt speak to his desperation for escape he didnt know what did almost all the algarvians in his caravan car were soldiers whod got leave from the endless grinding war against unkerlant some of them seeing his constables uniform cursed him for a coward and a slacker hed heard that before whenever soldiers passed through gromheort here he had to grin and bear it either that or pick a fight and get beaten to a pulp but some of the soldiers instead of reviling him just called him a lucky dog they shared food with him and fiery unkerlanters spirits too by the time the leyline caravan had got well into algarve bembo leaned back in his seat with a glazed look on his face he found he had little trouble figuring out just when the caravan entered his native kingdom it wasnt so much that redheads replaced swarthy bearded forthwegians in the fields that did happen but it wasnt what he noticed what he noticed was something starker women replaced men where are all the men he exclaimed gone to fight king swemmel one of the fellows whod been feeding him spirits shook his head oh no buddy not all of them by now a good many are dead bembo started to laugh then choked on it the soldier wasnt joking changing caravans in dorgali a goodsized town in southcentral algarve came as more than a little relief most of the men under fifty in the depot wore uniforms but some didnt and hearing women and children use his own language as their birthspeech was music to bembos ears after a couple of years of listening to sonorous forthwegian and occasional classical kaunian best of all the civilians among whom bembo sat on the trip to tricarico didnt blame him for not being a soldier some of them in fact started to take his constables uniform for that of the army he wouldnt have denied it if a woman hadnt pointed him out for what he really was but even she didnt do it in a mean way she said youre serving king mezentio beyond the frontier too just as if you were a soldier why so i am dear bembo said i couldnt have put it better or even so well myself he flirted with her till she got off the caravan car a couple of hours later that made him snap his fingers in disappointment if shed stayed on till tricarico something interesting might have developed he let out a long sigh of pleasure like that of a lover returning to his beloved when the conductor called tricarico folks all out for tricarico he grabbed his bag and hurried down onto the platform of the depot it was he saw the platform from which hed left for forthweg a couple of years before he kicked at the paving stones as he left the depot and hurried out into the city his city there were the bradano mountains indenting the eastern skyline he didnt have to worry about blond jelgavans swarming out of them as he had in the early days of the war he didnt have to worry about jelgavan dragons anymore either and there was a cab he waved to it the driver stopped bembo hopped in the dukes delight he told the hackman naming a hostel hed have no trouble affording hed had to give up his flat when he went off to the west youll be from around these parts the driver said flicking the horses reins how do you know bembo asked way you talk the fellow answered and nobody who wasnt would know of a dive like that bembo laughed he also got the last laugh by shorting the drivers tip to pay him back for his crack once hed got himself a room at the hostel bembo walked down the hall to take a bath then changed into wrinkled civilian clothes and went back out to promenade through the streets of tricarico how shabby everything looks he thought how worn that took him by surprise after so long in battered gromheort hed expected his home town to sparkle by comparison as hed seen on his caravan journey across algarve few men between seventeen and fifty were on the streets of those who were many limped or were short a hand or wore an eye patch or sometimes a black mask bembo grimaced whenever he saw men whod come back from the war something less than a full man they made him feel guilty for his free if not especially graceful stride after so long looking at dumpy forthwegian women and the occasional blond kaunian bembo had thought he would enjoy himself back in his home town but his own countrywomen seemed tired and drab too too many of them wore the dark gray of someone whod lost a husband or brother or father or son powers above he thought the forthwegians are having a better time of it than my own folk for a moment that seemed impossible then all at once it made sense of course they are theyre out of the war they arent losing loved ones anymore well except for the kaunians in forthweg anyhow we have to go right on taking it in the teeth till we finally win lurid broadsheets shouted the kaunians started this war but we will finish it others cried the struggle against kaunianity never ends they were pasted on every vertical surface and gave tricarico most of what little color it had people hurried past them head down not bothering to read another thought occurred to bembo or we have to go on taking it till we lose he resolutely shoved that one to the back of his mind he wasnt walking a beat here he had to keep reminding himself of that whether he was or he wasnt though he soon found himself back at the constabulary station where hed spent so much time before going to gromheort he hadnt seemed to belong anywhere else he went up the stairs and into the beatup old building with hope thudding in his heart he got his first jolt when he opened the door that wasnt sergeant pesaro sitting behind the desk in the front hall of course not you idiot bembo jeered at himself you left pesaro back in forthweg he didnt recognize the fellow in the sergeants familiar seat the constable didnt recognize him either what do you want pal he asked in tones suggesting that bembo had no business wanting anything and would be wise to take himself elsewhere in a hurry im not in uniform bembo realized he fished in his belt pouch and found the card that identified him as a constable from tricarico displaying it he said ive been on duty in forthweg the past couple of years lightning finally struck they gave me leave and you came back to a constabulary station the man in pesaros seat said incredulously havent you got better things to do with yourself curse me if i know for sure bembo answered tricarico looks dead and about halfway buried whats wrong with everybody anyway war news isnt so good the other constable said i know but thats not it or not all of it bembo insisted with a shrug he went on here at least i know some people go on then said the constable behind the desk just dont bother anybody whos working thats all bembo didnt dignify that with a reply he hurried down the hall to the big room where clerks and sketch artists worked a lot of the clerks hed known were gone with women taking their places most of the time that would have cheered bembo but now he was looking for familiar faces the jeers and insults he got from the handful of people who recognized him felt better than blank stares from even pretty strangers wheres saffa he asked one of the clerks who hadnt gone off to war when he didnt see the artist the army cant have taken her she had a baby a couple weeks ago the fellow answered shell be back before too long i expect a baby bembo exclaimed i didnt even know shed got married who said anything about married the clerk replied that made bembo laugh it also made him wonder why if saffa was going to fall into bed with somebody she hadnt fallen into bed with him life isnt fair he thought and pushed on farther into the station frontino the warder hastily stuck a trashy historical romance into his desk drawer when bembo came in then he pulled it out again saying oh its you i thought it might be somebody important as if the constable had never gone away he got up and clasped bembos wrist nice to see some things havent changed bembo said youre still a lazy goodfornothing and youre still an old windbag frontino retorted fondly again trading insults made bembo feel at home his wave encompassed the whole constabulary station the whole town the whole kingdom its not the same as it was is it frontino pondered that bembo wondered how the warder was supposed to judge when he spent most of his time shut away in the gaol he ran but he didnt take long to nod and say its been better sure enough bembo nodded too all at once he looked forward to getting back to gromheort a babys thin angry wail woke skarnu in the middle of the night merkela stirred beside him in the narrow crowded bed hush she told the baby in the cradle just hush the baby wasnt inclined to listen skarnu hadnt thought he would be he didnt suppose merkela had thought so either with a weary sigh she got out of bed and lifted their son from that cradle what does he want skarnu asked is he wet or is he just hungry ill find out she answered and then a moment later hes wet i hope i dont wake him up too much changing him she laid the baby on the bed and found a fresh rag with which to wrap his middle hush gedominu she murmured again but the baby didnt want to hush hes hungry skarnu said merkela sighed i know she sat down beside the baby picked him up and gave him her breast he nursed avidly and noisily skarnu tried to go back to sleep but couldnt he listened to his son eat the baby was named for merkelas dead husband whom the algarvians had blazed it wasnt the name skarnu would have chosen but merkela hadnt given him much choice he could live with it gedominu had been a brave man little gedominus sucking slowed then stopped merkela raised him to her shoulder and patted him till he gave forth with a surprisingly deep belch she set him back in the cradle and lay down beside skarnu again not too bad she said yawning no not too skarnu agreed little gedominu was only a couple of weeks old already skarnu and merkela had learned the difference between good nights and bad fussy feedings and others skarnu went on one of him and two of us he only outnumbers us by a little no matter how sleepy she was merkela noticed that ha she said not laughter but an exclamation that isnt funny i didnt think it was skarnu replied a new thought crossed his mind powers above how do you suppose people with twins or triplets manage merkela noticed that too i dont know she said they probably just go mad wouldnt you think she yawned again skarnu started to answer but checked himself when her breathing grew slow and regular she had the knack for falling asleep at once or maybe taking care of gedominu she was too weary to do anything else gedominu woke once more in the night and then again at first light that left skarnu shambling and redeyed from lack of sleep and merkela a good deal worse as she put a pot on the woodburning stove to make tea she said it might have been simpler just to let the algarvians catch us shed never said anything like that while they were on the farm but then she hadnt had to contend with a new baby while they were on the farm either skarnu went over and set a hand on her shoulder things will straighten out he said sooner or later they have to i suppose so even though gedominu lay in the cradle awake but quiet merkela sounded anything but convinced when she waved her arm she almost hit skarnu and she almost hit a couple of walls the flat wasnt very big that to her was part of the problem she burst out how do townsfolk stand living cooped up like this all their lives why dont they run screaming through the streets her farmhouse hadnt been very large either but when she looked out the windows there she saw her fields and meadows and the trees across the road when she looked out the one small grimy window here all she saw were the cobbles of the street below and across that street another block of flats of grimy yellowish brown bricks much like the ones here erzvilkas isnt much of a town skarnu said with what he reckoned commendable understatement and this isnt much of a flat either well do better as soon as we get the chance for now though were safe from the redheads and thats what matters most merkela only grunted and poured two mugs of tea she took a jar of honey and spooned some into her mug then passed it to skarnu who did the same he sipped the hot sweet strong brew it drove back the worst of his weariness but it couldnt drive away his worries theyd escaped the algarvians aye that wasnt the same as saying they were safe from them skarnu knew as much whether merkela did or not when merkela fled the farm shed left everything behind algarvian mages could use her clothes or her cooking gear and the law of contagion to help find her you didnt have to be a mage to know that objects once in contact remained in contact fortunately you did have to be a mage to do anything about it algarvian mages were spread thin these days the war wasnt going so well for the redheads maybe they wouldnt worry so much about one renegade valmieran noble in the larger scheme of things skarnu wasnt that important so he hoped they would reckon the odds anyway it all boiled down to how badly did they want him he sighed the other side of the coin was they were liable to want him quite a bit with both his sister and amatu howling for his blood he didnt dare get too sure he was safe merkelas thought followed a different ley line after another sip of tea she said how long can they keep holding down our kingdom sibiu is free again or just about aye i think so skarnu nodded the news sheets would talk more about the fighting there if it were going better for algarve but the sibs didnt free themselves lagoas and kuusamo beat king mezentio and took the kingdom away from him and its a lot easier to invade some islands in the middle of the sea than to put soldiers ashore on the derlavaian mainland for a moment merkela looked as if she hated him i want to be free again she said i want that so much id before she could say what she might do gedominu started to whimper merkela laughed ruefully nobody who wants to be free should ever have a baby she picked him up and held him in the crook of her elbow maybe that was what he wanted for he quieted down whered that honey jar go skarnu got up and opened it he tore a piece off a loaf of black bread dipped it in the honey and ate it back before the war he would have turned up his nose at the idea of such a breakfast now he knew that any breakfast at all was a long way toward being a good one fix some of that for me too would you merkela said skarnu nodded and did gedominu stared up at his mother as if trying to understand what shed just said his intent expression made skarnu start to laugh the world must be a demon of a confusing place for babies he remarked as he handed merkela the bread and honey of course it is merkela said its a demon of a confusing place for everybody she took a bite gedominu was still watching wideeyed she shook her head at him you cant have any of this not till you get bigger the babys face screwed up he started to cry skarnu started to laugh thatll teach you to tell him what he cant do he said merkela jiggled gedominu up and down and from side to side he subsided she let out a sigh of relief someone knocked on the door a quick hard urgent knock skarnu had been about to pour himself another cup of tea he froze so did merkela with a bite of bread halfway to her mouth nobody in erzvilkas had any business here at this hour the knock came again skarnu grabbed a knife and went to the door who is it he growled his voice clotted with suspicion not the redheads and cursed lucky for you hearing that rough reply skarnu unbarred the door and worked the latch sure enough raunu stood in the hallway skarnu looked him up and down no youre not the redheads he agreed but if youre here now you dont think theyre very far behind you theyre sniffing around all right the veteran sergeant agreed time for you and yours to pack up and go what about you skarnu demanded what about the kaunians from forthweg patiently raunu said im not a captain im not a marquis as far as the algarvians are concerned people like me are two for a copper and vatsyunas and pernavai are just a loose end you though youre a prize and your ladys bait hes right merkela said from behind skarnu we have to go she held little gedominu in her arms and also carried a sack full of diapers when theres no other choice we run and then we strike again another time raunu smiled at her and gave her half a bow as if her veins not skarnus held noble blood thats good sense youve always shown good sense as long as ive known you he turned back to skarnu come on captain weve a mage of sorts downstairs ready to block the redheads searching as best she can a mage of sorts in spite of everything skarnu smiled that sounds interesting but the smile slipped he was worried about merkela can you flee again so soon out of childbed he asked her of course i can she said at once i have to do you think i want to fall into the algarvians hands he had no answer to that lets go then he said roughly raunus shoulders rose and straightened as if hed just had a burden lifted from them he hurried for the stairs skarnu and merkela followed when they got to the stairway skarnu took the baby and the sack of cloths merkela didnt protest a telling measure of how worn she was out on the street a carriage waited skarnu let out his own sigh of relief when he saw it no matter how fiercely insistent she was merkela couldnt have got far on foot also waiting was raunus mage of sorts she couldnt have been above fifteen her figure half formed her hair stringy pimples splashing her cheeks and chin in a low voice skarnu said shes going to hold the algarvian wizards off our trail it wasnt low enough the girl heard him she flushed but spoke steadily i think i can do that aye the techniques for breaking affinities have improved remarkably since the days of the six years war skarnu stared she certainly spoke as if she knew what she was doing raunu let out a soft grunt of laughter he said ive been pretty impressed with palasta i have maybe i see why skarnu answered and bowed to her get you gone palasta told him thats the point of this business after all from now on powers above willing the algarvians will have a harder time coming after you raunu had already helped merkela up into the carriage now he slapped skarnu on the back and gave him a little push skarnu handed merkela gedominu and the bag of cloths then scrambled up beside her the driver another man from the underground flicked the reins the carriage started to roll fleeing again skarnu thought bitterly he reached out and set his hand on merkelas this time at least he had what mattered most to him the silversmiths shop that had been kugus remained closed every so often talsu would walk by just for the satisfaction of seeing it locked and dark and quiet he knew better than to do that very often someone might note it and report him to the algarvians he was grimly certain kugu hadnt been the only collaborator in skrunda hed wondered if the redheads would come around asking questions of him after kugus untimely demise so far they hadnt a forensic mage could have assured them he hadnt been in the room when the silversmith perished that was true but truth here had many layers he also knew algarve still had foes in his home town he wondered if kugus former students were among the men responsible for the new graffiti he saw on so many walls these days habakkuk they read and habakkuk is coming and he wondered what in blazes habakkuk was whatever it is mezentios men dont like it gailisa said when talsu wondered out loud at supper one evening have you seen them putting together gangs of people they drag off the street to paint it out wherever they find it talsu nodded aye i have thats got to mean its something good for jelgava he laughed feels funny hoping for something without knowing what im hoping for i know what im hoping for traku said dipping a piece of barley bread in garlicflavored olive oil im hoping for more orders of winter gear from algarvians heading off to unkerlant that wouldnt make me unhappy at all habakkuk or no habakkuk i wont say youre wrong there because youre right talsu nodded again but its such a funny name or word or whatever it is it doesnt sound jelgavan at all is it classical kaunian his father asked its nothing kugu ever taught me anyhow traku answered and kugu taught me all sorts of things he paused recalling some of the painful lessons hed learned from the silversmith then he said pass me the bread and oil would you please his mother beamed thats good thats very good ausra said high time you got some meat back on your bones talsu knew better than to argue with his mother about such things later in the small room that now seemed even smaller because he shared it with gailisa he asked his wife am i still as skinny as all that theres certainly more to you than there was when you first came home gailisa said after a brief pause for thought back then i think your shadow took up more room in bed than you did but youre still skinnier than you were before the algarvians grabbed you he lay down on the bed and grinned up at her if i take up more room now than i used to maybe you can get on top tonight gailisa stuck out her tongue at him i did that anyhow when you came back or have you forgotten i didnt want you working too hard now her eyes sparkled as she started to undo the toggles on her tunic well why not shed just gone off to her fathers grocery store the next morning when an algarvian captain strode into the tailors shop good morning sir traku said to him and what can we do for you today he didnt ask the redhead if he was looking for something warm the algarvian might have taken that as gloating over a trip to unkerlant which would have cost traku business but this particular algarvian turned out not to be going to unkerlant pointing to talsu he spoke in good jelgavan you are talsu son of traku is it not so aye talsu answered as his father had he asked what can i do for you today sir but he feared he knew the answer sure enough the algarvian said we havent heard much from you wed hoped for more quite a lot more im sorry sir replied talsu who was anything but ive just stayed close to home and minded my own business i havent heard anything much with a frown the algarvian said thats not why we ordered you turned loose you know we expected to get some use out of you and so you have by the powers above traku put in i couldnt have done half as much for you people without my son here stitching right beside me thats not what i meant the redhead said pointedly i dont care traku growled father talsu said in some alarm he didnt want to go back to the dungeon himself no but he didnt want to send his father there on his account either but traku wasnt inclined to listen to him either glaring at the algarvian he went on i dont care what you meant i tell you go ask the soldiers whove left this sunny land of ours for unkerlant ask them about their tunics and kilts and capes and cloaks ask them if talsus done something worth doing for them then come back here and complain if youve got the nerve now the algarvian captain frankly stared at him odds were nobody in jelgava had ever dared talk back to him before he didnt seem to know what to make of it at last he said you play a dangerous game still furious traku shook his head im not playing games at all for you maybe its a game for me and my son its our lives and our livelihood why dont you cursed well leave us alone and let us mind our own business like talsu here said he was shouting shouting loud enough to make ausra come halfway down the stairs to find out what was going on when talsus mother saw the redhead in the shop she let out a horrified gasp and retreated in a hurry talsu sighed in relief hed feared she would lay into the algarvian the same way his father had the captain said there is service and then there is service you are trying to tell me that one kind is worth as much as another in this you then to talsus astonishment he grinned in this you may be right i do not say you are i say you may be someone of higher rank than i will make the final decision he bowed and strolled out of the shop talsu gaped at his father that was one of the bravest things i ever saw he said was it traku shrugged i dont know anything about that all i know is i was too little to go off and fight the redheads in the last war and i get bloody sick of bending my neck and going aye sir whenever they come through the door so i told this son of a whore a couple of plain truths thats all thats not all talsu said you know the risk you were running what risk traku didnt want to take him seriously you went after the algarvians with a stick in your hands that now that was running a risk this isnt so much not even close he coughed once or twice thereve been times when ive sounded like it was your fault jelgava didnt lick those algarvian buggers i know there have im sorry for it talsu tried to remember if hed ever heard his father apologize for anything before he didnt think so he didnt quite know how to respond either he finally said dont worry about it i never have that was true though perhaps not in a way traku would have cared to know talsu discounted everything his father had to say about the war precisely because traku hadnt seen it for himself what soldier ever born took seriously a civilians opinions about fighting they went back to work in companionable silence after a while ausra appeared on the stairs again laitsina behind her when the two women didnt see the algarvian they came all the way down is everything all right they asked together everything is fine traku said gruffly sometimes its a little harder to make people see sense than it is other times thats all you made an algarvian see sense laitsina sounded as if she couldnt believe her ears he sure did talsu thumped his father on the shoulder traku to his astonishment blushed like a girl ausra came over and kissed her husband on the cheek that made traku blush more than ever ausra and laitsina went upstairs again talsu and traku looked at each other before they started work again maybe the algarvian captain had seen sense aye but maybe hed just gone for reinforcements more redheads or perhaps some jelgavan constables or maybe his superiors would overrule him having been in the army talsu knew how easily that could happen but the algarvian didnt come back with or without reinforcements as the day wore on toward evening talsu began to believe he wouldnt when gailisa came back from the grocers shop talsu told her how brave traku had been she clapped her hands together and kissed traku on the cheek too that made talsus father turn even redder than the kiss from his own wife had supper was barley porridge enlivened with garlic olives cheese raisins and wine food for hard times talsu remembered that huge piece of mutton hed eaten with kugu then he shrugged the company was better here when he went off to his cramped little bedchamber with gailisa that thought occurred to him again rather more forcefully he kissed her what was that for she asked smiling just because talsu answered because youre not kugu struck him as the wrong thing to say he did add i like kissing you do you gailisa gave him a sidelong look what else would you like they found something they both liked as a result they were sleeping soundly when eggs started falling on skrunda the first bursts made talsu sit bolt upright instantly wide awake after his time in the army he would never mistake that sound and never fail to respond to it either downstairs he exclaimed springing out of bed weve got to get downstairs powers above i wish we had a cellar to hide in he heard his parents and sister calling out in their bedrooms downstairs he cried again this time at the top of his lungs well hide behind the counter its good and thick better than nothing only later did he stop to think that going downstairs in pitch blackness was liable to be more dangerous than having an egg burst close by but the whole family got down safe they huddled behind the counter chilly and frightened and crowded and uncomfortable the news sheets will be screaming about air pirates tomorrow traku predicted not if one of these eggs bursts on their office they wont laitsina said i hope some of them burst on the algarvians here in town talsu said otherwise the lagoans or kuusamans up there on those dragons are just wasting their eggs why are they bothering us his mother wailed as an egg came down close by and made the building shake we havent done anything to them talsu did his best to think like a general and a foreign general at that if they strike at jelgava he said that makes it harder for the algarvians to pull men out of our kingdom and send them to unkerlant he paused that means father and i wont sell the redheads so many cloaks curse the foreigners in that case traku exclaimed maybe he meant it maybe he was joking maybe he was doing both at once any which way talsu laughed in spite of the death raining down on his home town may it strike the algarvians indeed just as my sister said he thought and hoped the powers above were listening colonel spinellos leyline caravan glided to a stop in a battered city in eastern forthweg not that there were any cities in forthweg eastern or western that werent battered the corporal doing conductor duty bawled this here is gromheort twohour layover were picking up some men and some horses here twohour layover gromheort spinello murmured hed been through this place before when he was posted in oyngestun back in the days when the war was easy when he thought of oyngestun he thought of the kaunian girl hed enjoyed there hed whiled away a lot of bitter hours in unkerlant telling stories about vanai gromheort was the biggest forthwegian town near the algarvian border almost without a doubt the kaunians from oyngestun would have been brought here to make it easier for the algarvians to ship them west for sacrifice if vanai was here if he could find her and bring her back she wont be sacrificed and i wont have to sleep with some dumpy unkerlanter peasant wench spinello thought itll work out fine for both of us he got up and limped to the door of the caravan car his leg still wasnt everything it might have been but he could use it and algarve these days needed every man even remotely able to fight to throw into the battle against king swemmel outside the depot a newssheet vendor was waving a copy of his wares and shouting in forthwegian spinello had only a smattering of forthwegian but he got the gist algarvian dragons striking hard at sibiu his mouth twisted some of the more ignorant or more forgetful forthwegians might take that as an algarvian victory but if lagoas and kuusamo hadnt swooped down on the island kingdom algarvian dragons would have had no need to set upon it he saw no obvious kaunians on the street but what did that prove hed heard about the sorcery that let them look like forthwegians and about the trouble it had caused the occupying authorities when he spotted a plump redheaded constable in tunic and kilt he waved to the man you there for a moment he thought the fat constable would pretend he hadnt heard but the fellow didnt quite dare aye colonel he said coming up what do you want do you by any chance know for a fact whether the kaunians from a noaccount village called oyngestun were brought here for safekeeping spinello asked i do know that the constables chest swelled with selfimportance till it stuck out almost as far as his belly helped bring those blonds in myself did you that was better than spinello had hoped for good do you chance to recall a girl named vanai then shed be worth recalling and sure enough the constable nodded she live with an old foof named brivibas didnt she cute little piece thats right spinello agreed his granddaughter im bound for unkerlant and i want to get her out of the kaunian quarter here and take her along to keep my bed warm dont blame you a bit the constable said but i dont think you can do it dont tell me shes been shipped west spinello exclaimed that would be a horrible waste i cant prove it one way or the other the constable replied ill tell you this though that brivibas whoreson is dead as shoe leather i caught him myself me bembo bastard put on his sorcerous disguise you know the blonds do he waited for spinello to nod then looking smug went on that disguise doesnt do anything for a voice and i recognized his he hanged himself in his gaol cell and nobody misses him a bit not so far as i can see spinello missed brivibas he missed him a good deal brivibas was a key to getting vanai to do what he wanted sooner than watch her dusty old granddad kill himself as a roadbuilder shed peeled off her clothes and opened her legs spinello sighed so you dont think anybody could find vanai in a hurry not a chance the constable bembo paused again frowning in fact come to think of it she never got hauled into gromheort at all if i remember right she ran off before we cleaned all the kaunians out of oyngestun powers above spinello glared at him why didnt you say that sooner whod she run off with some boy maybe that fellow from plegmunds brigade had known what he was talking about after all i dont know all the ins and outs of it bembo laughed loudly at his own wit if it werent for her mouthy old grandfather i might not remember her at all its not like i ever laid her or anything all right all right spinello who had knew when to give up he turned cursing under his breath at a good idea wasted and went back to the depot before long the leyline caravan was gliding west across forthweg again it stopped in eoforwic to pick up more reinforcements then slid on toward the fighting front towns and villages in western forthweg and in unkerlant had taken even more damage and more recent damage than those farther east swemmels men might not have fought skillfully but theyd fought hard from the very beginning and they or their brethren who practiced the nasty art of the guerrilla kept right on making themselves difficult the caravan had to halt twice before it got to the front for unkerlanter irregulars had burst eggs on the ley line and overloaded its energycarrying capacity algarvian mages had to put the damage right and there werent enough of them to go around at last a day and a half later than he should have spinello got down from the caravan car in the wreckage of a town named pewsum a sergeant was standing on the platform at the depot holding up a leaf of paper with his name printed on it in big letters im spinello he said cane in one hand carpetbag in the other the sergeant saluted pleased to meet you sir welcome to the brigade here let me get that for you he relieved spinello of the carpetbag now if youll just come with me ive got a wagon waiting efficiency spinello remarked and the sergeant grinned at him algarvians did their best to practice what king swemmel preached but the locally built wagon testified to genuine unkerlanter efficiency it was highwheeled and curvebottomed and could go through mud that bogged down anyalgarvian vehicle as the sergeant flicked the reins and the horses got moving spinello said we cant have too many of these wagons no matter how we get em nothing like em in the fall or the spring thats the truth sir powers above be praised that you see it the driver said sometimes we can get them from units that think something has to come from trapani to be any good if our neighbors want to be fools its no skin off our noses no indeed spinello said but then he checked himself the way things are nowadays nobody algarvian can afford to be a fool we have to leave that for the unkerlanters after a few seconds of very visible thought the sergeant nodded brigade headquarters lay in a little village called ubach a couple of miles northwest of pewsum getting there took more than an hour though unkerlanter wagons could get through the mud nothing could get through it very fast the sergeant pointed to the firstmans house thatll be yours sir ill let the regimental commanders know youre here so you can meet them thanks spinello looked around ubach with something less than overwhelming curiosity hed already seen more unkerlanter villages than hed ever wanted a few peasants tramped along the streets doing their best to keep their long tunics out of the mud some nodded to him as the wagon sloshed by rather more pretended he didnt exist hed seen all that before too and then he did a double take seeing a pretty young kaunian girl in ubach was the last thing hed expected she reminded him achingly of vanai though she was even younger and he thought even prettier pointing her way he asked whats she doing here oh yadwigai the sergeant blew her a kiss he raised his voice hello sweetheart the blond girl yadwigai waved back hello sergeant she called in good algarvian is that the new colonel there aye it is the sergeant answered and blew her another kiss is she yours spinello poked the sergeant in the ribs you lucky dog oh no sir the soldier driving him sounded shocked ah spinello nodded wisely a pet for one of the officers then he sighed wishing again that hed been lucky enough to get his hands on vanai during the layover at gromheort but the sergeant shook his head once more no sir he repeated yadwigai isnt anybodys not any one mans i mean she belongs to the brigade really spinello knew he sounded astonished hed seen more camp followers than hed ever wanted to too yadwigai had none of their hard bitter look if anything she put him in mind of a prosperous merchants daughter happy and right on the edge of being spoiled aye sir the sergeant replied and then realizing what spinello had to mean no sir not like that shes not our whore wed kill anybody who tried doing anything like that with her shes our our luck i guess you might say spinello scratched his head youd better tell me more he said at last the sergeant had to know what happened to most of the kaunians the algarvians brought into unkerlant spinello wondered if yadwigai did well its like this sir the sergeant said halting the wagon in front of the firstmans house we picked her up in a village in western forthweg when we first started fighting swemmels buggers and weve brought her along ever since weve had good fortune ever since too and i dont think theres a man among us who wouldnt die to help keep her safe shes sweet sir you know what im saying all right sergeant i wont mess with your goodluck charm spinello could see that any other answer would land him in trouble with his new brigade before he met anyone in it but this fellow driving him he got down from the wagon and went into the firstmans hut along with the benches against the walls that marked unkerlanter peasant houses the main room held an algarvianissue cot folding table and chairs a map was tacked down on the table spinello studied it while the sergeant brought in his carpetbag set it down beside the cot and went out again officers started coming in to greet their new commander a few minutes later the brigade was made up of five regiments majors led four of them a captain the fifth spinello nodded to himself hed led a regiment as a major too very pleased to make your acquaintance gentlemen he said bowing by what i saw on the map we have a good deal of work ahead of us to make sure king swemmels whoresons stay where they belong but i think we can bring it off i tell you frankly id be a lot more worried if we didnt have yadwigai here to make sure everything turned out all right the officers stared then they broke into broad smiles a couple of them even clapped their hands spinello smiled too at least as much at himself as at his subordinates sure as sure hed got his new command off on the right foot with your kind permission milady colonel lurcanio said bowing i should like to invite count amatu to supper again tomorrow night krasta drummed her fingers on the frame of the doorway in which she was standing must you she said i dont like hearing my brother cursed in the house that is was his home i understand that lurcanio bowed again i shall do my best to persuade amatu to be moderate but i should be grateful if you would say aye he needs to feel welcome in priekule he needs to feel not quite everybody hates him you mean krasta tossed her head if he curses skarnu i will hate him and i will let him know about it even you dont do that for which praise such as it is i thank you lurcanio bowed once more professionally speaking i quite admire your brother he is as slippery as olive oil we thought we had him again not long ago but he slipped through our fingers again did he krasta kept her voice as neutral as she could she was glad the algarvians hadnt caught skarnu but knew lurcanio could and would make her unhappy for showing it changing the subject and yielding on the side issue struck her as a good idea with a theatrical sigh she said i suppose amatu is welcome tomorrow night you said if he behaves himself you are gracious and generous colonel lurcanio said qualities few people had accused krasta of having he went on might i also beg one more favor would it be possible for your cook to serve something other than beef tongue krastas eyes sparkled why of course she said and her prompt agreement made lurcanio bow yet again krasta kissed him on the cheek and hurried into the kitchen count amatu will be coming for supper again tomorrow night she told the cook do you by any chance have some tripe in the rest crate there he nodded aye milady i do indeed he hesitated then said from what i know of algarvians the colonel will be less happy at eating tripe than count amatu will but amatu is our honored guest and so his wishes must come first krasta batted her eyes in artful artlessness she doubted she convinced the cook if lurcanio asked him why hed prepared a supper unlikely to be to an algarvians taste though he had only to repeat what she said and she would stay out of trouble she hoped she would stay out of trouble anyhow the cook dipped his head aye milady and i suppose you will want the side dishes to come from the countryside too he didnt quite smile but something in his face told krasta he knew what she was up to sure enough all she said was im certain count amatu would enjoy that pickled beets perhaps lurcanio wouldnt be happy with tripe and pickled beets or whatever else the cook came up with but she didnt think he would be so unhappy as to do something drastic still having given the cook his instructions krasta thought she might be wise to get out of the house for a while she ordered her driver to take her into priekule aye milady he said let me harness the horses for you and well be on our way he took the opportunity to don a broadbrimmed hat and throw on a heavy cloak too the slight sloshing noise krasta heard between hoofbeats came from somewhere by his left hip a flask under the cloak she realized that would also help keep him warm thinking of lurcanio discomfited put krasta in such a good mood she didnt even snap at the driver for drinking on the job he stopped the carriage on a side street just off the avenue of equestrians krasta looked back over her shoulder as she hurried toward priekules toniest boulevard of shops hed already tilted the flask to his lips it wouldnt slosh nearly so much on the way back to the mansion it might not slosh at all she shrugged what could you expect from commoners but drunkenness she shrugged again much less happily when she started up the avenue of equestrians toward the park where the kaunian column of victory had stood from the days of the kaunian empire till a couple of winters before when the algarvians demolished it on the grounds that it reflected poorly on their barbarous ancestors shed got used to the columns no longer being there though its destruction had infuriated her the shrug came from the sorry state of the shops shed been unhappy about that ever since algarve occupied the capital of valmiera more shopfronts were vacant now than ever before more of the ones that still had goods had nothing krasta wanted no matter how many valmieran women aye and men too wore algarvianstyle kilts these days she couldnt bring herself to do it shed had kilts in her closet before the war but that had been fashion not compulsion she hated compulsion or at least being on the receiving end of it a couple of algarvian soldiers ogled her they did no more than that for which she was duly grateful she sneered at a valmieran girl in a very short kilt though she suspected the redheads would like the girl fine and she started to sneer at a valmieran man in an almost equally short kilt till he waved at her and she saw it was viscount valnu hello sweetheart he cried hurrying up to kiss her on the cheek how much of your money have you wasted this afternoon none yet krasta answered i havent found anything worth spending it on what a tragedy valnu exclaimed in that case why dont you buy me a mug of ale and maybe even a bite to eat to go with it he waved they stood in front of an eatery called classical cuisine maybe itll have dormice in honey he said if they do ill get you a big plate of them krasta promised but since valnu had made it plain shed be doing the buying she held the door open for him instead of the other way round he took the point and kissed her on the cheek again as he walked past her into the eatery she ordered ale for both of them and no dormice appearing on the bill of fare strips of smoked and salted beef to go with it i thank you valnu said and raised his mug in salute its all right krasta said its rather better than all right in fact really the tip of valnus rather sharp pink tongue appeared between his lips for a moment what have you got in mind darling he meant do you want to go to bed with me darling krasta did want to but didnt dare she had to get in her digs at her algarvian lover less directly im going to feed lurcanio tripe tomorrow night she answered and hell have to eat it and make as if he likes it you are valnu said he will how did you manage that i didnt or not mostly lurcanio did it himself and to himself krasta replied hes invited count amatu to supper again and amatu say what you will about him eats like a valmieran do you know him i used to back before the war havent seen much of him since valnu said krasta sighed and gulped down her ale i wish i could say the same hes a bit of a bore these days more than a bit if you want to know the truth valnu finished his ale too instead of ordering another round for both of them as krasta expected him to he got up and fluttered his fingers at her im terribly sorry my love but i must dash he said one of my dear friends will beat me to a pulp if he thinks ive stood him up he shrugged a comic shrug what can one do pick different friends krasta suggested instead of getting angry valnu only laughed and slid out of the eatery krasta bit down on a strip of smoked meat with quite unnecessary violence a waiter came up to her will there be anything else milady no she snarled and strode out of classical cuisine herself not even buying a new hat made her feel better the hat sported a jaunty peacock feather leaping up from the band an algarvian style although that perhaps fortunately didnt occur to her her driver hadnt got too drunk to take her back to her mansion the horse knew the way whether the driver was sure of it or not lurcanio praised the hat that made krasta feel a little guilty about the supper shed planned for the next evening but only a little not enough to change the menu if lurcanio would inflict amatu on her she would inflict tripe on him amatu for a wonder did have the sense not to talk much about skarnu when he came maybe lurcanio really had warned him to keep his mouth shut whatever the reason it made him much better company and he praised the tripe to the skies and made a pig of himself over it that made him better company still colonel lurcanio by contrast picked at his supper and drank more than he was in the habit of doing so sorry to see you go krasta told amatu when he took his leave to her surprise she meant it id be delighted to come again he answered you set a fine table eh colonel he turned to lurcanio the algarvians nod was halfhearted at best krasta hid a smile by swigging from her mug of ale amatus driver had had his supper with krastas servants she never even thought to wonder what they had eaten the counts carriage rattled off toward the heart of priekule standing in the doorway krasta watched till it was out of sight which in the allencompassing darkness that pervaded nights to foil lagoan dragons did not take long when she closed the door and turned around she almost bumped into lurcanio who stood closer behind her than shed thought she let out a startled squeak lurcanio said i trust you were amused serving up another supper not to my taste i served it for count amatu he certainly seemed to enjoy it but krasta eyeing lurcanio judged it the wrong moment for defiance and so changed her course putting a throaty purr in her voice she asked and what would you enjoy colonel and set a hand on his arm up in her bedchamber he showed her what he would enjoy she enjoyed it too he did know what he was doing even if he couldnt do it quite so often as a younger man might have tonight unusually he fell asleep beside her instead of going back to his own bed maybe hed put down even more ale with the supper hed disliked than krasta had thought she fell asleep too pleased in more ways than one some time in the middle of the night someone pounded on the bedchamber door someone who shouted lurcanios name and a spate of unintelligible algarvian lurcanio sprang out of bed still naked and hurried to the door also exclaiming in his own language then he remembered valmieran and called to krasta as if she were a servant light the lamp i need to find my clothes i need to go back to sleep she complained but she didnt dare disobey blinking in the sudden light she asked what on earth is worth making a fuss about at this hour amatu is dead lurcanio answered pulling up his kilt rebel bandits ambushed him on his way home from here powers below eat the bandits we needed that man his drivers dead too he threw on his tunic and rapidly buttoned it tell me milady did you mention to anyone to anyone at all mind you that the count would visit here tonight only to the cook so he would know to make something special krasta replied around a yawn lurcanio shook his head he is safe enough he cant fart without our knowing it let alone betray us you are certain of that of course i am as certain as i am that im sleepy krasta said lurcanio cursed in valmieran and then as if that didnt satisfy him said several things in algarvian that certainly sounded incandescent and krasta yawning again realized shed just told a lie though she hadnt intended to shed mentioned amatu to viscount valnu when they went into that place called classical cuisine which meant which means i hold valnus life in the hollow of my hand krasta thought i wonder what i ought to do with it cornelu would rather have entered tirgoviste harbor aboard his own leviathan but the lagoan and kuusaman naval patrols around the harbor were attacking all leviathans without warning the algarvians had already sneaked in a couple and sunk several warships and so cornelu stood on the foredeck of a lagoan leyline frigate and watched the wharves and piers come nearer speaking algarvian a lagoan lieutenant said coming home must feel good for you eh commander my kingdom no longer has king mezentios hobnailed boot on its neck cornelu replied also in the language of the enemy that feels very good indeed thinking hed got agreement the lagoan nodded and went away the frigate glided up to its assigned berth a pretty piece of work by its captain and the mages who kept it afloat sailors on the pier caught bow lines and stern lines and made the ship fast when the gangplank thudded down cornelu was the first man off the ship hed had a new seagreen uniform tunic and kilt made up in sigisoara town so that he looked every inch a proper sibian officer well almost every inch for the truly observant would have noticed he still wore lagoanissue shoes he cursed when he got a close look at the harbor buildings theyd taken a beating when the algarvians first seized the city and had been allowed to decay it would be a while before tirgoviste became a firstclass port again whoresons he muttered under his breath but he had more reasons and more urgent and intimate reasons for cursing mezentios men than what theyd done to the harbor district three algarvian officers had been billeted in the house his wife and daughter shared and he feared no he was all too certain costache had been more than friendly with them away from the harbor tirgoviste town looked better the town had yielded to algarve once the harbor installations fell and the algarvians hadnt made much of a stand here after lagoan and kuusaman soldiers gained a foothold elsewhere on tirgoviste island cornelu didnt know whether to be grateful to them for that or to sneer at them for their faintheartedness tirgoviste town rose rapidly from the sea cornelu was panting by the time he began to near his own house then he got a chance to rest for a squad of kuusamans herded a couple of companies worth of algarvian captives past him and he had to stop till they went by the algarvians towered over their slight swarthy captors but that didnt matter the kuusamans were the ones with the sticks a small crowd formed to watch the algarvians tramp past a few people shouted curses at mezentios defeated troopers but only a few most just stood silently and then behind cornelu somebody said look at our fancy officer back from overseas hes all decked out now but he couldnt run away fast enough when the algarvians came cornelu whirled fists clenched fury on his face but he couldnt tell which sibian had spoken and no one pointed at the wretch whod impugned his courage the last of the captives went by opening the intersection again cornelu let his hands drop he couldnt fight everybody however much he wanted to and he knew hed have a fight a few blocks ahead he turned back around and walked on algarvian recruiting broadsheets still clung to walls and fences cornelu spat at one of them then he wondered why he bothered they belonged to a different world and not just a different world now but a dead one he turned onto his own street hed envisioned knocking on the door having costache open it and watching astonishment spread over her face but there she was in front of the house carrying something out to the gutter in a dustpan a dead rat he saw as he got closer what the dustpan held wasnt the first thing he noticed however much he wished it would have been the way her belly bulged was she dumped the rat into the gutter then looked up and saw him she froze bent out over the street as if a sorcerer had turned her to stone then slowly and jerkily she straightened she did her best to put a welcoming smile on her face but it cracked and slid away and she gave up trying to hold it when she said you came back it sounded more like accusation than welcome aye cornelu had never imagined he could despise anyone so much and hed loved her once he knew he had but that made things worse not better so much worse did you think i wouldnt of course i did costache answered nobody thought the algarvians would lose the war and you were never coming home if they won she dropped the dustpan a clatter of tin her hands folded over her swollen stomach curse you do you think im the only one whos going to have a baby on account of mezentios men no but youre mine cornelu corrected himself you were mine and it wasnt as if you thought i was dead you knew i was still around you saw me you ate with me and you still did that he pointed to her belly as if it were a crime somehow separate from the woman hed wooed and married and lost oh aye i saw you scorn roughened costaches voice till it cut into cornelu like the teeth of a saw i saw you filthy and unshaven and stinking like the hillman you were pretending to be is it any wonder i never wanted anything to do with you after that he clapped a hand to his forehead you stupid slut he shouted i couldnt very well go around in uniform then do you think i wanted to end up in a captives camp or more likely blazed instead of answering right away costache looked all around as if to see which neighbors were likely drinking in the scandal that also seemed to remind her of the dustpan which she picked up oh come inside will you she said impatiently you dont have to do this in front of everyone do you why not cornelu slapped her in the face dont you think you deserve to be shamed her hand flew to her cheek i think she grimaced not with pain he thought but with disgust and not selfdisgust disgust at him what i think doesnt matter anymore does it it never will anymore will it she walked up the path to the house not caring or at least pretending not to care whether cornelu followed he did still almost too furious to speak in the front room brindza was playing with a doll the gift of an algarvian officer of the father of her half brother or sister to come cornelus own daughter shied away from him and said mama who is the strange man in the funny clothes brindza i am your father cornelu said but he could see that didnt mean anything to her go on back to your bedroom now sweetheart cornelu told her well talk about it later brindza did as she was told cornelu wished costache would have done the same he looked down at himself sibian naval uniform funny clothes maybe so brindza might never have seen it before that spoke unhappy volumes about the state of cornelus kingdom costache went into the kitchen he heard her getting down goblets and knew exactly the cupboard from which she was getting them he knew which cupboard held the wine and ale and spirits too costache came back carrying two goblets full of wine she thrust one of them at him here this will be bad enough any which way we may as well blur it a little i dont want to drink with you but cornelu took the goblet whether with her or not he did want to drink he took a big swig then made a face powers above thats foul the algarvians sent all their best vintages here didnt they i gave you what i have costache answered you gave everybody what you have didnt you cornelu pointed at her belly as he finished the wine costaches mouth tightened he went on and youre going to pay for it too by the powers above sibius free again anyone who sucked up to the algarvians he started to say something else along those lines but the thought so infuriated him he choked on the words is going to pay she just stood there watching him she has nerve curse her he thought angrily i dont suppose i could say anything that would make you change your mind she observed ha he clapped a hand to his forehead not likely whatll you tell me how handsome the algarvian was how good he was that got home costache flushed till the handprint on her cheek seemed to fade she said i could talk about how lonely i was and how afraid too aye you could cornelu said you might even get some softheaded softhearted fool to believe it too but so what you wont even get me to listen i didnt think so costache said tonelessly you never had any forgiveness in you and im sure you never got into bed with anyone all the time you were away were not talking about me were talking about you cornelu snapped im not carrying an algarvians bastard you miserable little whore you were sleeping with mezentios men when you knew i was on tirgoviste island do you even know which one put the baby in you how do you know what i was doing or what i wasnt she asked how do i know they were chasing me thats how cornelu howled i came down here out of the hills hoping id find some way to shake free of them and bring you and brindza along with me and what did i find what did i find you telling the algarvians how much theyd enjoy it thats what he took a couple of quick steps across the room and slapped her again she staggered the goblet flew out of her hand and shattered on the floor she straightened the whole side of her face red now did you enjoy that she asked aye he growled breathing hard he might have been in battle his heart pounded his stomach churned he raised his hand to hit her once more then quite suddenly his stomach did more than churn it knotted horrible pain filled him he bent double clutching at his belly the next thing he knew hed crumpled to the floor costache stood over him looking down calmly she said the warning on the packet was true it does work on people the same way it works on rats you poisoned me he choked tasting blood in his mouth he tried to reach for her to grab her to pull her down but his hands obeyed him only slowly oh so slowly she stepped back not very far she didnt need to step back very far so i did she told him calm still i knew what youd be like and i was right her voice seemed to come from farther and father away cornelu stared up at her you wont get away with it his own words seemed to come from farther and farther away too i have a chance she said he tried to answer this time no words came he still stared up but he saw nothing at all nineteenb see that that gets translated into algarvian hajjaj told his secretary but let me review the translation before we send it on to marquis balastro and then are you listening to me im sorry your excellency qutuz had cocked his head to one side and seemed to be listening not to the zuwayzi foreign minister but to something outside king shazlis palace is that thunder nonsense hajjaj said aye fall and winter were the rainy season in zuwayza but the day the whole week had been fine and dry and sunny but then his ears also caught the low rumble the younger man had heard before him he frowned that is thunder but it cant be he and qutuz both found the answer more slowly than they should have they both found it at the same time too eggs qutuz blurted while hajjaj exclaimed the unkerlanters ever since the war began king swemmels dragonfliers had occasionally visited bishah they hadnt come in large numbers they could hardly afford to not with unkerlant locked in a lifeordeath struggle against algarve as far as hajjaj could tell theyd mounted the attacks more to remind the zuwayzin that swemmel hadnt forgotten about them than for any other reason the unkerlanter dragons had also done their best to hit the algarvian ministry in bishah but theyd never quite succeeded hajjaj didnt need long to realize this morning would be different theyre dropping a good many eggs today arent they he remarked doing his best to stay calm or at least not to show he was anything else but aye your excellency so they are qutuz took his cue from hajjaj but he had less practice at seeming dispassionate while actually frightened or furious more roars of bursting eggs beat against hajjajs ears they were coming closer to the palace now too so he no longer had any doubt what they were the ground started shaking under his fundament as if at an earthquake pen cases and leaves of paper on his desk trembled and quivered perhaps qutuz said we ought to look for shelter where hajjaj asked not at all rhetorically hed read that people in setubal and sulingen and other places that often came under attack from the air took refuge in cellars cellars however had never been a part of zuwayzi architecture and no one had ever dreamt the unkerlanters would really pummel bishah im getting under my desk qutuz declared and hurried off to do just that hajjaj nodded approval it wasnt a bad notion at all he crawled under his own for once he wished he were in the habit of working at it in a chair rather than sitting on the floor he would have had more room under there his joints creaked as he tried to fold himself into as small a space as he could then the first eggs fell on the royal palace for the next little while hajjaj had nothing whatever to do with whether he lived or died the ground shook windows blew out walls fell in chunks of the roof came crashing down one of them landed where hed been sitting while talking with his secretary another came down on the desk but wasnt heavy enough to crush it and incidentally hajjaj someone was screaming after a moment hajjaj realized that was his own voice he bit down hard on his lower lip to make himself stop then he wondered why he bothered plenty of people surely were screaming right now but he kept on biting his lip instead pride is a strange thing he thought a strange thing but a very strong one an eternity later an eternity probably measurable as a couple of minutes the eggs stopped landing on and around the palace and started falling farther north in bishah hajjaj had to fight his way out from under the desk some of the rubble all but caged him there qutuz he called are you all right aye your excellency the secretary came running into hajjajs office powers above be praised that youre safe im well enough hajjaj said but youre bleeding he pointed to a gash on qutuzs left calf his secretary looked down at it when he looked up again astonishment filled his face i didnt even know it was there he said well it needs bandaging thats plain hajjaj used a letteropener to cut up cushions to get cloth to wrap around qutuzs leg he would have had a simpler time of it had either of them worn clothes i thank you your excellency qutuz said there are bound to be plenty of people hurt a lot worse than i am wed better see what we can do for them youre right hajjaj went over to the little closet that opened onto his office his ceremonial wardrobe lay in chaos on the floor he didnt care he tossed his secretary a couple of tunics and kilts and grabbed some for himself seeing qutuzs bewilderment he spoke aloud his thought of a moment before bandages ah qutuzs face cleared thats clever thats very clever its cleverness i wish we didnt need hajjaj said grimly come on lets make for the audience chamber and the throne room that was as close as he would come to admitting he was worried about king shazli his secretarys eyes widened but qutuz didnt worry out loud either and they both had plenty to do before they got anywhere near the throne room people were down and groaning in the hallways some of them the ones with broken bones needed more than bandaging some were beyond all help hajjaj and qutuz found not only bodies but buried bodies and pieces of bodies before long their sandals left bloody footprints at every stride someone around the corner of a corridor barked peremptory orders get that rubble off him grab that roof beam and lift maybe we can still save his leg hajjajs heart leaped within him he knew that voice your majesty he called behind him qutuz whooped is that you hajjaj the king asked powers above be praised youre whole and hale powers below eat the unkerlanters for doing this to us he went back to the rescue he was leading heave there all of you a shriek not king shazlis followed easy there my friend shazli said itll be better now dust and dirt and blood covered shazli when hajjaj finally reached his side but the king needed no fancy trappings to gain obedience when he gave a command everyone who heard hurried to carry it out people respected him for the man he was as well as for the rank he held very good indeed to see you in one piece your excellency he told hajjaj when the foreign minister reached his side swemmels whoresons have struck us a heavy blow here aye your majesty hajjaj knew more than a little gratitude that the king didnt blame him for the unkerlanter attack or if he did didnt say so in public we are going to have to strengthen our defenses against dragons around the city shazli said if the unkerlanters did this once theyll come back to do it again thats true your majesty hajjaj bowed with no small respect i hadnt thought so far ahead that such a thing could happen once to bishah was appalling enough that it might happen again and again he shivered do you know whether general ikhshid lives king shazli asked im sorry but no hajjaj answered i have no idea the eggs stopped falling and the first thing i wanted to do was make sure you were safe here i stand shazli had lived the softest of soft lives he was inclined to be pudgy and had never looked particularly impressive but there was iron in him king swemmel will think he can put fear in us so that we will do whatever he wants he will find he is wrong he will find he cannot make us bend our necks by dropping eggs from the sky several of the people in the damaged hallway clapped their hands hajjaj almost clapped himself he did bow again this is the spirit that led your father to reclaim our freedom after the unkerlanters ruled us for so long king shazli nodded and we shall stay free come what may are we not still the men of the desert our forefathers were in days gone by even so your majesty hajjaj replied though he and the king both knew the zuwayzin were no such thing this generation was more urban and more like townsfolk in the rest of derlavai than any before it but shazli had to know saying such things was the best way to rally his people neither of them mentioned that the kings father had needed to free zuwayza because the unkerlanters had been strong enough to hold it down for generations and neither of them mentioned that enough blows like the one the unkerlanters had just delivered might break any peoples will to say nothing of ability to keep on fighting hajjaj understood both those things painfully well this did not seem the best time to ask shazli whether he did too i shall find out what we need to learn about ikhshid the king said he pointed at hajjaj i want you to find a crystallomancer and speak to marquis balastro assure him we are still in the fight and see what help we can hope to get from algarve as you say hajjajs cough had nothing to do with the dust and smoke in the air it was pure diplomacy seeing how things are going for them in their own fight against unkerlant i dont know what theyll be able to spare us shazli fortunately recognized a diplomatic cough when he heard one you may tell the marquis that we need tools to stay in the fight they have more dragons than we do they also have more highly trained mages than we do theyre bound to be better off when it comes to things like heavy sticks that can knock a dragon out of the sky every word you say there is true hajjaj agreed ill do what i can he nodded to qutuz to the crystallomancers his secretary nodded and followed one of the thick mudbrick walls of the crystallomancers office had a new yardwide hole in it some of their tables were overturned some of their crystals were bright jagged shards on the floor some of them were bleeding but one of the men who hadnt been hurt quickly established an etheric connection with the algarvian ministry balastros image stared out of a surviving crystal at hajjaj good to see you in one piece your excellency the redhead said and you hajjaj answered king shazli expects the unkerlanters to pay us more such calls i shouldnt be surprised balastro said they missed me this time so theyll have to come back and try again hajjaj smiled at his selfimportance which was partly an act and partly typical of a lot of algarvians the zuwayzi foreign minister said any help you can give us well be grateful for and put to good use we have the men to serve heavy sticks and the men to fly dragons if only we could get them then the unkerlanters wouldnt have such an easy time of it ill pass that along balastro said when we havent got enough of anything ourselves i dont know what theyll say about it back in trapani but ill pass it on with my recommendation that they give you all they can his eyes narrowed he was shrewd was balastro after all we have to keep you fighting swemmel too you and king shazli see things much alike here hajjaj said i am glad of it and i hope it does some good but will it will anything captain orosio stuck his head into colonel sabrinos tent sir the field post is here the squadron commander said is it sabrino rose from his folding chair he winced the blazed shoulder hed taken escaping the unkerlanters after his dragon was flamed out of the sky still pained him he wore a wound badge along with his other decorations now he knew how lucky he was to be alive and savored survival with algarvian gusto lets see what weve got then he wore the furs and leather in which he would have flown into the frigid upper air it was frigid enough down here on the ground in the kingdom of grelz the third winter of the war against unkerlant he thought with a sort of dull wonder hed never imagined not that first heady summer when the algarvians plunged ahead on their western adventure that the war against king swemmel could last into its third winter hed found a lot of things here that hed never imagined then the postman who wasnt a dragonflier looked cold but algarvian soldiers who stayed on the ground werent always freezing as they had that first dreadful winter for which theyd been so woefully unprepared the fellow saluted as sabrino came up to him here you go colonel he said and handed the wing commander an envelope thanks sabrino recognized the handwriting at once to orosio he said from my wife ah orosio stepped back a couple of paces to give him privacy to read it opening the envelope with gloved hands was a clumsy business but sabrino managed inside were two pages closely written in gismondas clear precise script as was her way she came straight to the point i have good reason to believe that your mistress has taken up with another man she told him fronesia has been seen too much with an infantry officer some say a major others a colonel to leave any doubt that he has seen too much of her that being so i suggest you let him pay for her flat and her extravagances and so i shall sabrino muttered whats that sir oraste asked cut off my mistress support sabrino answered my wife tells me some colonel of footsoldiers or whatever he may be is getting the benefits from her these days if hes getting the benefits by the powers above he can bloody well pay the freight too i should say so but orosios rather heavy features clouded as long as youre sure your wifes telling the truth that is sabrino nodded oh aye without a doubt gismonda has never given me any trouble about fronesia i should hope she wouldnt my dear fellow do you know a proper algarvian noble who hasnt got a mistress or two aside from the handful who have boys on the side instead i mean well captain orosio hesitated then said theres me sabrino slapped him on the back and we know what your problem is youve been here fighting a war and serving your kingdom you get back to civilization youll need to carry a constables club to beat the women back maybe orosio kicked at the frozen dirt like a youth just beginning to think about girls itd be nice sabrino slapped him on the back again itll happen he said wondering if it would orosio was a nobleman all right or hed have had an even harder time making officers rank than he had but you needed to squint hard at his pedigree to be sure of it hed have risen further and faster otherwise for he was a firstrate soldier there were times when sabrino was glad orosio hadnt been in position to hope for a wing of his own to command he was too useful and able a subordinate to want to lose well maybe orosio said again he knew what held him back he could hardly help knowing after another kick at the dirt he went on the way our losses are these days were getting more outandout commoners as officers than we probably ever did in all our history till now it could be sabrino agreed the six years war was hard on our noble families too put it together with this one and he sighed when the war is over the king will have to grant a lot of patents of nobility just to keep the ranks from getting too thin i suppose so orosios laugh sent fog spurting from his mouth and then the families who were noble before the war will spend the next five hundred years looking down their noses at the new ones thats the truth sabrino laughed too but as happened so often these days the laughter didnt want to stick better that than having some other king tell us who our nobles will be and who they wont be in centuries gone by valmiera and jelgava and forthweg and even yanina had meddled in algarvian affairs backing now this local prince now that one as puppet or catspaw once upon a time sibiu had ruled a broad stretch of the coastline of southern algarve those bad days those days when a man was embarrassed to admit he was an algarvian were gone algarve had taken its right place in the sun a kingdom among kingdoms a great kingdom among great kingdoms but algarve didnt hold sibiu anymore and not far away eggs burst a quick hard drumbeat of noise sabrinos head swung in that direction as he gauged the sound and what it might mean so did orosios unkerlanters orosio said aye sabrino hated to nod they didnt even let the mud slow them down this autumn now that the grounds hard again i dont know how were going to hold them out of herborn neither do i orosio said but wed cursed well better because well have a demon of a time hanging on to the rest of grelz if we lose it oh its not quite so bad as that i wouldnt say not good mind you but not so bad as that sabrino said orosio looked glum and cold and disbelieving and said not a word sabrino had been hoping for an argument silence skeptical silence gave him nothing to push against a crystallomancer hurried over to his tent and stuck his head inside not seeing him the fellow drew back in confusion here i am sabrino called and waved whats gone wrong now he assumed something had or the fellow wouldnt have been looking for him with a salute the crystallomancer said sir the wing is ordered to attack the unkerlanter ground forces now pushing their way into map square greenthree greenthree powers below eat me if i remember where that is sabrino said tell the dragon handlers to load eggs onto the beasts orosio call out the dragonfliers and ill go find out what in blazes were supposed to be doing while the crystallomancer and orosio shouted sabrino went back to his tent and unfolded the situation map for a moment he didnt see any square labeled greenthree and he wondered whether the crystallomancer had got the order straight then he noticed that the vertical column of squares labeled green lay east of herborn not west where hed been looking he cursed under his breath no the capital of the kingdom of grelz wasnt going to hold if the unkerlanters were already beyond herborn the fight had to be to keep a corridor open so the troops in the city could pull out no help for it he thought if we lose herborn and those men well be worse off than if we just lose herborn he hurried out of the tent again shouting orders of his own come on you whoresons he yelled to the men of his wing time to make some unkerlanters sorry they were ever born even now after so many bitter battles his dragonfliers gave him a cheer somehow that rocked him he had trouble believing they had anything to cheer about or that hed done anything to deserve those shouts waving a mittened hand he scrambled up onto his dragon and took his place at the base of its neck the dragons screech rang high and shrill in his ears it was younger and smaller than the beast hed taken into all the fights before it got blazed out of the sky younger and smaller and if such a thing was possible stupider too he whacked it with the goad it screeched again this time in fury and sprang into the air as if hoping to shake him off he grinned an angry dragon was a dragon that would fly hard he activated his crystal and spoke to his squadron leaders greenthree boys just like the crystallomancer said north and east of herborn would the words slide by without the officers fully noticing what hed just said he hoped so but no such luck north and east captain orosio exclaimed colonel that doesnt sound good at all not even a little bit i wish i could tell you you were wrong but im afraid youre right sabrino said nothing we can do about it though except hit swemmels bastards as hard as we can and help our own boys down on the ground orosio didnt answer that as far as sabrino could see it had no answer they flew on over the ruined landscape of the kingdom not the duchy not yet thought sabrino of grelz two and a half years before the unkerlanters had fought hard to hold back the algarvians little of what those battles wrecked was rebuilt and now sabrinos countrymen were doing everything they could to keep the unkerlanters from retaking this stretch of land if anything hereabouts was left standing by the time these battles were through sabrino would have been amazed then he stopped worrying about the local landscape there down below just emerging from forest onto open ground was the head of an unkerlanter column surely the force against which his wing had been sent a few algarvian behemoths out on the frozen fields started tossing eggs at swemmels soldiers but they wouldnt be able to stall the unkerlanters for long not without help they wouldnt come on sabrino shouted into his crystal he pointed for good measure there they are now we make em sorry they arent somewhere else like most of its kind his new dragon was happy enough to stoop on the enemy as if it imagined itself a madly outsized kestrel getting it to pull up he knew would be another problem it wanted to sink its claws into a behemoth and fly off with the great beast armor and crew and all it had not the wit to see such was far beyond even its great strength sabrino loosed the eggs slung beneath the dragon and hit it with the goad it screeched angrily but did finally decide to rise rather than flying into the ground more eggs burst behind sabrino as the rest of his dragonfliers also loosed their loads of death on the unkerlanters he looked back over his shoulder and nodded in solid professional satisfaction battered and undermanned though it was his wing still did a solid professional job theyd well and truly smashed in the head of this column swemmels men wouldnt be coming forward here not for a while but then more unkerlanters emerged from the woods north and east of the column the dragonfliers had just attacked and as his dragon gained height sabrino saw still more men and beasts some in rockgray some in white winter smocks over rockgray moving up from the south toward those soldiers coming out of the forest sabrino didnt know whether to groan or to curse he did both at once with great feeling powers below eat them he shouted to the uncaring sky theyve got herborn trapped in one of their stinking kettles herborn surrounded fernao sounded out the kuusaman words with care as he fought his way through the news sheet from yliharma large force of algarvians trapped inside unkerlanter lines demand for surrender refused ive heard lagoans who sounded worse ilmarinen said coming from him any praise was high praise fernao dipped his head thank you he said in kuusaman he went on in classical kaunian in which he remained more fluent reading the news sheets i learn many military terms but they are not much use to me in speaking of ordinary things oh i dont know ilmarinen looked around the refectory till he spotted the serving girl for whom hed conceived an as yet unrequited passion waving to get her attention he called hey linna if i surround you will you surrender you are not asleep master ilmarinen you are awake linna answered you are not talking in your dreams however much you wish you were i see fernao said aye i followed that well enough i was afraid you would ilmarinen said glumly that wench must spend an hour every morning stropping her tongue to make it sharper he took a sip of tea then asked let me see that news sheet will you fernao passed it to him ilmarinen was bound to make smoother faster going of it than he could and sure enough the kuusaman master mage soon grunted heres a sweet little story a sibian woman who was pregnant by an algarvian fed her husband rat poison when he came home and found out what shed been up to sweet aye fernao had a pretty good idea why ilmarinen had picked that particular story he had no intention of admitting as much since that would also have meant admitting ilmarinen had a point when fernao said no more ilmarinen grunted again and went on aye poor commander ah cornelu wont be riding leviathans for king burebistu any more and his notsoloving wife will end up a head shorter bad business all the way around cornelu fernao exclaimed the name got his notice oh that poor bugger you knew him now ilmarinen sounded surprised not well but aye i knew him fernao answered he was the leviathanrider who pulled king penda of forthweg and me out of mizpah down in the land of the ice people when it was on the point of falling to the yaninans ah ilmarinen nodded i suspect that if we knew more of these webs of casual acquaintance we could do more with the law of contagion than weve managed up till now if i had to guess id say that would be for the generation of mages after you it could be fernao eyed ilmarinen with admiration no less genuine for being reluctant no one could ever say ilmarinen thought small in a couple of sentences hed proposed a program of research that might well keep a whole generation of mages busy before fernao could say anything else pekka strode into the refectory and spoke in ringing tones my fellow mages we are leaving for the blockhouse in a quarter of an hour you will be ready the kuusaman verb had a form that expressed absolute certainty pekka used it then and fernao was ready in a quarter of an hour done with his breakfast and decked in furs a man of the ice people wouldnt have disdained as he dressed he wondered whether ilmarinen whod lingered in the dining hall could possibly get to the front door of the hostel within the appointed time but he found ilmarinen there before him the master mage gave a superior smirk as if to say he knew hed put one over on fernao everyone was there all the theoretical sorcerers who would conduct the next experiment that sprang from the unity at the heart of the two laws the secondary sorcerers who would project their spell to the animals the sorcerers who would keep the animals from freezing till the spell went forth and the contingent of mages who would do their best to protect the theoretical sorcerers against any onslaught from algarve pekka didnt look pleased to find everyone ready on time she looked as if that were nothing less than her due maybe that was what leading meant and off we go she said the weather is very fine today she came from kajaani of course on the southern coast of kuusamo that meant her standards differed from fernaos as far as he was concerned it was bloody cold outside but several of the other kuusamans nodded so he supposed he was the odd man out here odd man out or not he was glad to snuggle under more furs in a sleigh he was also glad to snuggle under them beside pekka snuggle down beside her was all he did without a word without a gesture shed made it plain that anything else would cost them the friendship theyd built up since he came to kuusamo he didnt think that was because she wasnt interested in him on the contrary he thought she was and sternly wouldnt let herself be in an abstract way he admired that which made it no less frustrating still he didnt suppose he wanted to put her husband leino in a situation like the one from which poor luckless cornelu hadnt escaped no he didnt want that at all all i want is to go to bed with her if only things were so simple but he knew too well they werent pekka said in spite of everything we do make progress we shall be sending the energies farther from the site of the sorcery than we have ever tried before she paused before adding almost far enough to be useful in the field almost fernao said but his comment was rather gloomier than hers almost is one of the saddest words in the language in any language it speaks of hopes with nothing to show for them we are already releasing nearly as much energy with our sorcery as the algarvians are with their murderous magecraft pekka said and our magic is far cleaner than theirs i know fernao replied the last thing he wanted to do was affront her but they still have more control over theirs than we do with ours we do not yet know how to project the energies from our spell across the strait of valmiera for instance and we know too well that mezentios mages can as usual speaking classical kaunian gave the conversation a certain air of detachment some but not enough here pekkas shiver had nothing to do with the icy air through which the sleigh glided aye we do know that too well she agreed with a grimace were it not so we would still have siuntio on our side and not a day goes by in which i do not miss him i know fernao said again he might have dragged siuntio out of the blockhouse when it started to collapse and burn during the algarvian sorcerous attack hed dragged pekka out instead she still didnt realize hed been closer to siuntio than to her no matter how much he wanted to bed her he would never tell her that ptarmigan fluttered away from the sleigh wings whistling as they took flight they are in their full winter plumage now pekka said the rabbits and the ferrets will be white too so they will here fernao said up by setubal and on the derlavaian mainland farther north too many of them will stay brown the whole winter long i wonder how they know to go white here where it snows more but not to where the winters are milder savants have puzzled over that for a long time pekka said they have never yet found an answer that satisfies me nor me fernao agreed it almost tempts me to think some inborn sorcerous power is hidden inside animals but if it is there no mage has ever been able to detect it and that makes me not believe in any such thing you are a modern rational man and i feel the same way you do pekka said no wonder though that our superstitious ancestors thought beasts had the same potential for using magic as people did no wonder at all fernao said before he or pekka could say anything more the driver reined in and spoke two words of kuusaman were here fernao got down from the sleigh and extended a mittened hand to pekka she set her own mittened hand in his as she alighted that was the contact of ordinary politeness and she did not shy away from it even through two thick layers of felted wool her touch warmed him braziers warmed the blockhouse not nearly so well as far as fernao was concerned filling it with mages did a better job did in fact too good a job people shed cloaks and jackets fernao started sweating after taking off his coat he joined the grumbling about how warm it was but then pekkas voice crisply cut through that grumbling let us begin shall we crystallomancer please be so kind as to check with the mages handling the animals is everything ready she spoke to the woman in kuusaman but fernao found he had no trouble following her after a moment the crystallomancer replied they are ready at your convenience mistress good pekka said and recited the ancient phrases with which kuusamans preceded every sorcery the other mages in the blockhouse repeated the phrases with her everyone but fernao nobody bothered him for not joining in the ritual though one mage or another would sometimes tease him about it back at the hostel before pekka could begin the spell itself ilmarinen let out a sharp bark of warning look out fernaos head came up he peered north as if he could see to the strait of valmiera let alone across it he sensed no sorcerous disturbance not yet a moment later though one of the mages charged with defending against algarvian wizardry also exclaimed and then fernao felt it too that cantrip that tasted of iron and brimstone and blood so much blood that smelled of powers above only knew how many open graves he couldnt join the kuusaman mages in their defense against it their ways were not his his ways to his shame were closer to the school of sorcery that had spawned such monstrousness no he shouted in lagoan a cry of rejection hardly different from its algarvian equivalent he launched his own angry counterspell at mezentios mages he didnt think it would do much good but he didnt see how it could hurt either then to his astonishment he felt his spell lifted reinforced he was almost startled enough to break off the chant ilmarinen waved for him to continue so did pekka she was incanting furiously but shes not aiming at the algarvians a tiny part of his mind thought shes going on with the magic she would have tried anyhow he didnt dwell on that he dwelt on nothing but his own magecraft and on the astonishing boost ilmarinen was giving it he couldnt see to the strait of valmiera no but he felt as if he might reach it and cross it he wanted to loose his bolt of sorcerous power but felt someone ilmarinen again delaying him making him hold back then he could delay no more but when he launched it he also launched all the tremendous energy from the spell pekka had shaped unlike the kuusamans the algarvian mages had been ready only for attack they hadnt dreamt they would need to defend fernao felt the sorcerous counterstroke shatter them he cried out in triumph and pitched forward on his face in a faint we did it pekka exclaimed for about the dozenth time since the mages returned to their hostel we truly did it i didnt think we could but we did it so we did fernao spoke in classical kaunian rather than kuusaman he still looked pale and drawn though a couple of mugs of ale had gone some way toward restoring his color not quite the experiment we had in mind when we went to the blockhouse but success is never an orphan only failure has to look for a father it was your success pekka said everyone else thought only of holding off the algarvians you were the one who struck back he shrugged ilmarinen here helped and i have algarvic blood in me and i am trained in algarvicstyle magecraft i hoped they would prove all sword and no shield and i was lucky enough to be right it turned out better than i thought it would in fact it turned out better than i dreamt it could pekka exclaimed she sipped from a small goblet of brandy flavored with almond paste the algarvians will not try to strike us again any time soon not that way ilmarinen gave her a sour stare if you gush any more my dear youll turn into a hot spring she reminded herself that fernao had needed the master mages help to launch his counterspell at mezentios mages that helped her keep her temper now the algarvians are the ones gushing hot tears now she said we put a lot of their sorcerers out of business today well so we did but even that didnt much impress ilmarinen he went on it wont bring the kaunians they killed back to life though did i say it would pekka returned but it may give them less reason to kill more of them that also counts for something perhaps because of the brandy she felt her temper slipping out from under her control whether she wanted it to or not had ilmarinen argued further she would have scorched him to her relief he didnt or not very much anyhow he said aye i suppose thats true not that it does the poor blond buggers they sacrificed this time any good then he gulped the last of the ale in his mug slammed it down on the table and stalked away fernao stared after him i almost think he would be happier if we were losing than he is to have struck the algarvians a solid sorcerous blow the lagoan mage observed with a sigh pekka answered i fear you are exactly right he would feel more needed were that so and we would be more inclined to make the kind of experiments he wants she shrugged as things are i am the one who judges what is important and what is not and i say that what we did here today was one of the most important things we have ever done i think you are right fernao said we proved we could project that power a long way a lot farther than we would have tried had the algarvians not pushed us everything we have done up till now we have done because the algarvians are pushing us pekka said this time though we pushed back aye fernao turned in his chair till he was facing north and ever so slightly west he pointed in that same direction along this bearing this is the direction from which their attack came and the direction along which we aimed our answer if we sent a dragon flying along this line i wonder what its flier would see after it got to the coast of valmiera we ought to do that pekka said and scribbled a note to herself we ought to find out what our magic does in the field rather than on the testing range as we have been using it here when do you suppose we really shall start using it in the field fernao asked he passed the back of his hand across his forehead as if wiping away sweat i do not know how often any one mage would want to serve as the channel through which that energy runs once was plenty for me i think this strike was a makeshift pekka said it might be easier if we planned it more beforehand it might but fernao did not sound convinced pekka went on i cannot answer your question yet not altogether i can say this though before we start work in the field we shall have to train more mages to use these spells ordinary practical mages i mean not theoretical sorcerers like the ones we have gathered here that will take some time she scribbled another note it is something we ought to think about beginning though is it not fernao nodded it may well be she only half heard the answer ordinary practical mages she thought mages like leino to whom i just happen to be married could he have done what fernao did there today he might have he likely would have had the presence of mind would he have had the strength the will angry at herself for raising the question in those terms she knocked back the rest of her brandy fernao raised an eyebrow and what does that mean she asked herself is he surprised to see me guzzle so or is he hoping im doing it to give myself an excuse to do something with him is that why im doing it pekka got to her feet indeed almost sprang to her feet the refectory swayed a little when she did sure enough shed had more brandy than she thought i she declared am going upstairs to bed to sleep she added so as not to leave fernao in any possible doubt about what she meant if he offered to escort her ill have to pretend to be angrier than i am pekka thought but fernao nodded i intend to do the same thing in a little while he said i have not drunk quite enough yet though try not to have too thick a head come morning pekka warned you will need to draft a report on what we did today i remember fernao answered and pekka had to fight against a giggle the lagoan mage might have been uto dutifully saying aye mother pekka got to her feet and hurried away shed had that thought about ilmarinen a good many times what did it mean when she also started having it about the other mages with whom she worked that you think being in charge of them means mothering them she wasnt sure she liked that she was sure they wouldnt if they found out about it she almost ran to the stairway as if running from her own thoughts had she had long legs like fernaos she would have gone up the stairs two at a time as things were she just climbed them as fast as she could that proved plenty fast to startle two people embracing halfway up to the second floor ilmarinen and linna pekka wondered if shed drunk enough to start seeing things then ilmarinen demanded did you have to come by at the most inconvenient possible moment and his annoyance convinced her her imagination hadnt run wild after all i didnt intend to pekka answered i am allowed to go up to my own room you know i suppose so ilmarinen sounded as if he supposed nothing of the sort he turned back to the serving girl and how would you like to go up to my own room better that than blocking the stairway pekka said linna didnt say anything right away pekka hoped she wouldnt have to listen to ilmarinen begging that didnt suit her image of the way a master mage should act of course a lot of the things ilmarinen did failed to suit her image and he cared not a fig but humiliation seemed somehow worse than outrageousness then linna answered well why not ive already come this far ilmarinen beamed and kicked up his heels like a frisky young reindeer pekka thought he would have carried linna up the stairs if shed shown any sign of wanting him to the next question was would he measure up once he lay down beside her for his sake pekka hoped so if he didnt he was liable to be devastated she let the two of them go up the stairs ahead of her now that shed escaped fernao any more rushing seemed pointless she walked past ilmarinens chamber on the way to her own but made a point of not listening to whatever was going on in there officially it was none of her business and ilmarinens attitude the next time she saw him would tell her everything she needed to know anyhow the inside of her own room bare and spare was not the most welcoming place in which shed ever found herself hoping to lose herself in the intricate business of trying to record events exactly as theyd happened she inked a pen and began to write but after shed set down a couple of sentences she shook her head and pushed the leaf of paper away hes saved your life twice maybe three times now she said aloud as if someone had denied it this last time he may have saved everything why are you running away from him then part of her knew the answer to that the rest the larger part proved not to want to think about it looking out the window she saw it was snowing again she ran a finger under the collar of her tunic it felt unpleasantly warm inside the hostel certainly inside her room she set down the pen with a sigh that was the next thing to a sob she got up and headed for the refectory when she walked past ilmarinens room linnas giggle gave her pause indeed it almost sent her running back to her own chamber but she shook her head and kept going she wondered if she would bump into fernao on the stairway and what would happen if she did she didnt and when she went back into the refectory and looked around she didnt see him there either she stood in the entranceway looking around till one of the serving women came up to her and asked may i help you with anything mistress pekka pekka jumped as if the woman had asked her something shameful no she said louder and more sharply than shed intended i was just looking for someone thats all ah the serving woman nodded master fernao went up to his chamber a couple of minutes ago did he pekka said and the woman nodded again she knows whom id be looking for does she she probably knows why id be looking for him too and she probably knows why better than i do myself aye he did the woman nodded again she sounded very certain more certain than pekka was herself oh she understood why she might be no why she was looking for fernao what she didnt know was whether she wanted to do anything about her understanding the serving woman eyed her curiously as if to say i told you where he was why are you wasting your time here when pekka turned to go out of the corner of her eye she spied the other woman nodding she shook her own head you may think you know everything thats going on but youre wrong this time she did go back upstairs but not to fernaos room whatever she was thinking she wasnt ready to be so brazen as that not quite she told herself whether with relief or disappointment even she couldnt tell when she attacked the report again in earnest this time she got a lot of work done captain recared had a new cry now hold them it was one sergeant leudast was delighted to echo the unkerlanters had drawn their ring all the way around herborn if they could keep it shut tight the algarvian forces trapped inside would beat themselves to death trying to break out hold them leudast shouted along with the rest of the men in the regiment hed done a prodigious lot of marching to move east as far and as fast as he had now he faced west again to keep the redheads and their grelzer puppets from pulling the stopper out of the bottle that contained them eggs kicked up clouds of snow when they burst in and around the grelzer village his company was holding fragments of metal from the eggshells whined through the air but instead of cratering the ground as they would have in summertime the eggs only knocked holes about the size and depth of a small washtub in it it was frozen too hard for anything more here they come somebody shouted leudast peered out from the hut in which he sheltered sure enough the algarvians and grelzers were trying to press home their attack against the village they had better gear now than theyd used the first winter of the war in unkerlant they all wore white snow smocks and almost all of them snowshoes some of them shouted mezentio others presumably the grelzers yelled raniero plenty of time leudast called to his men as the enemy slogged across the snowcovered fields outside the village make sure youve got a good target before you start blazing before the algarvians and grelzers even got into stick range of the village unkerlanter eggtossers started pounding them leudast knew a moments abstract pity for the foe with the ground hard as iron the soldiers out there couldnt very well dig holes in which to shelter from the eggs they had to take whatever the unkerlanters could dish out rockgray dragons dropped out of the sky on the redheads and the traitors who fought on their side more eggs burst these delivered with pinpoint precision and released only a few feet above the enemys heads flame yellow as the sun and far hotter than the winter sun down here in grelz burst from the dragons jaws leudast watched a kilted algarvian blacken and writhe and shrink in on himself like a moth that had just flown into a campfire recareds whistle screamed forward now the regimental commander shouted if we hit them hard we can break them a bit more than a year earlier battling down in the wreckage of sulingen leudast would have laughed at the thought of breaking algarvians overwhelming them certainly but breaking them making them run it would have seemed impossible a lot had happened since then aye he shouted we can do it by the powers above urra king swemmel urra the unkerlanters burst from the village and rushed at the redheads eggs kept falling on the enemy helping to pin him in place some of the algarvians tried to flee anyway and were flung aside when eggs bust near then others threw their sticks down in the snow raised their hands and went willingly enough into captivity and some of the redheads good stubborn resourceful soldiers that they were held on as long as they could to let their comrades escape fighting alongside mezentios soldiers were men who looked like leudast and his comrades but who wore dark green tunics rather than rockgray under their snow smocks few grelzers tried to surrender few of those who did try succeeded the men whod chosen raniero over swemmel had discovered the unkerlanters werent much interested in taking them alive keep your eyes and ears open leudast warned the soldiers in his company you see somebody you dont know watch him especially if he talks with a grelzer accent the traitors will strip our dead for their tunics so they get the chance to sneak out of the fight he knew he wasnt the only unkerlanter passing along that warning he also knew a few perfectly loyal unkerlanter soldiers who chanced to spring from grelz would get blazed because their countrymen went for sticks without bothering to ask questions first his broad shoulders moved up and down in a shrug as long as the grelzers got rooted out he didnt much care what else happened captain recared hadnt been the sole commander to order a counterattack shouting urra and king swemmels name unkerlanter soldiers stormed forward all along the line instead of trying to break out of the cauldron around herborn in which they were trapped the algarvians and grelzers had to try to hold back a foe who outnumbered them in men in eggtossers in horses and unicorns in behemoths and in dragons they tried they tried bravely but they could not hold here and there they would form a line and battle the unkerlanters in front of them to a standstill for a while but then swemmels soldiers would find a way around one flank or the other and the algarvians and grelzers would have to give ground again either that or be slaughtered where they stood the progress leudasts countrymen made left him slightly dazed that evening he sat down to barley cakes and garlicky sausage filched from an algarvian sergeant hed captured toasting a length of sausage over a fire on a stick he said curse me if theyre not starting to fall apart captain recared had some sausage too he pulled it away from the flames examined it and then thrust it back to cook some more aye they are he agreed while the sausage sizzled and dripped grease into the fire by this time tomorrow theyll have figured out that they cant pound their way through our ring theyll start trying to sneak through in small bands we have to smash as many of them as we can every soldier we kill or capture now is one more we wont have to worry about later on i understand sir leudast said and when theyre hungry and scared and their sticks are low on charges theyre a lot easier to deal with than when theyve got their peckers up thats right thats just right recared nodded he took his sausage off the fire and looked at it again with another nod he began to eat he proved a good prophet for over the next couple of days the spirit did leak out of the algarvians like water leaking from a cracked jar they stopped standing up to the unkerlanters and started trying to escape whenever and however they could when they couldnt run and couldnt hide they surrendered in a hurry glad to do it before something worse happened to them after a couple of days of that leudast was as rich as hed ever been in all his born days he didnt suppose it would last when he came to a place where he could spend the money he was taking from captured algarvian officers he probably would but a heavy belt pouch wasnt the worst thing in the world either one of his men asked sergeant what do we do with the coins we take that have false king raniero on em well kiun if i were you id lose the grelzer copper leudast answered itll never be worth anything on its own if you know what i mean but silvers silver even if it is stamped with ranieros pointynosed face somebodyll melt it down for you and give you what its worth in metal even if not in coin ah the soldier nodded thanks that makes good sense the next morning leudasts company came on the tracks of a squad of men trying to make their way east with snow on the ground following the trail was childs play before long his troopers caught up with the fleeing algarvians a couple of men started blazing at the redheads as soon as steam puffed up from the smoke around them the algarvians raised their hands in surrender aye you have us one of them said in pretty good unkerlanter as leudast and his men came up a bald fellow in his late middle years who wore a colonels uniform we can run no more youd best believe it pal leudast cocked his head to one side you talk funny the officers accent wasnt a typical algarvian trill but something else something familiar i was in the last war colonel of a regiment of forthwegians in algarvian service the redhead answered thats it sure enough leudast nodded his own home village up in the north wasnt so far from the forthwegian border no wonder he thought hed heard that accent before he had sergeant kiun the fellow whod asked him about grelzer money plucked at his sleeve sergeant powers below eat me if thats not raniero his own self what leudast shook himself free youre out of your fornicating but his voice trailed away he shuffled a couple of paces sideways so he could look at the algarvian in profile his lips pursed in a soundless whistle the captive in the colonels uniform certainly had the right beaky nose are you raniero a couple of the captives comrades exclaimed in algarvian but he shook his head and drew himself up very straight i have that honor aye he bowed and to whom do i present myself numbly leudast gave his own name he gestured with his stick you come along with me what would they give the man whod just captured the king of grelz he didnt know he had no idea but he looked forward to finding out he also waved to a couple of his own men who were all staring wideeyed at raniero you boys come along too he didnt want his prisoner stolen out from under him he made sure he included kiun the trooper also deserved a reward a lieutenant well back of the line glared at him why didnt you just send your captive to the rear sergeant he growled meaning why do you think you deserve to get out of the fight for a while sir this isnt just any captive leudast answered this is raniero who calls himself king of grelz the lieutenants glare turned to a gape he didnt have the presence of mind to ask to accompany leudast ranieros name was the password that got leudast taken from division headquarters to army headquarters to a battered firstmans house in a village that looked to have changed hands a good many times the soldier who came out of the house had irongray hair and big stars on the collar tabs of his tunic marshal rathar eyed the captive nodded and told leudast thats raniero all right leudast saluted aye sir he said rathar seemed to forget about him then he spoke to raniero in algarvian and king mezentios cousin answered in the same language but rathar wasnt one to forget his own men for long after giving raniero what looked like a sympathetic pat on the back he turned to leudast and asked and what do you expect for bringing this fellow in eh sergeant sir whatever seems right to you leudast answered ive figured you were fairminded ever since we fought side by side for a little while up in the zuwayzi desert he didnt expect the marshal to remember him but he wanted rathar to know theyd met before and he added kiun here was the one who first recognized him a pound of gold and sergeants rank for him and lieutenant leudast how does five pounds of gold on top of a promotion sound for you rathar asked leudast had expected gold though hed thought one pound likelier than five for himself the promotion was a delightful surprise me he squeaked an officer officers rank wasnt quite so much the preserve of bluebloods in unkerlants army as in algarves king swemmel had killed too many nobles to make that practical but it wasnt something to which a peasant could normally aspire either an officer leudast repeated if i live through the war ive got it made he thought dizzily if vanai had heard that there came a time when a woman actually enjoyed carrying a child during the first third of her pregnancy she wouldnt have believed it not for anything when she hadnt been nauseated shed been exhausted sometimes shed been both at once her breasts had pained her all the time there had been days when shed not cared to do anything but lie on her back with her tunic off and with a bucket beside her this middle stretch seemed better though she could eat anything she could clean her teeth without wondering if she would lose what shed eaten last she didnt feel as if she needed to prop her eyelids open with little sticks and the baby moving inside her was something she never took for granted maybe in a way ealstan had been right no matter how emphatically shed known before that she was with child its kicks and pokes did make that undeniably real the more so as they got stronger and more vigorous with each passing week and just as well im thelberge in a forthwegianstyle tunic these days she told ealstan over supper one evening if i still wore trousers id have to buy new ones because i wouldnt be able to fit into the ones i had been wearing anymore he nodded ive noticed with the tunic though it hardly shows even yet with the tunic no vanai said without it she shrugged her body had stayed much the same ever since she became a woman to watch it change to feel it change almost from day to day was disconcerting to say the very least ealstan shrugged too i like the way you look without your tunic just fine believe me vanai did believe him shed heard of men who lost interest in their wives when the women were expecting a baby that hadnt happened with ealstan who remained as eager as ever in fact from the look in his eye now the supper dishes got cleaned rather later than they might have when they woke up the next morning ealstan spoke in classical kaunian as if to emphasize his words you look like vanai again not like thelberge do i vanai spoke forthwegian annoyed forthwegian but i renewed the spell just before we went to sleep and you told me id got it right it really isnt holding as long as it used to i dont know what to tell you ealstan returned to forthwegian too you need to be careful thats all he got out of bed and put on fresh drawers and a clean tunic and i need to get going or pybba will have me for breakfast when i get to his office he just about lives there and he thinks everybody else should too i am careful vanai insisted i have to be she got out of bed too here ill fix your breakfast it didnt take much fixing barley bread with olive oil some raisins on the side and a cup of wine to wash things down vanai ate with ealstan and then while he shifted from foot to foot with impatience to be gone went through the spell that let her look like a forthwegian when she was through he said there you are sure enough you look like my sister again she didnt even let that annoy her not this morning as long as i dont look like a kaunian everythings fine she said i spent too much time cooped up in this flat i dont care to do it again if you have to you have to ealstan answered better that than getting caught wouldnt you say he brushed his lips across hers i really do have to go by the powers above dont do anything foolish that did make her angry i dont intend to she said biting the words off between her teeth going out and making sure we dont starve doesnt count as foolish to me i hope it doesnt to you either no ealstan admitted but getting caught does ive bought food for us before i can do it again everything will be fine vanai repeated go on youre the one worrying about being late she shoved him out the door once he was gone she washed the handful of breakfast dishes then more than a little defiantly she put money in her handbag and went out the door herself i wont be caged up anymore i wont curse it she thought no one paid any attention to her when she left the lobby of her block of flats and went down the stairs to the sidewalk why should anyone have paid attention to her she looked as much like a forthwegian as anyone else on the street how many of the other people on the street also were sorcerously disguised kaunians vanai had no way to tell in forthweg as a whole about one in ten had shared her blood before the derlavaian war began more kaunians had lived in and around eoforwic than anywhere else on the other hand the redheads had already shipped a lot of kaunians off to unkerlant to fuel the algarvian there with their life energy how many vanai had no way to know that either and wished the question had never crossed her mind a pair of algarvian constables came up the street toward her one of them reached out as if to pat her on the bottom she squeaked indignantly and sidestepped before he could he laughed so did his pal vanai glared at them which only made them laugh harder the fellow whod tried to feel her up blew her a farewell kiss over his shoulder as he kept on walking his beat so long as he keeps walking vanai thought it wasnt just that she didnt want him groping her he might have noticed she felt different to his hand from the way she looked to his eye her spell affected only her visual appearance ealstan had remarked on that more than once she couldnt afford to let an algarvian discover it no matter how much like a forthwegian she looked and i have to hurry she reminded herself i cant know how long im going to keep on looking like a forthwegian not anymore her hand went to her belly in an involuntary gesture of annoyance she was convinced her being with child was what weakened the magecraft it hadnt changed a bit from the day she perfected it till she found herself pregnant now for all she knew the baby inside her looked as if it were fully forthwegian too smiling at that she walked on toward the market square before she got there she went past more algarvian constables these fellows werent grinning and doing their best to be friendly they were grabbing men off the street for a work gang pointing toward walls and fences and shouting getting those down in their rudimentary forthwegian those were broadsheets vanai hurried forward to get a look at them before they all came down death to those who murder kaunians screamed one in lurid red characters another cried vengeance on algarve she couldnt even stare she had to keep walking its got to be kaunians who put those up she thought of course its got to be kaunians how many forthwegians care about us but no kaunian underground had shown itself since algarve overran forthweg or none to speak of how could such a thing start now with so many kaunians already gone however it had happened vanai was savagely delighted to learn of it a delight that only grew stronger because it had to stay hidden in the market square she bought olive oil and almonds and green onions and a goodsized bream she was just starting off toward her block of flats when an egg burst back where the algarvians were making the forthwegian work gang strip the broadsheets off the walls it was a big egg the roar of its bursting was more a blow against the ears than an ordinary noise the next thing vanai knew she was on her knees shed dropped the jar and it had shattered oil spilling and sliding across the cobbles of the market square she cursed as she got to her feet she wasnt the only one whod fallen or the only one whod had something break either when she staggered upright she first started back toward the stall where shed bought the olive oil then she started thinking straight and realized she had more important things to worry about chief among them was that she couldnt afford to be recognized as a kaunian at this of all moments forthwegians and algarvians alike would assume shed helped plant the egg and she probably wouldnt last long enough to get shipped west that meant she had to return to the flat as fast as she could only when she headed back across the square did she realize how lucky shed been not to have stood closer to the egg when it burst some people were down and shrieking other people and parts of people lay motionless blood was everywhere puddling between cobblestones and splashed up onto walls and stalls the sorcerous energies hadnt knocked down the street by which shed entered the square the street on which the forthwegians had been pulling down broadsheets suddenly had an opening twice as wide as it had been fewer people fewer whole people anyway and more body parts lay closer to where the egg must have been hidden gulping trying to avert her eyes vanai picked her way past them and past the crater the egg had blown in the ground by some miracle one of the algarvian constables whod been on the street had survived his tunic and kilt were half torn off him blood streamed down his face and from cuts on his arms and legs but he was up and walking and in that state of eerie calm where he hardly seemed aware of his own injuries stinking kaunians sneaking back from zuwayza mustve done this he said to vanai in algarvian as if to a superior zuwayzin are supposed to be allies curse em he spat spat red and then noticed to whom he was talking powers above you probably dont understand a word im saying off he staggered looking for an officer to brief but vanai followed algarvian well enough she thought the constable was very likely right the difference was he hated the kaunian raiders while she hoped they would do more and worse people were rushing toward the burst some paused to help wounded men and women nobody took any special notice of unhurt or slightly hurt folk coming away vanai wasnt the only one far from it for all she knew she wasnt the only kaunian hurrying to get out of the public eye before concealing sorcery concealed no more her street her block the entrance to her block of flats the stairway up to the dingy lobby the stairway up to her flat the hallway her front door her front door opening her front door closed behind her she took the almonds and the onions and the bream into the kitchen then she poured herself a full mug of wine and gulped it down it would probably make her go to sleep in the middle of the day she didnt care she would probably look like a kaunian when she woke up too she didnt care about that either not now what difference did it make here inside the flat where she was safe twenty unkerlanter dragons swarmed above herborn unkerlanter mages swarmed inside the reclaimed capital of grelz and to the east of it they had plenty of unkerlanter victims ready to sacrifice if the algarvians chose a sorcerous strike at herborn during king swemmels moment of triumph common sense said nothing could go wrong marshal rathar had learned not to trust common sense im worried he told general vatran vatran to his relief didnt pat him on the shoulder and go everything will be fine instead the veteran officer screwed up his face and said im worried too lord marshal if the algarvians get wind of whats going on here this afternoon theyll turn this place upside down to stop it looking around he added of course between the two sides they and weve pretty much turned herborn upside down already and inside out too come to that true enough rathar looked around too herborn was one of the oldest towns in unkerlant an algarvian merchant prince or some said an algarvian bandit chief had set himself up here as king in the land more than eight hundred years before ever since the city had had an algarvian look to it though a native dynasty soon supplanted the foreigners extravagantly ornamented skywardleaping towers always put visitors in mind of places farther east in the battles for herborn though when the algarvians took it from unkerlant in the first months of the war and now when king swemmels soldiers took it back a lot of those skywardleaping towers had been groundwardfalling others yet stood but looked as if theyd had chunks bitten out of them still others were only fireravaged skeletons of what they had been the stink of stale smoke lingered in the air so did the stink of death that would have been worse had the weather been warmer it was still too warm to suit rathar i wish wed have a blizzard he grumbled thatd make his majesty put things off he cast a hopeful eye westward the direction from which bad weather was likeliest to come but none looked like coming today vatran shook his head for one thing his majesty doesnt give a fart if all the algarvian captives hes got well all but one freeze to death while hes parading em i know that rathar said impatiently but he wouldnt care to go up on a reviewing stand and watch em in the middle of a snowstorm mm maybe not vatran allowed still and all though if he put things off itd give the redheads longer to find out what were about that made rathar nod however little he wanted to aye youre right he said if we have to do it wed best get it over with as soon as may be if the king will vatran gave him a shot in the ribs with an elbow the general had known him a long time but that didnt excuse such uncouth familiarity rathar started to say so in no certain terms then he too saw king swemmel coming up surrounded by a squad of hardfaced bodyguards he bowed very low your majesty he murmured beside him vatran did the same marshal general swemmel said he wore a tunic and cloak of military cut but royal splendor even in the wan winter sunlight their threadwork of clothofgold their encrusting pearls and rubies and polished faceted chunks of jet glittered dazzlingly so did the heavy crown on his head he waved we are pleased with the aspect of this our city of herborn your majesty this time rathar exclaimed in astonishment swemmels guards caught the tone their faces went harder yet several of them growled down deep in their throats like any wolves they knew lese majesty when they heard it but the king for once felt expansive enough to overlook it he waved again aye we are pleased he repeated most of all are we pleased with that he pointed to the tallest surviving tower of the dukes palace the palace that had been ranieros till not long before unkerlants banner white black and crimson fluttered above it ah rathar nodded as he had to vatran now he understood what swemmel meant hoping to take advantage of his sovereigns good humor he asked your majesty may i say a word swemmels bodyguards growled again whatever rathar was about to say they could tell it would be something their master didnt care to hear king swemmel could tell as much too say on he replied icy warning in his voice most of the kings courtiers would have found something harmless to ask him after that response doing anything else took more nerve than facing the algarvians in battle but rathar would speak his mind every now and then and did so now your majesty what you have planned for the end of the parade shall go forward king swemmel broke in it is our will our will shall assuredly be done it will make the war harder to fight from now on rathar said well see no quarter not anymore he glanced over to vatran vatran plainly wished he hadnt but the whitehaired general nodded agreement swemmel snapped his fingers there is no quarter between us and algarve now he said there has been none since mezentio treacherously hurled his armies across our border that held some truth but rathar wondered if swemmel remembered hed also been planning to attack the redheads back three summers before much of mezentios treachery lay in striking first with peasant stubbornness rathar tried once more your majesty slowly and deliberately his contempt as vast as it was regal king swemmel turned his back his guards didnt just growl they snarled without looking at rathar again the king said what hed said before our will shall assuredly be done he strode off not giving his marshal any chance to reply some of the guards looked as if they wanted to blaze rathar for his presumption once they were out of earshot general vatran said well you tried i know rathar kicked at the ground it was icy he almost fell when his booted foot slid more than hed expected i wish he would have listened sometimes he does but not today vatran said no not today rathar kicked again more carefully this time but were the ones wholl have to pay the price because he didnt hard to imagine how we could pay a price much bigger than were paying now vatran said which also held its share of truth and more broadsheets summoned the people of herborn to the parade route unkerlanter soldiers with megaphones also ordered them out of their homes those who still had homes standing at any rate watching the men and women coming up to line the street rathar wondered how many not so long before had waved goldandgreen flags and cheered thenking raniero more than a few of that he was certain the smart ones would already have burnt those and whatever else gold and green they owned if swemmels inspectors found such things it would go hard on whoever had them rathars own place was on the reviewing stand at his sovereigns side it stood not far from the ducal palace on the edge of herborns central square that square was smaller than cottbus but large enough and to spare grelzers lined the square too though guards kept them well away from the reviewing stand king swemmel imperiously raised his arm let us begin he cried a band began the triumphal parade horns and drums blared out the unkerlanter national hymn rathar wondered if the musicians would follow that with the hymn of the duchy of grelz but they didnt maybe swemmel didnt want the folk of herborn thinking about being grelzers at all whether inhabitants of a separate duchy or of a separate kingdom maybe he just wanted them to think of themselves as belonging to the kingdom of unkerlant and maybe he was shrewd to want them to think of themselves so instead of the hymn for the duchy of grelz the band played a medley of patriotic songs that had grown popular in these parts since the algarvians overran the region somebody rathar remembered had said they were written by a local peasant or irregular or something of the sort he wondered if that was true it struck him as being too pat for plausibility and so likelier a tale that came from cottbus swemmel was shrewd enough to come up with something like that and paid plenty of writers to come up with such things for him after the musicians came a regiment of behemoths their armor clattering upon them their heavy strides shaking the ground the timbers of the reviewing stand vibrated beneath rathars feet nothing could have been better calculated to overawe folk who still had doubts about whom they wanted to rule over them what the locals wanted didnt count for much of course king swemmel had returned and did not intend to be dislodged again and after the behemoths came a great shambling mob of algarvian captives herded along by sprucedup unkerlanter soldiers a herald bellowed scornfully behold the conquering heroes scrawny unshaven filthy some of them bandaged all of them in shabby tattered tunics and kilts they looked like what they were men whod fought a war as hard and as long as they could fought it and lost it in high good humor swemmel turned to rathar and said our mines and quarries shall have labor to spare for years to come aye your majesty the marshal said abstractedly he was watching the dragons overhead more than the luckless captives several of them broke off their spirals and flew east no algarvian dragons appeared above herborn if any tried to come over the town the dragons painted rockgray drove them back no grelzer captives appeared on the streets of herborn if grelzers hadnt been able to sneak out of the fight and find civilian clothes theyd seldom left it alive an elegant troop of unicorn cavalry followed the mass of algarvian captives they were beautiful to look upon even if not much use in the field and after them strode the highranking algarvian officers swemmels soldiers had captured in the herborn pocket colonels and brigadiers and generals they were better dressed and better fed than their countrymen of lower estate but if anything seemed even glummer last of all separated from them by more toughlooking unkerlanter footsoldiers raniero briefly king of grelz marched all alone the band the behemoths the ordinary captives the unicorn cavalry the high algarvian officers all left the square in front of the ducal palace raniero and his guards remained silence fell in the midst of that silence certain servitors of swemmels wheeled a large brass kettle nearly full of water into the center of the square other servitors piled coal a great deal of coal beneath the kettle and lit it still others set up a sort of a stand by the kettle one broad plank projected out over the polished brass vessel the guards took raniero up onto the platform but not yet onto the final plank like everyone else they waited for the water in the kettle to boil raniero had courage across the square he waved to king swemmel rathar murmured your majesty i beg you do not do this thing be silent swemmel said furiously be silent or join him there biting his lip rathar was silent at length one of the unkerlanter soldiers on the platform with raniero held up his hand king swemmel nodded let the usurper perish he shouted in a great voice let all who rise against us perish he had spoken the identical words when putting his brother kyot to death at the end of the twinkings war raniero had courage indeed instead of making the guards hurl him into the kettle as even kyot had done he marched out over it waved to swemmel again and with a cry of farewell leaped into the seething steaming water courage failed him then of course his shrieks ripped through the square but not for long swemmel let out a breathy grunt as he might have after a woman that was fine he murmured his eyes shining aye very fine indeed rathar was glad the breeze blew from him toward the kettle not the other way round even so he did not think he would eat boiled beef or pork again any time soon sidroc stumbled as he came up to the campfire so that he kicked a little snow onto sergeant werferth werferth shook a fist at him all right you son of a whore now youve done it he shouted just for that i order you boiled alive oh come off it sergeant sidroc said i have to be an algarvian and a prince to boot to rate anything so fancy why dont you just blaze me and get it over with nah thats what the unkerlanters do to grelzers they catch werferth said you ought to get something juicier ceorl was cooking some horsemeat and buckwheat groats in his mess tin using a branch as a handle he said the unkerlanters are liable to do that to us if they catch us too we look too much like them sidroc plucked at his beard unkerlanters shaved forthwegians didnt when hed lived in gromheort that had seemed plenty to distinguish between his own people and the bumpkins and semisavages of unkerlant but when he was in the midst of fighting a war against those bumpkins and semisavages and when they seldom got a chance to shave because they spent so much time in the field having a beard didnt seem enough differentiation not that the unkerlanters wouldnt kill him for being a forthwegian too but they sometimes showed mercy to men from plegmunds brigade to grelzers whod fought for king raniero dead raniero now hardly ever squatting down by the fire sidroc said word going around is that were getting a counterattack ready aye well wed bloody well better do something ceorl said if we dont theyll throw us out of grelz altogether maybe we werent so cursed smart joining the brigade looks like algarves losing the war shut your trap werferth said flatly youre only lucky it was a couple of your squadmates heard that not somebody whod report you he eyed sidroc reluctantly sidroc nodded to show he wouldnt he didnt like ceorl not even a little but the ruffian was a good man to have along in a brawl ahh bugger it ceorl spat into the fire what difference does it make not a one of us is ever going to get home to forthweg anyway who cares if our side kills us or the other bastards do sidroc waited for werferth to pitch a fit but the veteran sergeant only sighed odds are youre right powers below eat you for saying so out loud though why ceorl sounded genuinely curious why ill tell you why werferth answered because weve got to go on fighting like were on the edge of winning this war thats why because well get ourselves killed quicker if we dont thats why because we still might beat the odds too thats why ceorl dug into the meat and groats hed cooked up his mouth full he said fat chance no i think the sergeants right sidroc said ceorl sneered of course you do hes arguing with me if he said the sky was green youd figure he was right oh futter yourself sidroc said i think hes right on account of i think hes right and on account of the algarvians theyre sneakier than the unkerlanters and theyre smarter too the wars not over yet not by a long blaze if they kill enough stinking kaunians it wont make a counterfeit coppers worth of difference ceorl said swemmels boys will just kill as many of their own people as they need to to even things out havent we already seen that maybe theyll come up with some other kind of magecraft then i dont know sidroc said what i do know is one algarvian is worth two or three unkerlanters weve seen that plenty of times powers above one of us is worth two or three of swemmels men too of course we are ceorl said had he said anything else he would have had werferth arguing with him again too trouble is one of us is worth two or three unkerlanters and then that fourth or fifth unkerlanter ups and kicks us in the balls weve seen that plenty of times too tell me we havent sidroc grunted he couldnt tell ceorl any such thing and he knew it he gave the best comeback he could theyve got to run out of soldiers sooner or later sooner would be better sergeant werferth said neither ceorl nor sidroc wanted to quarrel with that not far away a sentry called out a challenge in algarvian all three men by the fire grabbed for their sticks not that those had been very far away the answer came back in algarvian too neither sidroc werferth nor ceorl relaxed for one thing the unkerlanters sometimes found soldiers who could speak the language of their enemies for another algarvians who didnt know the men of plegmunds brigade went right on taking them for unkerlanters not this time though not even when the sentry let out a happy yelp in forthwegian behemoths that the redheads could easily have taken for unkerlanter sidroc and his comrades exclaimed in delight behemoths with algarvians aboard them had been too rare since so many died trying to smash their way through the durrwangen bulge i wonder whos going short so the beasts can come here werferth said i dont sergeant sidroc answered i dont even care all i know is for once were not going to go short thats right by the powers above ceorl said not for the first time having ceorl agree with him made sidroc wonder if he was wrong on snowshoes the behemoths strides were surprisingly quiet the white surcoats the beasts wore the equivalent of the soldiers snow smocks helped muffle the clank and clatter of their chainmail but they drew the men of plegmunds brigade and their algarvian officers just the same and the algarvians who crewed the behemoths retained the cheerful arrogance of earlier days they waved to the forthwegians as if to younger brothers you boys come along with us one of them called and well do a proper job of smashing up the unkerlanters thats right said a redhead on a different behemoth they havent got a chance of standing up against us once we get rolling you know that sidroc knew nothing of the sort what he knew was that had the war been going just the way the algarvians wanted plegmunds brigade would never have come to the front line at all it would have stayed in grelz hunting irregulars as it had started out doing well now it was back in grelz after a year and more of some of the most desperate fighting in the war and it was facing the full weight of king swemmels army but and especially after ceorls gloom that algarvian good cheer hit sidroc like a strong slug of spirits mezentios men had gone forward against the unkerlanters why shouldnt they go forward against them again algarvian footsoldiers came up with the behemoths some of them new men by their trim uniforms and unhaggard faces gave the troopers of plegmunds brigade suspicious stares are these fellows really on our side one of them asked as if the bearded men in long tunics couldnt possibly be expected to understand his language aye we are sidroc said and well stay that way as long as you dont ask idiot questions like that the redhead glared at him sidroc was no older but hed seen things the algarvian hadnt yet imagined he looked through the newcomer as if he didnt exist a couple of mezentios veterans talked to their countryman and calmed him down somewhere not far away the algarvians had gathered together a good many eggtossers too they all started flinging death at the unkerlanters at once theyd never lay on so much just for us ceorl grumbled put their own people into the fight though and they care a lot more that was probably true sidroc shook his head no that was certainly true nothing we can do about it but make the most of it now he said whistles shrilled the algarvian behemoths lumbered forward straight through the hole the eggtossers had torn in the unkerlanter line footsoldiers algarvians and the men of plegmunds brigade together accompanied the behemoths maybe the men who rode those behemoths knew what they were talking about king swemmels soldiers seemed astonished to find algarvians attacking whenever the unkerlanters were astonished they had trouble some of them fought stubborn as always but a good many fled and a good many surrendered forward algarvian officers shouted again and again keep up with the behemoths sidroc did his best despite the snow on the ground sweat streamed down his face his legs ached but he was advancing again he blazed at an unkerlanter before the fellow could blaze at an algarvian behemoth the unkerlanter went down sidroc whooped with glee a couple of days later swemmels soldiers tried to rally at the outskirts of what was either a large village or a small town they had eggtossers in the place eggs flew through the air kicking up fans of snow and a few algarvian soldiers when they burst the counterattack slowed and threatened to stall sidroc cursed just when things looked like they were starting to go our way aye werferth agreed mournfully maybe that whoreson of a ceorl was right this is how it works for the redheads these days they dont we dont have enough to smash the unkerlanters flat when were supposed to but he was wrong the algarvians had always been good at making their eggtossers keep up with advancing soldiers now more eggs burst in and around the unkerlanterheld town than came out of it one by one the unkerlanter eggtossers fell silent suppressed by the eggs flung at them lately algarvian dragons had seemed almost as scarce in the air as algarvian behemoths were on the ground but a wing of them stooped on the town like kestrels with eggs and flame they left it a smoking ruin only then did officers blow their whistles and shout forward behemoths advanced with the footsoldiers tossing still more eggs on the enemy even before the algarvians and the men of plegmunds brigade got into the village white flags started flying unkerlanter soldiers stumbled toward them hands high ill be a son of a whore sidroc said in something approaching awe havent seen anything like this in i dont know when forward an algarvian officer not far away shouted keep moving dont waste a heartbeat push em hard well take herborn back yet three or four days before sidroc would have thought him a madman then like everyone else hed been wondering how far the algarvians would have to retreat before finally finding a line they could hold now now for the time being at least they had the bit between their teeth again he trudged on past burning peasant huts and unkerlanter corpses he didnt know how far he and his comrades could go but he was interested again in finding out an enormous wolf with fangs dripping blood had a long sly face that looked a lot like king swemmels so no forthwegian could miss the point the artist whod painted the wolf on the broadsheet had thoughtfully labeled it unkerlant a stalwart algarvian shepherd with a stout spear stood between that fearsome wolf and a flock of sheep altogether too precious and sweet to be believable they too had a label derlavaian civilization ealstan studied the broadsheet with a connoisseurs appraising eye in four and a half years of war hed seen a lot of them at last with the grudged respect one gave a clever foe he nodded this was one of algarves better efforts few forthwegians loved their cousins to the west the broadsheet might prompt his countrymen to think of the redheads as their protectors but so what ealstan thought and his face twisted into a grin almost as fearsome as the swemmelwolfs so what by the powers above if the unkerlanters keep pounding mezentios men what forthweg thinks about them wont matter the algarvians are losing that was sweet as honey to him ever since the algarvians overwhelmed the forthwegian army and so many others afterwards hed wondered if they could lose and feared they couldnt still wearing that grin he turned away from the broadsheet and walked down the street a newssheet vendor on a corner shouted read about the algarvian counterattack in the kingdom of grelz herborn threatened swemmel flees to cottbus with his tail between his legs heroes of plegmunds brigade ealstan strode past him as if he didnt exist he wondered how many times hed done that in gromheort and now in eoforwic too many he knew that he pretended newssheet vendors didnt exist whenever the algarvians moved forward and whenever he thought of plegmunds brigade he hoped his cousin was dead horribly dead and a long time dying with any luck at all pybbas potterty screeched a sign ever so much larger and gaudier than any broadsheet the algarvians had ever put up this wasnt the enormous warehouse down by the twegen river but the home of pybbas kilns and his offices the only pots and plates the magnate sold here were the ones that came out of the kilns too badly botched to go to the warehouse or to any shop no matter how shoddy our mistakes cheap another sign proclaimed pybba did a brisk business with them pybba as far as ealstan could tell did a brisk business with everything he was prowling through the offices when ealstan came in youre late he growled though ealstan was no such thing what took you so long i was looking at a new broadsheet ealstan answered wasting time pybba said sit your arse down in front of the books thats what youre supposed to be doing not leering at algarvian tripe i bet it had naked women on it the redheads are shameless buggers a couple of men whod beaten ealstan into the pottery works laughed pybba was reliably loud and reliably vulgar ealstan perched on a tall stool and got to work his boss legitimate books were quite complex enough the others before long pybba let out a roar from inside his sanctum ealstan get your arse in here this minute curse you and see if you cant bring your brains with it more snickers came from ealstans coworkers as he got down from the stool they werent without sympathy before long pybba would be bellowing at somebody else and everyone knew it what is it ealstan asked standing in the doorway shut the cursed door the pottery magnate rumbled ealstan did pybbas voice suddenly dropped which broadsheet were you talking about the one with the wolf aye ealstan nodded is there another one after the kaunians burst that egg youd best believe there is boy it shows a monster peeking out from behind a mask that looks a little like you a kaunian monster ealstan said this time pybba nodded ealstans lip curled thats disgusting its a pretty fair broadsheet pybba answered maybe not quite as strong as the one with the wolf but close whos got any use for kaunians anyhow he certainly didnt ealstan knew as much picking his words with care ealstan observed if the algarvians hate the blonds theyve probably got something going for them fat chance pybba said all right i just wanted to find out if you knew something i didnt you dont he raised his voice to an angry yell so get your miserable carcass back to work part of the reason for that yell was to make sure nobody outside wondered what pybba and ealstan were talking about in their quiet conversation the rest was because pybba was fed up with ealstan ealstan knew that too well hed tried again and again to get his boss to pay some attention to the kaunians in eoforwic and in forthweg generally who in all the kingdom had better reason to hate the occupiers and work against them nobody ealstan could see but pybba didnt care despising kaunians himself he refused to see them as allies he wants a forthwegian kingdom when the algarvians get thrown out ealstan realized as he went back to the ledgers not a kingdom of forthweg the way it was before the war but a forthwegian kingdom without kaunians the algarvians as far as hes concerned are solving the kaunian problem for him that thought was chillier than forthwegian winters commonly got for a moment ealstan was tempted to throw his job in pybbas face and find other work but hed already seen that pybba could make it hard for him to find bookkeeping work and vanai wouldnt want him to quit hed already seen that too she would want him to keep doing everything he could to drive mezentios men out of forthweg whatever happened after that it would be better than having the algarvians running the kingdom he didnt like that line of reasoning loving his wife as he did he wanted nothing less than full equality for all kaunians but he couldnt find any holes in it from somewhere in the vast pottery works came a large almost musical crash as of a good many crocks and chamber pots and dishes meeting an untimely demise one of the fellows who worked near ealstan his job was writing catchy slogans for the wares pybba produced grinned and said get out the red ink my friend there go some of the profits pybba heard the crash too pybba by all the signs heard everything he flew out of his inner sanctum like an egg flying out of a tosser powers above thats coming out of somebodys pay he roared just let me get my mitts on the butterfingered bunghole who buggered that up probably greased his hand so he could play with himself the son of a whore and he rushed off to find out exactly what had gone wrong and who was to blame for it so calm ealstan rolled his eyes so restrained the slogan writer his name was baldred chuckled never a dull moment around this place of course sometimes you wish there were why would you want that ealstan wondered ive got so i like having my hair set on fire about three times a day hardly seems like im doing anything unless somebodys screaming at me to do more oh its not so bad as that baldred said he was about halfway between ealstans age and pybbas in his midthirties with white hairs in his beard still so few that he ostentatiously plucked them out whenever he found them as long as you do the work of four men hell pay you for two what more could you want thats about the size of it ealstan agreed he thought baldred worked on pybbas unofficial business as well as that pertaining to pottery but he wasnt sure because he wasnt sure he never mentioned it to the sloganwriter every now and again he wondered whether baldred wondered about him pybba stomped back into the offices a stormcloud on his face but no cringing employee followed him to pick up whatever pay he was owed and then leave forever irked at pybba ealstan kept at his work and didnt ask the obvious question baldred did what happened fornicating stray dog came round a corner going one way at the same time as one of our boys came round it going the other pybba said aye he tripped over the stinking thing powers below eat him what else could he do three or four people saw it and the poor bastards got a scraped knee on one leg and a dog bite on the other one ah baldred said wisely no wonder you didnt fire him then the pottery magnates scowl grew more fearsome yet hed doubtless roared out of the office intending to do exactly that you tend to your knitting he rumbled or ill bloody well fire you not a thing to say i cant do that baldred got very busy very fast pybba eyed him long enough to make sure he was busy then went into his own office and slammed the door behind him hard enough to make little waves in ealstans inkwell charming as always ealstan murmured but of course baldred shrugged im not going to worry about it before too long hell pitch a fit at somebody else instead tell me im wrong cant do it ealstan got back to work too a few minutes later the outer door opened ealstan looked up still expecting the potter whod had the unfortunate encounter with the stray dog what he expected was not what he got what he got was an algarvian colonel with spiky waxed mustaches ealstan wondered if he ought to run or if he ought to scream for pybba to run before he could do either the redhead swept off his hat bowed and spoke in pretty good forthwegian i require to see the gentleman pybba if you would be so kind aye ill get him for you ealstan answered may i ask why i seek to purchase pots the algarvian raised an eyebrow if i wanted flowers you may be sure i would go elsewhere ears burning ealstan descended from his stool and went to fetch pybba pots the pottery magnate said ill give him he shook his head and followed ealstan out again eyeing the algarvian with no great warmth he asked what sort of pots have you got in mind small ones the officer gestured ones to fit the palm of the hand and the fingers so round or nearly round with snugfitting lids havent got anything just like that in stock pybba answered itd have to be a special order unless some sugar bowls would do let me see them the algarvian said come with me pybba told him ive got some samples in the next room good very good take me to them if you please when pybba and the redhead came back from the samples room the pottery magnate wore a sandbagged expression fifty thousand sugar bowls style seventeen he said hoarsely and turned to stare at the colonel why would anybody want fifty thousand sugar bowls for a very large tea party of course the algarvian said blandly that wasnt the truth of course ealstan wondered what the truth was and who would get hurt finding out rain pouring down on us sergeant istvan complained squelching along a muddy trench on the little island of becsehely water all around us his wave encompassed the bothnian ocean not far away we might as well grow fins and turn into fish szonyi shook his head which made water fly off his waxed cloth cap id sooner turn into a dragon and fly away from this miserable place probably safer to turn into a fish corporal kun observed the kuusamans have too many dragons between us and the stars he pointed upward no stars to see now not with this rain szonyi said no dragons to see either and i dont miss em one fornicating bit kun had disagreed with him about which impossible choice was better to make but not even kun could argue about that with a sigh istvan said if we were only fighting the kuusamans wed do fine and if we were only fighting the unkerlanters wed do fine too but were fighting both of em and were not doing so fine well send you back to the capital kun said you can teach the foreign ministry how to run its business itd mean i didnt have you in my hair anymore istvan scratched something gave under his fingernail he grunted in considerable satisfaction theres one louse thats not in my hair from now on the satisfaction evaporated stars only know how many ive still got though we all have em szonyi scratched too youd think the wizards would come up with a charm that could keep the lice off a fellow for more than a day or two at a time he scowled at kun as if to say he blamed the mages apprentice for the problem kun shrugged i cant do anything about it except scratch just like everybody else he did lajos came up the trench assembly the youngster called captain frigyes wants to talk to the whole company where istvan asked when right now lajos answered back there not far from the messfires he pointed in the direction from which hed come at the moment the rain had put out the fires istvan nodded to the other two veterans whod been through so much with him you heard the man he said as lajos went on to pass the word to more men in the company lets find out what the captains got to say he slogged down the trench once more kun and szonyi followed captain frigyes stood waiting while the soldiers gathered he wore a rain cape instead of using the hood or a cap like szonyis he had on a broadbrimmed felt hat in the algarvian style even though the feather in the hatband was sadly draggled the headgear cocked at a jaunty angle gave him a dashing air he couldnt have got without it he returned istvans salute and then those of his companions whats up sir istvan asked ill tell it all once captain frigyes answered that way i wont have to go over pieces of it three or four different times youll hear soon enough sergeant i promise you that istvan nodded what the company commander said made good sense even if it hadnt of course he couldnt have done anything about it a lieutenant another sergeant two corporals and even a cheeky common soldier asked frigyes more or less the same question as they came up he gave them the same answer or lack of answer istvan felt better to find out he wasnt the only nosy one in the company when just about everyone had gathered in front of frigyes he nodded to his soldiers and said men its time to stop beating around the bush nobody talks about it much but we all know the war isnt going as well for gyongyos as it ought to be weve got two foes and we cant hit either one so hard as wed like istvan preened in front of szonyi and kun hed said the same thing maybe he really did deserve a job in the foreign ministry frigyes went on most of you fought in the forests of unkerlant some of you remember how summer before last we were on the edge of breaking out of the forest and into the open country beyond and the magic the unkerlanters made to help halt us not likely id ever forget that istvan thought the other longtimers in the company were nodding kun had a look of something close to horror on his face having at least a small fragment of a mages talent hed not only felt the spell hed understood how the unkerlanters had done what theyd done for those who didnt frigyes spelled it out king swemmels mages slay their own folk the ones they reckon useless to fuel that magecraft the algarvians use the same spell but power it with the life energy of those theyve conquered neither of those is or could ever be the proper gyongyosian path stars be praised kun murmured beside istvan but frigyes went on still we need to use that spell if we are to hold back the grinning dwarfs of kuusamo kun gasped no aye frigyes said though istvan didnt think he could possibly have heard kun we need it for it has proved itself far stronger than any sorcery we have but the essence of the spell is its use of life energy not the murder of those who have done nothing to deserve it to gain that life energy whats he talking about kun whispered to istvan istvan looked at him in surprise dont you know kun was a city man if this was what being a city man meant istvan was just as well pleased to come from a mountain valley he understood how a proper gyongyosian was supposed to think for kun and any others who didnt captain frigyes spelled it out again we are seeking volunteers among the warriors of gyongyos if you say aye your name will go on a list to be held against time of need should the need arise you will serve gyongyos one last time and the glorious stars above will remember your name and your heroism forevermore who now will step forward to show you are willing no to show you are eager to serve gyongyos in her time of need madness kun said though still quietly no istvan said our duty his hand shot into the air he wasnt the first but he wasnt far behind either more and more hands went up after his szonyis among them till about two thirds of the company had volunteered stout fellows i expected nothing less frigyes said hold those hands high while i write down your names i knew i could rely on you i knew gyongyos could rely on you all through our army officers are asking this question today all through our army im sure theyre finding heroes muttering under his breath kun raised his hand too there you are istvan said i knew you had a warriors spirit in you warriors spirit my arse kun said if all you fools say aye youll hate me for saying no thats the long and short of it he probably wasnt the only one to think like that either and he probably wasnt wrong more and more hands went up till only a few stubborn or fearful soldiers refused to volunteer frigyes had been no fool to ask all the men at the same time they shamed one another forward when at last no more hands rose the company commander nodded approval i knew you were warriors he said if the stars be kind as i hope they will your names on this list will be only names and nothing more but should the need arise to give of ourselves for ekrekek arpad i know we will go bravely and of our own free will and i want you men to know one thing he held up the list of names hed taken my own name is here among yours i am willing to give my life for gyongyos too dismissed thats a brave man by the stars szonyi said as he and kun and istvan walked off together he put his name right down with ours kun gave him a pitying look then the city man glanced over to istvan you see it dont you sergeant see what istvan asked szonyis right captain frigyes is brave hes brave in battle nobody could say anything about that kun admitted but volunteering to be sacrificed doesnt prove anything about him one way or the other no szonyi asked you want your throat cut if gyongyos gets in trouble i dont and i dont suppose the captain does either kun sighed as if wondering why he met all the stupidity in the world szonyi started to get angry istvan sympathized with szonyi what are you going on about he asked kun do you think the captain didnt put his name down on the list when he said he did youd better not think that he started to get angry too angry at kun because he didnt want to be angry at the man who led them into battle i dont think that not for a minute kun said dont you see though it doesnt matter you keep saying it doesnt matter i see that istvan answered the more you say it the more i want to give you a clout in the eye i see that too so either start talking sense or else shut up all right by the stars ill make sense now kun sounded angry too and spoke with savage irony theres one captain for every hundred common soldiers more or less its harder to be a captain than a common soldier you have to do and know everything a common soldier does and knows and a lot more besides so when the time comes for the mages to start cutting throats if it ever does are they going to start cutting common soldiers throats or captains which can they replace easier if they have to use them up oh istvan walked on for a few paces he felt foolish he felt worse than foolish he felt stupid he glanced over at szonyi szonyi wasnt saying anything just tramping along with his head down and a half glum half furious expression on his face with a sigh istvan nodded to kun well youre right that made szonyi speak up i still want to give you a set of lumps maybe now more than ever why for being right kun asked wheres the justice there for being right in the wrong tone of voice istvan said you do that a lot no thats not it not this time szonyi shook his big head water flew from the brim of his cap for making me see captain frigyes was talking sly himself i dont want anybody saying one thing when he means something else or when he doesnt mean anything at all clouds hide the truth kun said the stars shine down on it they send out their light for us to see by like everything kun said that sounded wise szonyi grunted and finally reluctantly nodded istvan wasnt so sure even as a sergeant hed seen that the tricks by which men led other men werent so simple casting light on those tricks made leading harder considering the way the war was going maybe kun should have kept his mouth shut garivald had never seen so many unkerlanter soldiers in all his born days they swarmed through the forest west of herborn and clogged the roads north and south of the woods with every passing day the band of irregulars he led looked less and less important in fact it hardly seemed his band at all any more tantris gave more orders than he did and seemed happier doing it no matter how happy tantris seemed people started slipping away from the band under cover of night a couple of years before theyd slipped into the woods the same way to join the irregulars the first couple of inspectors or were they impressers joined tantris not long after herborn fell to king swemmels soldiers garivald didnt like the way they huddled with the regular he didnt like the way they looked at him either after darkness fell that night he spoke to obilot in a low whisper im going to get away while i still have the chance she nodded you think they mean to shove a uniform tunic on you it wasnt a question i think they mean to shove a uniform tunic on me and send me wherever its hottest and get me killed garivald answered after all ive led fighters who werent taking orders straight from king swemmels men youre going to slide off obilot said i already said so he answered im not going to waste a minute either i dont intend to be here when the sun comes up tomorrow he took her hand this isnt the way i wanted to say goodbye but ill come with you if you want she said garivald stared but he said again but im a woman obilot asked but they wont shove a uniform tunic on me so what i wish they would itd let me go on killing algarvians but youre right they wont and so ill come with you if you want you know where ill be going garivald said slowly back to zossen obilot answered back to your wife and your children aye i know thats why i said what i said the way i said it what will you do once i get there he asked obilot shrugged i dont know thatll be partly up to you anyhow but maybe you could use somebody to watch your back on the way and well have another few days together anyhow past that she shrugged again i never have worried much about what happens next when it happens ill worry about it all right garivald kissed her part of him was ashamed of himself he might lie with her a couple of more times on the way back to annore his wife but another part of him eagerly looked forward to that and yet another part warned he might well need a companion and maybe a fellow fighter before he got to zossen lets wait till midnight or so and then well see if we can sneak off getting out of camp going from leader of the band of irregulars to fugitive proved easier than hed expected no one challenged him as he slipped away tantris and the inspectors snored drunkenly by a fire so much for efficiency garivald thought obilot joined him a few minutes after he left his hut if they really want to theyll be able to follow our tracks in the snow she said i know garivald grimaced the algarvians and the grelzers could do the same thing in wintertime now he was worried about pursuit from his own side from the side he still preferred to the expelled enemy and their puppets he started away from the encampment lets get to a road then our tracks wont be the only ones how far is zossen obilot asked as they slipped through the trees i dont know forty fifty sixty miles something like that garivald answered with a shrug i was never more than a days walk away from it till the redheads grabbed and and took me off to herborn they were going to boil me the way king swemmel boiled raniero but munderic waylaid em when they cut through the woods instead of going around so ive seen zossen and ive seen the forest and whats around it but i havent hardly seen whatevers in between if you know what i mean obilot nodded i hadnt been far from my village before the algarvians came either just to the market town i dont think anythings left of either one of them our army fought there but we didnt win they were going to make a stand in zossen too garivald said but before they could they heard the redheads had outflanked them and so they fell back an icy breeze blew out of the west garivald steered by it it was all he had with clouds covering the stars somewhere not far away an owl hooted id rather hear that than wolves obilot remarked aye garivald was carrying his stick but his head went up and down anyway a few paces later he added some of the wolves in these woods go on two legs not four obilot laughed not that hed been joking she had her stick too they were both yawning when they emerged from the forest a couple of hours later but they kept going till they struck the road even in the middle of the night it had plenty of traffic wagons and unicorns and behemoths and columns of marching men all heading east garivald had to spring off to the side of the road again and again to keep from being trampled at sunrise they came to a tent city that hadnt been there a few days before and probably wouldnt be there in another few days can you spare us any bread obilot called to the soldiers had garivald asked the troopers likely would have cursed him or worse but a womans voice worked wonders they got black bread and ham and butter and pickled onions go on back to your farm if theres anything left of it one of the soldiers said in a northern accent heres hoping you find some pieces worth picking up thanks garivald said powers above keep you safe same to you the soldier answered i may see you again one of these days wherever your farms at the inspectors and impressersll be paying you a call sooner or later they want everybody to join the fun thats how things work thats how things work garivald repeated bitterly as he and obilot walked west against the flow of military traffic the worst of it is hes right some locusts have two legs too dont they know they have to leave some people on the land to keep everybody from starving nobody from cottbus knows anything now that obilot was back under king swemmels rule she mocked his officials too they slept for a few hours in a wrecked peasant hut lying in each others arms under both their cloaks when they woke and went back to the road they couldnt go down it for quite a while a great column of algarvian captives filled it some of the redheads looked glum some seemed relieved just to be alive and a few with the lighthearted algarvian arrogance garivald had seen before were doing their best to make a lark of it singing and grinning and acting the fool whatll happen to these bastards he called to one of the unkerlanters herding the captives along oh theyre for the mines every stinking one of em the soldier answered let em grub out brimstone and quicksilver and coal so we get some use out of em a short life and a not so merry one even thats too good for them obilot said i wish they had just one neck so we could take off all their heads at once the guard laughed and nodded any of the redheads who understood were probably less amused garivald and obilot fell in behind the column they walked at whatever pace they chose the algarvians walked at the faster pace the guards set every so often one wouldnt be able to keep up anymore garivald and obilot walked past redheaded corpses in the roadway obilot kicked the first couple they passed after that she didnt bother a strange cracking noise made garivald turn around to see what it was another smaller column of captives was gaining on him these werent algarvians they were men who looked a lot like him they looked a lot like their captors too but their uniform tunics werent rockgray they were dark green some of the grelzers whod been fighting for raniero still lived then their guards hustled them forward driving them even faster than the unkerlanters in charge of the algarvian captives garivald and obilot scrambled out of the roadway to let them pass and garivald discovered what that cracking noise was one of the guards carried not a stick but a whip which he brought down again and again on the back of a grelzer captive mercy the captive cried in accents much like garivalds mercy for you his tormentor laughed by the time were finished with you and your pals filth youll end up envying raniero you will the whip came down the grelzer dashed forward not in a run for freedom but straight toward an oncoming behemoth as the beast raised a great foot he dove under it red smeared the road when the behemoth took another step the unkerlanter guardsman cursed someone had escaped him toward evening obilot again begged food from soldiers here one of the men said we can spare you and your man a tent for the night too to their own they could be kindly to their own whod turned against them garivald fought to forget the sound the behemoths foot had made as it crushed the life from the grelzer captive only a few peasants were left in the villages by the side of the road garivald asked an old man how far to zossen never heard of it the fellow answered a couple of hours later another old man said zossen a day i think maybe not even no a day and a half easy a woman insisted they started to argue she turned out to be closer to right early the following morning garivald began recognizing the countryside he might have done it sooner but the fighting looked to have been heavy in these parts he and obilot walked on some time in the middle of the afternoon he said around that next bend therell be zossen obilot stopped she looked at him youll want to go on by yourself she said rather miserably garivald nodded hed fought for his life with obilot as well as lain beside her but all his life before the algarvians snatched him lay ahead he wouldnt have come back if he hadnt wanted that go on then obilot told him ill come along in a little while well see how things are when i get there when he still hesitated she pushed him go on i told you i knew how things were when we left the woods all right garivald trudged on along the path when he looked back over his shoulder obilot stood in the middle of the road cradling her stick in a way that said shed used it many times before and was ready to use it again if anyone bothered her but garivald was looking ahead eagerly looking ahead when he rounded that last bend obilot was behind him now in the path and in the past ahead of him lay the field he and his fellow peasants worked and nothing when he looked to where the village had stood nothing was what he saw the algarvians must have made a stand here not a house still stood not his hut not waddo the firstmans twostory home not his friend dagulfs none the buildings of zossen the houses the smithy the tavern were erased as if they had never been the people his wife his son and daughter maybe theyd fled he shook his head he knew what the odds were far more likely likely almost to the point of certainty theyd died with their village he was still standing still staring when he heard footsteps behind him he turned obilot came up and put a hand on his arm im sorry she said now you have nothing too just like me aye garivalds voice was still dull with shock he and obilot stood side by side surveying the devastation both their lives in ruin vanai was cooking rabbit stew with prunes and dried mushrooms when ealstan gave the coded knock at their door she hurried over to unbar it and let him in when she did his face glowed with excitement that made her smile too she kissed him and then asked whats happened something has i can see it youll never guess he said she looked at him in amused annoyance i was hoping i wouldnt have to you know how herborns fallen to the unkerlanters he said oh aye vanai nodded the news sheets finally admitted that a couple of days ago when they couldnt not admit it anymore if you know what i mean thats right and the algarvians and plegmunds stinking brigade were going to chase the unkerlanters out again any minute now i lose track of the lies sometimes ealstan said well pybba knows more than the news sheets do for instance had you heard the unkerlanters caught king mezentios cousin raniero the fellow hed named king of grelz no vanai kissed ealstan again this time for bringing home such wonderful news what are they going to do to him to her way of thinking brivibas way of thinking too but her grandfather never entered her mind the unkerlanters were barbarous enough to be capable of anything theyve already done it ealstan told her thats the real news they held a ceremony in herborn and boiled him alive oh for once the lurch vanais stomach gave had nothing to do with her pregnancy thats she didnt know quite what it was i wouldnt wish it on why wouldnt you wish it on an algarvian she wondered youve wished plenty of worse things on them and what theyve done to your own folk makes them deserve every one good riddance she said at last aye just so ealstan said thats how they serve up rebels and they slaughter their own folk when to strike back at the algarvians when the algarvians slaughter kaunians he hadnt said even if hed started to he tried to spare her feelings and forthwegians looked down on their cousins to the west hardly less than the kaunians of forthweg did the only difference was the kaunians of forthweg looked down on the forthwegians too ealstan went into the kitchen and came back with two mugs of wine he handed vanai one and raised the other in a toast down with algarve he drank down with algarve vanai would always drink to that the mere idea made any wine sweeter over supper ealstan said one of these days before too long swemmels men are bound to strike blows in the north to match the ones theyre making down in grelz is that something else pybba knows but the news sheets dont vanai asked he shook his head no i wish it were but it stands to reason doesnt it theyll want to run the redheads out of all of their kingdom not just part of it if they do run them out of unkerlant theyll run them back into forthweg and then theyll come after them vanai said that stands to reason too aye to her surprise ealstan didnt look so happy about it he explained why we dont get rid of our occupiers we only trade one set for another its a good trade vanai said ealstan nodded but with something less than full enthusiasm it would certainly be a good trade for forthwegs surviving kaunians the unkerlanters didnt much care about kaunianity one way or the other but an unkerlanter occupation might not be such a good trade for the forthwegians themselves the men of swemmels kingdom liked them no better than they liked unkerlanters wistfully ealstan said it would be nice if king penda could just come back vanai reached across the table and set her hand on his aye it would she said giving him and penda the benefit of the doubt as hed given it to the idea of an unkerlanter occupation as she was washing the supper dishes ealstan came up behind her and began to caress her be careful she warned him i am he said and he was vanai had trouble concentrating on the dishes her breasts had grown more tender since shed started expecting a baby but theyd also grown more sensitive after a little while she decided the dishes could wait she turned and put her arms around ealstan forthwegianstyle tunics were easier to get out of than the short tunics and trousers shed worn back in oyngestun certain postimperial kaunian writers had used that truth to sneer at the morals of forthwegian women back in the bedchamber vanai simply found it convenient afterwards she rubbed her upper lip ealstans mustache had tickled her when their lips clung while they made love im happy with you he said good she answered im happy with you too she kissed him again careless of that vicious mustache she meant it the accursed algarvian officer whod introduced her to what passed between man and woman might have been probably had been more skilled in this and that than ealstan was but so what it wasnt even that spinello hadnt wanted her to have pleasure he had so her pleasure could give him more but his own delight came first always ealstan wanted to give her pleasure for her sake not his he might have given a little less but she took ever so much more spinello went off to unkerlant she reminded herself with any luck at all hes dead horribly dead or else crippled or in torment from his wounds a lot of algarvian officers go to unkerlant not so many come back in one piece what are you thinking ealstan asked he would do that every once in a while after lovemaking or just out of the blue usually vanai felt obligated to answer with the truth tonight she gave him only part of it i love you as shed known it would be that was the part he wanted to hear he squeezed her to him im glad he said i dont know where id be without you youd be back in gromheort with your family she thought if you werent already married to some forthwegian girl youd be pledged to one youre too good a catch not to be i ought to know but where would i be without you maybe i would have lasted long enoughin the kaunian district in gromheort to come up with the spell that lets kaunians look like forthwegians maybe or maybe somebody else would have come up with it by now maybe she tried to make herself believe either of those things it wasnt easy odds are mezentios men would have shipped me west i wouldnt be here worrying about it i wouldnt be anywhere at all she clung to ealstan im very lucky she said he squeezed her again this time till she could hardly breathe you make me lucky he said vanai didnt know whether to laugh or to cry at that it was absurd but magnificently absurd the baby kicked i felt that ealstan exclaimed which was hardly surprising considering how tight he held her hes getting stronger thats what hes supposed to do vanai answered hes getting bigger too she rolled away from ealstan and onto her back then lifted her head so she could look at herself her belly definitely bulged now pretty soon even her baggy forthwegian tunics wouldnt be able to hide her pregnancy any more and so am i he set his hand on the swelling below her navel thats what youre supposed to do too before very long his hand wandered lower he was still young enough to be able to make love about as often as the thought crossed his mind as he began to stroke her vanai said this is how my belly started getting big in the first place laughing ealstan shook his head my hand had nothing to do with that but what with what followed vanai wasnt wrong either both of them slept soundly that night when they woke it was later in the morning than usual vanai wasnt surprised when ealstan told her her sorcerous disguise had slipped she repaired it while he gobbled bread and almonds and wine for breakfast is everything all right she asked when she finished the spell he nodded fine he said with his mouth full pybbas going to burst like an egg if i dont get to work on time no he wont vanai said he knows you do good work and he knows you do plenty of work too you just take him too seriously when he starts roaring and bellowing if youd listened to him roaring and bellowing as much as i have youd take him seriously too ealstan dug a finger into one ear as if to say listening to pybba had left him half deaf from her own brief meeting with the pottery magnate vanai could readily believe that ealstan gave her a quick kiss tasting of wine and hurried out the door she rolled her eyes he talked about listening to pybba but he hadnt listened to her she ate her own breakfast at a more leisurely clip then she put some silver in her handbag and went downstairs her thoughts of the evening before convinced her she needed a couple of new tunics cut even more loosely than the ones she already owned forthwegian women just didnt display the contours of their bodies if she was to seem a proper forthwegian woman she couldnt either down on the streets newssheet vendors shouted out their headlines they still said nothing about king raniero boiled alive their cry was algarvian drive toward herborn storms on plegmunds brave brigade spearheads assault vanai did not buy a news sheet she did buy a couple of tunics in a linenwool blend they would do for any but very cold days and she could wear a cloak over them then picking colors was harder than it had been before she donned a forthwegian appearance and took a while forthwegians could and did wear stronger colors than she would have chosen while she still looked like her fairhaired kaunian self the shopgirl seemed to mean it when she particularly praised the green of one tunic which left vanai pleased with herself as she headed back to the flat with her purchases she didnt have far to go but shed got less than halfway when she noticed people staring at her she wondered why but not for more than a couple of strides then panic seized her the spell must have worn off leaving her looking like what she really was in eoforwic these days what she really was could easily prove fatal vanai began to run only a couple of blocks to the flat if she could just get inside she hurried past the apothecarys where she dared not stop anymore rounded a corner and almost ran over two algarvian constables they were startled but not too startled to grab her well well what having we here one of them said but he knew they both knew too well you coming with us kaunian magic not working eh you arresting vanai screamed and kicked and clawed but she couldnt get away and no one on the street tried to help her no one at all somehow that was the worst of it
