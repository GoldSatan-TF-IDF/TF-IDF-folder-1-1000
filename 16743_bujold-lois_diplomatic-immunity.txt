lois mcmaster bujold miles vorkosigan diplomatic immunity vhtml chapter one in the image above the vid plate the sperm writhed in elegant sinuous curves its wriggling grew more energetic as the invisible grip of the medical microtractor grasped it and guided it to its target the pearllike egg round lustrous rich with promise once more dear boy into the breachfor england harry and saint george miles murmured encouragingly or at least for barrayar me and maybe grandfather piotr ha with a last twitch the sperm vanished within its destined paradise miles are you looking at those baby pictures again came ekaterins voice amused as she emerged from their cabins sybaritic bathroom she finished winding up her dark hair on the back of her head secured it and leaned over his shoulder as he sat in the station chair is that aral alexander or helen natalia well aral alexander in the making ah admiring your sperm again i see and your excellent egg my lady he glanced up at his wife glorious in a heavy red silk tunic that hed bought her on earth and grinned the warm clean scent of her skin tickled his nostrils and he inhaled happily were they not a handsome set of gametes while they lasted anyway yes and they made beautiful blastocysts you know its a good thing we took this trip i swear youd be in there trying to lift the replicator lids to peek or shaking the poor little things up like winterfair presents to see how they rattled well its all new to me your mother told me last winterfair that as soon as the embryos were safely implanted youd be acting like youd invented reproduction and to think i imagined she was exaggerating he captured her hand and breathed a kiss into its palm this from the lady who sat in the nursery next to the replicator rack all spring to study whose assignments all suddenly seemed to take twice as long to complete which of course had nothing to do with her lord popping in twice an hour to ask how she was going on the hand released traced his chin in a very flattering fashion miles considered proposing that they forgo the rather dull luncheon company in the ships passenger lounge order in room service get undressed again and go back to bed for the rest of the watch ekaterin didnt seem to regard anything about their journey as boring though this galactic honeymoon was belated but perhaps better so miles thought their marriage had had an awkward enough commencement it was as well that their settlingin had included a quiet period of domestic routine but in retrospect the first anniversary of that memorable difficult midwinter wedding had seemed to arrive in about fifteen subjective minutes they had long agreed they would celebrate the date by starting the children in their uterine replicators the debate had never been about when just how many he still thought his suggestion of doing them all at once had an admirable efficiency hed never been serious about twelve hed just figured to start with that proposition and fall back to six his mother his aunt and what seemed every other female of his acquaintance had all mobilized to explain to him that he was insane but ekaterin had merely smiled theyd settled on two to begin with aral alexander and helen natalia a double portion of wonder terror and delight at the edge of the vid recording babys first cell division was interrupted by a red blinking message light miles frowned faintly they were three jumps out from solar space in the deep interstellar on a sublightspeed run between wormholes expected to take four full days en route to tau ceti where they would make orbital transfer to a ship bound for escobar and there to yet another that would thread the jump route past sergyar and komarr to home he wasnt exactly expecting any vid calls here receive he intoned aral alexander in potentia vanished to be replaced by the head and shoulders of the tau cetan passenger liners captain miles and ekaterin had dined at his table some two or three times on this leg of their tour the man favored miles with a tense smile and nod lord vorkosigan yes captain what can i do for you a ship identifying itself as a barrayaran imperial courier has hailed us and is requesting permission to match velocities and lock on apparently they have an urgent message for you miless brows rose and his stomach sank this was not in his experience the way the imperium delivered good news on his shoulder ekaterins hand tightened certainly captain put them through the captains dark tau cetan features vanished to be replaced after a moment by a man in barrayaran imperial undress greens with lieutenants tabs and sector iv pins on his collar visions surged through miless mind of the emperor assassinated vorkosigan house burned to the ground with the replicators inside or even more hideously likely his father suffering a fatal strokehe dreaded the day some stifffaced messenger would begin by addressing him count vorkosigan sir the lieutenant saluted him lord auditor vorkosigan im lieutenant smolyani of the courier ship kestrel i have a message to handdeliver to you recorded under the emperors personal seal after which i am ordered to take you aboard were not at war are we nobodys died lieutenant smolyani ducked his head not so far as ive heard sir miless heart rate eased behind him ekaterin let out her breath the lieutenant went on but apparently a komarran trade fleet has been impounded at some place called graf station union of free habitats its listed as an independent system out near the edge of sector v my clearcode flight orders are to take you there with all safe speed and to wait on your convenience thereafter he smiled a bit grimly i hope its not a war sir because they only seem to be sending us impounded not quarantined i gather its some sort of legal entanglement sir i smell diplomacy miles grimaced well no doubt the sealed message will make it more plain bring it to me and ill take a look while we get packed up yes sir the kestrel will be locking on in just a few minutes very good lieutenant miles cut the com we said ekaterin in a quiet tone miles hesitated not a quarantine the lieutenant had said not apparently a shooting war either or not yet anyway on the other hand he couldnt imagine emperor gregor interrupting his longdelayed honeymoon for something trivial id better see what gregor has to say first she dropped a kiss on the top of his head and said simply right miles raised his personal wrist com to his lips and murmured armsman roicon duty to my cabin now the data disk with the imperial seal upon it that the lieutenant handed to miles a short time later was marked personal not secret miles sent roic his bodyguardcumbatman and smolyani off to sort and stow luggage but motioned ekaterin to stay he slipped the disk into the secured player that the lieutenant had also brought set it on the cabins bedside table and keyed it to life he sat back on the edge of the bed beside her conscious of the warmth and solidity of her body for the sake of her worried eyes he took her hand in a reassuring grip emperor gregor vorbarras familiar features appeared lean dark reserved miles read profound irritation in the subtle tightening of his lips im sorry to interrupt your honeymoon miles gregor began but if this has caught up with you you havent changed your itinerary so youre on your way home now in any case not too sorry then its my good luck and your bad that you happen to be the man physically closest to this mess briefly one of our komarrbased trade fleets put in at a deepspace facility out near sector v for resupply and cargo transfer oneor more the reports are unclearof the officers from its barrayaran military escort either deserted or was kidnapped or was murderedthe reports are unclear about that too the patrol the fleet commander sent to retrieve him ran into trouble with the locals shotsi phrase this advisedlyshots were fired equipment and structures were damaged people on both sides were apparently seriously injured no other deaths reported yet but that may have changed by the time you get this god help us the problemor one of them anywayis that were getting a significantly different version of the chain of events from the local impsec observer on the graf station side of the conflict than were getting from our fleet commander yet more barrayaran personnel are now reported either held hostage or arrested depending on which version one is to believe charges filed fines and expenses mounting and the local response has been to lock down all ships currently in dock until the muddle is resolved to their satisfaction the komarran cargomasters are now screaming back to us over the heads of their barrayaran escort with yet a third spin on events for your ah delectation all the original reports weve received so far from all the viewpoints are appended to this message enjoy gregor grimaced in a way that made miles twitch just to add to the delicacy of the problem the fleet in question is about fifty percent toscaneowned gregors new wife empress laisa was a toscane heiress and a komarran by birth a political marriage of enormous importance to the peace of the fragile union of planets that was the imperium the problem of how to satisfy my inlaws while simultaneously presenting the appearance of imperial evenhandedness to all their komarran commercial rivalsi leave to your ingenuity gregors thin smile said it all you know the drill i request and require you as my voice to get yourself to graf station with all safe speed and sort out the situation before it deteriorates further pry all my subjects out of the hands of the locals and get the fleet back on its way without starting a war if you please or breaking my imperial budget and critically find out whos lying if its the impsec observer thats a problem to bounce to their chain of command if its the fleet commanderwho is admiral eugin vorpatril by the wayit becomes very much my problem or rather very much the problem of gregors proxy his emperors voice his imperial auditor namely miles miles considered the interesting pitfalls inherent in attempting without backup far from home to arrest the ranking military officer out of the middle of his longstanding and possibly personally loyal command a vorpatril too scion of a barrayaran aristocratic clan of farflung and important political connections within the council of counts miless own aunt and cousin were vorpatrils oh thank you gregor the emperor continued in matters rather closer to barrayar something has stirred up the cetagandans around rho ceta no need to go into the peculiar details here but i would appreciate it if you would settle this impoundment crisis as swiftly and efficiently as you can if the rho cetan business becomes any more peculiar ill want you safely home the communications lag between barrayar and sector v is going to be too long to for me to breathe over your shoulder but some occasional status or progress reports from you would be a nice touch if you dont mind gregors voice did not change to convey irony it didnt need to miles snorted good luck gregor concluded the image on the viewer returned to a mute display of the imperial seal miles reached forward and keyed it off the detailed reports he could study once he was en route he or we he glanced up at ekaterins pale profile she turned her serious blue eyes toward him he asked do you want to go with me or continue on home can i go with you she asked doubtfully of course you can the only question is would you like to her dark brows rose not the only question surely do you think id be of any use or would i just be a distraction from your work theres official use and theres unofficial use dont bet that the first is more important than the second you know the way people talk to you to try to get oblique messages to me oh yes her lips twisted in distaste well yes i realize its tedious but youre very good at sorting them out you know not to mention the information to be obtained just from studying the kinds of lies people tell and ahnotlies there may well be people who will talk to you who wont talk to me for one reason or another she conceded the truth of this with a little wave of her free hand and it would be a real relief for me to have someone along i can talk to freely her smile tilted a little at this talk or vent ihemsuspect this one is going to entail quite a lot of venting yes dyou think you can stand it it could get pretty thick not to mention boring you know you keep claiming your job is boring miles but your eyes have gone all bright he cleared his throat and shrugged unrepentantly her amusement faded and her brows drew down how long do you think this sorting out will take he considered the calculation she had doubtless just made it would be six more weeks give or take a few days to the scheduled births their original travel plan would have put them back at vorkosigan house a comfortable month early sector v was in the opposite direction from their present location to barrayar insofar as the network of jump points people navigated to get from here to there could be said to have a direction several days to get from here to graf station plus an extra two weeks of travel at least to get home from there even in the fastest of fast couriers if i can settle things in less than two weeks we can both get home on time she breathed a short laugh for all that i try to be all modern and galactic that feels so strange all sorts of men dont make it home for the births of their children but my mother was out of town on the day i was born so she missed it just seems seems like a more profound complaint somehow if it runs over i suppose i could send you home on your own with a suitable escort but i want to be there too he hesitated its my first time dammit of course its making me crazy was a statement of the obvious that he managed to stop on his lips her first marriage had left her riddled with sensitive scars none of them physical and this topic trod near several of them rephrase o diplomat does it make it any easier that its the second time for you her expression grew introspective nikki was a body birth of course everything was harder the replicators take away so many risksour children could get all their genetic mistakes corrected they wont be subject to damage from a bad birthi know replicator gestation is better more responsible in every way its not as though they are being shortchanged and yet he raised her hand and touched her knuckles to his lips youre not shortchanging me i promise you miless own mother was adamantly in favor of the use of replicators with cause he was reconciled now at age thirtyodd with the physical damage he had taken in her womb from the soltoxin attack only his emergency transfer to a replicator had saved his life the teratogenic military poison had left him stunted and brittleboned but a childhoods agony of medical treatments had brought him to nearly full function if not alas full height most of his bones had been replaced piecemeal with synthetics thereafter emphasis on the pieces the rest of the damage he conceded was all his own doing that he was still alive seemed less a miracle than that he had won ekaterins heart their children would not suffer such traumas he added and if you think youre having it too luxuriously easy now to feel properly virtuous why just wait till they get out of those replicators she laughed very good point well he sighed id intended this trip to show you the glories of the galaxy in the most elegant and refined society it appears im heading instead to what i suspect is the armpit of sector v and the company of a bunch of squabbling frantic merchants irate bureaucrats and paranoid militarists life is full of surprises come with me my love for my sanitys sake her eyes narrowed in amusement how can i resist such an invitation of course i will she sobered would it violate security for me to send a message to nikki telling him well be late not at all send it from the kestrel though itll get through faster she nodded ive never been away from him so long before i wonder if hes been lonely nikki had been left on ekaterins side of the family with four uncles and a greatuncle plus matching aunts a herd of cousins a small army of friends and his grandmother vorsoisson on miless side were vorkosigan houses extensive staff and their extensive families with uncle ivan and uncle mark and the whole koudelka clan for backup impending were his doting vorkosigan stepgrandparents who had planned to arrive after miles and ekaterin for the birthday bash but who now might beat them home ekaterin might have to travel ahead to barrayar if he couldnt cut through this mess in a timely fashion but by no rational definition of the word alone i dont see how said miles honestly i expect you miss him more than he misses us or hed have managed more than that one monosyllabic note that didnt catch up with us till earth elevenyearold boys can be pretty selfcentered im sure i was her brows rose oh and how many notes have you sent to your mother in the past two months its a honeymoon trip nobody expects you to anyway shes always gotten to see the reports from my security the brows stayed up he added prudently ill drop her a message from the kestrel too he was rewarded with a league of mothers smile come to think of it perhaps he would include his father in the address as well not that his parents didnt share his missives and complain coequally about their rarity an hour of mild chaos completed their transfer to the barrayaran imperial courier ship fast couriers gained most of their speed by trading off carrying capacity miles was forced to divest all but their most essential luggage the considerable remainder along with a startling volume of souvenirs would continue the journey back to barrayar with most of their little entourage ekaterins personal maid miss pym and to miless greater regret both of roics relief armsmen it occurred to him belatedly as he and ekaterin fitted themselves into their new shared cabin that he ought to have mentioned how cramped their quarters would be hed traveled on similar vessels so often during his own years in impsec he took their limitations for grantedone of the few aspects of his former career where his undersized body had worked to his advantage so while he did spend the remainder of the day in bed with his wife after all it was primarily due to the absence of other seating they folded back the upper bunk for head space and sat up on opposite ends ekaterin to read quietly from a hand viewer miles to plunge into gregors promised pandoras box of reports from the diplomatic front he wasnt five minutes into this study before he uttered a ha ekaterin indicated her willingness to be interrupted by looking up at him with a reciprocal hm i just figured out why graf station sounded familiar were headed for quaddiespace by god quaddiespace is that someplace youve been before not personally no this was going to take more politic preparation than hed anticipated although i actually met a quaddie once the quaddies are a race of bioengineered humans developed oh two or three hundred years ago before barrayar was rediscovered they were supposed to be permanent free fall dwellers whatever their creators original plan for them was it fell through when the new grav technologies came in and they ended up as sort of economic refugees after assorted travels and adventures they finally settled as a group in what was at the time the far end of the wormhole nexus they were wary of other people by then so they deliberately picked a system with no habitable planets but with considerable asteroid and cometary resources planning to keep themselves to themselves i guess of course the explored nexus has grown around them since then so now they get some foreign exchange by servicing ships and providing transfer facilities which explains why our fleet came to be docked there although not what happened afterwards the ah he hesitated the bioengineering included a lot of metabolic changes but the most spectacular alteration was they have a second set of arms where their legs should be which is really um handy in free fall so to speak ive often wished id had a couple of extra hands when i was operating in vacuum he passed the viewer across and displayed the shot of a quaddie dressed in bright yellow shorts and a singlet handing himself along a gravityless corridor with the speed and agility of a monkey navigating through treetops oh gulped ekaterin then quickly regained control of her features how uh interesting after a moment she added it does look quite practical for their environment miles relaxed a trifle whatever her buried barrayaran reflexes were regarding visible mutations they would be trumped by her iron grip on good manners the same unfortunately did not appear to be true of their fellow members of the imperium now stranded in the quaddies system the difference between deleterious mutation and benign or advantageous modification was not readily grasped by barrayarans from the backcountry given that one officer referred to them as horrible spider mutants right in his report it was clear that miles could add racial tensions to the mix of complications they were now racing toward you get used to them pretty quickly he reassured her where did you meet one if they keep to themselves um some quick internal editing here it was on an impsec mission i cant talk about it but she was a musician of all things played the hammer dulcimer with all four arms his attempt to mime this remarkable sight resulted in his banging his elbow painfully on the cabin wall her name was nicol you would have liked her we got her out of a tight spot i wonder if she ever made it home he rubbed his elbow and added hopefully ill bet the quaddies free fall gardening techniques would interest you ekaterin brightened yes indeed miles returned to his reports with the uncomfortable certainty that this was not going to be a good task to plunge into underprepared he mentally added a review of quaddie history to his list of studies for the next few days chapter two is my collar straight ekaterins cool fingers made businesslike work upon the back of miless neck he concealed the shiver down his spine now it is she said clothes make the auditor he muttered the little cabin lacked such amenities as a fulllength mirror he had to use his wifes eyes instead this did not seem a disadvantage she stepped back as far as she could a halfpace to the bulkhead and looked him up and down to check the effect of his vorkosigan house uniform brown tunic with his family crest in silver thread upon the high collar silverembroidered cuffs brown trousers with silver side piping tall brown riding boots the vor class had been cavalry soldiers in their heyday no horse within god knew how many lightyears now that was certain he touched his wrist com mate in function to the one she wore though hers was made vorladylike with a decorative silver bracelet ill give you a headsup when im ready to come back and change he nodded toward the plain gray suit shed already laid out on the bunk a uniform for the militaryminded civvies for the civilians and let the weight of barrayaran history eleven generations of counts vorkosigan at his back make up for his lack of height his faintly hunched stance his less visible defects he didnt need to mention what should i wear since youll have to play the whole entourage something effective he smiled crookedly that red silk thing ought to be distractingly civilian enough for our stationer hosts only the male half love she pointed out suppose their security chief is a female quaddie are quaddies even attracted to downsiders one was apparently he sighed hence this mess parts of graf station are nullgee so youll likely want trousers or leggings instead of barrayaranstyle skirts something you can move in oh yes i see a knock sounded at the cabin door and armsman roics diffident voice my lord on my way roic miles and ekaterin exchanged placesfinding himself at her chest height he stole a pleasantly resilient hug in passingand he exited to the courier ships narrow corridor roic wore a slightly plainer version of miless vorkosigan house uniform as befitted his liegesworn armsmans status do you want me to pack up your things now for transfer to the barrayaran flagship mlord he asked no were going to stay aboard the courier roic almost managed to conceal his wince he was a young man of imposing height and intimidating breadth of shoulder and had described his bunk above the courier ships engineer as sort of like sleeping in a coffin mlord except for the snoring miles added i dont care to hand off control of my movements not to mention my air supply to either side in this squabble just yet the flagships bunks arent much bigger anyway i assure you armsman roic smiled ruefully and shrugged im afraid you shouldve brought jankowski sir what because hes shorter no mlord roic looked faintly indignant because hes a real veteran a count of barrayar was limited by law to a bodyguard of a score of sworn men the vorkosigans had by tradition recruited most of their armsmen from retiring twentyyear veterans of the imperial service by political need in the last decades theyd mostly been former impsec men they were a keen but graying bunch roic was an interesting new exception when did that become a concern miless fathers cadre of armsmen treated roic as a junior because he was but if they were treating him as a secondclass citizen eh roic waved somewhat inarticulately around the courier ship by which miles construed that the problem lay in more recent encounters miles about to lead off down the short corridor instead leaned against the wall and folded his arms look roictheres scarcely a man in the imperial service your age or younger whos faced as much live fire in the emperors employ as you have in the hassadar municipal guard dont let the damned green uniforms spook you its empty swagger half of em would fall over in a faint if they were asked to take down someone like that murderous lunatic who shot up hassadar square i was already halfway across the plaza mlord it wouldve been like swimming halfway across a river deciding you couldnt make it and turning around to swim back it was safer to jump him than to turn and run hed a had the same amount of time to take aim at me either way but not the time to take out another dozen or so bystanders autoneedlers a filthy weapon miles brooded briefly that it is mlord for all his height roic tended to shyness when he felt himself to be socially outclassed which unfortunately seemed to be much of the time in the vorkosigans service since the shyness showed on his surface mainly as a sort of dull stolidity it tended to get overlooked youre a vorkosigan armsman said miles firmly the ghost of general piotr is woven into that brown and silver theyll be spooked by you i promise you roics brief smile conveyed more gratitude than conviction wish i couldve met your grandfather mlord from all the tales they told of him back in the district he was quite something my greatgrandfather served with him in the mountains during the cetagandan occupation mmother says ah did she have any good stories about him roic shrugged he died of t radiation after vorkosigan vashnoi was destroyed mgrandmother would never talk about him much so i dont know pity lieutenant smolyani poked his head around the corner were locked on to the prince xav now lord auditor vorkosigan transfer tubes sealed and theyre ready for you to board very good lieutenant miles followed roic who had to duck his head through the oval doorway into the couriers cramped personnel hatch bay smolyani took up station by the hatch controls the control pad twinkled and beeped the door slid open onto the airlock and the flex tube beyond it miles nodded to roic who took a visible breath and swung himself through smolyani braced to a salute miles returned him an acknowledging nod and a thank you lieutenant and followed roic a meter of stomachlifting zerogee in the flex tube ended at a similar hatchway miles grasped the handgrips and swung himself through and smoothly to his feet in the open airlock he stepped from it into a very much more spacious hatch bay on his left roic loomed formally awaiting him the flagships door slid closed behind him before him three greenuniformed men and a civilian stood stiffly to attention not one of them changed expression at miless unbarrayaran physique presumably vorpatril whom miles barely recalled from a few passing encounters in vorbarr sultanas capital scene remembered him more vividly and had prudently briefed his staff on the mutoid appearance of emperor gregors shortest not to mention youngest and newest voice admiral eugin vorpatril was of middle height stocky whitehaired and grim he stepped forward and gave miles a crisp and proper salute my lord auditor welcome aboard the prince xav thank you admiral he did not add happy to be here no one in this group could be happy to see him under the circumstances vorpatril continued may i introduce my fleet security commander captain brun the lean tense man possibly even grimmer than his admiral nodded curtly brun had been in operational charge of the illfated patrol whose hairtrigger exploits had blown the situation from minor legal brangle to major diplomatic incident no not happy at all senior cargomaster molino of the komarran fleet consortium molino too was middleaged and quite as dyspepticlooking as the barrayarans though dressed in neat dark komarranstyle tunic and trousers a senior cargomaster was the ranking executive and financial officer of the limitedterm corporate entity that was a commercial convoy and as such bore most of the responsibilities of a fleet admiral with a fraction of the powers he also had the unenviable task of being the designated interface between a potentially very disparate bunch of commercial interests and their barrayaran military protectors which was usually enough to account for dyspepsia even without a crisis he murmured a polite my lord vorkosigan vorpatrils tone took on a slightly gritty quality my fleet legal officer ensign deslaurier tall deslaurier pale and wan beneath a lingering touch of adolescent acne managed a nod miles blinked in surprise when under his old covert ops identity he had run a supposedly independent mercenary fleet for impsecs galactic operations fleet legal had been a major department just negotiating the peaceful passage of armed ships through all the varied local space legal jurisdictions had been a fulltime job of nightmarish complexity ensign miles returned the nod and chose his wording carefully you ah would seem to have a considerable responsibility for your rank and age deslaurier cleared his throat and said in a nearly inaudible voice our department chief was sent home earlier in the voyage my lord auditor compassionate leave his motherd died i think im getting the drift of this already this your first galactic voyage by chance yes my lord vorpatril put in possibly mercifully i and my staff are entirely at your disposal my lord auditor and are ready with our reports as you requested would you care to follow me to our briefing room yes thank you admiral some shuffling and ducking through the corridors brought the party to a standard military briefing room bolteddown holovidequipped table and station chairs friction matting underfoot harboring the faint musty odor of a sealed and gloomy chamber that never enjoyed sunlight or fresh air the place smelled military miles suppressed the urge to take a long nostalgic inhalation for old times sake at his hand signal roic took up an impassive guards stance just inside the door the rest waited for him to seat himself then disposed themselves around the table vorpatril on his left deslaurier as far away as possible vorpatril displaying a clear understanding of the etiquette of the situation or at least some sense of selfpreservation began so how may we serve you my lord auditor miles tented his hands on the table i am an auditor my first task is to listen if you please admiral vorpatril describe for me the course of events from your point of view how did you arrive at this impasse from my point of view vorpatril grimaced it started out seeming no more than the usual one damned thing after another we were supposed to be in dock here at graf station for five days for contracted cargo and passenger transfers since there was no reason at that time to think that the quaddies were hostile i granted as many station leaves as possible which is standard procedure miles nodded the purposes of barrayaran military escorts for komarran ships ranged from overt to subtle to neverspoken overtly escorts rode along to repel hijackers from the cargo vessels and supply the military part of the fleet with maneuvering experience scarcely less valuable than war games more subtly the ventures provided opportunity for all sorts of intelligence gatheringeconomic political and social as well as military and it provided cadres of young provincial barrayaran men future officers and future civilians with seasoning contact with the wider galactic culture on the neverspoken side were the lingering tensions between barrayarans and komarrans legacy of the in miless view fully justified conquest of the latter by the former a generation ago it was the emperors express policy to move from a stance of occupation to one of full political and social assimilation between the two planets that process was proving slow and rocky vorpatril continued the toscane corporations ship idris put into dock for jump drive adjustments and ran into unexpected complications when they pulled things apart repaired parts failed to pass calibration tests when reinstalled and were sent back to the station shops for refabrication five days became ten while that bickering was going back and forth then lieutenant solian turned up missing do i understand correctly that the lieutenant was the barrayaran security liaison officer aboard the idris miles said fleet beat cop charged with maintaining peace and order among crew and passengers keeping an eye out for any illegal or threatening activities or suspicious personsnot a few historic hijackings were inside jobsand being first line of defense in counterintelligence more quietly keeping an ear out for potential disaffection among the emperors komarran subjects obliged to render all possible assistance to the ship in physical emergencies coordinating evacuation or rescue with the military escort liaison officer was a job that could shift from yawningly boring to lethally demanding in an eyeblink captain brun spoke for the first time yes my lord miles turned to him one of your people was he how would you describe lieutenant solian he was newly assigned brun answered then hesitated i did not have a close personal acquaintance with him but all his prior personnel evaluations gave him high marks miles glanced at the cargomaster did you know him sir we met a few times said molino i mostly stayed aboard the rudra but my impression of him was that he was friendly and competent he seemed to get along well with crew and passengers quite the walking advertisement for assimilation excuse me vorpatril cleared his throat solian was komarran my lord ah argh the reports hadnt mentioned this wrinkle komarrans were but lately permitted admittance into the barrayaran imperial service the first generation of such officers was handpicked and on their marks to prove their loyalty and competence the emperors pets miles had heard at least one barrayaran fellowofficer describe them in covert disgruntlement the success of this integration was a high personal priority of gregors admiral vorpatril certainly knew it too miles moved the mysterious fate of solian up a few notches in his mental list of mosturgent priorities what were the circumstances of his original disappearance brun answered very quiet my lord he signed offshift in the usual manner and never showed up for his next watch when his cabin was finally checked it seemed that some of his personal effects and a valise were missing although most of his uniforms were left there was no record of his finally leaving the ship but then hed know how to get out without being seen if anyone could which is why i posit desertion the ship was very thoroughly searched after that he has to have altered the records or slipped out with the cargo or something any sense that he was unhappy in his work or place notno my lord nothing special anything not special well there was the usual chronic chaff about being a komarran in thisbrun gestured at himselfuniform i suppose where he was placed he was in position to get it from both sides were trying to all be one side now miles decided this was not the time or place to pursue the unconscious assumptions behind bruns wordchoice cargomaster molinodo you have any sidelights on this was solian subject to ah reproof from his fellow komarrans molino shook his head the man seemed to be well liked by the crew of the idris as far as i could tell stuck to business didnt get into arguments nevertheless i gather that your first impression was that he had deserted it seemed possible brun admitted im not casting aspersions but he was komarran maybe hed found it tougher than he thought it would be admiral vorpatril disagreed he added scrupulously vorpatril waved a hand in a gesture of judicious balance the more reason not to think desertion high commands been pretty careful of what komarrans they admit to the service they dont want public failures in any case said brun we put all our own security people on alert to search for him and asked for help from the graf station authorities which they were not especially eager to offer they just kept repeating theyd had no sign of him in either the gravity or nullgee sections and no record of anyone of his description leaving the station on their localspace carriers and then what happened admiral vorpatril answered time ran on repairs on the idris were completed and signed off pressure he eyed molino without favor grew to leave graf station and continue on the planned route mei dont leave my men behind if i can help it molino said rather through his teeth it made no economic sense to tie up the entire fleet over one man you might have left one light vessel or even a small team of investigators to pursue the matter to follow on when they were concluded and let the rest continue i also have standing orders not to split the fleet said vorpatril his jaw tightening but we havent suffered a hijacking attempt in this sector for decades argued molino miles felt he was witnessing round nplusone of an ongoing debate not since barrayar began providing you with free military escorts said vorpatril with false cordiality odd coincidence that his voice grew firmer i dont leave my men i swore that at the escobar debacle back when i was a milkfaced ensign he glanced at miles under your fathers command as it happened uhoh this could be trouble miles let his brows climb in curiosity what was your experience there sir vorpatril snorted reminiscently i was a junior pilot on a combat drop shuttle orphaned when our mothership was blown to hell by the escos in high orbit i suppose if wed made it back during the retreat wed have been blown up with her but still nowhere to dock nowhere to run even the few surviving ships that had an open docking cradle not pausing for us a couple of hundred men on board including woundedit was a right nightmare let me tell you miles felt the admiral had barely clipped off a son at the end of that last sentence miles said cautiously im not sure admiral vorkosigan had much choice left by the time he inherited command of the invasion after the death of prince serg oh none at all vorpatril agreed with another wave of his hand im not saying the man didnt do all he could with what he had but he couldnt do it all and i was among those sacrificed spent almost a year in an escobaran prison camp before the negotiators finally got me mustered home the escobarans didnt make it a holiday for us i can tell you that it could have been worse you might have been a female escobaran prisoner of war in one of our camps miles decided not to suggest this exercise of the imagination to the admiral just now i would expect not all im saying is i know what it is to be abandoned and i wont do it to men of mine for any trivial reason his narrow glance at the cargomaster made it clear that evaporating komarran corporate profits did not qualify as a weighty enough reason for this violation of principle events proved he hesitated and rephrased himself for a time i thought events had proved me right for a time miles echoed not any more now well what happened next was pretty pretty disturbing there was an unauthorized cycling of a personnel airlock in the graf station cargo bay next to where the idris was locked on no ship or personnel pod was sighted at it howeverthe tube seals werent activated by the time the station security guard got there the bay was empty but there was a quantity of blood on the floor and signs of something dragged to the lock the blood came up on testing as solians it looked like he was trying to make it back to the idris and someone jumped him someone who didnt leave footprints added brun darkly at miless inquiring look vorpatril explained in the gravitational areas where the downsiders stay the quaddies buzz around in these little personal floaters they operate em with their lower hands leaving their upper arms free no footprints no feet for that matter ah yes i understand said miles blood but no bodyhas a body been found not yet said brun searched for oh yes in all the possible trajectories i suppose its occurred to you that a deserter might try to fake his own murder or suicide to free himself from pursuit i might have thought that said brun but i saw the loading bay floor no one could lose that much blood and live there must have been three or four liters at least miles shrugged the first step in emergency cryonic prep is to exsanguinate the patient and replace his blood with cryofluid that can easily leave several liters of blood on the floor and the victimwell potentially alive hed had close personal experience of the process or so elli quinn and bel thorne had told him afterward on that dendarii free mercenary mission that had gone so disastrously wrong granted he didnt remember that part except through bels extremely vivid description bruns brows flicked up i hadnt thought of that it rather sprang to my mind said miles apologetically i could show you the scars brun frowned then shook his head i dont think there would have been time before station security arrived on the scene even if a portable cryochamber was standing ready brun opened his mouth then closed it again he finally said its a complicated scenario my lord i dont insist on it said miles easily he considered the other end of the cryorevival process except that id also point out that there are other sources of several liters of nice fresh onesownpersonal blood besides a victims body such as a revival labs or hospitals synthesizer the product would certainly light up a cursory dna scan you couldnt even call it a false positive exactly a bioforensics lab could tell the difference though traces of cryofluid would be obvious too if only someone thought to look for them he added wistfully i hate circumstantial evidence who ran the identification check on the blood brun shifted uncomfortably the quaddies wed downloaded solians dna scan to them when he first went missing but the security liaison officer from the rudra had gone over by thenhe was right there in the bay watching their tech he reported the match to me as soon as the analyzer beeped thats when i podded across to look at it all myself did he collect another sample to crosscheck i believe so i can ask the fleet surgeon if he received one before um other events overtook us admiral vorpatril sat looking unpleasantly stunned i thought certainly poor solian was murdered by some he fell silent it doesnt sound as though that hypothesis is ruled out either yet miles consoled him in any case you honestly believed it at the time have your fleet surgeon examine his samples more thoroughly please and report to me and to graf station security too ah maybe not them yet even if the results were negative the query would only serve to stir up more quaddie suspicions about barrayarans and if they were positive miles wanted to think about that first at any rate what happened next that solian was himself fleet security made his murderapparent murderseem especially sinister vorpatril admitted had he been trying to get back with some warning we couldnt tell so i canceled all leaves went to alert status and ordered all ships to detach from dockside with no explanation of why put in molino vorpatril glowered at him during an alert a commander does not stop to explain orders he expects to be instantly obeyed besides the way you people had been champing at the bit complaining about the delays i hardly thought id need to repeat myself a muscle jumped in his jaw he inhaled and returned to his narrative at this point we suffered something of a communications breakdown here comes the smokescreen at last our understanding was that a twoman security patrol sent to retrieve an officer who was late reporting in that would be ensign corbeau yes corbeau as we understood it at the time the patrol and the ensign were attacked disarmed and detained by quaddies the real story as it emerged later was more complex but that was what i had to go on as i was trying to clear graf station of all our personnel and stand off for any contingency up to immediate evacuation from local space miles leaned forward did you believe it to be random quaddies who had seized your men or did you understand it to have been graf station security vorpatril didnt quite grind his teeth but almost he answered nonetheless yes we knew it was their security did you ask your legal officer to advise you no did ensign deslaurier volunteer advice no my lord deslaurier managed to whisper i see go on i ordered captain brun to send a strike patrol in to retrieve now three men from a situation that i believed had just proved lethally dangerous to barrayaran personnel armed with rather more than stunners i understand i couldnt ask my men to go up against those numbers with only stunners my lord said brun there are a million of those mutants out there miles let his brows climb on graf station i thought its resident population was around fifty thousand civilians brun made an impatient gesture a million to twelve fifty thousand to twelveregardless they needed weapons with authority my rescue party needed to get in and out as quickly as possible having to deal with as little argument or resistance as possible stunners are useless as weapons of intimidation i am familiar with the argument miles leaned back and rubbed his lips go on my patrol reached the place our men were being held graf station security post number three was it not miles put in yes tell mein all the time since the fleet has been here hadnt any of your men on leave had close encounters with station security no drunk and disorderlies no safety violations nothing brun looking as though the words were being pulled from his mouth with dental pliers said three men were arrested by graf station security last week for racing float chairs in an unsafe manner while inebriated and what happened to them how did your fleet legal advisor handle it ensign deslaurier muttered they spent a few hours in lockup then i went down and saw that their fines were paid and pledged to the stationer adjudicator that they would be confined to quarters for the duration of our stay so you were all by then familiar with standard procedures for retrieving men from contretemps with station authorities these were not drunk and disorderlies this time these were our own security forces carrying out their duties said vorpatril go on sighed miles what happened with your patrol i still dont have their own firsthand reports my lord said brun stiffly the quaddies have only let one unarmed medical officer visit them in their current place of confinement shots were exchanged both stunner and plasma fire inside security post three quaddies swarmed the place and our men were overwhelmed and taken prisoner the swarming quaddies had included not unnaturally in miless view most of the graf station professional and volunteer fire brigades plasma fire in a civilian space station oh my aching head so said miles gently after we shot up the police station and set the habitat on fire what did we do for an encore admiral vorpatrils teeth set briefly i am afraid that when the komarran ships in dock failed to obey my urgent orders to cast off and instead allowed themselves to be locked down i lost the initiative in the situation too many hostages had passed into quaddie control by then the komarran independent captainowners were entirely laggard in obeying my position orders and the quaddies own militia such as it is was allowed to move into position around us we froze in a standoff for almost two full days then we were ordered to stand down and wait your arrival thank all the gods for that military intelligence was as nothing to military stupidity but to slide halfway to stupid and stop was rare indeed vorpatril deserved some credit for that at least brun put in glumly not much choice at that point its not as though we could threaten to blow up the station with our own ships in dock you couldnt blow up the station in any case miles pointed out mildly it would be mass murder not to mention a criminal order the emperor would have you shot brun flinched and subsided vorpatrils lips thinned the emperor or you gregor and i would flip a coin to see who got to go first a little silence fell fortunately miles continued it appears heads have cooled all round for that admiral vorpatril i do thank you i might add the fates of your respective careers are a matter between you and your ops command unless you manage to make me late for the births of my very first children in which case youd better start looking for a deep deep hole my job is to talk out as many of the emperors subjects from quaddie hands at the lowest prices as i can if im really lucky when im done our trade fleets may be able to dock here again someday you have not given me an especially strong hand of cards to play here unfortunately nonetheless ill see what i can do i want copies of all raw transcripts pertaining to these late events provided for my review please yes my lord growled vorpatril but his voice grew almost anguished that still doesnt tell me what happened to lieutenant solian i will undertake to give that question my keenest attention as well admiral miles met his eyes i promise you vorpatril nodded shortly but lord auditor vorkosigan cargomaster molino put in urgently graf station authorities are trying to fine our komarran vessels for the damage done by barrayaran troops it must be made plain to them that the military stands alone in this criminal activity miles hesitated a long moment how fortunate for you cargomaster he said at last that in the event of a genuine attack the reverse would not be true he tapped the table and rose to his feet chapter three miles stood on tiptoe to peer through the little port beside the kestrel s personnel hatch as the ship maneuvered toward its assigned docking cradle graf station was a vast jumbled aggregation an apparent chaos of design not surprising in an installation in its third century of expansion somewhere buried in the core of the sprawling bristling structure was a small metallic asteroid honeycombed for both space and the material used in building this very oldest of the quaddies many habitats also somewhere in its innermost sections could still be seen according to the guidevids actual elements from the brokenapart and reconfigured jumpship in which the initial band of hardy quaddie pioneers had made their historic voyage to this refuge miles stepped back and gestured ekaterin to the port for a look he reflected on the political astrography of quaddiespace or rather as it was formally designated the union of free habitats from this initial point quaddie groups had leapfrogged out to build daughter colonies in both directions along the inner of the two rings of asteroids that had made this system so attractive to their ancestors several generations and a million strong later the quaddies were in no danger whatsoever of running out of space energy or materials their population could expand as fast as it chose to build only a handful of their many scattered habitats maintained areas supplied with artificial gravity for legged humans either visitor or resident or even dealt with outsiders graf station was one that did accept galactics and their trade as did the orbital arcologies dubbed metropolitan sanctuary minchenko and union station this last was the seat of quaddie government such as it was a variant of bottomup representative democracy based miles was given to understand on the work gang as its primary unit he hoped to god he wasnt going to end up negotiating with a committee ekaterin glanced around and with an excited smile motioned roic to take a turn he ducked his head and nearly pressed his nose to the port staring in open curiosity this was ekaterins first trip outside the barrayaran empire and roics first venture off barrayar ever miles paused to thank his habits of mild paranoia that before hed dragged them off world hed troubled to send them both through a short intensive course in space and free fall procedures and safety hed pulled rank and strings to get access to the military academy facilities albeit on a free week between scheduled classes for a tailored version of the longer course that roics older armsmen colleagues had received routinely in their former imperial service training ekaterin had been extremely startled when miles had invitedpersuadedwell hustledher to join the bodyguard in the orbital school daunted at first exhausted and close to mutiny partway through proud and elated at the finish for passenger liners in pressurization trouble it was the usual method to stuff their paying customers into simple bubbles called bod pods to passively await rescue miles had been stuck in a bod pod a time or two himself hed sworn that no man and most especially no wife of his would ever be rendered so artificially helpless in an emergency his whole party had traveled with their own personally tailored quickdonning suits at hand regretfully miles had left his old customized battle armor in storage roic unbent from the port looking especially stoic faint vertical lines of worry between his eyebrows miles asked has everyone had their antinausea pills roic nodded earnestly ekaterin said have you had yours oh yes he glanced down his plain gray civilian tunic and trousers i used to have this nifty biochip on my vagus nerve that kept me from losing my lunch in free fall but it got blown out with the rest of my guts in that unpleasant encounter with the needlegrenade i should get it replaced one of these days miles stepped forward and took one more glance outside the station had grown to occlude most of the view so roic if some quaddies visiting hassadar made themselves obnoxious enough to win a visit to the municipal guards gaol and then a bunch more quaddies popped up and tried to bust them out with militarygrade weapons and shot up the place and torched it and burned some of your comrades just how would you feel about quaddies at that point um not too friendly mlord roic paused pretty pissed actually thats what i figured miles sighed ah here we go clanks and thumps sounded as the kestrel came gently to rest and the docking clamps felt their way to a firm grip the flex tube whined seeking its seal guided by the kestrel s engineer at the hatch controls and then seated itself with an audible chink all tight sir the engineer reported all right troops were on parade miles murmured and waved roic on the bodyguard nodded and slipped through the hatch after a moment he called back ready mlord all was if not well good enough miles followed through the flex tube ekaterin close behind him he stole a glance over his shoulder as he floated forward she was svelte and arresting in the red tunic and black leggings her hair in a sophisticated braid around her head zero gee had a charming effect on welldeveloped female anatomy that he decided he had probably better not point out to her as an opening move setting this first meeting in the nullgee section of graf station was clearly calculated to put the visitors off balance to emphasize just whose space this was if theyd wanted to be polite the quaddies would have received them in one of the grav sections the stationside airlock opened into a spacious cylindrical bay its radial symmetry airily dispensing with the concepts of up and down roic floated with one hand on the grip by the hatch the other kept carefully away from his stunner holster miles craned his neck to take in the array of half a dozen quaddies males and females in paramilitary grade halfarmor floating in crossfire positions around the bay their weapons were out but shouldered formality masking threat lower arms thicker and more muscular than their uppers emerged from their hips both sets of arms were protected by plasmadeflecting vambraces miles couldnt help reflecting that here were people who actually could shoot and reload at the same time interestingly though two bore the insignia of graf station security the rest were in the colors and badges of the union militia impressive window dressing but these were not the people he needed to be attending to his gaze swept on to the three quaddies and the legged downsider waiting directly across from the hatch faintly startled expressions as they in turn took in his own nonstandard appearance were quickly suppressed on three out of four faces the senior graf station security officer was instantly recognizable by his uniform weapons and glower another middleaged quaddie male also wore some sort of stationer uniform slate blue in a conservative style designed to reassure the public a whitehaired female quaddie was more elaborately dressed in a maroon velvet doublet with slashed upper sleeves silky silver fabric puffing from the slits with matching puffy shorts and tight lower sleeves the legged downsider also wore the slateblue uniform except with trousers and friction boots short graying brown hair floated around the head that turned toward miles miles choked trying not to swear aloud in shock my god its bel thorne what the devil was the exmercenary betan hermaphrodite doing here the question answered itself as soon as it formed so now i know who our impsec observer on graf station is which abruptly raised the reliability of those reports to a vastly higher level or did it miless smile froze concealing he hoped his sudden mental disarray the whitehaired woman was speaking in a very chilly tonesome automatic part of miless mind pegged her as senior as well as oldest present good afternoon lord auditor vorkosigan welcome to the union of free habitats miles one hand still guiding a blinking ekaterin into the bay managed a polite return nod he left the second handhold flanking the hatch to her for an anchor and managed to set himself in air without imparting an unwanted spin right side up with relation to the senior quaddie woman thank you he returned neutrally bel what the hell give me a sign dammit the hermaphrodite returned his brief wideeyed stare with cool disinterest and as if casually raised a hand to scratch the side of its nose signaling perhaps wait for it i am senior sealer greenlaw the quaddie woman continued and i have been assigned by my government to meet with you and provide arbitration between you and your victims on graf station this is crew chief venn of graf station security boss watts who is supervisor of graf station downsider relations and assistant portmaster bel thorne how do you do madam gentlemen honorable herm miless mouth continued on autopilot he was too shaken by the sight of bel to take exception to that your victims for now permit me to introduce my wife lady ekaterin vorkosigan and my personal assistant armsman roic all the quaddies frowned disapprovingly at roic but now it was the turn for bels eyes to widen staring with sudden attention at ekaterin a purely personal aspect of it all blazed across miless mind then as he realized that he was shortly very probably going to be in the unsettling position of having to introduce his new wife to his old flame not that bels oftexpressed crush on him had ever been consummated exactly to his retrospective sometimesregret portmaster thorne ah miles felt himself scrambling for firm footing in more ways than one his voice went brightly inquiring have we met i dont believe weve ever met lord auditor vorkosigan no returned bel miles hoped his was the only ear that detected the slight emphasis on his barrayaran name and title in that familiar alto drawl ah miles hesitated throw out a lure a line something my mother was betan you know what a coincidence bel said blandly so was mine bel goddammit i have had the pleasure of visiting beta colony several times i havent been back but once in decades the faint light of bels notably vile sense of humor faded in the brown eyes and the herm relented as far as id like to hear about the old sandbox it would be my pleasure to discuss it miles responded praying this exchange sounded diplomatic and not cryptic soon soon bloody soon bel returned him a cordial acknowledging nod the whitehaired quaddie woman gestured toward the end of the bay with her upper right hand if you would please accompany us to the conference chamber lord and lady vorkosigan armsman roic certainly sealer greenlaw miles favored her with an after you maam halfbow in air then uncurled to get a foot to the wall to push off after her ekaterin and roic followed ekaterin arrived and braked at the round airseal door with reasonable grace though roic landed crookedly with an audible thump hed used too much power pushing off but miles couldnt stop to coach him on the fine points here hed come to the right of it soon enough or break an arm the next series of corridors featured a sufficiency of handgrips the downsiders kept up with the quaddies who both preceded and followed to miless secret satisfaction none of the guards had to pause and collect any outofcontrol spinning or helplessly becalmed barrayarans they came at length to a chamber with a windowwall offering a panoramic view out across one arm of the station and into the deep stardusted void beyond any downsider suffering from a touch of agoraphobia or pressurization paranoia would doubtless prefer to cling to the wall on the opposite side miles floated gently up to the transparent barrier stopping himself with two delicately extended fingers and surveyed the spacescape his mouth crooked up unwilled this is very fine he said honestly he glanced around roic had found a wall grip near the door awkwardly shared with the lower hand of a quaddie guard who glowered at him as they both shifted fingers trying not to touch the other the majority of the honor guard had been shed in the adjoining corridor and only two one graf station and one union now hovered albeit alertly the chamber endwalls featured decorative plants growing out of illuminated spiraling tubes that held their roots in a hydroponic mist ekaterin paused by one examining the multicolored leaves closely she tore her attention away and her brief smile faded watching miles watching their quaddie hosts watching for cues her eye fell curiously on bel who was surveying miles in turn the herms expressionwell anyone else would see it as bland probably miles suspected it was deeply ironic the quaddies took up position in a hemispherical arrangement around a central vid plate bel hovering near its comradeinslateblue boss watts arching posts of different heights featured the sort of com link control boards usually found on stationchair arms looking a bit like flowers on stalks which provided suitably spaced tethering points miles picked a post with his back to open space ekaterin floated over and took up a spot a little behind him shed gone into her silent highly reserved mode which miles had to school himself not to read as unhappy it might just mean that she was processing too hard to remember to be animated fortunately the ivorycarved expression also simulated aristocratic poise a pair of younger quaddies whose green shirtandshorts garb miless eye decoded as servitor offered drink bulbs all around miles selected something billed to be tea ekaterin took fruit juice and roic with a glance at his quaddie opposite numbers who were offered none declined a quaddie could grip a handhold and a drink bulb and still have two hands left to draw and aim a weapon it hardly seemed fair senior sealer greenlaw miles began my credentials you should have received she nodded her short fine hair floating in a wispy halo with the motion he continued i am unfortunately not wholly familiar with the cultural context and meaning of your title who do you speak for and do your words bind them in honor that is to say do you represent graf station a department within the union of free habitats or some larger entity still and who reviews your recommendations or sanctions your agreements and how long does it usually take them she hesitated and he wondered if she was studying him with the same intensity that he studied her quaddies were even longerlived than betans who routinely made it to onehundredandtwenty standard and might expect to see a century and a half how old was this woman i am a sealer for the unions department of downsider relations i believe some downsider cultures would term this a minister plenipotentiary for their state department or whatever body administers their embassies ive served the department for the past forty years including tours as junior and senior counsel for the union in both our bordering systems the near neighbors to quaddiespace a few jumps away on heavily used routes she was saying shed spent time on planets and incidentally that shes been doing this job since before i was born if only she wasnt one of those people who figured that if youd seen one planet youd seen em all this sounded promising miles nodded my recommendations and agreements will be reviewed by my work gang on union stationwhich is the board of directors of the union of free habitats well so there was a committee but happily they werent here miles pegged her as being roughly the equivalent of a senior barrayaran minister in the council of ministers well up to his own weight as an imperial auditor granted the quaddies had nothing in their governmental structure equivalent to a barrayaran count though they seemed none the worse for the deprivationmiles suppressed a dry snort one layer from the top greenlaw had a finite number of persons to please or persuade he permitted himself his first faint hope for a reasonably supple negotiation her white brows drew in they called you the emperors voice do barrayarans really believe their emperors voice comes from your mouth across all those lightyears miles regretted his inability to lean back in a chair he straightened his spine a trifle instead the name is a legal fiction not a superstition if thats what youre asking actually emperors voice is a nickname for my job my real title is imperial auditora reminder that always my first task is to listen i answer toand foremperor gregor alone this seemed a good place to leave out such complications as potential impeachment by the council of counts and other barrayaranstyle checks and balances such as assassination the security officer venn spoke up so do you or do you not control the barrayaran military forces here in union space hed evidently acquired enough experience of barrayaran soldiers by now to have a little trouble picturing the slightly crooked runt floating before him dominating the bluff vorpatril or his nodoubt large and healthy troopers yeah but you should see my da miles cleared his throat as the emperor is commanderinchief of the barrayaran military his voice is automatically the ranking officer of any barrayaran force in his vicinity yes if the emergency so demands it so are you saying that if you ordered it those thugs out there would shoot said venn sourly miles managed a slight bow in his direction not easy in free fall sir if an emperors voice so ordered it theyd shoot themselves this was pure swaggerwell part swaggerbut venn didnt need to know it bel remained straightfaced somehow thank whatever gods hovered here though miles could almost see the laugh getting choked back dont pop your eardrums bel the sealers white eyebrows took a moment to climb back down to horizontal again miles continued nevertheless while its not hard to get any group of persons excited enough to shoot at things one purpose of military discipline is to ensure they also stop shooting on command this is not a time for shooting but for talkingand listening i am listening he tented his fingers in front of what would be his lap if he were sitting from your point of view what was the sequence of events that led to this unfortunate incident greenlaw and venn both started to speak at once the quaddie woman opened an upper hand in a gesture of invitation to the security officer venn nodded and continued it started when my department received an emergency call to apprehend a pair of your men who had assaulted a quaddie woman here was a new player on stage miles kept his expression neutral assaulted in what sense broke into her living quarters roughed her up threw her around broke one of her arms they evidently had been sent in pursuit of a certain barrayaran officer who had failed to report for duty ah would that be ensign corbeau yes and was he in her living quarters yes by her invitation yes venn grimaced they had apparently um become friends garnet five is a premier dancer in the minchenko memorial troupe which performs live zerogee ballet for residents of the station and for downsider visitors venn inhaled it is not entirely clear who went to whose defense when the barrayaran patrol came to remove their tardy officer but it degenerated into a noisy brawl we arrested all the downsiders and took them to security post three to sort out by the way sealer greenlaw broke in your ensign corbeau has lately requested political asylum in the union this was new too how lately this morning when he learned you were coming miles hesitated he could imagine a dozen scenarios to account for this ranging from the sinister to the foolish he couldnt help it that his mind leapt to the sinister are you likely to grant it he asked finally she glanced at boss watts who made a little noncommittal gesture with a lower hand and said my department has taken it under advisement if you want my advice youll bounce it off the far wall growled venn we dont need that sort here i should like to interview ensign corbeau at the earliest convenience said miles well he evidently doesnt want to talk to you said venn nevertheless i consider firsthand observation and eyewitness testimony critical for my correct understanding of this complex chain of events ill also need to speak with the other barrayaran he clipped the word hostages and substituted detainees for the same reason its not that complex said venn a bunch of armed thugs came charging onto my station violated customs stunned dozens of innocent bystanders and a number of station security officers attempting to carry out their duties tried to effect what can only be called a jailbreak and vandalized property charges against them for their crimesdocumented on vidrange from the discharge of illegal weapons to resisting arrest to arson in an inhabited area its a miracle that no one was killed that unfortunately has yet to be demonstrated miles countered instantly the trouble is that from our point of view the arrest of ensign corbeau was not the beginning of the sequence of events admiral vorpatril had reported a man missing well before thatlieutenant solian according to both your witnesses and ours a quantity of his blood tantamount to a body part was found on the floor of a graf station loading bay military loyalty runs two waysbarrayarans do not abandon our own dead or alive where is the rest of him venn nearly ground his teeth we looked for the man he is not on graf station his body is not in space in any reasonable trajectory from graf station we checked weve told vorpatril that repeatedly how hardor easyis it for a downsider to disappear in quaddiespace if i may answer that bel thorne broke in smoothly as that incident impinges on my department greenlaw motioned assent with a lower hand while simultaneously rubbing the bridge of her nose with an upper boarding to and from galactic ships here is fully controlled not only from graf station but from our other nexus trade depots as well it is if not impossible at least difficult to pass through customs and immigration areas without leaving some sort of record including general vid monitors of the areas your lieutenant solian does not show up anywhere in our computer or visual records for that day truly miles gave bel a look is this the straight story bel returned a brief nod yes truly now insystem travel is much less strictly controlled it is more feasible for someone to pass out of graf station to another union habitat without notice if that person is a quaddie any downsider however would stand out in the crowd standard missingperson procedures were followed in this case including notifications of other habitat security departments solian has simply not been seen on graf station or any other union habitat how do you account for his blood in the loading bay the loading bay is on the outboard side of the station access control points it is my opinion that whoever created that scene came from and returned to one of the ships in that docksandlocks sector miles silently noted bels word choice whoever created that scene not whoever murdered solian of course bel had been present at a certain spectacular emergency cryoprep too venn put in irritably all of which were ships from your fleet at the time in other words you brought your own troubles with you we are a peaceful people here miles frowned thoughtfully at bel and mentally reshuffled his plan of attack is the loading bay in question very far from here its on the other side of the station said watts i think i would like to see it and its associated areas first before i interview ensign corbeau and the other barrayarans perhaps portmaster thorne would be so good as to conduct me on a tour of the facility bel glanced at boss watts and got an approving low sign i should be very pleased to do so lord vorkosigan said bel next perhaps we could take my ship around that would be very efficient yes replied bel eyes brightening with appreciation i could accompany you thank you good catch that would be most satisfactory wild as miles now was to get away and shake bel down in private he had to smile his way through further formalities including the official presentation of the list of charges costs fines and punitive fines vorpatrils strike force had garnered he plucked the data disk boss watts spun to him delicately out of the air and intoned note please i do not accept these charges i will however undertake to review them fully at the earliest possible moment a lot of unsmiling faces greeted this pronouncement quaddie body language was a study in its own right talking with ones hands was fraught with so many more possibilities here greenlaws hands were very controlled both uppers and lowers venn clenched his lower fists a lot but then venn had helped carry out his burned comrades after the fire the conference drew to an end without achieving anything resembling closure which miles counted as a small victory for his side he was getting away without committing himself or gregor to anything much so far he didnt yet see how to twist this unpromising tangle his way he needed more data subliminals people some handle or lever he hadnt spotted yet i need to talk to bel that wish at least looked to be granted at greenlaws word the meeting broke up and the honor guard escorted the barrayarans back through the corridors to the bay where the kestrel waited chapter four at the kestrel s lock boss watts took bel aside for a lowvoiced conversation with some anxious hand waving bel shook its head made calm down gestures and finally turned to follow miles ekaterin and roic through the flex tube and into the kestrel s tiny and now crowded personnel hatch deck roic stumbled and looked a trifle dizzied readjusting to the grav field but then found his balance again he frowned warily at the betan hermaphrodite in the quaddie uniform ekaterin flashed a covertly curious glance what was that all about miles asked bel as the airlock door slid shut watts wanted me to take a bodyguard or three to protect me from the brutal barrayarans i told him there wouldnt be room aboard and besides you were a diplomatnot a soldier bel head cocked gave him an indecipherable look is that so it is now uh miles turned to lieutenant smolyani manning the hatch controls lieutenant were going to take the kestrel around to the other side of graf station to another docking cradle their traffic control will direct you go as slowly as you can without looking odd take two or three tries to align with the docking clamps or something my lord said smolyani indignantly impsec fast courier pilots made a religion out of fast tight maneuvering and swift perfect dockings in front of these people well do it however you wish but buy me some time i need to talk with this herm go go he waved smolyani out he drew breath and added to roic and ekaterin well take over the wardroom excuse us please thus consigning her and roic to their cramped cabins to wait he gripped ekaterins hand in brief apology he dared not say more until hed decanted bel in private there were security angles political angles personal angleshow many angles could dance on the head of a pinand as the first thrill of seeing that familiar face alive and well wore off the nagging memory that the last time theyd met the purpose had been to strip bel of command and discharge it from the mercenary fleet for its unfortunate role in the bloody jacksons whole debacle he wanted to trust bel dare he roic was too well trained to ask are you sure you dont want me to come with you mlord out loud but from the expression on his face he was doing his best to send it telepathically ill explain it all later miles promised roic in an undervoice and sent him on his way with what he hoped was a reassuring halfsalute he led bel the few steps to the tiny chamber that doubled as the kestrel s wardroom dining room and briefing room shut both its doors and activated the security cone a faint hum from the projector on the ceiling and a shimmer in the air surrounding the wardrooms circular diningvid conference table assured him it was working he turned to find bel watching him head a little to one side eyes quizzical lips quirked he hesitated a moment then simultaneously they both burst into laughter they fell on each other in a hug bel pounded him on the back saying in a tight voice damn damn damn you sawedoff little halfbreed maniac miles fell back breathless bel by god you look good older surely that too but i dont think im the one to talk you look terrific healthy solid i take it that womans been feeding you right or doing something right anyway not fat though miles said anxiously no no but the last time i saw you right after they thawed you out of cryofreeze you looked like a skull on a stick you had us all worried bel remembered that last meeting with the same clarity as he did evidently more perhaps i worried about you too have you been all right how the devil did you end up here was that a delicate enough inquiry bels brows rose a trifle reading whoknewwhat expression on miless face i suppose i was a little disoriented at first after i parted company with the dendarii mercenaries between oser and you as commanders id served there almost twentyfive years i was sorry as hell about it id say not half as sorry as i was but you were the one who did the dying bel looked away briefly among other people it wasnt as if either of us had a choice at that point i couldnt have gone on andin the long runit was a good thing id got in a rut without knowing it i think i needed something to kick me out of it i was ready for a change well not ready but miles hanging on bels words was reminded of their place sit sit he gestured to the little table they took seats next to each other miles rested his arm on the dark surface and leaned closer to listen bel continued i even went home for a little while but i found that a quarter of a century kicking around the nexus as a free herm had put me out of step with beta colony i took a few spacer jobs some at the suggestion of our mutual employer then i drifted in here bel tucked its graybrown bangs up off its forehead with spread fingers a familiar gesture they promptly fell back again even more heartcatching impsecs not my employer any more exactly miles said oh so what are they exactly miles hesitated over this one my intelligence utility he chose at last by virtue of my new job bels eyebrows went up farther this time this imperial auditor thing isnt a cover for the latest covert ops scam then no its the real thing im done with scam bels lips twitched what with that funny accent this is my real voice the betan accent i affected for admiral naismith was the puton sort of not that i didnt learn it at my mothers knee when watts told me the name of the supposedlyhotshot envoy the barrayarans were sending out i thought it had to be you thats why i made sure to get myself onto the welcoming committee but this emperors voice thing sounded like something out of a fairy tale to me until i got to the fine print then it sounded like something out of a really gruesome fairy tale oh did you look up my job description yeah its pretty amazing whats in the historical databases here quaddiespace is fully plugged in to the galactic information exchange ive found theyre almost as good as beta despite having only a fraction of the population imperial auditors a pretty stunning promotionwhoever handed you that much unsupervised power on a platter has to be almost as much of a lunatic as you are i want to hear your explanation of that yes it can take some explaining to nonbarrayarans miles took a breath you know that cryorevival of mine was a little dicey do you remember the seizures i was having right after yes said bel cautiously they turned out to be a permanent side effect unfortunately too much for even impsecs version of the military to tolerate in a field officer as i managed to demonstrate in a particularly spectacular manner but thats another story it was a medical discharge officially so that was the end of my galactic covert ops career miless smile twisted i had to get an honest job fortunately emperor gregor gave me one everyone assumes my appointment was high vor nepotism at work for my fathers sake over time i trust ill prove them wrong bel was silent for a moment face set so it seems i killed admiral naismith after all dont hog the blame you had lots of help miles said dryly including mine he was reminded that this slice of privacy was precious and limited its all blood over the dam now anyway for you and me both we have other crises on our plate today quickly from the topive been assigned to straighten out this mess to barrayars if not benefit leastcost if youre our impsec informer hereare you bel nodded after bel had handed in its resignation from the dendarii free mercenaries miles had seen to it that the hermaphrodite had gone on impsecs payroll as a civilian informer in part it was payback for all bel had done for barrayar before the illconceived disaster that had ended bels career directly and miless indirectly but mostly it had been to keep impsec from getting lethally excited about bel wandering the wormhole nexus with a head full of hot barrayaran secrets aging tepid secrets now for the most part miles had figured the illusion that they held bels string would prove reassuring to impsec and so it had apparently proved portmaster eh what a superb job for an intelligence observer data on everyone and everything that passes in and out of graf station at your fingertips did impsec place you here no i found this job on my own sector five was happy though which at the time seemed an added bonus id think they damned well should be happy the quaddies like me too it seems im good at handling all sorts of upset downsiders without losing my equilibrium i dont explain to them that after years of trailing around after you my definition of an emergency is seriously divergent from theirs miles grinned and made calculations in his head then your most recent reports are probably still somewhere in transit between here and sector five headquarters yeah thats what i figure what are the most important things i need to know well for one we really havent seen your lieutenant solian or his body really union security hasnt stinted on the search for him vorpatrilis he any relation to your cousin ivan by the way yes a distant one i thought i sensed a family resemblance in more ways than one anyway he thinks were lying but were not also your people are idiots yes i know but theyre my idiots tell me something new all right heres a good one graf station security has pulled all the passengers and crew off the komarran ships impounded in dock and lodged em in stationside hostels to prevent illconsidered actions and to put pressure on vorpatril and molino naturally theyre none too happy the supercargononkomarrans who just took passage for a few jumpsare wild to get away half a dozen have tried to bribe me to let them take their goods off the idris or the rudra and transfer off graf station on somebody elses ships have any ah succeeded not yet bel smirked although if the price keeps going up at the current rate even i could be tempted anyway several of the most anxious ones struck me as potentially interesting check have you reported this to your graf station employers i made a remark or two but its only suspicion the individuals are all well behaved so farespecially compared to barrayaransits not like we have any pretext for fastpenta interrogations attempting to bribe an official miles suggested i hadnt actually mentioned that last part to watts yet at miless raised eyebrows bel added did you want more legal complications ahno bel snorted didnt think so the herm paused a moment as if marshaling its thoughts anyway back to the idiots your ensign corbeau to wit yes that political asylum request of his has got all my antennae quivering granted he was in some trouble for being late reporting in but why is he suddenly trying to desert what connection does he have to solians disappearance not any as far as ive been able to make out i actually met the fellow before all this blew up oh how and where socially as it happens what is it about you people who run sexually segregated fleets that makes you all disembark insane no dont bother answering that i think we all know but the allmale military organizations who have that custom for religious or cultural reasons all come onto station leave like some horrible combination of kids let out of school and convicts let out of prison the worst of both actuallythe judgment of children combined with the sexual deprivation ofnever mind the quaddies cringe when they see you coming if you didnt spend money with such wild abandon i think the commercial stations in the union would all vote to quarantine you aboard your own ships and let you die of blue balls miles rubbed his forehead lets get back to ensign corbeau shall we bel grinned we hadnt left so this backwoods barrayaran boy on his firstever trip into the glittering galaxy tumbles off his ship and being under instructions as i understand it to enhance his cultural horizons that is actually correct goes off to see the minchenko ballet which is something to behold in any case you should take it in while youre stationside what it isnt just uh exotic dancers not in the advertisingforthesexworkers sense or even in the betan orb ultraclassy sexual smorgasbord and training academy sense miles considered then reconsidered mentioning his and ekaterins honeymoon layover at the orb of unearthly delights possibly the most peculiarly useful stop on their itinerary focus my lord auditor its exotic and its dancers but its real art the real thingit goes way beyond craft a twohundredyearold tradition a jewel of this culture the fool boy ought to have fallen in love at first sight it was his subsequent pursuit with all guns blazingin the metaphorical sense this timethat was a little out of line soldier on leave falls madly in lust with local girl is not precisely a new scenario but what i really dont understand is what garnet five saw in him i mean hes a nice enough looking young male but still bel smiled slyly too tall for my taste not to mention too young garnet five is this quaddie dancer yes yes remarkable enough for a barrayaran to be attracted to a quaddie the deeply ingrained cultural prejudice against anything that smacked of mutation would seem to work against it had corbeau received less than the usual indulgent understanding from his fellows and superiors that a young officer in such a plight might ordinarily expect and your connection with all this iswhat did bel take an apprehensive breath nicol plays harp and hammer dulcimer in the minchenko ballet orchestra you do remember nicol the quaddie musician we rescued during that personnel pickup that almost went down the disposer i remember nicol vividly and so apparently had bel i gather she made it home safely after all yes bels smile grew tenser not surprisingly she also remembers you vividlyadmiral naismith miles went still for a moment at last he said cautiously do ah you know her well can you command or persuade her discretion i live with her said bel briefly no one needs to command anything she is discreet oh much becomes clear but shes a personal friend of garnet fives who is in a tearing panic over all of this shes convinced among other things that the barrayaran command wants to shoot her boyfriend out of hand the pair of thugs that vorpatril sent to pick up your stray evidentlywell it went beyond rude they were insulting and brutal for starters and it slid downhill from there ive heard the unabridged version miles grimaced i know my countrymen you can take the ugly details as read thanks nicol has asked me to do what i can for her friend and her friends friend i promised id put in a word this is it i understand miles sighed i cant make any promises yet except to listen to everyone bel nodded and looked away it said after a moment this imperial auditor gig of yoursyoure a big wheel in the barrayaran machine now huh something like that said miles the emperors voice sounds like it would be pretty loud people listen do they well barrayarans do the rest of the galaxyone side of miless mouth turned uptend to think its some kind of fairy tale bel shrugged apologetically impsec is barrayarans so the thing is ive come to like this placegraf station quaddiespace and these people i like them a lot i believe youll see why if i get much chance to show you around im thinking of settling here permanently thats nice said miles where are you taking me bel but if i do take an oath of citizenship hereand ive been thinking hard about it for a whilei want to take it honestly i cant offer them a false oath or divided loyalties your betan citizenship never interfered with your career in the dendarii mercenaries miles pointed out you never asked me to operate on beta colony said bel and if i had i would have faced a dilemma bels hand stretched in urgent entreaty i want a clean start with no secret strings attached you claim impsec is your personal utility now milescan you please fire me again miles sat back and chewed on his knuckle cut you loose from impsec you mean yes from all old obligations he blew out his breath but youre so valuable to us here i dont know dont know if you have the power or dont know if you want to use it miles temporized this power business has proved a lot stranger than i anticipated youd think more power would bring one more freedom but ive found its brought me less every word that comes out of my mouth has this weight that it never had before when i was babbling mad miles hustler of the dendarii i never had to watch my mass like this its damned uncomfortable sometimes id have thought youd love it id have thought that too bel leaned back easing off it would not make the request again not soon anyway miles drummed his fingers on the cool reflective surface of the table if there is anything more behind this mess than overexcitement and bad judgmentnot that that isnt enoughit hinges on the evaporation of that komarran fleet security fellow solian miles wrist com chimed and he raised it to his lips yes mlord came roics apologetic voice were in dock again now right thanks well be out directly he rose from the table saying you must meet ekaterin properly before we go back out there and have to play dumb again she and roic have full barrayaran security clearances by the waythey have to to live this close to me they both need to know who you are and that they can trust you bel hesitated do they really need to know im impsec here they might in an emergency i would particularly like the quaddies not to know ive been selling intelligence to downsiders you see maybe it would be safer if you and i were mere acquaintances miles stared but bel she knows perfectly well who you are or were anyway what have you been telling covert ops war stories to your wife clearly disconcerted bel frowned those rules always applied to someone else didnt they her clearance was earned not just granted miles said a little stiffly but bel we sent you a wedding invitation or did you get it impsec notified me it was delivered oh said bel looking confused that yes i did get it was it delivered too late it should have included a travel voucherif someone pocketed that ill have his hide no the voucher came through all right about a year and a half ago yes i could have made it if id scrambled a bit it just arrived at an awkward period for me kind of a low point id just left beta for the last time and i was in the middle of a little job i was doing for impsec arranging a substitute would have been difficult it was just effort at a time when more effort i wished you well though and hoped youd finally got lucky a wry grin flashed again finding the right lady vorkosigan was a bigger rarer kind of luck than any id had before miles sighed elli quinn didnt come either though she sent a present and a letter neither especially demure hm said bel smiling a little and added rather slyly and sergeant taura she attended miless lips curled up unwilled spectacularly i had a burst of genius and put my aunt alys in charge of getting her dressed civilianstyle it kept them both happily occupied the old dendarii contingent all missed you elena and baz were therewith their new baby girl if you can imagine itand arde mayhew too so the very beginning of it all was fully represented it was as well that the wedding was small a hundred and twenty people is small yes it was ekaterins second you seeshe was a widow and profoundly stressed thereby her tense distraught state the night before the wedding had reminded miles forcibly of a particular species of precombat nerves hed seen in troops facing not their first but their second battle the night after the wedding nowthat had gone much better thank god longing and regret had shadowed bels face during this recitation of old friends lifting a glass to new beginnings then the herms expression sharpened baz jesek back on barrayar said bel someone must have worked out his little problems with the barrayaran military authorities eh and if someone could arrange bazs relationship with impsec maybe that same someone might arrange bels bel didnt even need to make the point out loud miles said the old desertion charges made too good a cover when baz was active in ops to allow them to be rescinded but the need had become obsolete baz and elena are both out of the dendarii too now hadnt you heard were all getting to be history all of us who made it out alive anyway yes sighed bel there is a deal of sanity to be saved in letting the past go and moving on the herm glanced up if the past will let you go too that is so lets keep this as simple as possible with your people please all right miles agreed reluctantly for now well mention the past but not the present dont worrytheyll be ahdiscreet he deactivated the security cone above the little conference table and unlocked the doors raising his wrist com to his lips he murmured ekaterin roic could you step over to the wardroom please when they had both arrived ekaterin smiling expectantly miles said weve had a piece of undeserved good fortune although portmaster thorne works for the quaddies now the herms an old friend of mine from an organization i worked with in my impsec days you can rely on what bel has to say ekaterin held out her hand im so glad to meet you at last captain thorne my husband and his old friends have spoken highly of you i believe you were much missed from their company looking decidedly bemused but rising to the challenge bel shook her hand thank you lady vorkosigan but i dont go by that old rank here portmaster thorne or just call me bel ekaterin nodded and please call me ekaterin ohin private i suppose she looked a silent inquiry at miles ah right said miles his gesture took in roic who looked attentive bel knew me under another identity then as far as graf station is concerned weve just met but weve hit it off splendidly and bels talent for dealing with difficult downsiders is paying off for them roic nodded got it mlord miles shepherded them into the hatch bay where the kestrel s engineer waited to pipe them back aboard graf station he reflected that yet another reason ekaterins security clearance needed to be as high as his own was that according to several persons historical reports and her own witness he talked in his sleep until bel grew less nervy over the situation he decided hed probably better not mention this two quaddie station security men waited for them in the freight loading bay this being the section of graf station supplied with artificially generated gravitational fields for the comfort and health of its downsider visitors and residents the pair hovered in personal float chairs with station security markings emblazoned on the sides the floaters were stubby cylinders barely larger in diameter than a mans shoulders and the general effect was of people riding in levitating washtubs or maybe the baba yagas magic flying mortar from barrayaran folklore bel gave the quaddie sergeant a nod and a murmured greeting as they emerged into the echoing cavern of the loading bay the sergeant returned the nod evidently reassured and turned his close attention to the dangerous barrayarans since the dangerous barrayarans were frankly gawking like tourists miles hoped the toughlooking fellow would soon grow less twitchy this personnel lock here bel pointed back to the one by which theyd just entered was the one that was opened by the unauthorized person the blood trail ended in it in a smeary smudge it started bel walked across the bay toward the wall to the right a few meters away not far from the door to the next bay this is where the large pool of blood was found miles walked after bel studying the deck it had been cleaned up in the several days since the incident did you see this yourself portmaster thorne yes about an hour after it was first found the mob had arrived by then but security had been pretty good about keeping the area uncontaminated miles had bel walk him around the bay detailing all exits it was a standard sort of place utilitarian undecorated efficient a few pieces of freighthandling equipment stood silently in the opposite end near a darkened airsealed control booth miles had bel unlock it and give him a look inside ekaterin too walked about clearly glad to have room to stretch her legs after several days cooped up in the kestrel her expression gazing about the cool echoing space was thoughtfully reminiscent and miles smiled in appreciation they returned to the spot where the blood implied lieutenant solians throat had been cut and discussed the details of the spatter marks and smears roic observed with keen professional interest miles had one of the quaddie guards give up his float tub scooped out of his shell he sat up on the deck on his haunches and lower arms looking a bit like a large disgruntled frog quaddie locomotion in a gravity field without a floater was rather disturbing to watch they either went on all fours only slightly more mobile than a person on hands and knees or managed a sort of forwardleaning elbowsout upright chickenwalk on their lower hands either mode looked very wrong and ungainly compared to their grace and agility in zero gee with bel whom miles judged to be about the right size for a komarran cooperatively playing the part of the corpse they experimented with the problem of a person in a float chair shifting seventy or so kilos of inert meat the several meters to the airlock bel wasnt as slim and athletic as formerly either the added ah masses made it harder for miles to fall back into his old subconscious default habit of thinking of bel as male probably just as well miles found it extremely difficult legs folded awkwardly in a seat not designed for them trying to keep one hand on the float chair controls at roughly crotch level and also maintain a grip on bels clothing bel tried trailing either an arm or a leg artistically over the side miles stopped short of pouring water down bels sleeve to try to duplicate the smears ekaterin did little better than he did and roic surprisingly worse his superior strength was counteracted by the awkwardness of squeezing his greater size into the cuplike space his knees sticking up and trying to work the hand controls in the constricted clearances the quaddie sergeant managed it handily but glowered at miles afterwards floaters bel explained were not hard to come by being considered shared public property although quaddies who spent a lot of time on the grav side sometimes owned their own personalized models the quaddies kept racks of floaters by the access ports between the grav and the free fall sections of the station for any quaddie to grab and use and drop off again upon returning they were numbered for maintenance record purposes but not tracked otherwise anyone could obtain one by simply walking up and getting in apparently even drunken barrayaran soldiers on leave when we came into that first docking cradle around on the other side i noticed a lot of personal craft puttering around the outside of the stationpushers personnel pods insystem flitters miles said to bel it occurs to me that someone could have picked up solians body within a short time of its being ejected from the airlock and removed it damned near tracelessly it could be anywhere by now including still stored in a pod airlock or put through a disposer in onekilo lumps or tucked away to mummify in some random asteroid crevice which offers an alternate explanation of why it hasnt been found floating out there but that scenario requires either two persons with prior planning or one spontaneous murderer who moved very quickly how much time would a single person have had between the throatcutting and the pickup bel straightening uniform and hair after the last drag across the loading bay pursed its lips there were maybe five or ten minutes between the time the lock cycled and the time the security guard arrived to check it maybe twenty minutes max after that before all sorts of people were looking around outside in thirty minutes yes one person could just about have dumped the body run to another bay and jumped in a small craft zipped around and collected it again good get me a list of everything that went out a lock in that period for the sake of the listening quaddie guards he remembered to add a formal if you please portmaster thorne certainly lord auditor vorkosigan seems damned odd to go to all that trouble to remove the body but leave the blood though timing tried to get back to clean up but it was too late something very very strange to hide about the body maybe just blind panic if the murder had not been planned in advance miles could imagine someone who was not a spacer shoving a body out an airlock and only then realizing what poor concealment it really was that didnt exactly jibe with a subsequent swift and handy outside pickup though and no quaddie qualified as notaspacer he sighed this is not getting us much forwarder lets go talk to my idiots chapter five graf station security post three lay on the border between the free fall and the grav sides of the station with access to both construction quaddies in yellow shirts and shorts and a few legged downsiders similarly dressed were at work on repairs around the main gravside entrance miles ekaterin and roic were escorted through by bel and one of their quaddie outriders the other having been left on dour guard at the kestrel s docking hatch the workers turned their heads to stare frowning as the barrayarans passed they wound via a couple of corridors down one level where they found the control booth at the portal to the gravside detention block a quaddie and a downsider were just collaborating on raising a new possibly more plasmafireresistant window into place in its frame beyond another yellowclad quaddie could be seen putting the finishing touches on a monitor array while a uniformed quaddie in a security floater upper arms crossed watched glumly in the toolcluttered staging area in front of the booth they found sealer greenlaw and chief venn now supplied with floaters awaiting them venn immediately made sure to point out to miles all the repairs completed and still in progress in detail with approximate costs with a chronicle appended of all the quaddies who had been injured in the imbroglio including names ranks prognoses and the distress suffered by their family members miles made acknowledging yet neutral noises and went into a short counterriff on the missing solian and the sinister testimony of the blood on the loading bay deck with a brief dissertation on the logistics of his ejected body being spirited away by a possible outboard coconspirator this last gave venn pause at least temporarily his face twinged like a man in stomach pain while venn went to arrange miless entry to the cellblock with the guard in the control booth miles glanced at ekaterin and a little doubtfully around the lessthaninviting staging area do you want to wait here or sit in do you want me to sit in she asked with a lack of enthusiasm in her voice that even miles could sense not that you dont draft anyone in sight as needed but surely im not needed for this well perhaps not but it looks like it might be a trifle boring out here i dont have quite your allergic response to boredom love but to tell the truth i was rather hoping i could get more of a look around the station while you were tied up here this afternoon the glimpses we saw on the way in seemed quite enticing but i want roic he hesitated the security triage problem turning in his head she glanced across in friendly speculation at bel listening i admit i would be glad for a guide but do you really think i need a bodyguard here insult seemed possible though only from quaddies who knew whose wife she was but assault miles had to admit seemed unlikely no but bel smiled cordially back at her if you would accept my escort lady vorkosigan i would be pleased to show you around graf station while the lord auditor conducts his interviews ekaterin brightened still further i would like that very much yes thank you portmaster thorne if things go well as we must hope they do we might not be here very long i feel i should seize my opportunities bel was more experienced than roic in everything from handtohand combat to fleet maneuvers and vastly less likely to blunder into trouble here through ignorance well all right why not enjoy miles touched his wrist com ill call when im about finished maybe you can go shopping he waved them off smiling just dont haul home any severed heads he glanced up to find venn and greenlaw both staring at him in some dismay ahfamily joke he explained weakly the dismay did not abate ekaterin smiled back and sailed out on bels cheerfully proffered arm it occurred to miles belatedly that bel was notably universal in its sexual tastes and that maybe he ought to have warned ekaterin that she neednt be especially delicate in redirecting bels attentions should any be offered but surely bel wouldnt on the other hand maybe theyd just take turns trying things on reluctantly he turned back to business the barrayaran prisoners were stacked three to a cell in chambers meant for two occupants a circumstance about which venn half complained half apologized security post three he gave miles to understand had been unprepared for such an abnormal influx of recalcitrant downsiders miles murmured comprehension if not necessarily sympathy and refrained from observing that the quaddies cells were larger than the sleeping cabins housing four aboard the prince xav miles began by interviewing bruns squad commander the man was shocked to find his exploits receiving the highpowered attention of an actual imperial auditor and as a result defaulted to a thick milspeak in his account of events the picture miles unpacked behind such formal phrases as penetrated the perimeter and enemy forces amassed still made him wince but allowing for the changed point of view his testimony did not materially contradict the stationer version of the events alas miles spotchecked the squad commanders story with another cell full of fellows who added details unfortunate but not surprising as the squad had been attached to the prince xav none of them were personally acquainted with lieutenant solian posted on the idris miles emerged and tested an argument on the hovering sealer greenlaw it is quite improper for you to continue holding these men the orders they were following though perhaps ill thought out were not in fact illegal in barrayaran military definition if their orders had been to plunder rape or massacre civilian quaddies they would have been under a legal military obligation to resist them but in fact they were specifically ordered not to kill if they had disobeyed brun they could have faced courtmartial its double jeopardy and seriously unfair to them i will consider this contention said greenlaw dryly with the for about ten seconds after which i shall toss it out the nearest airlock hanging unspoken and looking ahead added miles you cant wish to be stuck housing these men indefinitely surely it would be preferable for us to take them he just managed to convert off your hands to with us when we leave greenlaw looked even dryer venn grunted disconsolately miles gathered venn would be just as glad for the imperial auditor to take them away now except for the politics of the larger situation miles didnt push the point but stored it up for nearfuture reference he entertained a brief wistful fantasy of trading brun for his men and leaving brun here to the net benefit of the emperors service but did not air it aloud his interview with the two service security men whod initially been sent to pick up corbeau was in its way even more winceworthy they were sufficiently intimidated by his auditors rank to give full and honest if muttered accounts of the contretemps but such infelicitous phraseology as i wasnt trying to break her arm i was trying to bounce the mutie bitch off the wall and all those clutching hands gave me the creepsit was like having snakes wrapping around my boot convinced miles that here were two men he wouldnt care to have testify in public at least not in public in quaddiespace however he was able to establish the significant point that at the time of the clash they too had been under the impression that lieutenant solian had just been murdered by an unknown quaddie he emerged from this interrogation to say to venn i think id better speak privately to ensign corbeau can you find us a space corbeau already has his own cell venn informed him coolly as a result of his being threatened by his comrades ah take me to him then if you please the cell door slid aside to reveal a tall young man sitting silently on a bunk elbows on knees his face propped in his hands the metallic contact circles of a jump pilots neural implant gleamed at his temples and midforehead and miles mentally tripled the young officers recent training costs to the imperium he looked up and frowned in confusion at miles he was a typical enough barrayaran dark haired brown eyed with an olive complexion made pale by his months in space his regular features reminded miles a bit of his cousin ivan at the same feckless age an extensive bruise around one eye was fading turning yellowish green his uniform shirt was open at the throat sleeves rolled up some paling irregular pink scars zigzagged over his exposed skin marking him as a victim of the sergyaran worm plague of some years back he had evidently grown up or at least been resident on barrayars new colony planet during that difficult period before the oral vermicides had been perfected venn said ensign corbeau this is the barrayaran imperial auditor lord vorkosigan your emperor sent him out as the official diplomatic envoy to represent your side in negotiations with the union he wishes to interview you corbeaus lips parted in alarm and he scrambled to his feet and bobbed his head nervously at miles it made their height differential rather spring to the eye and corbeaus brow wrinkled in increased confusion venn added not so much kindly as punctiliously due to the charges lodged against you as well as your petition for asylum still pending for review sealer greenlaw will not permit him to remove you from our custody at this time corbeau exhaled a little but still stared at miles with the expression of a man introduced to a poisonous snake venn added a sardonic edge in his voice he has undertaken not to order you to shoot yourself either thank you chief venn said miles ill take it from here if you dont mind venn took the hint and his leave roic took up his silent guard stance by the cell door which hissed closed miles gestured at the bunk sit down ensign he seated himself on the bunk across from the young man and cocked his head in brief study as corbeau refolded himself stop hyperventilating he added corbeau gulped and managed a wary my lord miles laced his fingers together sergyaran are you corbeau glanced down at his arms and made an abortive move to roll down his sleeves not born there my lord my parents emigrated when i was about five years old he glanced at the silent roic in his brownandsilver uniform and added are you then swallowed whatever hed been about to say miles could fill in the blank im viceroy and vicereine vorkosigans son yes one of them corbeau managed an unvoiced oh his look of suppressed terror did not diminish i have just interviewed the two fleet patrollers sent to retrieve you from your station leave in a moment id like to hear your version of that event but firstdid you know lieutenant solian the komarran fleet security officer aboard the idris the pilots thoughts were so clearly focused on his own affairs that it took him a moment to parse this i met him once or twice at some of our prior stops my lord i cant say as i knew him i never went aboard the idris do you have any thoughts or theories about his disappearance not not really captain brun thinks he might have deserted corbeau grimaced brun would why brun especially corbeaus lips moved halted he looked still more miserable it would not be appropriate for me to criticize my superiors my lord or to comment on their personal opinions brun is prejudiced against komarrans i didnt say that that was my observation ensign oh well lets leave that for the moment back to your troubles why didnt you answer your wrist com recall order corbeau touched his bare left wrist the barrayarans com links had all been confiscated by their quaddie captors id taken it off and left it in another room i must have slept through the beep the first i knew of the recall order was when those two two he struggled for a moment then continued bitterly thugs came pounding at garnet fives door they just pushed her aside did they identify themselves properly and relay your orders clearly corbeau paused his glance at miles sharpening i admit my lord he said slowly sergeant touchev announcing all right mutielover this shows over did not exactly convey admiral vorpatril has ordered all barrayaran personnel back to their ships to my mind not right away anyway id just woken up you see did they identify themselves notnot verbally show any id well they were in uniform with their patrol armbands did you recognize them as fleet security or did you think this was a private visita couple of comrades taking out their racial offense on their own time it um wellthe two arent exactly mutually exclusive my lord in my experience the kid has that one straight unfortunately miles took a breath ah i was slow still half asleep when they shoved me around garnet five thought they were attacking me i wish she hadnt tried to i didnt slug touchev till he dumped her out of her float chair at that point everything sort of went down the disposer corbeau glowered at his feet encased in prisonissue friction slippers miles sat back throw this boy a line hes drowning he said mildly you know your career is not necessarily cooked yet you arent technically awol as long as you are involuntarily confined by the graf station authorities any more than bruns strike patrol here is for a little while yet youre in a legal limbo your jump pilots training and surgery would make you a costly loss from commands viewpoint if you make the right moves you could still get out of this pretty cleanly corbeaus face screwed up i dont he trailed off miles made an encouraging noise corbeau burst out i dont want my damned career any more i dont want to be part ofhe waved around inarticulatelythis this idiocy suppressing a certain sympathy miles asked whats your present statushow far along are you in your enlistment i signed up for one of the new fiveyear hitches with the option to reenlist or go to reserve status for the next five ive been in three years two still to go at age twentythree miles reminded himself two years still seemed a long time corbeau could be barely more than an apprentice junior pilot at this stage of his career although his assignment to the prince xav implied a superior rating corbeau shook his head i see things differently these days somehow attitudes i used to take for granted jokes remarks just the way things are donethey bother me now they grate people like sergeant touchev captain brungod were we always this awful no said miles we used to be much worse i can personally testify to that one corbeau stared searchingly at him but if all the progressiveminded men had opted out then as you are proposing to do now none of the changes ive seen in my lifetime could have happened weve changed we can change some more not instantly no but if all the decent folks quit and only the idiots are left to run the show it wont be good for the future of barrayar about which i do care it startled him to realize how passionately true that statement had become of late he thought of the two replicators in that guarded room in vorkosigan house i always thought my parents could fix anything now its my turn dear god how did this happen i never imagined a place like this corbeaus jerky wave around miles construed now meant quaddiespace i never imagined a woman like garnet five i want to stay here miles had a bad sense of a desperate young man making permanent decisions for the sake of temporary stimuli graf station was attractive at first glance certainly but corbeau had grown up in open country with real gravity real airwould he adapt or would the technoclaustrophobia creep up on him and the young woman for whom he proposed to throw his life over was she worthy or would corbeau prove a passing amusement to her or over time a bad mistake hell theyd known each other bare weeksno one could know least of all corbeau and garnet five i want out said corbeau i cant stand it any more miles tried again if you withdraw your request for political asylum in the union before the quaddies reject it it might still be folded into your present legal ambiguity and made to disappear without further prejudice to your career if you dont withdraw it first the desertion charge will certainly stick and do you vast damage corbeau looked up and said anxiously doesnt this firefight that bruns patrol had with the quaddie security here make it in the heat the prince xav s surgeon said it probably did in the heat desertion in the face of the enemy was punishable by death in the barrayaran military code desertion in peacetime was punishable by long stretches of time in some extremely unpleasant stockades either seemed excessively wasteful all things considered i think it would require some pretty convoluted legal twisting to call this episode a battle for one thing defining it so runs directly counter to the emperors stated desire to maintain peaceful relations with this important trade depot still given a sufficiently hostile court and hamhanded defense counsel i shouldnt call courtmartial a wise risk if it can possibly be avoided miles rubbed his lips were you drunk by chance when sergeant touchev came to pick you up no hm pity drunk is a wonderfully safe defense not politically or socially radical ysee i dont suppose corbeaus mouth tightened in indignation suggesting corbeau lie about his chemical state would not go over well miles sensed which gave him a higher opinion of the young officer true but it didnt make miless life any easier i still want out corbeau repeated stubbornly the quaddies dont much like barrayarans this week im afraid relying on them granting your asylum to pluck you out of your dilemma seems to me to be a grave mistake there must be half a dozen better ways to solve your problems if youd open your mind to wider tactical possibilities in fact almost any other way would be better than this corbeau shook his head mute well think about it ensign i suspect the situation will remain murky until i find out what happened to lieutenant solian at that point i hope to unravel this tangle quickly and the chance to change your mind about really bad ideas could run out abruptly he climbed wearily to his feet corbeau after a moment of uncertainty rose and saluted miles returned an acknowledging nod and motioned to roic who spoke into the cells intercom and obtained their release he exited frowning thoughtfully to encounter the hovering chief venn i want solian dammit miles said grouchily to him this remarkable evaporation of his doesnt reflect any better on the competence of your security than it does on ours yknow venn glowered at him but he didnt contradict this remark miles sighed and raised his wrist com to his lips to call ekaterin she insisted on having him rendezvous with her back at the kestrel miles was just as glad for the excuse to escape the depressing atmosphere of security post three he couldnt call it moral ambiguity alas worse he couldnt call it legal ambiguity it was quite clear which side was in the right it just wasnt his side dammit he found her in their little cabin just hanging his brownandsilver house uniform out on a hook she turned and embraced him and he tilted his head back for a long luxurious kiss so how did your venture into quaddiespace with bel go he inquired when he had breath to spare again very well i thought if bel ever wants a change from being a portmaster i believe it could go into union public relations i think i saw all the best parts of graf station that could be squeezed into the time we had splendid views good food historybel took me deep down into the free fall sector to see the preserved parts of the old jumpship that first brought the quaddies to this system they have it set up as a museumwhen we arrived it was full of quaddie schoolchildren bouncing off the walls literally they were incredibly cute it almost reminded me of a barrayaran ancestorshrine she released him and indicated a large box decorated with shiny colorful pictures and schematics occupying half the lower bunk i found this for nikki in the museum shop its a scale model of the d superjumper modified with the orbital habitat configured on that the quaddies forebears escaped in oh hell like that nikki at eleven had not yet outgrown a passion for spaceships of every kind but especially jumpships it was still too early to guess whether the enthusiasm would turn into an adult avocation or fall by the wayside but it certainly hadnt flagged yet miles peered more closely at the picture the ancient d had been an amazingly ungainly looking beast of a ship appearing in this artists rendition rather like an enormous metallic squid clutching a collection of cans largescale replica i take it she glanced rather doubtfully at it not especially it was a huge ship i wonder if i should have chosen the smaller version but it didnt come apart like this one now that i have it back here im not quite sure where to put it ekaterin in maternal mode was quite capable of sharing her bunk with the thing all the way home for nikkis sake lieutenant smolyani will be happy to find a place to stow it really you have my personal guarantee he favored her with a halfbow hand over his heart he wondered briefly if he ought to snag a couple more for little aral alexander and helen natalia while they were here but the conversation with ekaterin about ageappropriate toys several times repeated during their sojourn on earth probably did not need another rehearsal what did you and bel find to talk about she smirked you mostly belated panic came out as nothing more selfincriminating than a brightly inquiring oh bel was wildly curious as to how wed met and obviously racking its brains to figure out how to ask without being rude i took pity and told a little about meeting you on komarr and after with all the classified parts left out our courtship sounds awfully odd do you know he acknowledged this with a rueful shrug ive noticed cant be helped is it really true that the first time you met you shot bel with a stunner the curiosity hadnt all run one way evidently well yes its a long story from a long time ago her blue eyes crinkled with amusement so i understand you were an absolute lunatic when you were younger by all accounts im not sure if id met you back then whether id have been impressed or horrified miles thought it over im not sure either her lips curled up again and she stepped around him to lift a garment bag from the bunk she drew from it a heavy fall of fabric in a bluegray hue matching her eyes it resolved itself into a jumpsuit of some swinging velvety stuff gathered to long buttoned cuffs at the wrists and ankles which gave the trouser legs a subtly sleevelike look she held it up to herself thats new he said approvingly yes i can be both fashionable in gravity and demure in free fall she laid the garment back down and stroked its silky nap i take it bel blocked any unpleasantness due to your being barrayaran when you two were out and about she straightened well i didnt have any problems bel was accosted by one oddlooking fellowhe had the longest narrowest hands and feet something funny about his chest too rather oversized i wondered if he was genetically engineered for anything special or if it was some sort of surgical modification i suppose one meets all kinds out here on the edge of the nexus he badgered bel to tell how soon the passengers were to be let back aboard and said there was a rumor someone had been allowed to take off their cargo but bel assured himfirmlythat no one had been let on the ships since they were impounded one of the passengers from the rudra worrying about his goods i gather he implied the seized cargoes were subject to rifling and theft by the quaddie dockhands which didnt go over too well with bel i can imagine then he wanted to know what you were doing and how the barrayarans were going to respond naturally bel didnt say who i was bel said if he wanted to know what barrayarans were doing hed do better to ask one directly and to get in line to make an appointment with you through sealer greenlaw like everyone else the fellow wasnt too happy but bel threatened to have him escorted back to his hostel by station security and confined there if he didnt give over pestering so he shut up and went scurrying to find greenlaw good for bel he sighed and hitched his tight shoulders i suppose id better deal with greenlaw again next no you shouldnt ekaterin said firmly youve done nothing but talk with committees of upset people since the first thing this morning the answer i expect is no the question is did you ever stop to eat lunch or take any sort of break um well no how did you guess she merely smiled then the next item on your schedule my lord auditor is a nice dinner with your wife and your old friends bel and nicol are taking us out and after that were going to the quaddie ballet we are yes why i mean i have to eat sometime i suppose but my wandering off in the middle of the case to um disport myself wont thrill anyone whos waiting on me to solve this mess starting with admiral vorpatril and his staff i daresay it will thrill the quaddies theyre vastly proud of the minchenko ballet and being seen to show an interest in their culture can do you nothing but good with them the troupe only performs once or twice a week depending on the passenger traffic in port and the seasondo they have seasons here time of year anywayso we might not get another chance her smile grew sly it was a soldout show but bel had garnet five pull strings and get us a box shell be joining us there miles blinked she wants to pitch her case to me about corbeau does she thats what id guess at his dubiously wrinkled nose she added i found out more about her today shes a famous person on graf station a local celebrity the barrayaran patrols assault on her was news because shes a performing artist breaking her arm like that has put her out of work for a time as well as being an awful thing in its own rightit was extra culturally offensive in quaddie eyes oh terrific miles rubbed the bridge of his nose it wasnt just his imagination he did have a headache yes so the sight of garnet five at the ballet chatting cordially with the barrayaran envoy all forgiven and amicable is worth what to you in propaganda points ah ha he hesitated as long as she doesnt end up flouncing out of my presence in a public rage because i cant promise her anything yet about corbeau tricky situation that one and the boys not being as smart as he could about it shes apparently a person of strong emotions but not stupid or so i gather from bel i dont think bel would have coaxed me to let it arrange this in order to engineer a public disaster but perhaps you have reason to think otherwise no anyway im sure youll be able to handle garnet five just be your usual charming self ekaterins vision of him he reminded himself was not exactly objective thank god ive been trying to charm quaddies all day with no noticeable success if you make it plain you like people its hard for them to resist liking you back and nicol will be playing in the orchestra tonight oh he perked up that will be worth hearing ekaterin was shrewdly observant he had no doubt she had spent the afternoon picking up cultural vibrations that went well beyond local fashions the quaddie ballet it was will you wear your fancy new outfit thats why i bought it we honor the artists by dressing up for them now skin back into your house uniform bel will be along to collect us soon id better stick to my dull grays i have a feeling that parading barrayaran uniforms in front of the quaddies just now is a bad idea diplomatically speaking in security post three probably but theres no point in being seen enjoying their art if we just look like any other anonymous downsiders tonight i think we should both look as barrayaran as possible his being seen with ekaterin was good for a few points too he rather fancied although not so much propaganda as pure swaggering oneupsmanship he tapped his trouser seam where no sword hung right chapter six bel arrived promptly at the kestrel s hatch having changed from its staid work uniform into a startling but cheerful orange doublet with glinting stardecorated blue sleeves slashed trousers bloused into cuffs at the knee and colorcoordinated midnightblue hose and friction boots variations of the style seemed to be the local high fashion for both males and females whether with or without legs judging by greenlaws less blinding outfit the herm conducted them to a hushed and serene restaurant on the grav side of the station with the usual transparent windowwall overlooking station and starscape an occasional tug or pod zipped silently past outside adding interest to the scene despite the gravitation which at least kept food on open plates the place bowed to quaddie architectural ideals by having tables set on their own private pillars at varying heights using all three dimensions of the room servers flitted back and forth and up and down in floaters the design pleased everyone but roic who cranked his neck around in dismay watching for trouble in d but bel ever thoughtful as well as trained in security protocols had provided roic with his own perch above theirs with an overview of the whole room roic mounted to his eyrie looking more reconciled nicol was waiting for them at their table which commanded a superior view out the windowwall her garments ran to formfitting black knits and filmy rainbow scarves otherwise her appearance was not much changed from when miles had first met her so many years and wormhole jumps ago she was still slim graceful of movement even in her floater with pure ivory skin and shortclipped ebony hair and her eyes still danced she and ekaterin regarded each other with great interest and fell at once into conversation with very little prompting from bel or miles the talk ranged widely as exquisite food appeared in a smooth stream presented by the places welltrained and unobtrusive staff music gardening and station biorecycling techniques led to discussion of quaddie population dynamics and the methodstechnical economic and politicalfor seeding new habitats in the growing necklace along the asteroid belt only old war stories by a silent mutual agreement failed to trickle into the conversational flow when bel guided ekaterin off to the lavatory between the last course and dessert nicol watched her out of earshot then leaned over and murmured to miles i am glad for you admiral naismith he touched a finger briefly to his lips be glad for miles vorkosigan i certainly am he hesitated then asked should i be equally glad for bel her smile crimped a little only bel knows im done with traveling the nexus ive found my place home at last bel seems happy here too most of the time butwell bel is a downsider they get itchy feet im told bel talks about making a commitment to the union yet somehow never gets around to applying im sure bels interested in doing so miles offered she shrugged and drained the last of her lemon drink anticipating her performance later she had forgone the wine maybe the secret of happiness is to live for today to never look ahead or maybe thats just a habit of mind bel got into in its former life all that risk all that dangerit takes a certain sort to thrive on it im not sure bel can change its nature or how much it would hurt to try maybe too much mm said miles i cant offer them a false oath or divided loyalties bel had said even nicol apparently was not aware of bels second source of incomeand hazard i do note bel could have found a portmasters berth in quite a few places it traveled a very long way to get one here instead nicols smile softened thats so she added do you know when bel arrived at graf station it still had that betan dollar id paid you on jacksons whole tucked in its wallet miles managed to stop the logical query are you sure it was the same one on his lips before it fell out of his mouth leaving room for his downsider foot one betan dollar looked like any other if bel had claimed it for the same one when making nicols reacquaintance who was miles to suggest otherwise not that much of a spoilsport for damn sure after dinner they made their way under bel and nicols guidance to the bubblecar system its arteries of transit recently retrofitted into the threedimensional maze graf station had grown to be nicol left her floater in a common rack on the passenger platform it took their car about ten minutes to wend through the branching tubes to their destination miless stomach lifted when they crossed into the free fall side and he made haste to slip his antinausea meds from his pocket swallow one and offer them discreetly to ekaterin and roic the entrance to the madame minchenko memorial auditorium was neither large nor imposing being just one of several accessible airseal doorways on different levels of the station here nicol kissed bel and flitted off no crowds yet clogged the cylindrical corridors as theyd come early to give nicol time to make her way backstage and change miles was therefore unprepared for the vast chamber into which they floated it was an enormous sphere nearly a third of its interior surface was a round transparent windowwall the universe itself turned into backdrop thick with bright stars on this shaded side of the station ekaterin grabbed his hand rather abruptly and roic made a small choked noise miles had the sense of having swum inside a giant beehive for the rest of the wall was lined with hexagonal cells like a silveredged honeycomb filled with rainbow jewels as they floated out toward the middle the cells resolved into velvetlined boxes for the audience varying in size from cozy niches for one patron to units spacious enough for parties of ten if the ten were quaddies not trailing long useless legs other sectors interspersed seemed to be dark flat panels of various shapes or to contain other exits he tried at first to impose a sense of up and down upon the space but then he blinked and the chamber seemed to rotate around the window and then he wasnt sure if he was looking up down or sideways through it down was a particularly disturbing mental construction as it gave the dizzy impression of falling into a vast well of stars a quaddie usher wearing an airjet belt took them in tow after they had gawked their fill and steered them gently wallward to their assigned hexagon it was lined with some dark soft soundbaffling padding and convenient handgrips and included its own lighting the colored jewels seen from afar a dark shape and a gleam of motion in their generously sized box resolved itself as they approached as a quaddie woman she was slim and longlimbed with fine whiteblond hair cut finger length and waving in an aureole around her head it made miles think of mermaids of legend cheekbones to inspire men to duel with each other or perhaps scribble bad poetry or drown in drink or worse desert their brigade she was clothed in closefitting black velvet with a little white lace ruff at her throat the cuff on the lower right elbow of her softly pleated black velvet pants sleeve miles decided not leg had been left unfastened to make room for a medical airfilled arm immobilizer of a sort painfully familiar to miles from his fragileboned youth it was the only stiff ungraceful thing about her a crude insult to the rest of the ensemble no mistaking her for anyone other than garnet five but he waited for bel to introduce them all properly which bel promptly did they shook hands all around miles found her grip athletefirm thank you for obtaining these seats did not apply this space for us on such short notice miles said releasing her slim upper hand i understand we are to be privileged to view some very fine work work was a word with extra resonance in quaddiespace he had already gathered like honor on barrayar my pleasure lord vorkosigan her voice was melodious her expression seemed cool almost ironic but an underlying anxiety glowed in her leafgreen eyes miles opened his hand to indicate her broken lower right arm may i convey my personal apologies for the poor behavior of some of our men they will be disciplined for it when we get them back please do not judge all barrayarans by our worst examples well she cant we actually dont ship out our worst gregor be praised she smiled briefly i do not for ive also met your best the urgency in her eyes tinged her voice dmitriwhat will happen to him well that depends to a great extent on dmitri pitches miles suddenly realized could run two ways here it could range when he is released and returns to duty from a minor black mark on his recordhe wasnt supposed to remove his wrist com while on station leave you know for just the sort of reason you unfortunately discoveredto a very serious charge of attempted desertion if he fails to withdraw his request for political asylum before it is denied her jaw set a trifle perhaps it wont be denied even if granted the longterm consequences could be more complex than you perhaps anticipate he would at that point be plainly guilty of desertion he would be permanently exiled from his home never able to return or see his family barrayar might seem a world well lost now in the first flush of emotion but i thinkim sureits something he could come to deeply regret later he thought of melancholy baz jesek exiled for years over an even more badly managed conflict there are other if less speedy ways ensign corbeau might yet end up back here if his desire to do so is true will and not temporary whim it would take a little more time but be infinitely less damaginghes playing for the rest of his life with this after all she frowned wont the barrayaran military have him shot or horribly butchered oror assassinated we are not at war with the union yet anyway it would take more heroic blundering than this to make that happen but he ought not to underestimate his fellow barrayarans he supposed and he didnt think corbeau was politically important enough to assassinate so lets try to make sure he doesnt become so eh he wouldnt be executed but twenty years in jail is hardly better from your point of view you dont serve him or yourself by encouraging him to this desertion let him return to duty serve out his hitch get passage back if youre both still of the same mind then continue your relationship without his unresolved legal status poisoning your future together her expression had grown still more grimly stubborn he felt horribly like some stodgy parent lecturing his angstridden teenager but she was no child hed have to ask bel her age her grace and authority of motion might be the results of her dancers training he remembered that they were supposed to be looking cordial so tried to soften his words with a belated smile she said we wish to become partners permanently after only two weeks of acquaintance are you so sure he strangled this comment in his throat as ekaterins sideways glance at him put him in mind of just how many daysor was it hoursit had taken him to fall in love with her granted the permanently part had taken longer i can certainly see why corbeau would wish that the reverse was more puzzling of course in both cases he himself did not find corbeau lovablehis strongest emotion so far was a deep desire to whack the ensign on the side of the headbut this woman clearly didnt see him that way permanently said ekaterin doubtfully but dont you think you might wish to have children someday or might he garnet fives expression grew hopeful weve talked about having children together were both interested um er said miles quaddies are not interfertile with downsiders surely well one has to make choices before they go into the replicators just as a herm crossing with a monosexual has to choose whether to have the genetics adjusted to produce a boy or a girl or a herm some quaddiedownsider partnerships have quaddie children some have downsiders some have some of eachbel show lord vorkosigan your baby pictures miless head swiveled around what bel blushed and dug in its trouser pocket nicol and i when we went to the geneticist for counseling they ran a projection of all the possible combinations to help us choose the herm held up a holocube and turned it on six fulllength still shots of children sprang into being above its hand they were all frozen in their early teens with the sense of adult features just starting to emerge from childhoods roundness they had bels eyes nicols jawline hair a brownish black with that familiar swipe of a forelock a boy a girl and a herm with legs a boy a girl and a herm quaddie oh said ekaterin reaching for it how interesting the facial features are just an electronic blend of nicols and mine not a genuine genetic projection bel explained willingly giving the cube to her for that theyd need an actual cell from a real conceptus which of course they cant have till a real one is made for the genetic modifications ekaterin turned the array back and forth examining the portraits from all angles miles looking over her shoulder told himself firmly that it was probably just as well that his holovid of the blandly blastular aral alexander and helen natalia was still in his luggage back aboard the kestrel but maybe later he would have a chance to show bel have you two finally decided what you want asked garnet five a little quaddie girl to start like nicol bels face softened then abruptly recovered its habitual ironic smile assuming i take the plunge and apply for my union citizenship miles imagined garnet five and dmitri corbeau with a string of handsome athletic quaddie children or bel and nicol with a clutch of smart musical ones it made his head spin roic looking quietly boggled shook his head at ekaterins profferment of a closer examination of the holoarray ah said bel the shows about to start the herm retrieved the holocube and switched it off and plunged it back safely deep in the pocket of its baggy blue knee breeches carefully fastening the flap the auditorium had filled to capacity while they spoke the honeycomb of cells now harboring an attentive crowd including a fair smattering of other downsiders though whether union citizen or galactic visitor miles could not always tell no green barrayaran uniforms tonight in any case the lights dimmed the hubbub quieted and a few last quaddies sped across to their boxes and settled in a couple of downsiders who had misjudged their momentum and were stranded in the middle were rescued by the ushers and towed to their box earning a quiet snicker from the quaddies who noticed an electric tension filled the air the odd blend of hope and fear that any live performance bore with its risk of imperfection chance of greatness the lights dimmed further till only the bluewhite starshine glinted off the chambers array of nowcrowded cells lights flared an exuberant fountain of red and orange and gold and from all sides the performers flowed in thundered in quaddie males athletic and vastly enthusiastic in skinfitting ship knits made splendid with glitter drumming i wasnt expecting hand drums other free fall performances miles had seen whether dance or gymnastic had been eerily silent except for the music and sound effects quaddies made their own noise and still had hands left to play handsacross the drummers met in the middle clasped gripped exchanged momentum turned and doubled back in a shifting pattern two dozen men in free fall took up perfect station in the center of the spherical auditorium their motion so controlled as to permit no sideways drift as the energy of their spins and duckings twistings and turnings flowed through their bodies one to another and on around again the air pulsed with the rhythm of their drumming drums of all sizes round oblong twoheaded not only played by each holder but some batted back and forth among them in an eyeandearstunning cross between music and juggling never missing a beat or a blow the lights danced reflections spattered on the walls picking out flashes from the boxes of upraised hands arms bright cloth jewelry entranced faces then from another entrance a dozen female quaddies all in blues and greens geysered up into the growing geodesic pattern and joined the dance all miles could think was whoever first brought castanets to quaddiespace has much to answer for they added a laughing descant note to the percussive braid of sound hand drums and castanets no other instruments none needed the round chamber reverberated fairly rocked he stole a glance sideways ekaterins lips were parted her eyes wide and shining drinking in all this booming splendor without reserve miles considered barrayaran marching bands it wasnt enough that humans did something so difficult as learning to play a musical instrument then they had to do it in groups while walking around in complicated patterns and then they competed with one another to do it even better excellence this kind of excellence could never have any sane economic justification it had to be done for the honor of ones country or ones people or the glory of god for the joy of being human the piece ran for twenty minutes until the players were gasping and sweat spun off them in tiny drops to speed in sparking streaks into the darkness and still they whirled and thundered miles had to stop himself from hyperventilating in sympathy heartbeat synchronized with their rhythms then one last grand blast of joyous noiseand somehow the shifting net of fourarmed men and women resolved itself into two chains which flowed away into the exits from which they had emerged a revelation ago darkness again the silence was like a blow behind him miles heard roic exhale reverently longingly like a man home from war easing himself into his own bed for the first time the applausehandclapping of courserocked the room no one in the barrayaran party miles thought had to pretend enthusiasm for quaddie culture now the chamber hushed again as the orchestra emerged from four points and filtered into positions all around the great window the halfahundred quaddies bore a more standard array of instrumentsall acoustic ekaterin observed to him in a fascinated whisper they spotted nicol assisted by two more quaddies who helped manage and secure her harp which was nearly the usual shape for a harp and her doublesided hammer dulcimer appearing to be a dull oblong box from this angle but the piece that followed included a solo section for her with the dulcimer her ivory face picked out in spotlights and the music that poured forth between her four flashing hands was anything but dull radiantly ethereal heartbreaking electrifying bel must have seen this dozens of times miles guessed but the herm was surely as entranced as any newcomer it wasnt just a lovers smile that illuminated bels eyes yes you would not be loving her properly if you did not also love her improvident lavish spendthrift excellence no jealous lover greedy and selfish could hoard it all it had to be poured forth upon the world or burst its wellspring he glanced at ekaterin and thought of her glorious gardens much missed back on barrayar i shall not keep you away from them much longer love i promise there was a brief pause while quaddie stagehands arranged a few mysterious poles and bars sticking in at odd angles around the interior of the sphere garnet five floating sideways with respect to miles murmured over her shoulder coming up is the piece i usually dance its an excerpt from a larger work aljeans classic ballet the crossing which tells the story of our peoples migration through the nexus to quaddiespace its the love duet between leo and silver i dance silver i hope my understudy doesnt muck it up she trailed off as the overture swelled two figures a downsider male and a blond quaddie woman floated in from opposite sides of the space picked up momentum with handspins around a couple of the poles and met in the middle no drums this time just sweet liquid sound from the orchestra the leo characters legs trailed uselessly and it took miles a moment to realize that he was being played by a quaddie dancer with dummy legs the womans use of angular momentum drawing in or extending various arms as she twirled or spun was brilliantly controlled her changes of trajectory around the various poles precise only a few indrawn breaths and critical mutters from garnet five suggested anything less than perfection to miless perceptions the falselegged fellow was deliberately clumsy earning a chuckle from the quaddie audience miles shifted uncomfortably realizing he was watching a nearparody of how downsiders looked to quaddie eyes but the womans charming gestures of assistance made it seem more endearing than cruel bel grinning leaned over to murmur in miless ear its all right leo grafs supposed to dance like an engineer he was the love angle of it all was clear enough affairs between quaddies and downsiders apparently had a long and honorable history it occurred to miles that certain aspects of his youth might have been rendered much easier if barrayar had possessed a repertoire of romantic tales starring short crippled heroes instead of mutie villains if this was a fair sample it was clear that garnet five was culturally primed to play juliet to her barrayaran romeo but lets not enact a tragedy this time eh the enchanting piece drew to a climax and the two dancers saluted the enthusiastically clapping audience before making their way out the lights came up break time performance art was fundamentally constrained miles realized by biology in this case the capacity of the human bladder whether downsider or quaddie when they all rendezvoused again in their box he found garnet five explaining quaddie naming conventions to ekaterin no its not a surname said garnet five when quaddies were first made by the galactech corporation there were only one thousand of us each had just one given name plus a numerical designation and with so few each name was unique when our ancestors fled to their freedom they altered what the numbers coded but kept the system of single unique names tracked in a register with all of old earths languages to draw on it was several generations before the system really began to be strained the waiting lists for the really popular names were insanely long so they voted to allow duplication but only if the name had a numerical suffix so we could always tell every leo from every other leo when you die your namenumber goes back in the registry to be drawn again i have a leo ninetynine in my docks and locks crew said bel its the highest number ive run across yet lower numbers or none seem to be preferred ive never run across any of the other garnets said garnet five there were eight altogether somewhere in the union last time i looked it up ill bet there will be more said bel and itll be your fault garnet five laughed i can wish the second half of the show was as impressive as the first during one of the musical interludes nicol had an exquisite harp part there were two more large group dances one abstract and mathematical the other narrative apparently based on a tragic pressurization disaster of a prior generation the finale put everyone out in the middle for a last vigorous dizzying whirl with drummers castanet players and orchestra combining in musical support that could only be described as massive it felt to miles as though the performance ended all too soon but his chrono told him four hours had passed in this dream he bade a grateful but noncommittal farewell to garnet five as bel and nicol escorted the three barrayarans back to the kestrel in the bubble car he reflected on how cultures told their stories to themselves and so defined themselves above all the ballet celebrated the quaddie body surely no downsider could walk out of the quaddie ballet still imagining the fourarmed people as mutated crippled or otherwise disadvantaged or inferior one might evenas corbeau had demonstratedwalk out having freefallen in love not that all crippling damage was visible to the eye all this exuberant athleticism reminded him to check his brain chemical levels before bed and see how soon his next seizure was likely to be chapter seven miles woke from a sound sleep to tapping on his cabin door mlord came roics hushed voice admiral vorpatril wants to talk with you hes on the secured comconsole in the wardroom whatever inspiration his backbrain might have floated up to his consciousness in the drowsy interlude between sleep and waking flitted away beyond recall miles groaned and swung out of his bunk ekaterins hand extended from the top bunk and she peeked over blearily at him he touched it and whispered go back to sleep love she snuffled agreeably and rolled over miles ran his hands through his hair grabbed his gray jacket shrugged it on over his underwear and padded out barefoot into the corridor as the airseal door hissed closed behind him he checked his chrono since quaddiespace didnt have to deal with inconvenient planetary rotations they kept a single time zone throughout local space to which miles and ekaterin had supposedly adjusted on the trip in all right so it wasnt the middle of the night it was early morning miles sat at the wardroom table straightened his jacket and fastened it to the neck and touched the control on his station chair admiral vorpatrils face and torso appeared over the vid plate he was awake dressed shaved and had a coffee cup at his right hand the ratbastard vorpatril shook his head lips tight how the hell did you know he demanded miles squinted i beg your pardon i just got back the report on solians blood sample from my chief surgeon it was manufactured probably within twentyfour hours of its being spilled on the deck oh hell and damnation thats unfortunate but what does it mean is the man still alive somewhere id have sworn he wasnt a deserter but maybe brun was right like the stopped clock even idiots could be correct sometimes ill have to think about this it doesnt actually prove if solians alive or dead either way it doesnt even necessarily prove that he wasnt killed there just not by getting his throat cut armsman roic god bless and keep him forever set a cup of steaming coffee down by miless elbow and withdrew to his station by the door miles cleared his mouth if not his mind with the first sluicing swallow and took a second sip to buy a moment to think vorpatril had a head start on both coffee and calculation should we report this to chief venn or not miles made a dubious noise in his throat his one diplomatic edge the only thing that had given him so to speak a leg to stand on here had been the possibility that solian had been murdered by an unknown quaddie this was now rendered even more problematic it seemed the blood had to have been manufactured somewhere if you have the right equipment its easy and if you dont its impossible find all such equipment on stationor aboard ships in dockand the place it was done has to be one of em the place plus the time should lead to the people process of elimination its the sort of footwork miles hesitated but went on that the local police are better equipped to carry out than we are if they can be trusted trust the quaddies hardly what motivation do they have to lie or misdirect us what indeed i have to work through greenlaw and venn i have no authority on graf station in my own right well there was bel but he had to use bel sparingly or risk the herms cover he wanted the truth ruefully he recognized that he also would prefer to have a monopoly on it at least until he had time to figure out how best to play for barrayars interests yet if the truth doesnt serve us what does that say about us eh he rubbed his stubbled chin it does clearly prove that whatever happened in that freight bay whether murder or coverup was carefully planned and not spontaneous ill undertake to speak with greenlaw and venn about it talking to the quaddies is my job now anyway for my sins presumably what god did i piss off this time thank you admiral and thank your fleet surgeon from me for a good job vorpatril gave a grudgingly pleased nod at this acknowledgment and miles cut the com dammit he muttered querulously frowning into the blank space why didnt anyone pick up this information on the first pass its not my job to be a bloody forensic pathologist i expect began armsman roic and stopped uh was that a question mlord miles swung around in his station chair a rhetorical one but do you have an answer well mlord said roic diffidently its about the size of things here graf station is a pretty big space habitat but its really a kind of a small city by barrayaran standards and all these spacer types tend to be pretty lawabiding in certain ways all those safety rules i dont imagine they get many murders here how many did you used to get in hassadar graf station boasted fifty thousand or so residents the vorkosigans district capitals population was approaching half a million these days maybe one or two a month on average they didnt come in smoothly seems thered be a run of em then a quiet period more in the summer than the winter except around winterfair got a lot of multiples then most of em werent mysteries of course but even in hassadar there werent enough really odd ones to keep our forensics folks in practice ysee our medical people were parttimers from the district university mostly on call if we ever got anything really strange wed call in one of lord vorbohns homicide investigators from vorbarr sultana they must get a murder every day or so up thereall sorts lots of experience ill bet chief venn doesnt even have a forensics department just some quaddie doctors he taps once in a while so i wouldnt expect them to be um up to impsec standards like what youre used to mlord thats an interesting point armsman thank you miles took another swallow of his coffee solian he said thoughtfully i dont know enough about solian yet did he have enemies damn it didnt the man have even one friend or a lover if he was killed was it for personal or for professional reasons it makes a huge difference miles had glanced through solians military record on the inbound leg and found it unexceptionable if the man had ever been to quaddiespace before it wasnt since hed joined the imperial service six years previously hed had two prior voyages with different fleet consortiums and different military escorts his experiences had apparently included nothing more exciting than handling an occasional inebriated crewman or belligerent passenger on average more than half the military personnel on any tour of nexus escort duty would be new to each other if solian had made friendsor enemiesin the weeks since this fleet had departed komarr they almost had to have been on the idris if his disappearance had been closer to the time of the fleets arrival in quaddiespace miles would have pegged the professional possibilities to the idris as well but the ten days in dock was plenty of time for a nosy security man to find trouble stationside too he drained his cup and punched up chief venns number on the stationchair console the quaddie security commander had also arrived early to work apparently his personal office was evidently on the free fall side of things he appeared floating sideways to miles in the vid view a coffee bulb clutched in his upper right hand he murmured a polite good morning lord auditor vorkosigan but undercut the verbal courtesy by not righting himself with respect to miles who had to exert a conscious effort to keep from tilting out of his chair what can i do for you several things but first a question when was the last murder on graf station venns brows twitched there was one about seven years ago and ah before that three years before i believe a veritable crime wave did you have charge of those investigations well they were before my timei became security chief for graf station about five years back but there wasnt that much to investigate both suspects were downsider transientsone killed another downsider the other murdered a quaddie hed got into some stupid dispute over a payment with guilt confirmed by witnesses and fastpenta interrogation its almost always downsiders in these affairs i notice have you ever investigated a mysterious killing before venn righted himself apparently in order to frown more effectively at miles i and my people are fully trained in the appropriate procedures i assure you im afraid i must reserve judgment on that point chief venn i have some rather curious news i had the barrayaran fleet surgeon reexamine solians blood sample it appears that the blood in question was artificially produced presumably using an initial specimen or template of solians real blood or tissue you may wish to have your forensics peoplewhoever they areretest your own archived evidence from the freight bay and confirm this venns frown deepened then he was a deserternot murdered after all no wonder we couldnt find a body you runyou hurry ahead i believe i grant you the scenario has grown extremely murky my request then is that you locate all possible facilities on graf station where such a tissue synthesis could be carried out and see if there is any record of such a batch being run off and who for or if it could have been slipped through off the record for that matter i think we can safely assume that whoever had it done solian or some unknown was keenly interested in concealment the surgeon reports the blood likely was generated not much more than a day before it was spilled but the inquiry had better be run back to the time the idris first docked to be sure i follow your logic certainly venn held his coffee bulb to his mouth and squeezed then transferred it absently to his lower left hand yes certainly he echoed himself more faintly ill see to it myself miles felt satisfied that hed rocked venn offbalance to just the right degree to embarrass him into effective action yet not freeze him into defensiveness thank you venn added i believe sealer greenlaw wished to speak with you this morning also lord vorkosigan very well you may transfer my call to her if you please greenlaw was a morning person it appeared or else had drunk her coffee earlier she appeared in the holovid dressed in a different elaborate doublet stern and fully awake perhaps more by diplomatic habit than any desire to please she twitched herself around rightsideup to miles good morning lord auditor vorkosigan in response to their petitions i have arranged you an appointment with the komarran fleets stranded passengers at tenhundred you may meet with them to answer their questions at the larger of the two hostels where they are presently housed portmaster thorne will meet you at your ship and conduct you there miless head jerked back at this cavalier arrangement of his time and attention not to mention blatant pressure move on the other hand this delivered him a room full of suspects just the people he wished to study he split the difference between irritation and eagerness by remarking blandly nice of you to let me know just what is it that you imagine i will be able to tell them that i must leave to you these people came in with you barrayarans they are your responsibility madam if that were so they would all be on their way already there can be no responsibility without power it is the union authorities who have placed them under this house arrest and therefore the union authorities who must free them when you finish settling the fines costs and charges your people have incurred here we will be only too happy to do so miles smiled thinly and laced his hands together on the tabletop he wished the only new card he had to play this morning were less ambiguous nevertheless he repeated to her the news about solians manufactured blood sample welllarded with complaint about quaddie security not having determined this peculiar fact earlier she bounced it back instantly as venn had as evidence more supporting of desertion than murder fine said miles then have union security produce the man a foreign downsider wandering about in quaddiespace cant be that hard for a competent police force to locate assuming theyre actually trying quaddiespace she sniffed back is not a totalitarian polity as your lieutenant solian may perhaps have observed our guarantees of freedom of movement and personal privacy could well have been what attracted him to separate himself here from his former comrades so why hasnt he asked for asylum like ensign corbeau no i greatly fear what we have here is not a missing man but a missing corpse the dead cannot cry out for justice it is a duty of the living to do so for them and that is a responsibility of mine for mine madam they closed the conversation on that note miles could only hope hed made her morning as aggravating as shed made his he cut the com and rubbed the back of his neck gah that ties me down for the rest of the day ill bet he glanced up at roic whose guard stance by the door had segued into at ease his shoulders propped against the wall roic roic quickly drew himself upright my lord have you ever conducted a criminal investigation well i was just a street guard mostly but i got to go along and help the senior officers on a few fraud and assault cases and one kidnapping we got her back alive several missing persons oh and about a dozen murders though like i said they werent hardly mysteries and the series of arsons that time that right miles waved a hand to stem this gentle tide of reminiscence i want you to do the detail work for me on solian first the timetable i want you to find out every documented thing the man did his watch reports where he was what he ate when he sleptand who with if anyoneminute by minute or as nearly as you can come to it from the time of his disappearance right on back as far as you can take it especially any movements off the ship and missing time and then i want the personal slanttalk to the crew and captain of the idris try to find out anything you can about the fellow i take it i dont need to give you the lecture on the difference between fact conjecture and hearsay no mlord but vorpatril and brun will give you full cooperation and access i promise you or if they dont let me know miles smiled a bit grimly its not that mlord wholl run your personal security on graf station if im off poking around admiral vorpatrils fleet miles managed to swallow his airy i wont need a bodyguard upon the reflection that by his own pet theory a desperate murderer might be floating around possibly literally on the station ill have captain thorne with me roic looked dubious i cant approve mlord hesitsnot even barrayaran what do you really know about um the portmaster lots miles assured him well i used to anyway he placed his hands on the table and pushed to his feet solian roic find me solian or his trail of breadcrumbs or something ill try mlord back in what he was starting to think of as their cabinet miles encountered ekaterin returning from the shower dressed again in her red tunic and leggings they maneuvered for a kiss and he said ive acquired an involuntary appointment i have to go stationside almost immediately you will remember to put on pants he glanced down at his bare legs planned to yeah her eyes danced you looked abstracted i thought it would be safer to ask he grinned i wonder how strangely i could behave before the quaddies would say anything judging by some of the stories my uncle vorthys tells me of the imperial auditors of past generations a lot stranger than that no im afraid it would only be our loyal barrayarans whod have to bite their tongues he captured her hand and rubbed it enticingly want to come along with me doing what she asked with commendable suspicion telling the trade fleets galactic passengers i cant do a damned thing for them theyre stuck till greenlaw shifts thank you very much have a pleasant day that sounds really unrewarding that would be my best guess a countess is by law and tradition something of an assistant count an auditors wife however is not an assistant auditor she said in a firm tone reminiscent to miless ear of her auntprofessora vorthys was herself an auditors spouse of some experience nicol and garnet five made arrangements to take me out this morning and show me quaddie horticulture if you dont mind i think ill stick to my original plan she softened this sensible refusal with another kiss a flash of guilt made him grimace graf station is not exactly what we had in mind for a honeymoon diversion im afraid oh im having a good time youre the one who has to deal with all the difficult people she made a face and he was reminded again of her tendency to default to extreme reserve when painfully overwhelmed he did fancy that it happened less often these days her growing confidence and ease with the role of lady vorkosigan had been his secret delight to watch develop this past year and a half maybe if youre free by lunch we can rendezvous and you can vent at me she added rather in the tone of one offering a trade of hostages but not if i have to remind you to chew and swallow only the carpet this won a snicker a goodbye kiss as he headed off to the shower eased his heart in advance he reflected that while he might feel lucky that shed agreed to come with him to quaddiespace everyone on graf station from vorpatril and greenlaw on down was much luckier the crews of all four komarran ships now locked into their docking cradles had been herded into one hostel and held there under close arrest the quaddie authorities had feigned not to charge the passengers an odd lot of galactic businesspeople who with their goods had joined the convoy for various segments of its route as the most economical transport going their way but of course they could not be left aboard unmanned vessels and so perforce had been removed to two other more luxurious hostels in theory the erstwhile passengers were made free of the station with no more onerous requirement than to sign in and out with a couple of quaddie security guardsarmed with stunners only miles noted in passingwatching the hostel doors it wasnt even that the passengers couldnt legally leave quaddiespaceexcept that the cargoes most had been shepherding were still impounded aboard their respective ships and so they were held on the principle of the monkey with its hand trapped in the jar of nuts unwilling to let go of what they could not withdraw the luxury of the hostel translated into another quaddie punishment since the mandatory stay was being charged to the komarran fleet corporation the hostels lobby was fauxgrandiose to miless eye with a high domed ceiling simulating a morning sky with drifting clouds that probably cycled through sunrise sunset and night with the daycycle miles wondered which planets constellations were displayed or if they could be varied to flatter the transients du jour the large open space was circled by a secondstory balcony given over to a lounge restaurant and bar where patrons could meet greet and eat in the center an array of drumshaped fluted marble pillars waisthigh supported a long doublecurved sheet of thick glass that in turn held a large and complex live floral display where did they grow such flowers on graf station was ekaterin viewing the source of them even now in addition to the usual lift tubes a wide curving staircase led from the lobby down to the conference level bel guided miles down it to a more utilitarian meeting room in the level below they found the chamber crammed with about eighty irate individuals of what seemed every race dress planetary origin and gender in the nexus galactic traders with a keenly honed sense of the value of their time and no barrayaran cultural inhibitions about imperial auditors they unleashed several days of accumulated frustrations upon miles the moment he stepped to the front and turned to face them fourteen languages were handled by nineteen different brands of autotranslators several of which miles decided must have been purchased at closeout prices from makers going deservedly bellyup not that his answers to their barrage of questions were any special tax on the translatorswhat seemed ninety percent of them came up either i dont know yet or ask sealer greenlaw the fourth iteration of this latter litany was finally met with a heartrending wail in chorus from the back of the room of but greenlaw said to ask you except for the translation device that came up a beat later with lawn rule seahunter inquiring altitude unit miles did get bel to quietly point out to him the men who had attempted to bribe the portmaster into releasing their wares then he asked all passengers from the idris who had ever met lieutenant solian to stay and debrief their experiences to him this actually seemed to foster some illusion of authority doing something and the rest shuffled out merely grumbling an exception was an individual miless eye placed after an uncertain pause as a betan hermaphrodite tall for a herm the age suggested by its silver hair and eyebrows was belied by its firm posture and fluid movements if a barrayaran miles would have pegged the individual as a healthy and athletic sixtywhich probably meant it had achieved its betan century a long sarong in a dark conservative print a highnecked shirt and longsleeved jacket against what a betan would doubtless interpret as the station chill and fine leather sandals completed an expensivelooking ensemble in the betan style the handsome features were aquiline the eyes dark liquid and sharply observant such extraordinary elegance seemed something miles should remember but he could not bring his dim sense of familiarity into focus damn cryofreezehe couldnt guess if it was a true memory smudged as too many had been by the neural traumas of the revival process or a false one even more distorted portmaster thorne said the herm in a soft alto yes bel too unsurprisingly studied a fellowbetan with special interest despite the herms dignified age its beauty drew admiration and miles was amused to note bels glance go to the customary betan earring hanging in its left lobe disappointingly it was of the style that coded romantically attached not looking im afraid i have a special problem with my cargo bels expression returned to bland preparing no doubt to hear yet another woeful story with or without bribes i am a passenger on the idris im transporting several hundred genetically engineered animal fetuses in uterine replicators which require periodic servicing the servicing is due again i really cannot put it off much longer if they are not cared for my creatures may be damaged or even die one longfingered hand pulled on the other nervously worse they are nearing term i really didnt expect such a long delay in my travels if i am held here very much longer they will have to be decanted or destroyed and i will lose all the value of my cargo and of my time what kind of animals miles asked curiously the tall herm glanced down at him sheep and goats mostly some other specialty items mm i suppose you could threaten to turn them loose on the station and force the quaddies to deal with em several hundred customcolored baby lambs running around the loading bays this earned an extremely dry look from portmaster thorne and miles continued smoothly but i trust it wont come to that ill submit your petition to boss watts said bel your name honorable herm ker dubauer bel bowed slightly wait here ill return shortly as bel moved off to make a vid call in private dubauer smiling faintly murmured thank you so much for assisting me lord vorkosigan no trouble brow wrinkling miles added have we ever met no my lord hm oh well when you were aboard the idris did you encounter lieutenant solian the poor young male everyone thought had deserted but now it seems not i saw him going about his duties i never spoke with him at any length to my regret miles considered imparting his news about the synthetic blood then decided to hold that close for a little while there might yet prove some better cleverer thing to do with it than unleash it with the rest of the rumors some half dozen other passengers from the idris had shuffled forward during this conversation waiting to volunteer their own experiences of the missing lieutenant the brief interviews were of dubious value a bold murderer would surely lie but a smart one might simply not come forward at all three of the passengers were wary and curt but dutifully precise the others were eager and full of theories to share none consonant with the blood on the docking bay deck being a plant miles wistfully considered the charms of a wholesale fastpenta interview of every passenger and crew person aboard the idris another task venn or vorpatril or both together should have done already dammit alas the quaddies had tedious rules about such invasive methods these transients on graf station were offlimits to the more abrupt barrayaran interrogation techniques and the barrayaran military personnel with whose minds miles might make free were much farther down his current list of suspects the komarran civilian crew was a more ambiguous case barrayaran subjects now on quaddiewell not soiland under quaddie custody while this was going forth bel returned to dubauer waiting quietly by the side of the room with its hands folded and murmured i can personally escort you aboard the idris to service your cargo as soon as the lord auditor is finished here miles cut short the last crimetheory enthusiast and sent him on his way im done he announced he glanced at the chrono in his wrist com could he catch up with ekaterin for lunch it seemed doubtful by this hour but on the other hand she could spend unimaginable amounts of time looking at vegetation so maybe there was still a chance the three exited the conference chamber together and mounted the broad stairs to the spacious lobby neither miles nor he supposed bel ever entered a room without running a visual sweep of every possible vantage for aim a legacy of years of unpleasant shared learning experiences thus it was that they spotted simultaneously the figure on the balcony opposite hoisting a strange oblong box onto the railing dubauer followed his glance eyes widening in astonishment miles had a flashing impression of dark eyes in a milky face beneath a mop of brassblond curls staring down intently at him he and bel on either side of dubauer reached spontaneously and together for the startled betans arms and flung themselves forward bright bursts from the box chattered with a loud echoing tapping noise blood spattered from dubauers cheek as the herm was yanked along something like a swarm of angry bees seemed to pass directly over miless head then they were all three sliding on their stomachs to cover behind the wide marble drums holding the flowers the bees seemed to follow them pellets of safety glass exploded in all directions and chips of marble fountained in a wide spray a vast vibrato filled the room shook the air the thunderous thrumming noise sliced with screams and cries miles trying to raise his head for a quick glance was crushed down again by bel diving over the intervening betan and landing on him in a smothering clutch he could only hear the aftermath more yells the sudden cessation of the hammering a heavy clunk a womans voice sobbed and hiccoughed in the startling silence then was choked down to a spasmodic gulping his hand jerked at a soft cool kiss but it was only a few last shredded leaves and flower petals sifting gently down out of the air to settle all around them chapter eight miles said in a muffled voice bel will you please get off my head there was a brief pause then bel rolled away and cautiously sat up head hunched into collar sorry said bel gruffly thought for a moment there i was about to lose you again dont apologize miles his heart still racing and his mouth very dry pushed up and sat his back pressed to a nowshorter marble drum he spread his fingers to touch the cool synthetic stone of the floor a little beyond the narrow irregular arc of space shielded by the table pillars dozens of deep gouges scored the pavement something small and bright and brassy rolled past and miless hand reached for it then sprang back at its branding heat the elderly herm dubauer also sat up hand going to pat its face where blood trickled miless glance took quick inventory no other hits apparently he shifted and drew his vorkosiganmonogrammed handkerchief from his trouser pocket folded it and silently handed it across to the bleeding betan dubauer swallowed took it and mopped at the minor wound it held the pad out a moment to stare at its own blood as if in surprise then pressed the cloth back to its hairless cheek in a way miles thought shakily it was all rather flattering at least someone figured he was competent and effective enough to be dangerous or maybe im onto something i wonder what the hell it is bel placed its hands upon the shattered drum top peered cautiously over then slowly pulled itself to its feet a downsider in the uniform of the hostel staff scurried a little bent over around the excenterpiece and asked in a choked voice are you people all right i think so said bel glancing around what was that it came from the balcony sir the the person up there dropped it over the side and fled the door guard went after him bel didnt bother to correct the gender of the honorific a sure sign of distraction miles rose too and nearly passed out still hyperventilating he crunched around their bulwark through the broken glass pellets marble chips halfmelted brass slugs and flower salad bel followed in his path on the far side of the lobby the oblong box lay on its side notably dented they both knelt to stare automated hot riveter said bel after a moment he must have disconnected quite a few safety devices to make it do that a slight understatement miles felt but it did explain their assailants uncertain aim the device had been designed to throw its slugs with vast precision a matter of millimeters not meters still if the wouldbe assassin had succeeded in framing miless head for even a short bursthe glanced again at the shattered marbleno cryorevival ever invented could have brought him back this time ye godswhat if he hadnt missed what would ekaterin have done this far from home and help a messily decapitated husband on her hands before her honeymoon trip was even over with no immediate support but the inexperienced roicif theyre shooting at me how much danger is she in in belated panic he slapped his wristcom roic roic answer me it was at least three agonizing seconds before roics drawl responded my lord where arenever mind drop whatever youre doing and go at once to lady vorkosigan and stay with her get her back aboard he clipped off the kestrel would she be safer there by now any number of people knew that was where to look for vorkosigans maybe aboard the prince xav standing off a good safe distance from the station surrounded by troopsbarrayars finest god help us all just stay with her till i call again my lord whats happening someone just tried to rivet me to the wall no dont come here he overrode roics beginning protest the fellow ran off and anyway quaddie security is beginning to arrive two uniformed quaddies in floaters were entering the lobby even as he spoke at a hostel employees gesticulations one rose smoothly up over the balcony the other approached miles and his party i have to deal with these people now im all right dont alarm ekaterin dont let her out of your sight out he glanced up to see dubauer unbend from examining a rivetchewed marble drum face very strained the herm hand still pressed to cheek was visibly shaken as it walked over to glance at the riveter miles rose smoothly to his feet my apologies honorable herm i should have warned you never to stand too close to me dubauer stared at miles its lips parted in momentary bewilderment then made a small circle oh i believe you two gentlepersons saved my life i im afraid i didnt see anything until that thingwhat was ithit me miles bent and picked up a loose rivet one of hundreds now cooled one of these have you stopped bleeding the herm pulled the pad away from its cheek yes i think so here keep it for a souvenir he held out the gleaming brass slug trade you for my handkerchief back ekaterin had embroidered it by hand for a present oh dubauer folded the pad over the bloodstain oh dear is it of value ill have it cleaned and return it to you not necessary honorable herm my batman takes care of such things the elderly betan looked distressed oh no miles ended the argument by reaching over and plucking the fine cloth from the clutching fingers and stuffing it back in his pocket the herms hand jerked after it and fell back miles had met diffident people but never before one who apologized for bleeding dubauer unused to personal violence on lowcrime beta colony was on the edge of distraught a quaddie security patrolwoman hovered anxiously in her floater what the hell happened here she demanded snapping open a recorder miles gestured to bel who took over describing the incident into the recorder bel was as calm logical and detailed as at any dendarii debriefing which possibly took the woman more aback than the crowd of witnesses who clustered eagerly around trying to tell the tale in more excited terms to miless intense relief no one else had been hit except for a few minor clips from ricocheting marble chips the fellows aim might have been imperfect but he apparently hadnt intended a general massacre good for public safety on graf station but not upon reflection so good for miles his children might have been orphaned just now before theyd even had a chance to be born his will was spot up to date the size of an academic dissertation complete with bibliography and footnotes it suddenly seemed entirely inadequate to the task was the suspect a downsider or a quaddie the patrolwoman asked bel urgently bel shook its head i couldnt see the lower half of his body below the balcony rail im not even sure it was male really a downsider transient and the quaddie waitress whod been serving his drink on the lounge level chimed in with the news that the assailant had been a quaddie and had fled down an adjoining corridor in his floater the transient was sure hed been male although the waitress now that the question was raised grew less certain dubauer apologized for not having glimpsed the person at all miles prodded the riveter with his toe and asked bel in an undervoice how hard would it be to carry something like that through station security checkpoints easy said bel no one would even blink local manufacture it looked quite new yes thats a sanctuary station brand they make good tools first job for venn then find out where the thing was sold and when and who to oh yeah miles was nearly dizzy with a weird combination of delight and dismay the delight was partly adrenaline high a familiar and dangerous old addiction partly the realization that having been potshotted by a quaddie gave him a stick to beat back greenlaws relentless attack on his barrayaran brutality quaddies were killers too hah they just werent as good at it he remembered solian and took back that thought yeah and if greenlaw didnt set me up for this herself now there was a nice paranoid theory he set it aside to reexamine when his head had cooled after all a couple of hundred people both quaddies and transientsincluding all of the fleets galactic passengersmust have known hed be coming here this morning a quaddie medical squad arrived and on their heelsimmediately after them chief venn the security chief was instantly deluged with excited descriptions of the spectacular attack on the imperial auditor only the erstwhile victim miles was calm standing in wait with a certain grim amusement amusement was an emotion notably lacking in venns face were you hit lord auditor vorkosigan no time to put in a good wordwe may need it later thanks to the quick reactions of portmaster thorne here but for this remarkable herm youand the union of free habitatswould have one hell of a mess on your hands just now a babble of confirmation solidified this view with a couple of people breathlessly describing bels selfless defense of the visiting dignitary with the shield of its own body bels eye glinted briefly at miles though whether with gratitude or its opposite miles was not just sure the portmasters modest protests served only to firmly affix the picture of this heroism in the eyewitnesses minds and miles suppressed a grin one of the quaddie security patrollers who had gone in pursuit of the assailant now returned floating back over the balcony to jerk to a halt before chief venn and report breathlessly lost him sir weve put all duty personnel on alert but we dont have much of a physical description three or four people attempted to supplement this lack in vivid and contradictory terms bel listening frowned more deeply miles nudged the herm hm bel shook its head and murmured back thought for a moment he looked like someone id seen recently but that was a downsider sono miles considered his own brief impression brighthaired lightskinned a trifle bulky of indeterminate age probably malethis could cover some several hundred quaddies on graf station laboring under intense emotion but by that time miles had been too seen once at that distance under such circumstances miles didnt think even he could reliably pick the fellow out of a group of similar physical types unfortunately none of the transients had happened just then to be doing a vid scan of the lobby dcor or each other to show the folks back home the waitress and her patron werent even quite sure when the fellow had arrived though they thought hed been in position for a few minutes upper hands resting casually upon the balcony railing as if waiting for some last straggler from the passengers meeting to mount the stairs and so he was the stillshaken dubauer fended off the medtechs insisting it could treat the clotted rivetgraze itself and reiterating a lack of anything to add to the testimonies begged to be let go back to its room to lie down bel said to its fellow betan sorry about all this i may be tied up for a while if i cant get away myself ill have boss watts send another supervisor to escort you aboard the idris to take care of your critters thank you portmaster that would be very welcome youll call my room yes it really is most urgent dubauer withdrew hastily miles couldnt blame dubauer for fleeing for the quaddie news services were arriving in the persons of two eager reporters in floaters emblazoned with the logo of their journalistic work gang an array of little vidcam floaters bobbed after them the vidcams darted about collecting scans sealer greenlaw followed hurriedly in their wake and wove her floater determinedly through the growing mob to miless side she was flanked by two quaddie bodyguards in union militia garb with serious weapons and armor however useless against assassins they at least had the salutary effect of making the babbling bystanders back off lord auditor vorkosigan were you hurt she demanded at once miles repeated to her the assurances hed made to venn he kept one eye on the robot vidcams floating up to him and recording his words and not just to be sure his good side was turned to them but none appeared to be miniweaponsplatforms in disguise he made sure to loudly mention bels heroics again which had the useful effect of turning them in pursuit of the betan portmaster now on the other side of the lobby being grilled in more detail by venns security people greenlaw said stiffly lord auditor vorkosigan may i convey my profound personal apologies for this untoward incident i assure you all of the unions resources will be turned to tracking down what i am certain must be an unbalanced individual and danger to us all danger to us all indeed i dont know whats going on here said miles he let his voice sharpen and clearly neither do you this is no diplomatic chess game any more someone seems to be trying to start a damned war in here they nearly succeeded she took a deep breath i am certain the person was acting alone miles frowned thoughtfully the hotheads are always with us true he lowered his voice for what retaliation did any of the quaddies injured by vorpatrils strike force suddenly die last night hed thought they all were on the recovering list it was hard to imagine a quaddie relative or lover or friend taking bloody revenge for anything short of a fatality but no said greenlaw her voice slowing as she considered this hypothesis regretfully her voice firmed no i would have been told so greenlaw was wishing for a simple explanation too but honest enough not to fool herself at least his wrist com gave its high priority beep he slapped it yes my lord vorkosigan it was admiral vorpatrils voice strained not ekaterin or roic after all miless heart climbed back down out of his throat he tried not to let his voice go irritable yes admiral oh thank god we received a report that you were attacked all over now they missed station security is here now there was a brief pause vorpatrils voice returned fraught with implication my lord auditor my fleet is on full alert ready at your command oh crap thank you admiral but stand down please miles said hastily really its under control ill get back to you in a few minutes do nothing without my direct personal orders very well my lord said vorpatril stiffly still in a very suspicious tone miles cut the channel greenlaw was staring at him he explained to her im gregors voice to the barrayarans its as if that quaddie had fired on the emperor almost when i said someone had nearly started a war it wasnt a figure of speech sealer greenlaw at home this place would be crawling with impsecs best by now she cocked her head her frown sharpening and how would an attack on an ordinary barrayaran subject be treated more casually i daresay not more casually but on a lower organizational level it would be a matter for their counts district guard so on barrayar what kind of justice you receive depends on who you are interesting i do not regret to inform you lord vorkosigan that on graf station you will be treated like any other victimno better no worse oddly enough this is no loss for you how salutary for me said miles dryly and while youre proving how unimpressed you are with my imperial authority a dangerous killer remains at large what will it be to lovely egalitarian graf station if he goes for a less personal method of disposing of me next time such as a large bomb trust meeven on barrayar we all die the same shall we continue this discussion in private the vidcams evidently finished with bel were zooming back toward him his head swiveled around at a breathless cry of miles also zooming toward him was ekaterin roic lumbering at her shoulder nicol and garnet five followed in floaters pale of face and wide of eye ekaterin strode across the detritus in the lobby gripped his hands and at his crooked smile hugged him fiercely fully conscious of the vidcams avidly circling he hugged her back making sure that no journalists alive no matter how many arms or legs they possessed could resist putting this one up front and center a humaninterest shot yeah roic said apologetically i tried to stop her mlord but she insisted on coming here its all right said miles in a muffled voice ekaterin murmured unhappily in his ear i thought this was a safe place itfelt safe the quaddies seemed like such peaceful people the majority of them undoubtedly are miles said reluctantly he released her though he still kept a firm grip on one hand they stood back and regarded each other anxiously across the lobby nicol flew to bel with much the same look on her face as had been on ekaterins and the vidcams flocked after her miles asked roic quietly how far did you get on solian not far mlord i decided to start with the idris and got all the access codes from brun and molino all right but the quaddies wouldnt permit me to board her i was about to call you miles grinned briefly bet i can fix that now by damn greenlaw returned to invite the barrayarans to step into the hostel managements meeting room hastily cleared as a refuge miles tucked ekaterins hand into his arm and they followed he shook his head regretfully at a reporter who flitted purposefully toward them and one of greenlaws union militia guards made a stern warding motion thwarted the quaddie journalist pounced on garnet five instead with a performers reflex she welcomed him with a blinding smile did you have a nice morning miles asked ekaterin brightly as they picked their way over the mess on the floor she eyed him in some bemusement yes lovely quaddie hydroponics are extraordinary her voice went dry as she glanced around the battle zone and you delightful well not if we hadnt ducked but if i cant figure out how to use this to break our deadlock i should turn in my auditors chain he stifled a foxs smile contemplating greenlaws back the things one learns on a honeymoon now i know how to coax you out of your glum moods just hire someone to shoot at you peps me right up he agreed i figured out years ago that i was addicted to adrenaline i also figured out that it was going to be toxic eventually if i didnt taper off indeed she inhaled the slight trembling in the hand tucked in the crook of his elbow was lessening and its clamp on his biceps was growing less circulationstopping her face was back to being deceptively serene greenlaw led them through the office corridor behind the reception area to a cluttered workroom its small central vid table had been swept clean of ringed cups flaccid drink bulbs and plastic flimsies now piled haphazardly on a credenza shoved to one wall miles saw ekaterin into a station chair and sat next to her greenlaw positioned her floater at chairheight opposite roic and one of the quaddie guards jockeyed for position at the door frowning at each other miles reminded himself to be indignant and not ecstatic well he let a distinct note of sarcasm creep into his voice that was a remarkable addition to my mornings speaking schedule greenlaw began lord auditor you have my apologies your apologies are all very well madam sealer but i would happily trade them for your cooperation assuming you are not behind this incident he overrode her indignant splutter continuing smoothly and i dont see why you should be despite the suggestive circumstances random violence does not seem to me to be in the usual quaddie style it certainly is not well if its not random then it must be connected the central mystery of this entire imbroglio remains the neglected disappearance of lieutenant solian it was not neglected i disagree the answer to it mightshouldhave been put together days ago except that tab a seems to be on one side of an artificial divide from slot b if pursuing my quaddie assailant is the unions taskhe paused and raised his eyebrows she nodded grimlythen pursuing solian is surely mine its the one string i have in hand and i intend to follow it up and if the two investigations dont meet in the middle somewhere ill eat my auditors seal she blinked seeming a little surprised by this turn of discourse possibly good then i want complete and unimpeded access for me my assistant armsman roic and anyone else i may designate to any and all areas and records pertinent to this search starting with the idris and starting immediately we cannot give downsiders license to roam at will over station secure areas that madam sealer you are here to promote and protect union interests as i am to promote and protect barrayaran interests but if there is anything at all about this mess thats good for either quaddiespace or the imperium its not apparent to me is it to you no but then you agree the sooner we dig to the center of it the better she tented her upper hands regarding him through narrowed eyes before she could marshal further objections bel entered having apparently escaped venn and the media at last nicol bobbed along beside in her floater greenlaw brightened and seized on the one auspicious point for the quaddies in the chaos of the morning portmaster thorne welcome i understand the union owes you a debt of thanks for your courage and quick thinking bel glanced at milesa trifle dryly miles thoughtand favored her with a selfdeprecating half salute all in a days work maam at one time that would have been a statement of plain fact miles couldnt help reflecting greenlaw shook her head i trust not on graf station portmaster well i certainly thank portmaster thorne said ekaterin warmly nicols hand crept into bels and she shot a look up from under her dark eyelashes for which a redblooded soldier of any gender would gladly have traded medals campaign ribbons and combat bonuses all three high commands boring speeches thrown in gratis bel began to look slightly more reconciled to being designated heroic person of the hour to be sure miles agreed to say that im pleased with the portmasters liaison services is a profound understatement i would take it as a personal favor if the herm might continue in this assignment for the duration of my stay greenlaw caught bels eye then nodded at miles certainly lord auditor relieved miles gathered to have something to hand to him that cost her no new concessions a small smile moved her lips a rare event furthermore i shall grant you and your designated assistants access to graf station records and secured areasunder the portmasters direct supervision miles pretended to consider this compromise frowning artistically this places a substantial demand on portmaster thornes time and attention bel put in demurely ill gladly accept the assignment madam sealer provided boss watts authorizes both all my overtime hours and another supervisor to take over my routine duties not a problem portmaster ill direct watts to add his increased departmental costs to the komarran fleets docking bill greenlaw delivered this promise with a glint of grim satisfaction added to bels impsec stipend this would put the herm on triple time miles estimated old dendarii accounting tricks hah well miles would see that the imperium got its moneys worth very well he conceded endeavoring to appear stung then i wish to proceed aboard the idris immediately ekaterin didnt crack a smile but a faint light of appreciation glimmered in her eye and what if she had accepted his invitation to accompany him this morning and had walked up those stairs next to himhis assailants erratic aim would not have passed over her head picturing the probable results put an unpleasant knot in his stomach and his lingering adrenaline high tasted suddenly very sour lady vorkosiganmiles swallowedi am going to arrange for lady vorkosigan to stay aboard the prince xav until graf station security apprehends the wouldbe killer and this mystery is resolved he added in an apologetic murmur aside to her sorry she returned him a brief nod of understanding its all right not happy to be sure but she possessed too much good vor sense to argue about security issues he continued i therefore request special clearance for a barrayaran personnel shuttle to dock and take her out or the kestrel no he dared not lose access to his independent transport bolthole and secure communications station greenlaw twitched excuse me lord vorkosigan but thats how the last barrayaran assault arrived stationside we do not care to host another such influx she glanced at ekaterin and took a breath however i appreciate your concern i would be glad to offer one of our pods and pilots to lady vorkosigan as a courtesy transport miles replied madam sealer an unknown quaddie just tried to kill me ill grant i dont really think it was your secret policy but the key word here is unknown we dont yet know that it wasnt some quaddieor group of quaddiesstill in a position of trust there are several experiments id be willing to run to find out but this isnt one of them bel sighed audibly if you wish lord auditor vorkosigan i will undertake to personally pilot lady vorkosigan out to your flagship but i need you here bel evidently read his look for the herm added or some pilot of my choosing with an unfeigned reluctance this time miles agreed the next step was to call admiral vorpatril and inform him of his ships new guest vorpatril when his face appeared above the vid plate on the conference table passed no comment at the news other than certainly my lord auditor the prince xav will be honored but miles could read in the admirals shrewd glance his estimation of the increased seriousness of the situation miles ascertained that no hysterical preliminary dispatches about the incident had yet been squirted on their severalday trip to hq news and reassurances would therefore arrive thankfully simultaneously aware of their quaddie listeners vorpatril made no other remark than a bland request that the lord auditor bring him up to date on developments at his earliest conveniencein other words as soon as he could reach a private secured comconsole the meeting broke up more of greenlaws union militia guards had arrived and they all exited back into the hostels lobby well screened belatedly by armed outriders miles made sure to walk as far from ekaterin as possible in the shattered lobby quaddie forensics techs under venns direction were taking vid scans and measurements miles frowned up at the balcony considering trajectories bel walking beside him and watching his glance raised its eyebrows miles lowered his voice and said suddenly bel you dont suppose that loon could have been firing at you could he why me well just so how many people does a portmaster usually piss off in the normal course of business he glanced around nicol was out of earshot floating beside ekaterin and engaged in some lowvoiced animated exchange with her or notbusiness you havent been oh sleeping with anyones wife have you or husband he added conscientiously or daughter or whatever no said bel firmly nor with their household pets either what a barrayaran view of human motivations you do have miles miles grinned sorry what about old business bel sighed i thought id outrun or outlived all the old business the herm eyed miles sideways almost and added after a thoughtful moment youd surely be way ahead of me in line for that one too possibly miles frowned and then there was dubauer that herm was certainly tall enough to be a target although how the devil could an elderly betan dealer in designer animals whod spent most of its time on graf station locked in a hostel room anyway have annoyed some quaddie enough to inspire him to try to blow its timid head off too damned many possibles here it was time to inject some hard data chapter nine the quaddie pilot of bels selecting arrived and whisked ekaterin off together with a couple of sternlooking union militia guards miles watched her go in mild anguish as she turned to look over her shoulder walking out the hostel door he tapped his wrist com meaningfully she silently raised her left arm com bracelet glinting in return since they were all on their way to the idris anyway bel used the delay to call dubauer down to the lobby again dubauer smooth cheek now neatly sealed with a discreet dab of surgical glue arrived promptly and stared in some alarm at their new quaddie military escort but the shy graceful herm appeared to have regained most of its selfpossession and murmured sincere gratitude to bel for recollecting its creatures needs despite all the tumult the little party walked or floated variously trailing portmaster thorne via a notably unpublic back way through the customs and security zone to the array of loading bays devoted to galactic shipping the bay serving the idris clamped into its outboard docking cradle was quiet and dim unpeopled except for the two graf station security patrollers guarding the hatches bel presented its authorization and the two patrollers floated aside to allow bel access to the hatch controls the door to the big freight lock slid upward and leaving their union militia escort to help guard the entry miles roic and dubauer followed bel aboard the freighter the idris like its sister ship the rudra was of a utilitarian design that dispensed with elegance it was essentially a bundle of seven huge parallel cylinders the centralmost devoted to personnel four of the outer six given to freight the other two nacelles opposite each other in the outer ring housed the ships necklin rods that generated the field to fold it through jump points normalspace engines behind mass shield generators in front the ship rotated around its central axis to bring each outer cylinder to alignment with the stationside freight lock for automated loading or unloading of containers or hand loading of more delicate goods the design was not without added safety value for in the event of a pressurization loss in one or more cylinders any of the others could serve as a refuge while repairs were made or evacuation effected as they walked now through one freight nacelle miles glanced up and down its central access corridor which receded into darkness they passed through another lock into a small foyer in the forward section of the ship in one direction lay passenger staterooms in the other personnel cabins and offices lift tubes and a pair of stairs led up to the level devoted to ships mess infirmary and recreation facilities and downward to life support engineering and other utility areas roic glanced at his notes and nodded down the corridor this way to solians security office mlord ill escort citizen dubauer here to its flock said bel and catch up with you dubauer made an abortive little bow and the two herms passed onward into the lock leading to one of the outboard freight sections roic counted doorways past a second connecting foyer and tapped a code into a lock pad near the stern the door slid aside and the light came up revealing a tiny spare chamber housing scarcely more than a computer interface and two chairs and some lockable wall cabinets miles fired up the interface while roic ran a quick inventory of the cabinets contents all securityissue weapons and their power cartridges were present and accounted for all safety equipment neatly packed in its places the office was void of personal effects no vid displays of the girl back home no slyor politicaljokes or encouraging slogans pasted inside the cabinet doors but bruns investigators had been through here once already after solian had disappeared but before the ship had been evacuated by the quaddies following the clash with the barrayarans miles made a note to inquire if brunor venn for that matterhad removed anything roics override codes promptly brought up all of solians records and logs miles started from solians final shift the lieutenants daily reports were laconic repetitive and disappointingly free of comments on potential assassins miles wondered if he was listening to a dead mans voice by rights there ought to be some psychic frisson the eerie silence of the ship encouraged the imagination while the ship was in port its security system did keep continuous vid records of everyone and everything that boarded or departed through the stationside or other activated locks as a routine antitheft antisabotage precaution slogging through the whole ten days worth of comings and goings before the ship had been impounded even on fast forward was going to be a timeconsuming chore the daunting possibility of records having been altered or deleted as brun suspected solian had done to cover his desertion would also have to be explored miles made copies of everything that seemed even vaguely pertinent for further examination then he and roic paid a visit to solians cabin just a few meters down the same corridor it too was small and spare and unrevealing no telling what personal items solian might have packed in the missing valise but there certainly werent many left the ship had left komarr what six weeks ago with half a dozen ports of call between when the ship was inport was the busiest time for its security perhaps solian hadnt had much time to shop for souvenirs miles tried to make sense of what was left half a dozen uniforms a few civvies a bulky jacket some shoes and boots solians personally fitted pressure suit that seemed an expensive item one might want for a long sojourn in quaddiespace not very anonymous though with its barrayaran military markings finding nothing in the cabin to relieve them of the chore of examining vid records miles and roic returned to solians office and began if nothing else miles encouraged himself reviewing the security vids would give him a mental picture of the potential dramatis personae buried somewhere in the mob of persons who had nothing to do with anything to be sure looking at everything was a sure sign that he didnt know what the hell he was doing yet but it was the only way hed ever found to smoke out the nonobvious clue that everyone else had overlooked he glanced up after a time at a movement in the office door bel had returned and leaned against the jamb finding anything yet the herm asked not so far miles paused the vid display did your betan friend get its problems taken care of still working feeding the critters and shoveling manure or at least adding nutrient concentrate to the replicator reservoirs and removing the waste bags from the filtration units i can see why dubauer was upset at the delay there must be a thousand animal fetuses in that hold major financial loss if it becomes a loss huh most animal husbandry people ship frozen embryos said miles thats the way my grandfather used to import his fancy horse bloodstock from earth implanted em in a grade mare upon arrival to finish cooking cheaper lighter less maintenanceshipping delays not an issue if it comes to that although i suppose this way uses the travel time for gestation dubauer did say time was of the essence bel hitched its shoulders frowning uncomfortably what do the idris s logs have to say about dubauer and its cargo anyway miles called up the records boarded when the fleet first assembled in komarr orbit bound for xerxesthe next stop after graf station which must make this mess especially frustrating reservation made about six weeks before the fleet departed via a komarran shipping agent a legitimate company miles recognized the name this record did not indicate where dubauerandcargo had originated nor if the herm had intended to connect with another commercialor privatecarrier at xerxes for some further ultimate destination he eyed bel shrewdly something got your hackles up i dont know theres something funny about dubauer in what way would i get the joke if i could say it wouldnt bother me so much it seems a fussy old herm maybe something on the academic side university or former university bioengineering research and development would fit the oddly precise and polite style so would personal shyness that might account for it said bel in an unconvinced tone funny right miles made a note to especially observe the herms movements on and off the idris in his records search bel watching him remarked greenlaw was secretly impressed with you by the way oh yeah shes certainly managed to keep it a secret from me bels grin sparked she told me you appeared very task oriented thats a compliment in quaddiespace i didnt explain to her that you considered getting shot at to be a normal part of your daily routine well not daily by preference miles grimaced nor normally in the new job im supposed to be rear echelon now im getting old bel the grin twisted halfup in sardonic amusement speaking from the vantage of one not quite twice your age and in your fine old barrayaran phrase of yore horseshit miles miles shrugged maybe its the impending fatherhood got you spooked does it bels brows rose no of course not orwell yes but not in that way my father was i have a lot to live up to and perhaps even a few things to do differently bel tilted its head but before it could speak again footsteps sounded down the corridor dubauers light cultured voice inquired portmaster thorne ah there you are bel moved within as the tall herm appeared in the doorway miles noted roics appraising eye flick before the bodyguard pretended to return his attention to the vid display dubauer pulled on its fingers anxiously and asked bel are you returning to the hostel soon no that is im not returning to the hostel at all oh ah the herm hesitated you see with strange quaddies flying around out there shooting at people i didnt really want to go out on the station alone has anyone heardhe hasnt been apprehended yet has he no i was hoping can anyone go with me bel smiled sympathetically at this display of frazzled nerves ill send one of the security guards with you that all right i should be extremely grateful yes are you all finished now dubauer bit its lip well yes and no that is i have finished servicing my replicators and done what little i can to slow the growth and metabolism of their contents but if my cargo is to be held here very much longer therell not be time to get to my final destination before my creatures outgrow their containers if i indeed have to destroy them it will be a disastrous event the komarran fleets insurance ought to make good on that id think said bel or you could sue graf station miles suggested better yet do both and collect twice bel spared him an exasperated glance dubauer managed a pained smile that only addresses the immediate financial loss after a longer pause the herm continued to salvage the more important part the proprietary bioengineering i wish to take tissue samples and freeze them before disposal i shall also require some equipment for complete biomatter breakdown or access to the ships converters if they wont become overloaded with the mass i must destroy its going to be a timeconsuming and i fear extremely messy task i was wondering portmaster thorneif you cannot obtain my cargos release from quaddie impoundment can you at least get me permission to stay aboard the idris while i undertake its dispatch bels brow wrinkled at the horrific picture the herms soft words conjured lets hope youre not forced to such extreme measures how much time do you have really the herm hesitated not very much more and if i must dispose of my creaturesthe sooner the better id prefer to get it over with understandable bel blew out its breath there might be some alternate possibilities to stretch your time window said miles hiring a smaller faster ship to take you directly to your destination for example the herm shook its head sadly and who would pay for this ship my lord vorkosigan the barrayaran imperium miles bit his tongue on either yeah sure or alternate suggestions involving greenlaw and the union he was supposed to be handling the big picture not getting bogged down in all the humanor inhumanedetails he made a neutral gesture and let bel shepherd the betan out miles spent a few more minutes failing to find anything exciting on the vid logs then bel returned miles shut down the vid i think id like a look at that funny betans cargo cant help you there said bel i dont have the codes to the freight lockers only the passengers are supposed to have the access to the space they rent by contract and the quaddies havent bothered to get a court order to make them disgorge em decreases graf stations liability for theft while the passengers arent aboard ysee youll have to get dubauer to let you in dear bel i am an imperial auditor and this is not only a barrayaranregistered ship it belongs to empress laisas own family i go where i will solian has to have a security override for every cranny of this ship roic right here mlord the armsman tapped his notation device very well then lets take a walk bel and roic followed him down the corridor and through the central lock to the adjoining freight section the doubledoor to the second chamber down yielded to roics careful tapping on its lock pad miles poked his head through and brought up the lights it was an impressive sight gleaming replicator racks stood packed in tight rows filling the space and leaving only narrow aisles between each rack sat bolted on its own float pallet in four layers of five unitstwenty to a rack as high as roic was tall beneath darkened display readouts on each control panels twinkled with reassuringly green lights for now miles walked down the aisle formed by five pallets around the end and up the next counting more pallets lined the walls bels estimate of a thousand seemed exactly right youd think the placental chambers would be a larger size these seem nearly identical to the ones at home with which hed grown intimately familiar of late these arrays were clearly meant for mass production all twenty units stacked on a pallet economically shared reservoirs pumps filtration devices and the control panel he leaned closer i dont see a makers mark or serial numbers or anything else that would reveal the planet of origin for what were clearly very finely made machines he tapped a control to bring the monitor screen to life the glowing screen didnt contain manufacturing data or serial numbers either just a stylized scarlet screamingbird pattern on a silver background his heart began to lump what the hell was this doing here miles said bels voice seeming to come from a long way off if youre going to pass out put your head down between my knees choked miles and kiss my ass goodbye bel do you know what that sigil is no said bel in a leery nowwhat tone cetagandan star crche not the military ghemlords not their cultivatedand i mean that in both sensesmasters the haut lordsnot even the imperial celestial garden higher still the star crche is the innermost core of the innermost ring of the whole damned giant genetic engineering project that is the cetagandan empire the haut ladies own gene bank they design their emperors there hell they design the whole haut race there the haut ladies dont work in animal genes they think it would be beneath them they leave that to the ghemladies not note to the ghemlords hand shaking slightly he reached out to touch the monitor and bring up the next control level general power and reservoir readouts all in the green the next level allowed individual monitoring of each fetus contained within one of the twenty separate placental chambers human blood temperature baby mass and if that werent enough tiny individual vid spy cameras built in with lights to view the replicators inhabitants in real time floating peacefully in their amniotic sacs the one in the monitor twitched tiny fingers at the soft red glow and seemed to scrunch up its big dark eyes if not quite grown to term itno shewas damned close to it miles guessed he thought of helen natalia and aral alexander roic swung on his booted heel lips parting in dismay staring up the aisle of glittering devices dyou mean mlord that all these things are full of human babies well now thats a question actually thats two questions are they full and are they human if they are haut infants that latter is a most debatable point for the first we can at least look a dozen more pallet monitors checked at random intervals around the room revealed similar results miles was breathing rapidly by the time he gave it up for proven roic said in a puzzled tone so whats a betan herm doing with a bunch of cetagandan replicators and just because theyre cetagandan make how dyou know its cetagandans inside em maybe the betan bought the replicators used miles lips drawn back on a grin swung to bel betan what do you think bel how much did you two talk about the old sandbox while you were supervising this visit we didnt talk much at all bel shook its head but that doesnt prove anything im not much for bringing up the subject of home myself and even if i had im too out of touch with beta to spot inaccuracies in current events anyway it wasnt dubauers conversation that was the trouble there was just something off in its body language body language just so miles stepped to bel reached up and turned the herms face to the light bel did not flinch at his nearness but merely smiled fine hairs gleamed on cheek and chin miless eyes narrowed as he carefully revisualized the cut on dubauers cheek you have facial down like women all herms do right sure unless theyre using a really thorough depilatory i suppose some even cultivate beards dubauer doesnt miles made to pace down the aisle stopped himself turned back and held still with an effort nary a sprout in sight except for the pretty silver eyebrows and hair which id wager betan dollars to sand are recent implants body language hah dubauers not doublesexed at allwhat were your ancestors thinking bel smirked cheerily but altogether sexless truly it it in betan parlance bel began in the weary tone of one who has had to explain this far too often does not carry the connotation of an inanimate object that it does in other planetary cultures i say this despite a certain exboss of my very distant past who did a pretty fair imitation of the sort of large and awkward piece of furniture that one can neither get rid of nor decorate around miles waved this aside dont tell me i got that lecture at my mothers knee but dubauers not a herm dubauers a ba a who what to the casual outside eye the ba appear to be the bred servitors of the celestial garden where the cetagandan emperor dwells in serenity in surroundings of aesthetic perfection or so the haut lords would have you believe the ba seem the ultimate loyal servant race human dogs beautiful of course because everything inside the celestial garden must be i first ran into the ba about ten years back when i was sent to cetagandanot as admiral naismith but as lieutenant lord vorkosiganon a diplomatic errand to attend the funeral of emperor fletchir giajas mother as it happened the old dowager empress lisbet i got to see a lot of ba up close those of a certain agerelicts of lisbets youth a century ago mainlyhad all been made hairless it was a fashion which has since passed but the ba arent servants or anyway arent just servants of the imperial haut remember what i said about the haut ladies of the star crche only working in human genes the ba are where the haut ladies test out prospective new gene complexes improvements to the haut race before they decide if theyre good enough to add to this years new model haut cohort in a sense the ba are the hauts siblings elder siblings almost children even from a certain angle of view the haut and the ba are two sides of one coin a ba is every bit as smart and dangerous as a haut lord but not as autonomous the ba are as loyal as they are sexless because theyre made so and for some of the same reasons of control at least it explains why i kept thinking id met dubauer someplace before if that ba doesnt share most of its genes with fletchir giaja himself ill eat my my my fingernails bel suggested miles hastily removed his hand from his mouth he continued if dubauers a ba and ill swear it is these replicators have to be full of cetagandan somethings but why here why transport them covertly and on a ship of a onceandfuture enemy empire at that well i hope not futurethe last three rounds of open warfare we had with our cetagandan neighbors were surely enough if this was something open and aboveboard why not travel on a cetagandan ship with all the trimmings i guarantee its not for economys sake deathly secret this but who from and why what the hell is the star crche up to anyway he swung in a circle unable to keep still and what is so hellish secret that this ba would bring these live growing fetuses all this way but then plan to kill them all to keep the secret rather than ask for help oh said bel yeah that thats a bit unnerving when you think about it roic said indignantly thats horrible mlord maybe dubauer doesnt really intend to flush them said bel in an uncertain tone maybe it just said that to get us to put more pressure on the quaddies to give it a break let it take its cargo off the idris ah said miles there was an attractive ideawash his hands of this whole unholy mess crap no not yet anyway in fact i want you to lock the idris back down dont let dubauerdont let anyone back on board for once in my life i actually want to check with hq before i jump and as quickly as possible what was it that gregor had saidhad talked around rather something has stirred up the cetagandans around rho ceta something peculiar oh sire do we ever have peculiar here now connections miles said bel in aggravation i just jumped through hoops persuading watts and greenlaw to let dubauer back on the idris how am i going to explain the sudden reversal bel hesitated if this cargo and its owner are dangerous to quaddiespace i should report it dyou think that quaddie in the hostel might have been shooting at dubauer instead of at you or me the thought has crossed my mind yes then its wrong to blindside the station on what may be a safety issue miles took a breath you are graf stations representative here you know therefore the station knows thats enough for now bel frowned that arguments too disingenuous even for me im only asking you to wait depending on what information i get back from home i could damn well end up buying dubauer a fast ship to take its cargo away on one not of barrayaran registry preferably just stall i know you can well all right for a little while i want the secured comconsole in the kestrel well seal this hold and continue later wait i want to have a look at dubauers cabin first miles have you ever heard of the concept of a search warrant dear bel how fussy you have grown in your old age this is a barrayaran ship and i am gregors voice i dont ask for search warrants i issue them miles took one last turn completely around the cargo hold before having roic lock it back up he didnt spot anything different just dauntingly more of the same fifty pallets added up to a lot of uterine replicators there were no decomposing dead bodies tucked in behind any of the replicator racks anyway worse luck dubauers accommodation back in the personnel module proved unenlightening it was a small economy cabin and whatever personal effects the individual of unknown gender had possessed it had evidently packed and taken them all along when the quaddies had transferred the passengers to the hostels no bodies under the bed or in the cabinets here either bruns people had surely searched it at least cursorily once the day after solian vanished miles made a mental note to try to arrange a more microscopically thorough forensics examination of both the cabin and the hold with the replicators althoughby what organization he didnt want to turn this over to venn yet but the barrayaran fleets medical people were mainly devoted to trauma ill figure something out never had he missed impsec more keenly do the cetagandans have any agents here in quaddiespace he asked bel as they exited the cabin and locked up again have you ever encountered your opposite numbers bel shook its head people from your region are pretty thinly spread out in this arm of the nexus barrayar doesnt even keep a fulltime consuls office on union station and neither does cetaganda all they have is some quaddie lawyer on retainer over there who keeps the paperwork for about a dozen minor planetary polities if anyone should want it visas and entry permissions and such actually as i recall she handles both barrayar and cetaganda if there are any cetagandan agents on graf i havent spotted them i can only hope the reverse is also true though if the cetagandans do keep any spies or agents or informers in quaddiespace theyre most likely to be on union im only here on graf for um personal reasons before they exited the idris roic insisted bel call venn for an update on the search for the murderous quaddie from the hostel lobby venn clearly discommoded rattled off reports of vigorous activity on the part of his patrollersand no results roic was jumpy on the short walk from the idris s docking bay to the one where the kestrel was locked on eyeing their armed quaddie escort with almost as much suspicion as he eyed shadows and cross corridors but they arrived without further incident how hard would it be to get greenlaws permission to fastpenta dubauer miles asked bel as they made their way through the kestrel s airlock well youd need a court order and an explanation that would convince a quaddie judge hm ambushing dubauer with a hypospray aboard the idris suggests itself to my mind as a simpler alternate possibility it would bel sighed and it would cost me my job if watts found out id helped you if dubauers innocent of wrongdoing it would certainly complain to the quaddie authorities afterward dubauers not innocent at the very least its lied about its cargo not necessarily its manifest just reads mammals genetically altered assorted you cant say they arent mammals transporting minors for immoral purposes then slave trading hell ill think of something miles waved roic and bel off to wait and took over the kestrel s wardroom again he seated himself adjusted the security cone and took a long breath trying to round up his galloping thoughts there was no faster way to get a tightbeam message however coded from quaddiespace to barrayar than via the commercial system of links message beams were squirted at the speed of light across local space systems between wormhole jump point stations an hours or a days messages were collected at the stations and loaded on either scheduled dedicated communications ships jumping back and forth on a regular schedule to squirt them across the next local space region or on less traveled routes on whatever ship next jumped through the round trip for a beamed message between quaddiespace and the imperium would take several days at best he addressed the message triply to emperor gregor to impsec chief allegre and to impsec galactic operations headquarters on komarr after a sketchy outline of the situation so far including assurances of his assailants bad aim he described dubauer in as much detail as possible and the startling cargo hed found aboard the idris he requested full details on the new tensions with the cetagandans that gregor had alluded to so obliquely and appended an urgent plea for information if any on known cetagandan operatives and operations in quaddiespace he ran the results through the kestrel s impsec encoder and squirted it on its way now what wait for an answer that might be entirely inconclusive hardly he jumped in his chair when his wrist com buzzed he gulped and slapped it vorkosigan hello miles it was ekaterins voice his heart rate slowed do you have a moment not only that i have the kestrel s comconsole a moment of privacy if you can believe it oh just a second then the wrist com channel closed shortly ekaterins face and torso appeared over the vid plate she was wearing that flattering slateblue thing again ah she said happily there you are thats better well not quite he touched his fingers to his lips and transferred the kiss in pantomime to the image of hers cool ghost alas not warm flesh belatedly he asked where are you alone he trusted in my cabin on the prince xav admiral vorpatril gave me a nice one i think he evicted some poor senior officer are you all right have you had your dinner dinner oh dear i know that look make lieutenant smolyani at least open you a meal tray before you go off again yes love he grinned at her practicing that maternal drill i was thinking of it more as a public service have you found something interesting and useful interesting is an understatement usefulwellim not sure he described his find on the idris in only slightly more colorful terms than the ones hed just sent off to gregor ekaterins eyes grew wide goodness and here i was all excited because i thought id found a fat clue for you im afraid mines just gossip by comparison gossip away do just something i picked up over dinner with vorpatrils officers they seemed a pleasant group i must say ill bet they made themselves pleasant their guest was beautiful cultured a breath of home and the first female most of them had spoken to in weeks and married to the imperial auditor heh eat your hearts out boys i tried to get them to talk about lieutenant solian but hardly anyone knew the man except that one fellow remembered that solian had had to step out of a weekly fleet security officers meeting because hed sprung a nosebleed i gather that solian was more embarrassed and annoyed than alarmed but it occurred to me that it might be a chronic thing with him nikki had them for a while and i had them occasionally for a couple of years when i was a girl though mine went away on their own but if solian hadnt taken himself to his ships medtech to get fixed yet well it might be another way someone could have obtained a tissue sample from him for that manufactured blood she paused actually now i think on it im not so sure that is a help to you anyone might have grabbed his used nose rag out of the trash wherever hed been although i supposed that if his nose was bleeding at least he had to have been alive at the time it seemed a little hopeful anyway her thoughtful frown deepened or maybe not thank you said miles sincerely i dont know if its hopeful or not either but it gives me another reason to see the medtechs next good he was rewarded with a smile he added and if you come up with any thoughts on dubauers cargo feel free to share although only with me for the moment i understand her brows drew down it is stunningly strange not strange that the cargo existsi mean if all the haut children are conceived and genetically engineered centrally the way your friend the haut pel described it to me when she came as an envoy to gregors wedding the haut women geneticists have to be exporting thousands of embryos from the star crche all the time not all the time miles corrected once a year the annual haut child ships to the outlying satrapies are all dispatched at the same time it gives all the top hautlady planetary consorts like pel who are charged with conducting them a chance to meet and consult with each other among other things she nodded but to bring this cargo all the way hereand with only one handler to look after them if your dubauer or whoever it is really does have a thousand babies in tow i dont care if theyre normal human or ghem or haut or what it had better have several hundred nursemaids waiting for them somewhere truly miles rubbed his forehead which was aching again and not just from the exploding possibilities ekaterin was right about that meal tray as usual if solian could have tossed away a blood sample anywhere any time oh ha he rummaged in his trouser pocket and pulled out his handkerchief forgotten there since this morning and opened it on the heavy brown stain blood sample indeed he didnt have to wait for impsec hq to get back to him on this identification he would have undoubtedly remembered this accidental specimen eventually without the prompting whether before or after the efficient roic had cleaned his clothes and returned them ready to don again now that was another question wasnt it ekaterin i love you dearly and i need to talk to the prince xav s surgeon right now he made frantic kissing motions at her which elicited that entrancing enigmatic smile of hers and cut the com chapter ten miles made an urgent headsup call to the prince xav a short delay followed while bel negotiated clearance for the kestrel s message drone half a dozen armed union militia patrol vessels still floated protectively between graf station and vorpatrils fleet lying in frustrated exile several kilometers off it would not have done for miless precious sample to be shot out of space by some quaddie militia guard with a double quota of itchy trigger fingers miles didnt relax until the prince xav reported the capsule safely retrieved and taken inboard he finally settled down at the kestrel s wardroom table with bel roic and some militaryissue ration trays he ate mechanically barely tasting the admittedly notverytasty hot food one eye on the vid display still fast forwarding through the idris s lock records dubauer it appeared had never once left the vessel to so much as stroll about the station during the whole of the time the ship had been in dock until forcibly removed with the other passengers to the stationside hostel by the quaddies lieutenant solian had left five times four of them duty excursions for routine cargo checks the fifth most interestingly after his work shift on his last day the vid showed a good view of the back of his head departing and a clear shot of his face returning about forty minutes later despite freezing the image miles could not certainly identify any of the spots or shadows on solians darkgreen barrayaran military tunic as nosebloodstains even in closeup solians expression was set and frowning as he glanced up straight at the security vid pickup part of his charge after allperhaps automatically checking its function the young man didnt look relaxed or happy or as though he were looking forward to some interesting station leave although he had been due some he looked intent on something it was the last documented time solian had been seen alive no sign of his body had been found when bruns men had searched the idris the next day and they had searched thoroughly requiring each passenger with cargo including dubauer to unlock their cabins and holds for inspection hence bruns strongly held theory that solian must have smuggled himself out undetected so where did he go out to during that forty minutes he was off the ship miles asked in aggravation he didnt cross my customs barriers not unless someone rolled him in a damned carpet and carried him said bel positively and i dont have a record of anyone lugging in a carpet we looked he had pretty free access to the six loading bays in that sector and any ships then in dock which were all your four at the time well brun swears he doesnt have vids of him boarding any of the other vessels i suppose id better check everyone else who entered or left any of the ships during that period solian could have sat down for a quiet unobserved chator more sinister exchangewith someone in any number of nooks in those loading bays with or without a nosebleed the bays arent that closely controlled or patrolled bel admitted we let crew and passengers use the empty ones for exercise spaces or games sometimes hm someone had certainly used one to play games with that synthesized blood later after their utilitarian dinner miles had bel conduct him back through the customs checkpoints to the hostel where the impounded ships crews were housed these digs were notably less luxurious and more crowded than the ones devoted to the paying galactic passengers and the edgy crews had been stuck in them for days with nothing but the holovid and each other for entertainment miles was instantly pounced upon by assorted senior officers both from the two toscane corporation ships and the two independents caught up in this fracas demanding to know how soon he was going to obtain their release he cut through the hubbub to request interviews with the medtechs assigned to the four ships and a quiet room to conduct them in some shuffling produced at length a back office and a quartet of nervous komarrans miles addressed the idris s medtech first how hard would it be for an unauthorized person to gain access to your infirmary the man blinked not hard at all lord auditor i mean its not locked in case of an emergency people might need to be able to get in right away without hunting me up i might even be the emergency he paused then added a few of my medications and some equipment are kept in codelocked drawers with tighter inventory controls of course but for the rest theres no need in dock who comes on and off the ship is controlled by ships security and in space well that takes care of itself you havent had trouble with theft then equipment going for a walk supplies disappearing very little i mean the ship is public but its not that kind of public if you see what i mean the medtechs from the two independent ships reported similar protocols when in space but when in dock both were required to keep their little departments secured when they were not themselves on duty there miles reminded himself that one of these people might have been bribed to cooperate with whoever had undertaken the blood synthesis four suspects eh his next inquiry ascertained that all four ships infirmaries did indeed keep portable synthesizers in inventory as standard equipment if someone snuck in to one of your infirmaries to synthesize some blood would you be able to tell that your equipment had been used if they cleaned up after themselves maybe not said the idris s tech orhow much blood three to four liters the mans anxious face cleared oh yes that is if they used my supplies of phyllopacks and fluids and didnt bring in their own id have noticed if that much were gone how soon would you notice next time i looked i suppose or at the monthly inventory if i didnt have occasion to look before then have you noticed no butthat is i havent looked except that a suitably bribed medtech ought to be perfectly capable of fudging the inventory of such bulky and noncontrolled items miles decided to turn up the heat he said blandly the reason i ask is that the blood that was found on the loading bay floor that kicked off this unfortunateand expensivechain of events while it was indeed initially dna typed as lieutenant solians was found to be synthesized quaddie customs claim to have no record of solian ever crossing into graf station which suggests although it does not alas prove that the blood might have been synthesized on the outboard side of the customs barrier too i think we had better check each of your supply inventories next the medtech from the idris s toscaneowned sister ship the rudra frowned suddenly there was she broke off yes miles said encouragingly there was that funny passenger who came in to ask me about my blood synthesizer i just figured he was one of the nervous sorts of travelers although when he explained himself i also thought he probably had good reason to be miles smiled carefully tell me more about your funny passenger hed just signed on to the rudra here at graf station he said he was worried if he had any accidents en route because he couldnt take standard blood substitutes on account of being so heavily gengineered which he was i mean i believed him about the blood compatibility problems thats why we carry the synthesizers after all he had the longest fingerswith webs he told me he was an amphibian which i didnt quite believe till he showed me his gill slits his ribs opened out in the most astonishing fashion he said he has to keep spraying his gills with moisturizer when he travels because the air on ships and stations is too dry for him she stopped and swallowed definitely not dubauer then hm another player but in the same game or a different one she continued in a scared voice i ended up showing him my synthesizer because he seemed so worried and kept asking questions about it i mainly worried about what sorts of tranquilizers were going to be safe to use on him if he turned out to be one of those people who gets hysterical eight days out leaping about and whooping miles told himself firmly would likely just frighten the young woman more he did sit up and favor her with a perky smile which made her shrink back in her chair only slightly when was this what day um two days before the quaddies made us all evacuate the ship and come here three days after solians vanishing better and better what was the passengers name could you identify him again oh surei mean webs after all he told me his name was firka as if casually miles asked would you be willing to repeat this testimony under fastpenta she made a face i suppose so do i have to neither panicked nor too eager good well see physical inventory next i think well start with the rudra s infirmary and just in case he was being led up the path by his nose the others to follow more delays ensued while bel negotiated over the comconsole with venn and watts for the temporary release from house arrest of the medtechs as expert witnesses once those arrangements had been approved the visit to the rudra s infirmary was gratifyingly short direct and fruitful the medtechs supply of synthetic blood base was down by four liters a phyllopack with its hundreds of square meters of primed reaction surface stacked in microscopic layers in a convenient insert was gone and the blood synthesizing machine had been improperly cleaned miles smiled toothily as he personally scraped a tinge of organic residue from its tubing into a plastic bag for the delectation of the prince xav s surgeon it all rang sufficiently true that he set roic to collecting copies of the rudra s security records with particular reference to passenger firka and sent bel off with the techs to crosscheck the other three infirmaries without him miles returned to the kestrel and handed off his new sample to lieutenant smolyani to convey promptly to the prince xav then settled down to run a search for firkas present location he tracked him to the second of the two hostels taken up with the impounded ships passengers but the quaddie on security duty there reported that the man had signed out for the evening before dinner and had not yet returned firkas prior venture out that day had been around the time of the passengers meeting perhaps hed been one of the men in the back of the room although miles certainly hadnt noticed a webbed hand raised for questions miles left orders with quaddie hostel security to call him or armsman roic when the passenger returned regardless of the time frowning he called the first hostel to check on dubauer the betancetagandan hermbawhatever had indeed returned safely from the idris but had left again after dinner not in itself unusual few of the trapped passengers stayed in their hostel when they could vary their evening boredom by seeking entertainment elsewhere on the station but hadnt dubauer just been the person whod been too frightened to traverse graf station alone without an armed escort miless frown deepened and he left orders to this quaddie duty guard to notify him when dubauer too came back he rescanned the idris s security vids on fast forward while waiting roics return paused closeup views of the hands of a number of otherwise unexceptionable visitors to the ship revealed no webs it was nearing station midnight when roic and bel checked in bel was yawning nothing exciting the herm reported i think we got it in one i sent the medtechs back to the hostel with a security escort to tuck em into bed whats next miles chewed gently on the side of his finger wait for the surgeon to report identifications on the two samples i sent over to the prince xav wait for firka and dubauer to return to their hostels or else go running all over the station looking for them or better yet make venns patrollers do it except that i dont really want to divert them from hunting for my assassin till they nail the fellow roic who had begun to look alarmed relaxed again good thinking mlord he murmured gratefully sounds like a golden opportunity to sleep to me opined bel miles to his irritation was finding bels yawns contagious miles had never quite mastered their old mercenary colleague commodore tungs formidable ability to sleep anywhere any time a break in the action permitted he was sure he was still too keyed up to doze a nap maybe he granted grudgingly bel intelligently at once seized the chance to go home to nicol for a time overriding the herms argument that it was a bodyguard miles made bel take a quaddie patroller along regretfully miles decided to wait until he had heard back from the surgeon to call and wake up chief venn he could not afford mistakes in quaddie eyes he cleaned up and lay down himself in his tiny cabin for whatever sleep he could snatch if he had a choice between a good nights uninterrupted sleep and early news hed prefer news venn would presumably let him know at once if security effected an arrest of the quaddie with the rivet gun some space transfer stations were deliberately designed to be hard to hide in unfortunately graf wasnt one of them its architecture could only be described as an agglomeration it had to be full of forgotten crannies best chance of catching the fellow would be if he attempted to leave would he be cool enough to go to some den and lie low instead or having missed his target the first timewhoever his target had beenhot enough to circle back for another pass smolyani had disengaged the kestrel from its lock and taken up position a few meters off the side of the station just in case while the lord auditor slept replacing the question of who would want to shoot a harmless elderly betan herm shepherding well sheep with the question of who would want to shoot a cetagandan ba smuggling a secret humanor superhumancargo of inestimable value at least to the star crche opened up the range of possible complications in an extremely disturbing fashion miles had already quietly decided that passenger firka was due for an early rendezvous with fastpenta with quaddie cooperation if miles could get it or without but upon reflection it was doubtful that the truth drug would work on a ba he entertained brief wistful fantasies of older interrogation methods something from the ancestral era of mad emperor yuri perhaps or greatgreatgrandfather count pierre le sanguinaire vorrutyer he rolled over in his narrow bunk conscious of how lonely the silence of his cabin was without the reassuring rhythmic breath of ekaterin overhead he had gradually become used to that nightly presence this marriage thing was getting to be a habit one of his better ones he touched the chrono on his wrist and sighed she was probably asleep by now too late to call and wake her just to listen to his blither he counted over the days to aral alexander and helen natalias decanting their travel margin was narrowing each day he fooled around here his brain was putting together a twisted jingle to an old nursery tune something about fastpenta and puppy dog tails early in the morning when he mercifully drifted off mlord miles snapped alert at roics voice on the cabin intercom yes the prince xav s surgeon is on the secured comconsole i told him to hold youd wish to be wakened yes miles glanced at the glowing numerals of the wall chrono hed been asleep about four hours plenty enough for now he reached for his jacket on my way roic againno stillin uniform waited in the increasingly familiar little wardroom i thought i told you to get some sleep miles said tomorrowtoday it is now could be a long one i was checking through the rudra s security vids mlord think i might have something all right show me them after this then he slid into the station chair powered up the security cone and activated the com vid image the senior fleet surgeon who by the collar tabs on his green uniform held a captains rank looked to be one of the young and fit new men of emperor gregors progressive reign by his bright excited eyes he wasnt regretting his lost nights sleep much my lord auditor captain chris clogston here i have your blood work excellent what have you found the surgeon leaned forward the most interesting was the stain on that handkerchief of yours id say it was cetagandan haut blood without question except that the sex chromosomes are decidedly odd and instead of the extra pair of chromosomes where they usually assemble their genetic modifications there are two extra pairs miles grinned yes quite an experimental model cetagandan haut indeed but this one is a bagenderlessand almost certainly from the star crche itself freeze a portion of that sample and mark it top secret and send it along home to impsecs biolabs by the first available courier with my compliments im sure theyll want it on file yes my lord no wonder dubauer had tried to retrieve that bloodied handkerchief quite aside from blowing its cover highlevel star crche gene work was not the sort of thing the haut ladies cared to have circulating at large not unless theyd released it themselves filtered through a few select cetagandan ghem clans via their haut trophy wives and mothers granted the haut ladies saved their greatest vigilance for the genes they gated in to their wellguarded genome generationslong work of art that it was miles wondered how tidy a profit one might make offering pirate copies of those cells hed inadvertently collected or maybe notthis ba wasnt clearly their latest work a nearcentury out of date in fact their latest work lay in the hold of the idris urk the other sample clogston went on was solian iithat is lieutenant solians synthesized blood identical to the earlier specimensame batch id say good now were getting somewhere where for gods sake thank you captain this is invaluable go get some sleep youve earned it the surgeon disappointment writ plainly on his face at this dismissal without further explication signed off miles turned back to roic in time to catch him stifling a yawn the armsman looked embarrassed and sat up straighter so what do we have miles prompted roic cleared his throat the passenger firka actually joined the rudra after it was first due to leave during that delay for repairs huh suggests it wasnt part of a longlaid itinerary then maybe go on ive filtered out quite a few records of the fellow passing on and off the ship before it was impounded and the passengers evicted using his cabin as his hostel it seems which a lot of folks do to save money two of his trips bracket times lieutenant solian was away from the idris one overlaps his last routine cargo inspection and tother exactly brackets that last forty minutes we cant account for oh very nice so what does this selfdeclared amphibian look like roic fiddled a moment with the console and brought up a clear fulllength shot from the rudra s lock vid records the man was tall with pale unhealthylooking skin and dark hair shaved close to his skull in a patchy unflattering fuzz like lichen on a boulder big nose small ears a lugubrious expression on his rubbery facehe looked strung out actually eyes dark and ringed long skinny arms and legs a loose tunic or poncho concealed the details of his big upper torso his hands and feet were especially distinctive and miles zoomed in for closeups one hand was halfconcealed in a cloth glove with the fingertips cut out which hid the webs from a casual glance but the other was ungloved and halfraised and the webs showed distinctly a dark rose color between the overlong fingers the feet were concealed in soft boots or buskins tied at the ankles but they too were about double the length of a normal foot though no wider could the fellow spread his webbed toes when in the water as he spread his webbed fingers to make a broad flipper he recalled ekaterins description of the passenger who had accosted her and bel on their outing that first dayhe had the longest narrowest hands and feet bel should get a look at this shortly miles let the vid run the fellow had a somewhat shambling gate when he walked lifting and setting down those almost clownish feet where did he come from miles asked roic his documentation claims hes an aslunder roics voice was heavy with disbelief aslund was one of barrayars fairly near nexus neighbors an impoverished agricultural world in a local space culdesac off the hegen hub huh almost our neck of the woods i dunno mlord his graf station customs records show him disembarking from a ship hed joined at tau ceti which arrived here on the day before our fleet was originally due to leave dont know if he originated there or not id bet not was there a waterworld being settled somewhere on the fringes of the nexus whose colonists had chosen to alter their children instead of their environment miles hadnt heard of one but it had to happen sometime or was firka a oneoff project an experiment or prototype of some sort hed certainly run into a few of those before neither exactly squared with an origin on aslund though he might have immigrated there miles made a note to request an impsec background search on the fellow in his next report even though any results were likely to trickle back too late to be of any immediate use at least he certainly hoped hed have this mess wrapped up and shipped out before then he originally tried to get a berth on the idris but there wasnt room roic added ah or maybe that ought to be huh miles sat back in his station chair eyes narrowing reasoning in advance of his beloved and muchlongedfor fastpentaposit that this peculiar individual had had some personal contact with solian before the lieutenant went missing posit that he had acquired somehow a sample of solians blood perhaps in much the same accidental way that miles had acquired dubauers why then in the name of reason would he have subsequently gone to the trouble of running up a fake sample of solians blood and dribbling it all over a loading bay and out the airlock to cover up a murder elsewhere solians disappearance had already been put down to desertion by his own commanders no cover needed if a murder it was already nearly the perfect crime at that point with the investigation about to be abandoned a frame meant to pin solians murder on another attractive but in that case shouldnt some innocent have been tracked and accused by now unless firka was the innocent it was a frame with no portrait in it at present to cover up a desertion might firka and solian be collaborating on solians defection or when might a desertion not be a desertion when it was an impsec covert ops scam thats when except that solian was service security not impsec a guard not a spy or trained agent still a sufficiently bright loyal highly motivated and ambitious officer finding himself in some complex imbroglio might not wait for orders from on high to pursue a fastmoving long shot as miles had reason to know of course taking risky chances like that could get such an officer killed as miles also had reason to know regardless of intent what had the actual effect of the blood bait been or what would it have been if corbeau and garnet fives starcrossed romance hadnt run afoul of barrayaran prejudices and loutishness the showy scarlet scenario on the loading bay deck would certainly have reaffixed official attention upon solians disappearance it would almost certainly have delayed the fleets departure although not as spectacularly as the real events had assuming garnet five and corbeaus problems had been accidental she was an actress of sorts after all they had only corbeaus word about his wrist com he said wistfully i dont suppose we have a clear shot of this frogman lugging out half a dozen liter jugs at any point afraid not mlord he went back and forth with lots of packages and boxes at various times though they could well have been hid inside something gah the acquisition of facts was supposed to clarify thought this was just getting murkier and murkier he asked roic has quaddie security from either of the hostels called yet are dubauer or firka back yet no mlord no calls that is miles called both to crosscheck neither of his two passengers of interest had yet returned it was over four hours after midnight now on the twentyfourhour earthdescended clock that quaddiespace still kept generations after their ancestors unmodified ancestors had departed the home world after hed cut the com miles asked querulously so where the hell have they gone all night roic shrugged if it was t obvious thing i wouldnt look for them to be back till breakfast miles considerately declined to take notice of roics distinct blush our frogman maybe but i guarantee the ba didnt go looking for feminine companionship theres nothing obvious about any of this decisively miles reached for the call pad again instead of chief venn the image of a quaddie woman in a security gray uniform appeared against the dizzying radial background of venns office miles wasnt sure what her rank markings decoded to but she looked sensible middleaged and harried enough to be fairly senior good morning he began politely wheres chief venn sleeping i hope the expression on her face suggested she was going to do her loyal best to keep it that way too at a time like this the poor man had a double shift and a half yester she squinted at him and seemed to come to some recognition oh lord auditor vorkosigan im chief venns thirdshift supervisor teris three is there anything i can do for you night duty officer eh very good yes please i wish to arrange for the detainment and interrogation possibly with fastpenta of a passenger from therudra his names firka is there some criminal charge you wish to file material witness to start i have found reason to suspect he may have something to do with the blood on the floor of the docking bay that started this mess i want very much to find out for sure sir we cant just go around arresting and drugging anyone we please here we need a formal charge and if the transient doesnt volunteer to be interrogated youll have to get an adjudicators order for the fastpenta that problem miles decided he would bounce to sealer greenlaw it sounded like her department all right i charge him with suspected littering incorrect disposal of organics has to be some kind of illegal here despite herself the corner of her mouth twitched its a misdemeanor yes that would do she admitted any pretext that will fix it for you is all right by me i want him and i want him as quickly as you can lay hands on him unfortunately he signed out of his hostel at about seventeenhundred yesterday and hasnt been seen since our security work gang is seriously overstretched here on account of yesterdays unfortunate incident can this wait till morning lord auditor vorkosigan no for a moment he thought she was going to go all bureaucratic on him but after screwing up her lips in a thoughtfully aggravated way for a moment she relented very well ill put out a detention order on him pending chief venns review but youll have to see to the adjudicator as soon as we pick him up thank you i promise you wont have any trouble recognizing him i can download ids and some vid shots to you from here if you wish she allowed as how that would be useful and the task was done miles hesitated mulling over the even more disturbing dilemma of dubauer there was not to be sure any obvious connection between the two problems yet perhaps the interrogation of firka would reveal one leaving venns myrmidon to get on with it miles cut the com he leaned back in his station chair for a moment then brought up the vids of firka and reran them a couple of times so he said after a time how the devil did he keep those long floppy feet out of the blood puddles roic stared over his shoulder floater he finally said hed have to be damned near doublejointed to fold those legs up in one though he looks damned near doublejointed but if firkas toes were as long and prehensile as his fingers suggested might he have been able to manipulate the joystick controls designed for quaddie lower hands with his feet in this new scenario miles neednt picture the person in the floater horsing a heavy body around merely emptying his gurgling liter jugs overboard and supplying some artistic smears with a suitable rag after a few crosseyed moments trying to imagine this miles dumped firkas vid shots into an image manipulator and installed the fellow in a floater the supposed amphibian didnt quite have to be doublejointed or break his legs to fit in assuming his lower body was rather more flexible than miless or roics it folded pretty neatly it looked a bit painful but possible miles stared harder at the image above the vid plate the first question one addressed in describing a person on graf station wasnt man or woman it was quaddie or downsider the very first cut by which one discarded half or more of the possibilities from further consideration he pictured a blond quaddie in a dark jacket speeding up a corridor in a floater he pictured that quaddies belated pursuers whizzing past a shavenheaded downsider in light garb walking the other way that was all it would take in a sufficiently harried moment step out of the floater turn ones jacket inside out stuff the wig in a pocket leave the machine with a couple of others sitting waiting stroll away it would be much harder to work it the other way around of course for a quaddie to impersonate a downsider he stared at firkas hollow darkringed eyes he pulled up a suitable mop of blond ringlets from the imager files and applied it to firkas unhandsome head a fair approximation of the darkeyed barrelchested quaddie with the rivet gun glimpsed for a fraction of a second at fifteen meters range and truth to tell most of miless attention had been on the sparkspitting chattering hotbrasschucking object in his hands had those hands been webbed fortunately he could draw upon a second opinion he called up bel thornes home code from the comconsole unsurprisingly at this ungodly hour the visual didnt come on when nicols sleepy voice answered hello nicol miles vorkosigan here sorry to drag you out of your sleep sack i need to talk to your housemate boot it out and make it come to the vid bels had more sleep than i have by now the visual came up nicol righted herself and drew a fluffy lace garment closer about her with a lower hand this section of the apartment she shared with bel was evidently on the free fall side it was too dim to make out much beyond her floating form she rubbed her eyes what isnt bel with you miless stomach went into free fall for all that the kestrel s grav was in good working order no bel left over six hours ago her frown sharpened the sleep drained from her face to be replaced by alarm but bel didnt come home last night chapter eleven graf station security post one housing most of the security police administrative offices including chief venns lay entirely on the free fall side of the station miles and roic trailed by a flustered quaddie guard from the kestrel s lock floated into the posts radially arranged reception space from which tubular corridors led off at odd angles the place was still nightquiet although shift change was surely due soon nicol had beaten miles and roic there but not by much she was still awaiting the arrival of chief venn under the concerned eye of a uniformed quaddie whom miles took to be the equivalent of a night desk sergeant the quaddie officers wariness increased when they entered and one lower hand moved unobtrusively to touch a pad on his console as if casually and very promptly another armed quaddie officer drifted down from one of the corridors to join his comrade nicol wore a plain blue tshirt and shorts hastily donned with no artistic touches her face was pale with worry her lower hands clenched each other she returned a short grateful nod to miless undervoiced greeting chief venn arrived at last and gave miles a look unloving but resigned he had apparently slept if not enough and had pessimistically dressed for the day no secret hope of getting back into the sleep sack showed in his neat attire he waved off the armed guard and gruffly invited the lord auditor and company to follow him to his office the thirdshift supervisor miles had spoken with a while agomight as well start calling it last night brought coffee bulbs along with her endofshift report meticulously she handed the bulbs out to the downsiders instead of launching them through the air and expecting them to be caught the way she served her crew chief and nicol miles turned the bulbs thermal control to the limit of the red zone and sucked the hot bitter brew with gratitude as did roic this panic may be premature venn began after his own first swallow portmaster thornes nonappearance may have some very simple explanation and what were the top three complicated explanations in venns mind right now the quaddie wasnt sharing but then neither was miles bel had been missing for over six hours ever since it had dismissed its quaddie guard at a bubblecar stop near its home by now this panic might just as easily be posthumous but miles didnt care to say so aloud in front of nicol i am extremely concerned thorne could be asleep somewhere else venn glanced somewhat enigmatically at nicol have you checked with likely friends the portmaster stated explicitly that it was heading home to nicol to rest when it left the kestrel about midnight said miles a wellearned rest by that time i might add your own guards should be able to confirm the exact time of thornes departure from my ship we will of course provide you with another liaison officer to assist you in your inquiries lord vorkosigan venns voice was a little distant buying time to think was how miles read him he might be playing deliberately obtuse as well miles did not mistake him for actually obtuse not when hed cut his sleep shift short and come in for this within little more than minutes i dont want another i want thorne you mislay too damned many downsiders around here its beginning to seem bloody careless miles took a deep breath it has to have crossed your mind by now as it has mine that there were three persons in the line of fire in the hostel lobby yesterday afternoon we all assumed that i was the obvious target what if it was something less obvious what if it was thorne teris three made a stemming motion at him with an upper hand and interjected speaking of that the trace on that hot riveter came in a few hours ago oh good said venn turning to her with relief what have we got it was sold for cash three days back from an engineering supply store near the free fall docks carried out not delivered the purchaser didnt fill out the warranty questionnaire the clerk wasnt sure which customer took it because it was a busy hour quaddie or downsider he couldnt say could have been either it seems and if certain webbed hands had been covered with gloves as in the vid shot they might well have been overlooked venn grimaced his hopes for a break plainly frustrated the night supervisor glanced at miles lord vorkosigan here also called to request that we detain one of the passengers from the rudra find him yet asked miles she shook her head why do you want him asked venn frowning miles repeated his own nights news about his interrogation of the medtechs and finding traces of solians synthesized blood in the rudra s infirmary well that explains why we were having no luck at the station hospitals and clinics grumbled venn miles imagined him totting up his departments wasted quaddiehours from the fruitless search and let the grumble pass i also flushed out one suspect in the course of the conversation with the rudra s tech all circumstantial speculation so far but fastpenta is the drug to cure that miles described the unusual passenger firka his own insufficient but nagging sense of recognition and his suspicions about the creative use of a floater venn looked grimmer and grimmer just because venn reflexively resisted being stampeded by a barrayaran dirtsucker miles decided didnt mean he wasnt listening what he made of it all through his provincial quaddiespace cultural filters was much harder to guess but what about bel nicols voice was tight with suppressed anguish venn was obviously less immune to a plea from a beautiful fellow quaddie he met his night supervisors inquiring look and nodded agreement well whats one more teris three shrugged ill put out a call to all patrollers to start looking for portmaster thorne too as well as the fellow with the webs miles nibbled on his lower lip in worry sooner or later that live cargo secreted aboard the idris must draw the ba back to it belportmaster thorne did get back to you people last night about resealing the idris did it not yes said venn and the night supervisor together venn gave her a short apologetic nod and continued did that betan passenger thorne was trying to help get its animal fetuses taken care of all right dubauer um yes theyre fine for now but ah i think id like to have you pick up dubauer as well as firka why it left its hostel and vanished yesterday evening close to the same time that firka went out and also hasnt returned and dubauer was the third of our little triumvirate of targets yesterday lets just call it protective custody for starters venn screwed up his lips for a moment considering this and eyed miles with shrewd disfavor hed have to be less bright than he appeared not to suspect miles wasnt telling him everything very well he said at last he waved a hand at teris three lets go ahead and collect the whole set right she glanced at the chrono on her left lower wrist its ohsevenhundred shift change presumably shall i stay no no ill take over get the new missingperson traces started then go get some rest venn sighed tonight may be no better the night supervisor gave him an acknowledging thumbsup with both lower hands and slipped out of the little office chamber would you prefer to wait at home venn said suggestively to nicol youd be more comfortable there im sure well undertake to call you as soon as we find your partner nicol took a breath i would rather be here she said sturdily just in case just in case something happens soon ill keep you company miles volunteered for a little while anyway there let venn try to shift his diplomatic mass venn at least managed to get them shifted out of his office by conducting them to a private waiting space advertising it as more undisturbed more undisturbed for venn anyway miles and nicol were left regarding each other in troubled silence what miles most wanted to know was if bel had any other impsec business in train at present that might have impinged unexpectedly last night but he was almost certain nicol knew nothing of bels second source of incomeand risk besides that was wishful thinking if any business had impinged it was most probably the current mess which was now messy enough to raise every hackle miles owned to quivering attention bel had escaped its former career very nearly unscathed despite admiral naismiths sometimeslethal nimbus for the betan herm to have come all this way to have come so close to regaining a private life and future only to have its past reach out like some blind fate and swat it down now miles swallowed guilt and worry and refrained from blurting some illtimed and incoherent apology to nicol something had certainly come upon bel last night but bel was quick and clever and experienced bel could cope bel had always coped before but even the luck you made for yourself ran out sometimes nicol broke the stretched silence by asking some random question of roic about barrayar and the armsman returned clumsy but kind small talk to distract her from her nerves miles glanced at his wrist com was it too early to call ekaterin what the bloody hell was next on his agenda anyway hed planned to spend this morning conducting fastpenta interrogations all the threads hed thought hed had in hand winding in nicely had come to these disturbingly similar cut ends firka vanished dubauer vanished and now bel vanished too and solian dont forget him graf station for all its mazelike nondesign wasnt that big a place were they all sucked into the same oubliette how many oubliettes could the damned labyrinth have to his surprise his frustrated fretting was interrupted by the night supervisor sticking her head in through one of the round doors hadnt she been leaving lord auditor vorkosigan may we see you for a moment she asked in a polite tone he excused himself to nicol and floated after her roic trailing dutifully she led the way back through a corridor to venns nearby office venn was finishing up a comconsole call saying hes here hes hot and hes all over me its your job to handle him he glanced over his shoulder and cut the com above the vid plate miles just glimpsed sealer greenlaws form wrapped in what might be a bathrobe vanish with a sparkle when the door hissed closed again behind them the supervisor turned in midair and stated the patroller that you detailed to escort postmaster thorne last night reports that thorne dismissed him when they got to the joint the what said miles when why she glanced at venn who opened a hand in a goahead gesture the joint is one of our main corridor hubs on the free fall side with a bubblecar transfer station and a public gardena lot of people meet there to eat or whatever after their work shifts thorne evidently encountered garnet five at about ohonehundred coming the other way and went off to have some kind of conversation yes theyre friends i believe venn shifted in what miles recognized after a belated moment as embarrassment and said do you happen to know how good of friends i didnt wish to discuss this in front of that distressed young lady but garnet five is known to um favor exotic downsiders and the betan herm is after all a betan herm simple explanations after all half a dozen mildly outraged arguments coursed through miless mind to be promptly rejected he wasnt supposed to know bel that well not that someone who did know bel would be in the least shocked by venns delicate suggestion no bels sexual tastes might be eclectic but the herm wasnt the sort to betray the trust of a friend had never been we all change you might ask boss watts he temporized he caught roics rolling eye and headjerk in the direction of venns comconsole affixed to the curving office wall miles continued smoothly better still call garnet five if thornes there the mystery is solved if not she might at least know where thorne was headed he tried to decide which would be the worse cause for dismay the memory of the hot rivets parting his hair inclined him to hope for the first result despite nicol venn opened an upper hand in acknowledgment of the point and halfturned to tap out a searchcode on his comconsole with a lower miless heart jumped as garnet fives serene face and crisp voice came on but it was only an answering program venns brows twitched he left a brief request that she contact him at her earliest convenience and cut the com she could just be asleep said the nightshift woman wistfully send a patroller to check said miles a little tightly remembering he was supposed to be a diplomat he added if you please teris three looking as though a vision of her sleep sack was receding before her eyes departed again miles and roic returned to nicol who turned anxious eyes upon them as they floated back into the waiting chamber miles barely hesitated before reporting the patrollers sighting to her can you think of any reason for them to have met he asked her lots she answered without reserve confirming miless secret judgment im sure shed want news from bel about ensign corbeau or anything happening that might affect his chances if she crossed trajectories with bel coming home through the joint shed be sure to grab the chance to try to get some news or she might have just wanted an ear to vent at most of her other friends are not too sympathetic about her romance after the barrayaran attack and the fire all right that might account for the first hour but no more bel was tired then what she turned all four hands out in helpless frustration i cant imagine miless own imagination was all too wildly active need data dammit was becoming his private mantra here he left roic to make more distracting small talk with nicol and feeling a trifle selfish took himself to the side of the chamber to call ekaterin on his wrist com her voice was sleepy but cheerful and she stoutly maintained that shed been awake already and just about to get up they exchanged a few verbal caresses that were no ones business but their own and he described what hed found as a result of the gossip shed collected about solians nosebleeds which seemed to please her greatly so where are you now and what have you had for breakfast she asked breakfast is delayed im at the station security hq he hesitated bel thorne went missing last night and theyre putting together a search for it a little silence greeted this and her return remark was as carefully neutral in tone as his own oh thats very worrisome yes you are keeping roic with you at all times arent you oh yes the quaddies have armed guards trailing me around now too good her breath drew in good the situations getting pretty murky over here i may have to send you home after all we have four more days to decide though well in four more days we can talk about it then between his desire not to alarm her further and hers not to distract him unduly the conversation grew limping and he mercifully tore himself from the calming sound of her voice to let her go bathe and dress and obtain her own breakfast he wondered if he and roic ought after all to escort nicol home and perhaps after that try quartering the station themselves in the hope of some random encounter now there was a tactically bankrupt plan if ever hed evolved one roic would have a fully justifiable painfully polite fit at the suggestion it would feel just like old times but suppose there was some way to make it less random the night supervisors voice floated in from the corridor dear god was the poor woman never to get home to sleep yes theyre in here but dont you think you ought to see the medtech next to i have to see lord vorkosigan miles jerked to full alertness as he identified the sharp breathless female voice as garnet fives the blond quaddie practically tumbled through the round door from the corridor she was trembling and haggard almost greenish an unpleasant contrast to her rumpled carmine doublet her eyes huge and darkringed flicked over the waiting trio nicol oh nicol she flew to her friend in a fierce threearmed hug the immobilized fourth wavering slightly nicol looking bewildered dutifully hugged her back but then pushed her away and asked urgently garnet have you seen bel yes no im not sure this is just insane i thought we were both knocked out together but when i came to bel wasnt there any more i thought bel might have waked up first and gone for help but the security crewshe nodded to her escortsays not havent you heard anything came to waitwho knocked you out where are you hurt i have the most horrible headache it was some sort of drug mist icy cold it didnt smell like anything but it tasted bitter he sprayed it in our faces bel yelled dont breathe garnet but of course had to breathe to yell i felt bel go all limp and then everything sort of drained away when i woke up i was so sick i almost threw up ugh nicol and teris three both grimaced in sympathy miles gathered this was the security womans second time through this recitation but her focus didnt flag garnet miles interjected please take a deep breath calm down and begin at the beginning a patroller reported he saw you and bel somewhere in the joint last night is that correct garnet five scrubbed her pallid face with her upper hands inhaled and blinked a little returning color relieved her graygreenness yes i bumped into bel coming out of the bubblecar stop i wanted to know if bel had askedif youd said anythingif anything had been decided about dmitri nicol nodded in bleak satisfaction i bought us those peppermint teas that bel likes at the kabob kiosk hoping to get it to talk to me but we hadnt been there five minutes when bel went all distracted by this other pair who came in one was a quaddie bel knew from the docks and locks crewbel said he was someone itd been keeping an eye on because it suspected him of handling stolen stuff from the ships the other was this really funnylooking downsider tall lanky fellow with webbed hands and long feet and a big barrel chest looks sort of like his mother might have married the frog prince but the kiss didnt quite work out miles asked garnet five stared why yes well im not sure about the chesthe was wearing this loose flippy capething how did you know this is about the third time hes turned up in this case you might say hes riveted my attention but go on then what i couldnt get bel to stay on the subject bel made me turn around and sit facing the pair so bel could keep its back to them and made me report what they were doing i felt silly like we were playing spies no not playing they had some sort of argument then the quaddie from dock and locks spotted bel and left in a hurry the other fellow the funny downsider left too and then bel insisted on following him and bel left the bistro we both left together i wasnt going to be dumped and besides bel said oh all right come along you may be useful i think the downsider must have been some sort of spacer because he wasnt as awkward as most tourists usually are on the free fall side i didnt think he saw us following but he must have because he wandered down cross corridor weaving in and out of any shops that were open at that hour but not buying anything then he suddenly zigzagged over to the portal to the grav side there werent any floaters in the rack so bel boosted me onto its back and kept on after the fellow he ducked into this utility section where the shops on the next corridorover on the grav sidemove freight and supplies in and out of their back doors he seemed to vanish around a corner but then he just popped out in front of us and waved this little tube in our faces that spit out that nasty spray i was afraid it was a poison and we were both dead but evidently not she hesitated in stricken doubt anyway i woke up where asked miles there well not quite therei was all in a heap stuck to the floor inside a recycle bin behind one of the shops on top of a bundle of cartons it wasnt locked fortunately that horrible downsider couldnt have stuffed me into it if it had been i suppose i had a bad time trying to climb out the stupid lid kept pressing down it almost smashed my fingers i hate gravity bel wasnt anywhere around i looked and called and then i had to walk on three hands back to the main corridor till i could find help i grabbed the first patroller i came to and she brought me right here you must have been out cold for six or seven hours then miles calculated aloud how different were quaddie metabolisms from those of betan herms not to mention body mass and the erratic dosage inhaled by two variously dodging persons you should be seen by a physician right away and get a blood sample drawn while there are still traces of the drug in your system we might be able to identify it and maybe its place of origin if it isnt just a local product the night supervisor endorsed this idea emphatically and permitted the downsider visitors as well as nicol to whom garnet five still clung to trail along as she escorted the shaken blond quaddie to the posts infirmary when miles had assured himself that garnet five had been taken into competent medical hands and plenty of them he turned back to teris three it isnt just my airy theories any more he told her you have a valid assault charge on this firka fellow cant you step up the search oh yes she answered grimly this ones going out on all the com channels now he attacked a quaddie and he released toxic volatiles into the public air miles left the two quaddie women safely ensconced in the security posts infirmary he then leaned on the night supervisor to supply him with the patroller whod brought in garnet five to take him on an inspection of the scene of the crime such as it was the supervisor temporized more delays ensued and miles harassed crew chief venn in a nearly undiplomatic manner but at length he was issued a different quaddie patroller who did indeed escort him and roic to the spot where garnet five had been so uncomfortably cached the dimly lit utility corridor had a flat floor and squaredoff walls and while not exactly cramped shared its cross section with a great deal of duct work which roic had to bend to avoid around an obliquely angled turn they found three quaddies one in a security uniform and two in shorts and shirts working behind a stretchedout plastic ribbon printed with the graf station security logo forensics techs at last and about time the young male rode in a floater broadly stenciled with a graf station technical school identification number an intentlooking middleaged female piloted a floater that bore the mark of one of the station clinics the shortsandshirt man in the tech school floater hovering carefully finished a laser scan for fingerprints along the edge and top of a large square bin sticking out into the corridor at a convenient height to bang the shins of the unwary passerby he moved aside and his colleague moved into place and began to run over the surfaces with what looked to be a standard sort of skin cell and fibercollecting handvac was that the bin where garnet five was hidden miles asked the quaddie officer who was supervising yes miles leaned forward only to be waved back by the intently vacuuming tech after extracting promises to be informed of any interesting crossmatches in the evidence he strolled up and down the corridor instead hands scrupulously tucked in his pockets looking for what cryptic messages written in blood on the walls or in ink or spit or snot or something he checked the floor ceiling and ducts too at belheight and lower angling his head to catch odd reflections nothing were all these doors locked he asked the patroller who shadowed them have they been checked yet could someone have bunged beldragged portmaster thorne inside one youll have to ask the officer in charge sir the quaddie guard replied exasperation leaking into his serviceissue neutral tone i only just got here with you miles stared at the doors and their key pads in frustration he couldnt very well go down the row trying them all not unless the scanner man was finished he returned to the bin finding anything he inquired not the medical quaddie glanced aside at the officer in charge was this area swept before i got here not as far as i know maam said the officer why do you ask miles inquired instantly well there isnt very much i would have expected more try further away suggested the scanner tech she cast him a somewhat bemused look thats not quite the point in any case after you she gestured down the corridor and miles hurriedly confided his worries about the doors to the officer in charge the crew dutifully scanned everything including at miless insistence the ductwork above where the assailant might have braced himself in nearconcealment to drop upon his victims they tried each door fingers tapping impatiently on his trouser seam miles followed them up and down the corridor as they completed their survey all doors proved locked at least they were now one hissed open as they passed and a blinking shopkeeper with legs poked his head through the quaddie officer interrogated him briefly and he in turn helped rouse his neighbors to cooperate in the search the quaddie woman collected lots of little plastic bags of nothing much no unconscious hermaphrodite was discovered in any bin hallway utility closet or shop adjoining the passageway the utility corridor ran for about another ten meters before opening discreetly into a broader crosscorridor lined with shops offices and a small restaurant the scene would have been quieter partway into third shift last night but by no means reliably deserted and just as well lit miles pictured the lanky firka lugging or dragging bels compact but substantial form down the public way wrapped in something for concealment it would almost have to be it would take a strong man to lug bel far or someone in a floater not necessarily a quaddie roic looming at his shoulder sniffed the spicy smells wafting into the corridor into which the eatery cannily vented its bakery ovens reminded miles of his duty to feed his troops troop the disgruntled quaddie guard could fend for himself miles decided the place was small clean and cozy the sort of cheap caf where the local working people ate it was evidently past the breakfast rush and not yet time for lunch because it was occupied only by a couple of legged young men who might be shop assistants and a quaddie in a floater who judging by her crowded tool belt was an electrician on break they stared covertly at the barrayaransmore at tall roic in his notfromaroundhere brownandsilver uniform than at short miles in his unobtrusive gray civvies their quaddie security guard distanced himself slightlywith their party but not of itand ordered coffee in a bulb a legged woman doubled as server and cook assembling food on the plates with practiced speed the spicy breads apparently a specialty of the place appeared handmade the slices of vat protein unexceptionable and the fresh fruit startlingly exquisite miles selected a large golden pear its skin touched with a rose blush unblemished its flesh when he cut into it proved pale perfect and dripping with perfumed juice if only they had more time hed love to sic ekaterin onto the local agriculturewhatever plantlike matrix this had grown from had to have been genetically engineered to thrive in free fall the empires space stations could use such stocksif the komarran traders hadnt snagged them already miless plan to slip seeds into his pocket to smuggle home was thwarted by the fruit being seedless a holovid in the corner with the sound turned low had been mumbling to itself ignored by everyone but a sudden rainbow of blinking lights advertised an official safety bulletin heads turned briefly and miles followed the stares to find being displayed the shots of passenger firka from the rudra s locks that he had downloaded earlier to station security he didnt need the sound to guess the content of the seriouslooking quaddie womans speech that followed suspect wanted for questioning may be armed and dangerous if you see this dubious downsider call this code at once a couple of shots of bel followed as the putative kidnapping victim presumably they were taken from yesterdays interviews after the assassination attempt in the hostel which a newscaster came on to recap can you turn it up miles asked belatedly the newscaster was just winding down even as the caf server aimed her remote her image was replaced with an advertisement for an impressive selection of work gloves oh sorry said the server it was a repeat anyway theyve been showing it every fifteen minutes for the past hour she provided miles with a verbal summary of the alarm which matched miless guess in most particulars so on just how many holovids all over the station was this now appearing it would be an order of magnitude harder for a wanted man to hide with an order of magnitude more pairs of eyes looking for him but was firka himself seeing this if so would he panic becoming more hazardous to anyone who crossed him or perhaps turn himself in claiming it was all some sort of misunderstanding roic studying the vid frowned and drank more coffee the sleepdeprived armsman was holding up all right for the moment but miles figured he would be dragging dangerously by midafternoon miles had an unpleasant sensation of sinking in a quicksand of diversions and losing his grip on his initial mission which had been what oh yes free the fleet he suppressed an internal snarl of screw the fleet where the hells bel but if there was any way to use this disturbing development to pry his ships from quaddie hands it was not apparent to him right now they returned to security post one to find nicol waiting for them in the front reception space with the air of a hungry predator at a water hole she pounced on miles the moment he appeared did you find bel did you see any sign miles shook his head in regret neither hide nor hair well there might be hairswell know when the forensics tech gets her analysis donebut that wont tell us anything we dont already know from garnet fives testimony the truth of which miles didnt doubt i do have a better mental picture of the possible course of events now he wished it made more sense the first partfirka wishing to delay or shake his pursuerswas sensible enough it was the blank afterward that puzzled do you think nicols voice grew smaller he carried bel away to murder someplace else in that case why leave a witness alive he tossed this off instantly for her reassurance upon reflection he found it reassuring too maybe but if not murder what what did bel have or know that someone else might want unless like garnet five bel had come to consciousness on its own and gone off but if bel had wandered away in some state of dazed or sick confusion it should have been picked up by the patrollers or some solicitous fellow stationers by now and if it had gone in hot pursuit of something it should have reported in to me at least dammit if bel was nicol began and stopped a startling crowd heaved through the main entry port and paused for orientation a pair of husky male quaddies in the orange work shirts and shorts of docks and locks managed the two ends of a threemeter length of pipe firka occupied the middle the unhappy downsiders wrists and ankles were lashed to the pipe with swathes of electrical tape bending him in a u with another rectangle of tape plastered across his mouth muffling his moans his eyes were wide and rolled in panic three more quaddies in orange panting and rumpled one with a red bruise starting around his eye bobbed along beside as outriders the work crew took aim and floated with their squirming burden through free fall to fetch up with a thump at the reception desk a quartet of uniformed security quaddies appeared from another portal to gather and stare at this unwilling prize the desk sergeant hit his intercom and lowered his voice to speak into it in a rapid undertone the spokesquaddie for the posse bustled forward a smile of grim satisfaction on his bruised face we caught him for you chapter twelve where miles asked number two freight bay the spokesquaddie answered he was trying to get pramod sixteen herehis nod indicated one of the husky quaddies holding an end of the pipe who nodded back in confirmationto take him out in a pod around the security zone to the galactic jumpship docks so you can add attempted bribery of an airseal tech to violate regs to his list of charges id say ah ha another way to get around bels customs barriers miless mind jumped back to the missing solian pramod told him he was making arrangements and slipped out and called me i rounded up the boys and we made sure hed come along and explain himself to you the spokesquaddie gestured to chief venn whod floated in hastily from the office corridor and was taking in the scene with unsurprised satisfaction the webfingered downsider made a plaintive noise beneath his electrical tape but miles took it more for protest than explanation nicol put in urgently did you see any sign of bel oh hi nicol the spokesquaddie shook his head in regret we asked the fellow but we didnt get an answer if you all dont have better luck with him we have a few more ideas we can try his scowl suggested that these might run to the illicit utilization of airlocks or perhaps innovative applications of freighthandling equipment definitely not covered in the manufacturers warranties i bet we could make him stop screaming and start talking before his air ran out i think we can take it from here thanks chief venn assured him he glanced without favor at firka wriggling on his pole although ill keep your offer in mind do you know portmaster thorne miles asked the docks and locks quaddie do you work together bels one of our best supervisors the quaddie replied about the most sensible downsider weve ever gotten we dont care to lose it eh he gave nicol a nod she ducked her head in mute gratitude the citizens arrest was duly recorded the quaddie patrollers whod assembled looked cautiously over the long squirming captive and elected to take him pole and all for the moment the docks and locks crew with justifiable selfsatisfaction also presented the duffel bag firka had been carrying so here was miless most wanted suspect if not presented on a platter at least en brochette miles itched to tear that tape off his rubbery face and start squeezing sealer greenlaw arrived while this was going forth accompanied by a new quaddie man darkhaired and fitlooking though not especially young he wore neat subdued garb much like that of boss watts and bel but black instead of slate blue she introduced him as adjudicator leutwyn so said leutwyn staring curiously at the tapesecured suspect this is our oneman crime wave do i understand he too came in with the barrayaran fleet no adjudicator said miles he joined the rudra here on graf station at the last minute actually he didnt sign aboard until after the ship had originally been due to leave id very much like to know why i strongly suspect him of synthesizing and planting the blood in the loading bay of attempting to assassinate someone in the hostel lobby yesterday and of attacking garnet five and bel thorne last night garnet five at least had a fairly close look at him and should be able to confirm that identification shortly but by far the most urgent question is what has happened to portmaster thorne hot pursuit of a kidnap victim in danger is sufficient pretext for nonvoluntary penta interrogations in most jurisdictions surely here as well the adjudicator admitted but a fastpenta examination is a delicate undertaking ive found in the half dozen ive monitored that its not nearly the magic wand most people think it is miles cleared his throat in fake diffidence i am tolerably familiar with the techniques adjudicator ive conducted or sat in on over a hundred pentaassisted interrogations and ive had it given to me twice no need to go into his idiosyncratic drug reaction that had made those two events such dizzyingly surreal and notably uninformative occasions oh said the quaddie adjudicator sounding impressed despite himself possibly especially with that last detail im keenly aware of the need to keep the examination from being a mob scene but you also need the right leading questions i believe i have several venn put in we havent even processed the suspect yet me i want to see what hes got in that bag the adjudicator nodded yes carry on chief venn id like further clarification if i can get it mob scene or no they all followed the quaddie patrollers who maneuvered the unfortunate firka pole and all into a back chamber a pair of the patrollers after first clapping proper restraints around the bony wrists and ankles recorded retinal patterns and took laser scans of the fingers and palms miles had one curiosity satisfied when they also pulled off the prisoners soft boots the fingerlength toes prehensile or nearly so flexed and stretched revealing wide rosecolored webs between the quaddies scanned them tooof course the quaddies would routinely scan all four extremitiesthen cut through the bulky lashings of tape meanwhile another patroller assisted by venn emptied and inventoried the duffel they removed an assortment of clothes mostly in dirty wads to find a large new chefs knife a stunner with a dubiously corroded discharged power pack but no stunner permit a long crowbar and a leather folder full of small tools the folder also contained a receipt for an automated hot riveter from a graf station engineering supply store complete with incriminating serial numbers it was at this point that the adjudicator stopped looking so carefully reserved and started to look grim instead when the patroller held up something that looked at first glance to be a scalp but when shaken out proved a brassy short blond wig of no particular quality the evidence seemed almost redundant of more interest to miles was not one but a dozen sets of identifying documentation half of them proclaimed their bearers to be natives of jacksons whole the others were from local space systems all adjoining the hegen hub a wormholerich planetpoor system that was one of the barrayaran empires nearest and most strategically important nexus neighbors jump routes from barrayar to both jacksons whole and the cetagandan empire passed via komarr and the independent buffer polity of pol through the hub venn ran the handful of ids through a holovid station affixed to the chambers curving wall his frown deepening miles and roic both maneuvered to watch over his shoulder so venn growled after a bit which one really is the fellow two sets of documentation for firka included physical vid shots of a man very different in appearance from their moaning captive a big bulky but perfectly normal human male from either jacksons whole no house affiliation or aslund another hegen hub neighbor depending on whichif eitherid was to be believed yet a third firka id the one the present firka seemed to have used to travel from tau ceti to graf station portrayed the prisoner himself finally his vid shots also matched up with the ids of a person named russo gupta also hailing from jacksons whole and lacking a proper house affiliation that name face and associated retina scans came up again on a jumpship engineers license that miles recognized as originating from a certain jacksonian organization of the subeconomy he had dealt with in his covert ops days judging from the long file of dates and customs stamps appended it had passed as genuine elsewhere and recently a record of his travels good miles pointed that is almost certainly a forgery the clustering quaddies looked genuinely shocked greenlaw said a false engineers license that would be unsafe if its from the place i think you could get a false neurosurgeons license to go with it or any other job you cared to pretend to have without going through all that tedious training and testing and certification or in this case really havenow there was a disturbing thought although onthejob apprenticeship and selfteaching might cover some of the gaps over time someone had been clever enough to modify that hot riveter after all under no circumstances could this pale lanky mutie pass for a stout pleasantly ugly redhaired woman named either grace nevatta of jacksons wholeno house affiliationor louise latour of pol depending on which set of ids she favored nor for a short headwired mahoganyskinned jumpship pilot named hewlet who are all these people venn muttered in aggravation why dont we just ask suggested miles firkaor guptahad finally stopped struggling and just lay in midair nostrils flexing with his panting above the blue rectangle of tape over his mouth the quaddie patroller finished recording his last scans and reached for a corner of the tape then paused uncertainly im afraid this is going to hurt a bit hes probably sweated enough underneath the tape to loosen it miles offered take it in one quick jerk itll hurt less in the long run thats what id want if i were him a muffled mew of disagreement from the prisoner turned into a shrill scream as the quaddie followed this plan all right so the frog prince hadnt sweated as much around the mouth as miles had guessed it was still better to have the damned tape off than on but despite the noises hed been making the prisoner did not follow up this liberation of his lips with outraged protests swearing complaints or raving threats he just kept panting his eyes were peculiarly glassya look miles recognized of a man whod been wound up far too tight for far too long bels loyal stevedores might have roughed him up a bit but he hadnt acquired that look in the brief time hed been in quaddie hands chief venn held up a double handful left and left of ids before the prisoners eyes all right which one are you really you may as well tell us the truth well be crosschecking it all anyway with surly reluctance the prisoner muttered im guppy guppy russo gupta yeah who are these others absent friends miles wasnt quite sure if venn had caught the intonation he put in dead friends yeah that too guppygupta stared away into a distance miles calculated as lightyears venn looked alarmed miles was torn between anxiety to proceed and an intense desire to sit down and study the place and date stamps on all those ids real and fake before decanting gupta a world of revelation lay therein he was fairly sure but greater urgencies drove the sequencing now where is portmaster thorne miles asked i told those thugs before i never heard of him thorne is the betan herm you sprayed with knockout mist last night in a utility passage off cross corridor along with a blond quaddie woman named garnet five the surly look deepened never seen either of em venn turned his head and nodded to a patroller who flitted off a few moments later she returned through one of the chambers other portals ushering garnet five garnets color looked vastly better now miles was relieved to note and she had obviously managed to obtain whatever female grooming equipment she used to touch herself back up to her highvisibility norm ah she said cheerfully you caught him wheres bel venn inquired formally is this the downsider who committed chemical assault on you and the portmaster and released illicit volatiles into the public atmosphere last night oh yes said garnet five i couldnt possibly mistake him i mean look at the webs gupta clenched his lips his fists and his feet but further pretense was clearly futile venn lowered his voice to a quite nicely menacing official growl gupta where is portmaster thorne i dont know where the blighted nosy herm is i left it in the bin right next to hers it was all right then i mean it was breathing and all they both were i made sure the herms probably still sleeping it off in there no said miles we checked all the bins in the passage the portmaster was gone well i dont know where it went after that would you be willing to repeat that assertion under fastpenta and clear yourself of a kidnapping charge venn inquired cannily angling for a voluntary interrogation guptas rubbery face set and his eyes shifted away cant im allergic to the stuff is that so said miles lets just check shall we he dug in his trouser pocket and drew out the strip of test patches hed borrowed earlier from the kestrel s impsec supplies in anticipation of just such an opportunity granted he hadnt anticipated the added urgency of bels alarming vanishing act he held up the strip and explained to venn and the adjudicator who was monitoring all this with a judicial frown securitygrade penta allergy skin test if the subject has any of the six kinds of artificially induced anaphylaxes or even a mild natural allergy the welt pops right up by way of reassurance to the quaddie officials he peeled off one of the burrlike patches and slapped it on the back of his own wrist displaying it with a heartening wriggle of his fingers the sleight of hand was sufficient that no one except the prisoner protested when he leaned over and pressed another to guptas arm gupta let out a yowl of horror that won him only stares he reduced it to a pitiable whimper under the bemused eyes of the onlookers miles peeled off his own patch to reveal a distinct reddish prickle as you see i do have a slight endogenous sensitivity he waited a few moments longer to drive home the point then reached over and peeled the patch off gupta the rather sickly naturalmushrooms were natural rightskin tone was unaffected venn getting into the rhythm of the thing like an old impsec hand leaned toward gupta and said thats two lies so far then you can stop lying now or you can stop lying shortly either way will do he raised narrowed eyes to his fellow quaddie official adjudicator leutwyn do you rule that we have sufficient cause for an involuntary chemically assisted interrogation of this transient the adjudicator looked less than wholly enthusiastic but he replied in light of his admitted connection to the worrisome disappearance of a valued station employee yes there can be no question i do remind you that subjecting detainees in your charge to unnecessary physical discomfort is against regs venn glanced at gupta hanging miserably in air how can he be uncomfortable hes in free fall the adjudicator pursed his lips transient gupta aside from your restraints are you in any special discomfort at this time do you require food drink or downsider sanitary facilities gupta jerked his wrists against their soft bonds and shrugged naw well yes my gills are getting dry if youre not gonna let me loose i need somebody to spray them the stuffs in my bag this the female quaddie patroller held out what appeared to be a perfectly ordinary plastic sprayer of the sort that miles had seen ekaterin use to mist some of her plants she wriggled it and it gurgled whats in it asked venn suspiciously water mostly and a bit of glycerin said gupta go ahead and check it said venn aside to his patroller she nodded and floated out gupta watched her depart with some mistrust but no particular alarm transient gupta it appears youre going to be our guest for a while said venn if we remove your restraints are you going to give us any trouble or are you going to behave yourself gupta was silent a moment then vented an exhausted sigh ill behave much good itll do me either way a patroller floated forward and unshackled the prisoners wrists and ankles only roic seemed less than pleased with this unnecessary courtesy tensing with a hand on a wall grip and one foot planted to a bit of bulkhead not occupied by equipment ready to launch himself forward but gupta only chafed his wrists and bent to rub his ankles and looked grudgingly grateful the patroller returned with the bottle handing it to her chief the labs chemical sniffer says its inert should be safe she reported very well venn pitched the bottle to gupta who despite his odd long hands caught it readily with little downsider clumsiness a fact miles was sure the quaddie noted um gupta gave the crowd of onlookers a slightly embarrassed glance and hitched up his loose poncho he stretched and inhaled and the ribs on his big barrel chest drew apart flaps of skin parted to reveal red slashes the substance beneath seemed spongy rippling in the misting like densely laid feathers god almighty he really does have gills under there presumably the bellowslike movement of the chest helped pump water through when the amphibian was immersed dual systems so did he hold his breath or did his lungs shut down involuntarily by what mechanism was his blood circulation switched from one oxygenating interface to the other gupta pumped the bottle and sprayed mist into the red slits handing it back and forth from right side to left and seemed to draw some comfort thereby he sighed and the slits closed back down his chest appearing merely ridged and scarred he smoothed the drifting poncho back into place where are you from miles couldnt help asking gupta grew surly again guess well jacksons whole by the weight of the evidence but which house made you ryoval bharaputra another and were you a oneoff or part of a set firstgeneration gengineered or from a selfreproducing line of of water people guptas eyes widened in surprise you know jacksons whole lets say ive had several painfully educational visits there the surprise became edged with faint respect and a certain lonely eagerness house dyan made me i was part of a set oncewe were an underwater ballet troupe garnet five blurted in unflattering astonishment you were a dancer the prisoner hunched his shoulders no they made me to be submersible stage crew but house dyan suffered a hostile takeover by house ryovaljust a few years before baron ryoval was assassinated pity that didnt happen sooner ryoval broke up the troupe for other um tasks and decided he had no alternate use for me so i was out of a job and out of protection could have been worse he mighta kept me i drifted around and took what tech jobs i could get one thing led to another in other words gupta had been born into jacksonian technoserfdom and dumped out on the street when his original ownercreators had been engulfed by their vicious commercial rival given what miles knew of the late unsavory baron ryoval guptas fate was perhaps happier than that of his mercohort by the known date of ryovals death that last vague remark about things leading to things covered at least five years maybe as many as ten miles said thoughtfully you werent shooting at me at all yesterday then were you nor at portmaster thorne which left gupta blinked at him oh thats where i saw you before sorry no his brow corrugated so what were you doing there then youre not one of the passengers are you another stationer squatter like that officious bloody betan no my name ishe made an instant almost subliminal decision to drop all the honorificsmiles i was sent out to look after barrayaran concerns when the quaddies impounded the komarran fleet oh gupta grew uninterested what the devil was keeping that fastpenta miles softened his voice so what happened to your friends guppy that fetched the amphibians attention again doublecrossed subjected injected infected rejected we were all taken in damned cetagandan bastard that wasnt the deal something inside miles went on overdrive heres the connection finally his smile grew charming sympathetic and his voice softened further tell me about the cetagandan bastard guppy the hovering mob of quaddie listeners had stopped rustling even breathing more quietly roic had drawn back to a shadowed spot opposite miles gupta glanced around at the graf stationers and at miles and himself the only legged persons now in view in the center of the circle whats the use the tone was not a wail of despair but a bitter query i am barrayaran i have a special stake in cetagandan bastards the cetagandan ghemlords left five million of my grandfathers generation dead behind them when they finally gave up and pulled out of barrayar i still have his bag of ghemscalps for certain kinds of cetagandans i might know a use or two youd find interesting the prisoners wandering gaze snapped to his face and locked there for the first time hed won guptas total attention for the first time hed hinted he might have something that guppy really wanted wanted burned for lusted for desired with mad obsessive hunger his glassy eyes were ravenous for maybe revenge maybe justicein any case blood but the frog prince clearly lacked personal expertise in retribution the quaddies didnt deal in blood barrayarans had a more sanguinary reputation which for the first time this mission might actually prove some use gupta took a long breath i dont know what kind this one was is he was like nothing id ever met before cetagandan bastard he melted us tell me miles breathed everything why you he came to us through our usual cargo agents we thought it would be all right we had a ship grasgrace and firka and hewlet and me had this ship hewlet was our pilot but grasgrace was the brains me i had a knack for fixing things firka kept the books and fixed regs and passports and nosy officials grasgrace and her three husbands we called us we were a collection of rejects but maybe we added up to one real spouse for her i dont know one for all and all for one because it was damn sure that a crew of refugee jacksonians without a house or a baron wasnt going to get a break from anyone else in the nexus gupta was getting wound up in his story miles listening with utmost care prayed venn would have the sense not to interrupt ten people hovered around them in this chamber yet he and gupta mutually hypnotized by the increasing intensity of his confession might almost be floating in a bubble of time and space altogether removed from this universe so where did you pick up this cetagandan and his cargo anyway gupta glanced up startled you know about the cargo if its the same one now aboard the idris yes ive had a look i found it rather disturbing whats he got in there really i only saw the outsides id rather not say at this time what did he miles elected not to go into the confusions of ba gender just now tell you it was gengineered mammals not that we asked questions we got paid extra for not asking questions that was the deal we thought and if there was anything that the ethically elastic inhabitants of jacksons whole held nearly sacred it was the deal a good bargain was it looked like two or three more runs like that we could have paid off the ship and owned it free and clear miles took leave to doubt that if the crew was in debt for their jumpship to a typical jacksonian financial house but perhaps guppy and his friends had been terminal optimists or terminally desperate the gig looked easy enough just take a little mixedfreight run through the fringes of the cetagandan empire we jumped in through the hegen hub via vervain and skirted round to rho ceta all those arrogant suspicious bastard inspectors who boarded us at the jump points turned up nothing to hold against us though theyd have liked to because there wasnt anything aboard but what our filed manifest said gave old firka a good chuckle till we were heading out for the last jumps for rho ceta through those empty buffer systems just before the route splits to komarr we made one little midspace rendezvous there that didnt appear on our flight plan what kind of ship did you rendezvous with jumpship or just a local space crawler could you tell for sure or was it disguised or camouflaged jumpship i dont know what else it might have really been it looked like a cetagandan government ship it had lots of fancy markings anyway not big but fastfresh and classy the cetagandan bastard moved his cargo all by himself with float pallets and hand tractors but he sure didnt waste any time the moment the locks were closed they went off where could you tell well hewlet said they had an odd trajectory it was that uninhabited binary system a few jumps out from rho ceta i dont know if you know it miles nodded in encouragement they went inbound deeper into the grav well maybe they were planning to swing around the suns and approach one of the jump points from a disguised trajectory i dont know that would make sense given all the rest of it just the one passenger yeah tell me more about him not much to tellthen he kept to himself ate his own rations in his own cabin he didnt talk to me at all he had to talk to firka on account of firka was fixing his manifest by the time we reached the first barrayaran jump point inspection it had a whole new provenance he was somebody else by then too ker dubauer venn twitched at this first mention of the familiar name in his hearing and opened his mouth and inhaled but closed it again without diverting guppys flow the unhappy amphibian was in full spate now pouring out his troubles not yet he wasnt he musta become dubauer during his layover on the komarran transfer station i figure i didnt track him by his identity anyway he was too good for that fooled you barrayarans didnt he indeed an apparent cetagandan agent of the highest caliber had passed through barrayars key nexus trade crossroad like so much smoke impsec would have a seizure when this report arrived how did you follow him here then the first smilelike expression miles had seen on the rubbery face ghosted across guptas lips i was ships engineer i tracked him by his cargos mass it was kind of distinctive when i went to look later the ghastly smile faded into a black frown when we dumped him and his pallets off on the komarran transfer stations loading bay he seemed happy downright cordial he went around to each of us for the first time and gave us our noproblems bonuses personally he shook hewlets and firkas hands he asked to see my webbing so i spread my fingers for him and he leaned over and gripped my arm and seemed real interested and thanked me he gave grasgrace a pat on her cheek and smiled at her in this sappy way he smirked as he touched her knowing since she was holding the bonus chit in her hand she sort of smiled back and didnt deck him though i could see it was a near thing and then we bailed out hewlet and i wanted to take station leave and spend some of our bonus but grasgrace said we could party later and firka said the barrayaran empire wasnt a healthy place for the likes of us to linger in a distracted laugh that had nothing to do with humor puffed from his lips so that startling scream when miles had touched the test patch to guppys skin hadnt been overreaction exactly it had been a flashback miles suppressed a shudder sorry sorry it was six days out from komarr past the jump to pol before the fevers began grasgrace guessed it first from the way it started she always was the quickest of us four little pink wheals like some kind of bug bites on the backs of hewlet and firkas hands on her cheek on my arm where the cetagandan bastard had touched me they swelled up to the size of eggs and throbbed though not as much as our heads it only took an hour my head hurt so bad i could hardly see and grasgrace who wasnt doing any better helped me to my cabin sos i could get into my tank tank id rigged up a big tank in my cabin with a lid i could lock down from the inside because the gravity on that old ship wasnt any too reliable it was really comfortable to rest in my own kind of water bed i could stretch all the way out and turn around good filtration system on the water nice and clean and extra oxygen sparkling up through it from a bubbler id rigged all pretty with colored lights and music i miss my tank he heaved a sigh you appear to have lungs as well do you hold your breath underwater or what gupta shrugged i have these extra sphincter muscles in my nose and ears and throat that shut down automatically when my breathing switches over thats always kind of an awkward moment the switch my lungs dont always seem to want to stop or start again sometimes but i cant stay in my tank forever or id end up pissing in the water i breathe thats what happened then i floated in my tank for hours im not sure how many i dont think i was quite in my right mind i hurt so bad but then i had to piss really bad so i had to get out i damn near passed out when i stood i threw up on the floor but i could walk i made it to my cabins head finally the ship was still running i could feel the right vibrations through my feet but it had gone all quiet nobody talking or arguing or snoring no music no laughing i was cold and wet i put on a robeit was one of hers that grasgrace had given me because she claimed being fat made her hot and i was always too cold she said it was because my designers gave me frog genes for all i know that might be true i found her body he stopped the lightyearsgone look in his eyes intensified about five steps down the corridor at least i thought it was her it was her braid floating on the at least i thought it was a body the size of the puddle seemed about right it stank like what kind of helldisease liquefies bones he inhaled and continued unsteadily firka had made it to the infirmary for all the good it had done him he was all flaccid like he was deflating and dripping over the side of the bunk he stank worse than grasgrace and he was steaming hewletwhat was left of himwas in his pilots chair in nav and com i dont know why he crawled up there maybe it was a comfort to him pilots are strange that way his pilots headset kind of held his skull braced but his face his features they were just sliding off i thought he might have been trying to send an emergency message maybe help us biocontamination aboard but maybe not because nobody ever came later i thought maybe hed sent too much and the rescuers stayed away on purpose why should the good citizens risk anything for us just jacksonian smuggler scum better off dead saves the trouble and expense of prosecution eh he looked at no one now miles feared he was falling silent spent but there was so much more desperately important to know he dared to play out a leadso no shit there you were trapped on a drifting ship with three dissolving corpses including a dead jump pilot how did you get away the ship the ship was no good to me now not without hewlet and the others let the bastard financers have it biocontamination and all murdered dreams but i figured i was everybodys heir by that time nobody had anybody else not to speak to i wouldve wanted them to have my stuff if it had been the other way around i went round and collected everybodys movables spare cash credit chitsfirka had a huge cache he would and he had all our doctored ids grasgrace well she probably gave hers away or lost it gambling or spent it on toys or let it slip through her fingers somehow which made her smarter than firka in the long run hewlet i guess hed drunk most of his but there was enough enough to travel to the ends of the nexus if i was clever about it enough to catch up with that cetagandan bastard stern chase or no with that heavy cargo i didnt figure hed be traveling all that fast i took it all and loaded it in an escape capsule decontaminated it all and me a dozen times first trying to get that horrible death smell off i wasnt i wasnt at my best and brightest i dont think but i wasnt that far gone once i was in the capsule it wasnt so hard theyre designed to get injured idiots to safety automatically following the local space beacons i got picked up three days later by a passing ship and told a bullshit story about our ship coming apartthey believed that when they looked up the jacksonian registry id stopped crying by then tears were glistening at the corners of his eyes now didnt mention the bioshit or theyd have jugged me good they dropped me at the nearest polian jump point station from there i slipped away from the safety investigators and got me on the first ship i could bound for komarr i tracked the cetagandan bastards cargo by its mass to the komarran trade fleet that had just pulled out ran a search to find a route that would catch me up to it at the first possible place which was here he stared around blinking at his quaddie audience as if surprised to find them all still in the room how did lieutenant solian get sucked into it miles had been waiting with nerves stretched to twanging to ask that one i thought i could just lie in wait and ambush the cetagandan bastard as soon as he came off the idris but he never came off stayed holed up in his cabin i guess smart scum i couldnt get through customs or the ships securityi wasnt a registered passenger or a guest of one though i tried to butter up a few scared the shit out of me when the fellow i tried to bribe to get me on board threatened to turn me in then i got smart and got me a berth on the rudra to at least get me legal entry past customs into those loading bays and to be sure id be able to follow along if the fleet pulled out suddenly which it was overdue to do by then i wanted to kill him myself for grasgrace and firka and hewlet but if he was going to get away i thought if i turned him in to the barrayarans as a cetagandan spy maybe something interesting might happen anyway something he wouldnt like i didnt want to leave my trace on the vid call record so i caught the idris s security officer in person when he was out in the loading bay tipped him off i wasnt sure if he believed me or not but i guess he went to check gupta hesitated he musta run into the cetagandan bastard im sorry im afraid i got him melted like grasgrace and his litany ended in a shaken gulp is that when solian had the nose bleed when you were tipping him off miles asked gupta stared what are you some kind of psychic check why the faked blood on the docking bay floor well id heard the fleet was pulling out they were saying that the poor bugger id got melted was supposed to have deserted and they were writing him off just like like he didnt have a house or a baron to put up any stake for him and nobody cared but i was afraid the cetagandan bastard would pull another midspace transfer and id be stuck on the rudra and hed get away i thought it would focus attention back on the idris and what might be on it i didnt dream those military morons would attack the quaddie station there were concatenating circumstances miles said primly made conscious for the first time in what seemed a small eternity of evoked horrors of the hovering quaddie officialdom you certainly triggered events but you could not possibly have anticipated them he too blinked and looked around er did you have any questions chief venn venn was giving him a most peculiar stare he shook his head slowly from side to side uh a young quaddie patroller miles had barely noticed enter during guppys urgent soliloquy held out a small glittering object to his chief i have the fastpenta dose you ordered sir venn took it and gazed over at adjudicator leutwyn leutwyn cleared his throat remarkable i do believe lord auditor vorkosigan that is the first time ive ever seen a fastpenta interrogation conducted without the fastpenta miles glanced at guppy curled around himself in air shivering a little smears of water still glistened at the corners of his eyes he really wanted to tell somebody his story hes been dying to for weeks there was just no one in the entire nexus he could trust still isnt gulped the prisoner dont get a swelled head barrayaran i know nobodys on my side but i missed my one shot and he saw me i was safe when he thought i was melted like the others im a dead frog now one way or another but if i cant take him with me maybe somebody else can chapter thirteen chief venn said so this cetagandan bastard gupta here is raving about that he says killed three of his friends and maybe your lieutenant solianyou really think this is the same as the betan transient dubauer that you wanted us to pick up last night so is he a herm or a man or what or what answered miles my medical people established from a blood sample i accidentally collected yesterday that dubauer is a cetagandan ba the ba are neither male female nor hermaphrodite but a genderless servant caste i guess is the best word of the cetagandan haut lords more specifically of the haut ladies who run the star crche at the core of the celestial garden the imperial residence on eta ceta who almost never left the celestial garden with or without their ba servitors so whats this ba doing way out here eh miles hesitated then went on this ba appears to be conducting a cargo of a thousand of what i suspect are the latest genetically modified haut fetuses in uterine replicators i dont know where i dont know why and i dont know who for but if guppys telling us the straight story the ba has killed four people including our missing security officer and tried to kill guppy to keep its secret and cover its tracks at least four people greenlaws expression had grown stiff with dismay venn regarded gupta frowning i guess wed better put out a public arrest call on dubauer then too no miles cried in alarm venn raised his brows at him miles explained hastily were talking about a possible trained cetagandan agent who may be carrying sophisticated bioweapons its already extremely stressed by the delays into which this dispute with the trade fleet has plunged it its just discovered its made one bad mistake at least because guppy here is still alive i dont care how superhuman it is it has to be rattled by now the last thing you want to do is send a bunch of feckless civilians up against it nobody should even approach the ba who doesnt know exactly what theyre doing and what theyre facing and your people brought this creature here onto my station believe me if any of my people had known what the ba was before this it would never have made it past komarr the trade fleet are dupes innocent carriers im sure well he wasnt that surechecking that airy assertion was going to be a highpriority problem for counterintelligence back home carriers greenlaw echoed looking hard at guppy all the quaddies in the room followed her stare could this transient still be carrying that whatever it was infection miles took a breath possibly but if he is its too damned late already guppy has been running all over graf station for days now hell if hes infectious hes just spread a plague along a route through the nexus touching half a dozen planets and me and my fleet and maybe ekaterin too i see two points of hope one by guppys testimony the ba had to administer the thing by actual touch the patrollers whod handled the prisoner looked apprehensively at each other and secondly miles went on if the disease or poison is something bioengineered by the star crche its likely to be highly controlled possibly deliberately selflimiting and selfdestructing the haut ladies dont like to leave their trash lying around for anyone to pick up but i got better cried the amphibian yes said miles why obviously something in your unique genetics or situation either defeated the thing or held it at bay long enough to keep you alive past its period of activity putting you in quarantine is about useless by now but the next highest priority after nailing the ba has got to be running you through the medical wringer to see if what you have or did can save anyone else miles drew breath may i offer the facilities of the prince xav our medical people do have some specific training in cetagandan biothreats guppy blurted to venn in panic dont give me to them theyll dissect me venn who had brightened at this offer shot the prisoner an exasperated look but greenlaw said slowly i know something of the ghem and the haut but ive never heard of these ba or the star crche adjudicator leutwyn added warily cetagandans of any stripe havent much come in my way greenlaw continued what makes you think their work is so safe so restricted safe no controlled maybe how far did he need to back up his explanation to make the dangers clear to them it was vital that the quaddies be made to understand and believe the cetagandans have this twotiered aristocracy that is the bafflement of noncetagandan military observers at the core are the haut lords who are in effect one giant genetics experiment in producing the posthuman race this work is conducted and controlled by the haut women geneticists of the star crche the center where all haut embryos are created and modified before being sent back to their haut constellationsclans parentson the outlying planets of the empire unlike most prior historical versions of this sort of thing the haut ladies didnt start by assuming theyd reached the perfected end already they do not at present believe themselves to be done tinkering when they arewell who knows what will happen what are the goals and desires going to be of the true posthuman even the haut ladies dont try to secondguess their greatgreatgreatwhatever grandchildren i will say it makes it uncomfortable to have them as neighbors didnt the haut try to conquer you barrayarans once asked leutwyn not the haut the ghemlords the buffer race if you will between the haut and the rest of humanity i suppose you could think of the ghem as the hauts bastard children except that they arent bastards in that sense anyway the haut leak selected genetic lines into the ghem via trophy haut wivesits a complicated system but the ghemlords are the military arm of the empire always anxious to prove their worth to their haut masters the ghem ive seen said venn we get them through here now and then i though the haut were well sort of degenerate aristocratic parasites afraid to get their hands dirty they dont work he gave a very quaddie sniff of disdain or fight you have to wonder how long the ghemsoldiers will put up with them on the surface the haut appear to dominate the ghem through pure moral suasion overawe by their beauty and intelligence and refinement and by making themselves the source of all kinds of status rewards culminating in the haut wives all this is true but beneath that it is strongly suspected that the haut hold a biological and biochemical arsenal that even the ghem find terrifying i havent heard of anything like that being used said venn in a tone of skepticism oh you bet you havent why didnt they use it on you barrayarans back then if they had it said greenlaw slowly that is a problem much studied at certain levels of my government first it would have alarmed the neighborhood bioweapons arent the only kind the cetagandan empire apparently wasnt ready to face a posse of people scared enough to combine to burn off their planets and sterilize every living microbe more importantly we think it was a question of goals the ghemlords wanted the territory and the wealth the personal aggrandizement that would have followed successful conquest the haut ladies just werent that interested not enough to waste their resourcesnot resources of weapons per se but of reputation secrecy of a silent threat of unknown potency our intelligence services have amassed maybe half a dozen cases in the past thirty years of suspected use of hautstyle bioweapons and in every instance it was a cetagandan internal matter he glanced at greenlaws intensely disturbed face and added in what he hoped didnt sound like hollow reassurance there was no spread or biobacksplash from those incidents that we know of venn looked at greenlaw so do we take this prisoner to a clinic or to a cell greenlaw was silent for a few moments then said graf station university clinic straight to the infectious isolation unit i think we want our best experts in on this and as quickly as possible gupta objected but ill be an open target i was hunting the cetagandan bastardnow heit whateverwill be hunting me i agree with this evaluation miles said quickly wherever you take gupta the location should be kept absolutely secret the fact that hes even been taken into custody should be suppresseddear god this arrest hasnt gone out on your news services already has it piping the word of guptas location to every nook of the station not formally said venn uneasily it scarcely mattered miles supposed dozens of quaddies had seen the webfingered man brought in including everybody that bels crew of roustabouts had passed on the way the docks and locks quaddies would certainly brag of their catch to everyone they knew the gossip would be all over i strongly urgebegyou to put out word of his daring escape then complete with followup bulletins asking all the citizens to keep an eye out for him again the ba had killed four to keep its secretwould it be willing to kill fifty thousand a disinformation campaign greenlaws lips pursed in repugnance the lives of everyone on the station might well depend on it secrecy is your best hope of safety and guptas after that guards my people are already spread to their limit venn protested he gave greenlaw a beseeching look miles opened a hand in acknowledgment not patrollers guards who know what theyre doing trained in biodefense procedures well have to draw on union militia specialists said greenlaw in a decisive tone ill put in the request but it will take them some time to get here in the meanwhile said miles i can loan you some trained personnel venn grimaced i have a detention block full of your personnel im not much impressed with their training miles suppressed a wince not them military medical corps i will consider your offer said greenlaw neutrally some of vorpatrils senior medical men must have some expertise in this area if you wont let us take gupta out to the safety of one of our vessels please let them come aboard the station to help you greenlaws eyes narrowed all right we will accept up to four such volunteers unarmed under the direct supervision and command of our own medical experts agreed said miles instantly it was the best compromise he was likely to get for the moment the medical end of this problem terrifying as it was would have to be left to the specialists it was out of miless range of expertise catching the ba before it could do any more damage now the haut are not immune to stunner fire i recommendhe could not order he could not demand most of all he could not screamyou quietly inform all of your patrollers that the badubauerbe stunned on sight once its down we can sort things out at our leisure venn and greenlaw exchanged looks with the adjudicator leutwyn said in a constricted voice it would be against regs to so ambush the suspect if it is not in process of a crime resisting arrest or fleeing bioweapons muttered venn the adjudicator swallowed make damned sure your patrollers dont miss their first shot your ruling is noted sir and if the ba stayed out of sight which it had certainly managed to do for most of the past twentyfour hours what did the ba want its cargo freed and guppy dead before he could talk presumably what did the ba know at this point or not know it didnt know that miles had identified its cargo did it where the hell is bel ambush miles echoed there are two places where you could set up an ambush for the ba wherever you take guppyor better still wherever the ba believes youve taken guppy if you dont want to put it about that hes escaped then take him to a concealed location with a second less secret one set up for bait then another trap at the idris if dubauer calls in requesting permission to go aboard again which the last time we met it fully intended to do you should grant the petition then nail it as it enters the loading bay thats what i was going to do put in gupta in a resentful voice if you people had just let well enough alone this could have been all over by now miles privately agreed but it would hardly do to say so out loud someone might point out just who had put on the pressure for guptas arrest greenlaw was looking grimly thoughtful i wish to inspect this alleged cargo it is possible that it violates enough regs to merit impoundment quite separately from the issue of its carrier ship the adjudicator cleared his throat that could grow legally complex sealer more complex cargoes not offloaded for transfer even if questionable are normally allowed to pass through without legal comment theyre considered to be the territorial responsibility of the polity of registration of the carrier unless they are an imminent public danger a thousand fetuses if thats what they are constitute what menace impounding them could prove a horrific danger miles thought it would certainly lock cetagandan attention upon quaddiespace speaking from both historical and personal experience this was not necessarily a good thing i want to confirm this for myself too said venn and give my guards their orders in person and figure out where to place my sharpshooters and you need me along to get into the cargo hold miles pointed out greenlaw said no just your security codes miles smiled blandly at her her jaw tightened after a moment she growled very well lets go venn you too adjudicator and she sighed briefly you lord auditor vorkosigan gupta was wrapped in biobarriers by the two quaddies who had handled him beforea logical choice if not much to their liking they donned wraps and gloves themselves and towed him out without allowing him to touch anything else the amphibian suffered this without protest he looked utterly exhausted garnet five left with nicol for nicols apartment where the two quaddie women planned to support each other while awaiting word of bel call me nicol pleaded in an undervoice to miles as they floated out miles nodded his promise and prayed silently that it would not prove to be one of those hard calls his brief vid call out to the prince xav and admiral vorpatril was hard enough vorpatril was almost as white as his hair by the time miles had finished bringing him up to date he promised to expedite a selection of medical volunteers at emergency speed the procession to the idris finally included venn greenlaw the adjudicator two quaddie patrollers miles and roic the loading bay was as dim and quiet ashad it only been yesterday one of the two quaddie guards watched bemusedly by the other was out of his floater and crouched on the floor he was evidently playing a game with gravity involving a scattering of tiny bright metal caltrops and a small rubber ball which seemed to consist of bouncing the ball off the floor catching it again and snatching up the little caltrops between bounces to make it more interesting for himself he was switching hands with each iteration at the sight of the visitors the guard hastily pocketed the game and scrambled back into his floater venn pretended not to see this simply inquiring after any events of note during their shift not only had no unauthorized persons attempted to get past them the investigation committee was the first live persons the bored men had seen since relieving the prior shift venn lingered with his patrollers to make his arrangements for the stunner ambush of the ba should it appear and miles led roic greenlaw and the adjudicator aboard the ship the gleaming rows of replicator racks in dubauers leased cargo hold appeared unchanged from yesterday greenlaw grew tense about the lips guiding her floater around the hold on an initial overview then pausing to stare down the aisles miles thought he could almost see her doing the multiplication in her head she and leutwyn then hovered by miless side as he activated a few control panels to demonstrate the replicators contents it was almost a repeat of yesterday except a number of the readout indicators showed amber instead of green closer examination revealed them as measures of an array of stressorsignals including adrenaline levels was the ba right about the fetuses reaching some sort of biological limit in their containers was this the first sign of dangerous overgrowth as miles watched a couple of the light bars dropped back on their own from amber to a more encouraging green he went on to call up the vid monitor images of the individual fetuses for greenlaws and the adjudicators views the fourth one he activated showed amniotic fluid cloudy with scarlet blood when the lights came on miles caught his breath how that surely wasnt normal the only possible source of blood was the fetus itself he rechecked the stressor levelsthis one showed a lot of amberthen stood on tiptoe and peered more closely at the image the blood appeared to be leaking from a small jagged gash on the twitching haut infants back the low red lighting miles reassured himself uneasily made it look worse than it was greenlaws voice by his ear made him jump is there something wrong with that one he appears to have suffered some sort of mechanical injury that shouldnt be possible in a sealed replicator he thought of aral alexander and helen natalia and his stomach knotted if you have any quaddie experts in replicator reproduction it might not be a bad idea to get them in here to look at these he doubted this was a specialty where the military medicos from the prince xav were likely to be much help venn appeared at the door of the hold and greenlaw repeated most of miless orienting patter for his benefit venns expression was most disturbed as he regarded the replicators that frog fellow wasnt lying this is very strange venns wrist com buzzed and he excused himself to float to the side of the room and engage in some lowvoiced conversation with whatever subordinate was reporting in at least it began as lowvoiced until venn bellowed what when miles abandoned his worried study of the injured haut infant and edged over to venn about sir a distressed voice responded from the wrist com this wasnt authorized yes it was crew chief duly portmaster thorne authorized it since it was the same passenger it had brought on board yesterday the one who had that live cargo to tend we didnt think anything was odd what time did they leave venn asked his face was a mask of dismay not on our shift sir i dont know what happened after that i went straight home and went to bed i didnt see the search bulletin for portmaster thorne on the news stream till i got up for breakfast just a few minutes ago why didnt you pass this on in your endofshift report portmaster thorne said not to the voice hesitated at least the passenger suggested we might want to leave this off the record so that we wouldnt have to deal with all the other passengers demanding access too if they heard about it and portmaster thorne nodded and said yes venn winced and took a deep breath it cant be helped patroller you reported as soon as you knew im glad you at least picked up the news right away well take it from here thank you venn cut the channel what was that all about asked miles roic had strolled up to loom over his shoulder venn clutched his head with his upper hands and groaned my nightshift guard on the idris just woke up and saw the news bulletin about thorne being missing he says thorne came here last night about ohtwohundred and passed dubauer through the guards where did thorne go after that escorted dubauer aboard apparently neither of them came off while my nightshift crew was watching excuse me i need to go talk to my people venn grabbed his floater control and swung hastily out of the cargo hold miles stood stunned how could bel have gone from an uncomfortable but relatively safe nap in a recycling bin to this action in little more than an hour garnet five had taken six or seven hours to wake up his high confidence in his judgment of guptas account was suddenly shaken roic eyes narrowing asked could your herm friend have gone renegade mlord or been bribed adjudicator leutwyn looked to greenlaw who looked sick with uncertainty i would sooner doubt myself said miles and that was slandering bel although the portmaster might have been bribed with a nerve disruptor muzzle pressed to its spine or something equivalent he wasnt sure he wanted to even try to imagine the bas bioweapon equivalent bel would play for time how could this ba find the portmaster when we couldnt asked leutwyn miles hesitated the ba wasnt hunting bel the ba was hunting guppy if the ba had been closing in last night when guppy counterattacked his shadowers the ba might have come along immediately after or even been a witness and allowed itself to be diverted or swapped its priorities in the face of the unexpected opportunity to gain access to its cargo through bel what priorities what did the ba want well gupta dead certainly doubly so now that the amphibian was witness to both its initial clandestine operation and to the murders by which the ba had attempted to completely erase its trail but for the ba to have been so close to its target and yet veer off suggested that the other priority was overwhelmingly more important to it the ba had spoken of utterly destroying its purportedly animal cargo the ba had also spoken of taking tissue samples for freezing the ba had spoken lie upon lie but suppose this was the truth miles wheeled to stare down the aisle of racks the image formed itself in his mind of the ba working all day with relentless speed and concentration loosening the lid of each replicator stabbing through membrane fluid and soft skin with a sampling needle lining the needles up row on row in a freezer unit the size of a small valise miniaturizing the essence of its genetic payload to something it could carry away in one hand at the cost of abandoning their originals destroying the evidence maybe it has and we just cant see the effects yet if the ba could make adultsized bodies steam away their own liquids within hours and turn to viscous puddles what could it do with such tiny ones the cetagandan wasnt stupid its smuggling scheme might have gone according to plan but for the slipup with gupta who had followed the ba here and drawn in solianwhose disappearance had led to the muddle with corbeau and garnet five which had led to the bungled raid on the quaddie security post which had resulted in the impoundment of the fleet including the bas precious cargo miles knew exactly how it felt to watch a carefully planned mission slide down the toilet in a flush of random mischance how would the ba respond to that sick heartpounding desperation miles had almost no sense of the person despite meeting it twice the ba was smooth and slick and selfcontrolled it could kill with a touch smiling but if the ba was paring down its payload to a minimum mass it certainly wouldnt saddle its escape with a prisoner i think said miles and had to stop and clear a throat gone dry bel would play for time but suppose time and ingenuity ran out and no one came and no one came and no one came i think bel might still be aboard the idris we must search the ship at once roic stared around looking daunted all of it mlord he started to cry yes but his laggard brain converted it to no bel had no access codes beyond quaddie control of the airlock the ba had codes only for this hold and its own cabin anything that was locked before should still be for the first pass check unsecured spaces only shouldnt we wait for chief venns patrollers asked leutwyn uneasily if anyone even tries to come aboard who hasnt been exposed already i swear ill stun them myself before they can get through the airlock im not fooling miless voice was husky with conviction leutwyn looked taken aback but greenlaw after a frozen moment nodded i quite see your point lord auditor vorkosigan i must agree they spread out in pairs the intentlooking greenlaw followed by the somewhat bewildered adjudicator roic determinedly keeping to miless shoulder miles tried the bas cabin first to find it as empty as before four other cabins had been left unlocked three presumably because they had been cleared of possessions the last apparently through sheer carelessness the infirmary was sealed as it had been left after bels inspection with the medtechs last evening nav and com was fully secured on the deck above the kitchen was open as were some of the recreation areas but no cheeky betan herm or unnaturally decomposed remains were to be found greenlaw and leutwyn passed through to report that all of the other holds in the huge long cylinder shared by the bas cargo were still properly sealed venn they discovered had taken over a comconsole in the passenger lounge upon being apprised of miless new theory he paled and attached himself to greenlaw five more nacelles to check on the deck below the passengers zone most of the utility and engineering areas remained locked but the door to the department of small repairs opened at miless touch on its control pad three adjoining chambers were full of benches tools and diagnostic equipment in the second chamber miles came upon a bench holding three deflated bod pods marked with the idris s logo and serial numbers these toughskinned humansized balloons were furnished with enough air recycling equipment and power to keep a passenger alive in a pressurization emergency until rescue arrived one had only to step inside zip it up and hit the poweron button bod pods required a minimum of instruction mostly because there wasnt bloody much you could do once you were trapped inside one every cabin hold and corridor on the ship had them stored in emergency lockers on the walls on the floor beside the bench one bod pod stood fully inflated as if it had been left there in the middle of testing by some tech when the ship had been evacuated by the quaddies miles stepped up to one of the pods round plastic ports and peered through bel sat inside crosslegged stark naked the herms lips were parted and its eyes glazed and distant so still was that form miles feared he was looking at death already but then bels chest rose and fell breasts trembling with the shivers racking its body on the blank face a fevered flush bloomed and faded no god no miles lunged for the pods seal but his hand stopped and fell back clenching so hard his nails bit into his palm like knives no chapter fourteen step one seal the biocontaminated area had the entry lock been closed behind them when their party entered the idris yes had anyone opened it since miles raised his wrist com to his lips and spoke venns contact code roic stepped closer to the bod pod but stopped at miless upflung hand he ducked his head and peered past miless shoulder and his eyes widened the few seconds of delay while the wrist coms search program located venn seemed to flow by like cold oil finally the crew chiefs edgy voice venn here what now lord vorkosigan weve found portmaster thorne trapped in a bod pod in the engineering section the herm appears dazed and very ill i believe we have an urgent biocontamination emergency here at least class three and possibly as bad as class five the most extreme level biowarfare plague where are you all now in the number two freight nacelle the sealer and the adjudicator are with me no one has attempted to leave or enter the ship since we boarded you didnt go out for any reason no you understand the necessity for keeping it that way till we know what the devil were dealing with what do you think id be insane enough to carry some hellplague back ontomy own station check very good crew chief i see we are of one mind in this step two alert the medical authority in your district to each their own im going to report this to admiral vorpatril and request medical assistance i presume graf station has its own emergency protocols just as soon as you get off my com link right at the earliest feasible moment i also intend to break the tube seals and move the ship a little way out of its docking cradle just to be sure if you or the sealer would warn station traffic control plus clear whatever shuttle vorpatril sends that would be most helpful meanwhilei strongly urge you seal the locks between your nacelle and this central section until until we know more find the nacelles atmosphere controls and put yourselves on internal circulation if you can i havent quite figured out what to do about this damned bod pod yet naivorkosigan out he cut the com and stared in anguish at the thin wall between him and bel how good a biocontamination barrier was a sealed bod pods skin probably quite good for something not purposebuilt for the task a new and horrible idea of just where to look for solian or rather whatever organic smear of the lieutenant might now remain presented itself inescapably to miless imagination with that jump of deduction came new hope and new terror solian had been disposed of weeks ago probably aboard this very vessel at a time when passengers and crew had been moving freely between the station and the ship no plague had broken out yet if solian had been dissolved by the same nightmare method gupta testified had claimed his shipmates inside a bod pod which was then folded and set out of the way leaving bel in the pod with the seals unbroken might make everyone perfectly safe everyone of course except bel it was unclear if the incubation or latency period of the infection was adjustable although what miles was seeing now suggested it was six days for gupta and his friends six hours for bel but the disease or poison or biomolecular device whatever it was had killed the jacksonians quickly once it became active in just a few hours how long did bel have until intervention became futile before the herms brains began turning to some bubbling gray slime along with its body hours minutes too late already and what intervention could help gupta survived this therefore survival is possible his mind dug into that historical fact like pitons into a rock face hang on and climb boy he held his wrist com to his lips and called up the emergency channel to admiral vorpatril vorpatril responded almost immediately lord vorkosigan the medical squad you requested reached the quaddie station a few minutes ago they should be reporting in to you there momentarily to assist with the examination of your prisoner havent they presented themselves yet they may have but im now aboard the idris along with armsman roic and unfortunately sealer greenlaw adjudicator leutwyn and chief venn weve ordered the ship sealed we appear to have a biocontamination incident aboard he repeated the description of bel hed given venn with a few more details vorpatril swore shall i send a personnel pod to take you off my lord absolutely not if theres anything contagious loose in herewhich while not certain is not yet ruled outits um already too late ill divert my medical squad to you at once not all of them dammit i want some of our people in with the quaddies working on gupta it is of the highest urgency to find out why he survived since we may be stuck in here for a while dont tie up more men than required but do send me bright ones in level five biotainer suits you can send any equipment they want aboard with them but nothing and no one goes back off this ship till this thing is locked down or until the plague took them all miles had a vision of the idris towed away from the station and abandoned the untouchable final tomb of all aboard a damned expensive sepulchre there was that consolation he had faced death before and once at least lost but the lonely ugliness of this one shook him badly there would be no cheating with cryochambers this time he suspected not for the last victims to go certainly volunteers only you understand me admiral that i do said vorpatril grimly im on it my lord auditor good vorkosigan out how much time did bel have half an hour two hours how much time would it take vorpatril to muster his new set of medical volunteers and all their complex cargo more than half an hour miles was fairly certain and what could they do when they got here besides his genetic engineering what had been different from the others about gupta his tank breathing through his gills bel didnt have gills no help there cooling water flowing over the froggish body his fanlike webs through the bloodfilled feathery gills chilling his blood could some of this biodissolvents hellish development be heatsensitive or temperaturetriggered an icewater bath the vision sprang to his minds eye and his lips drew back on a fierce grin a lowtech but provably fast way to lower body temperature no question about it he could personally guarantee the effects thank you ivan my lord said roic uncertainly to his apparent transfixed paralysis we run like hell now you go to the galley and check for ice if there isnt any start whatever machine they have full blast then meet me in the infirmary he had to move fast he didnt have to be stupid about it they may have biotainer gear there by the expression on roics face he was notably not following any of this but at least he followed miles who boiled out and down the corridor they rose up the lift tube the two flights to the level that housed galley infirmary and recreation areas more out of breath than he cared to reveal miles waved roic on his way and galloped to the infirmary at the far end of the central nacelle a frustrating pause while he tapped out the locking code and he was through into the little sickbay the facilities were scant two small wards although both with at least level three biocontainment capabilities plus an examining room equipped for minor surgery that also harbored the pharmacy major surgeries and severe injuries were expected to be transported to one of the military escort ships more seriously equipped sickbays yes one of the wards bathrooms included a sterilizable treatment tub miles pictured unhappy passengers with skin infestations soaking therein lockers full of emergency equipment he jerked them all open there was the blood synthesizer there a drawer of mysterious and unnerving objects perhaps designed for female patients there was a narrow float pallet for patient transport standing on end in a tall locker with two biotainer suits yes one too large for miles the other too small for roic he could wear the toolarge suit it wouldnt be the first time the other would be impossible he couldnt justify endangering roic so roic jogged in found the ice maker mlord nobody seems to have turned it off when the ship was evacuated its packed full miles pulled out his stunner and dropped it on the examining table then began to skin into the smaller biotainer suit what thell do you think youre doing mlord asked roic warily were going to bring bel up here or at least i am its where the medics will want to do treatments anyway if there were any treatments i have an idea for some quickanddirty first aid i think guppy might have survived by the water in his tank keeping his body temperature down head for engineering try to find a pressure suit that will fit you ifwhen you find the suit let me know and put it on at once then meet me back where bel is move roic face set moved miles used the precious seconds to run to the galley and scoop a plastic waste bin full of ice and drag it back to the infirmary on the float pallet to dump in the tub then a second bin full then his wrist com buzzed found a suit mlord itll just fit i think roics voice wavered as presumably his arm moved about some rustling and faint grunting indicated a successful test once im in i wont be able to use my secured wrist com ill have to access you over some public channel well have to live with that make contact with vorpatril on your suit com as soon as youre sealed in be sure his medics can communicate when they bring their pod to one of the outboard locks make sure they dont try to come through the same freight nacelle where the quaddies have taken refuge right mlord meet you in small repairs right mlord suiting up now the channel went muffled regretfully miles covered his own wrist com with the biotainer suits left glove he tucked his stunner into one of the sealable outer pockets on the thigh then adjusted his oxygen flow with a few taps on the suits control vambrace on his left arm the lights in the helmet faceplate display promised him he was now sealed from his environment the slight positive pressure within the overlarge suit puffed it out plumply he slopped toward the lift tube in the loose boots towing the float pallet roic was just clumping down the corridor as miles maneuvered the pallet through the door of small repairs the armsmans pressure suit marked with theidris s engineering departments serial numbers was certainly as much protection as miless gear although its gloves were thicker and more clumsy miles motioned roic to bend toward him touching his faceplate to roics helmet were going to reduce the pressure in the bod pod to partially deflate it roll bel onto the float pallet and run it upstairs im not going to unseal the pod till were in the ward with the molecular barriers activated shouldnt we wait for the prince xav s medics for that mlord asked roic nervously theyll be here soon enough no because i dont know how soon too late is i dont dare vent bels pod into the ships atmosphere so im going to try to rig a line to another pod as a catchment help me look for sealing tape and something to use for an air pipe roic gave him a rather frustrated gesture of acknowledgment and began a survey of benches and drawers miles peered in the port again bel bel he shouted through faceplate and bod skin muffled yes but he should be audible dammit were going to move you hang on in there bel sat unchanged apparently from a few minutes ago still glazed and unresponsive it might not be the infection miles tried to encourage himself how many drugs had the herm been hit with last night to assure its cooperation knocked out by gupta stimulated to consciousness by the ba tanked with hypnotics presumably for the walk to the idris and the scam of the quaddie guards maybe fastpenta after that and some sedatives to keep bel quiescent while the poison took hold who knew miles shook out one of the other pods onto the floor nearby if the residue of solian lay therein well this wasnt going to make it any more contaminated now was it and would bels remains have escaped notice for as long as solians if miles hadnt come along so soonwas that the bas plan murder and dispose of the body in one move he knelt to the side of bels bod pod and opened the access panel to the pressurization control unit roic handed down a length of plastic tubing and strips of tape miles wrapped prayed and turned assorted valve controls the air pump vibrated gently the pods round outline softened and slumped the second pod expanded after a flaccid wrinkled fashion he closed valves cut lines sealed wished for a few liters of disinfectant to splash around he held the fabric up away from the lump that was bels head as roic lifted the herm onto the pallet the pallet moved at a brisk walking pace miles longed to run they maneuvered the load into the infirmary into the small ward as close as possible to the rather cramped bathroom miles motioned roic to bend close again all right this is as far as you go we dont both need to be in here for this i want you to exit the room and turn on the molecular barriers then stand ready to assist the medics from the prince xav as needed mlord are you sure you wouldnt rather we do it tother way around im sure go roic exited reluctantly miles waited till the lines of blue light indicating that the barriers had been activated sprang into being across the doorway then bent to unzip the pod and fold it back from bels tensed trembling body even through his gloves bels bare skin felt scorching hot edging both the pallet and himself into the bathroom involved some awkward clambering but at last he had bel positioned to shift into the waiting vat of ice and water heave slide splash he cursed the pallet and lunged over it to hold bels head up bels body jerked in shock miles wondered if his shakily theorized palliative would instead give the victim heart failure he shoved the pallet back out the door and out of the way with one foot bel was now trying to curl into a fetal position a more heartening response than the openeyed coma miles had observed so far miles pulled the bent limbs down one by one and held them under the ice water miles fingers grew numb with the cold except where they touched bel the herms body temperature seemed scarcely affected by this brutal treatment unnatural indeed but at least bel stopped growing hotter the ice was melting noticeably it had been some years since miles had last glimpsed bel nude in a field shower or donning or divesting space armor in a mercenary warship locker room fiftysomething wasnt old for a betan but still gravity was clearly gaining on bel on all of us in their dendarii days bel had taken out its unrequited lust for miles in a series of halfjoking passes halfregretfully declined miles repented his younger sexual reticence altogether now profoundlywe should have taken our chances back then when we were young and beautiful and didnt even know it and bel had been beautiful in its own ironic way living and moving at ease in a body athletic healthy and trim bels skin was blotched mottled red and pale the herms flesh sliding and turning in the ice bath under miless anxious hands had an odd texture by turns swollen tight or bruised like crushed fruit miles called bels name tried his best old admiral naismith commands you voice told a bad joke all without penetrating the herms glazed stupor it was a bad idea to cry in a biotainer suit almost as bad as throwing up in a pressure suit you couldnt blot your eyes or wipe your snot and when someone touched you unexpectedly on the shoulder you jumped as though shot and they looked at you funny through their faceplate and yours lord auditor vorkosigan are you all right said the prince xav s biotainerswaddled surgeon as he knelt beside him at the vats edge miles swallowed for selfcontrol im fine so far this herms in a very bad way i dont know what theyve told you about all this i was told that i might be dealing with a possible cetagandandesigned bioweapon in hot mode that had killed three so far with one survivor the part about there being a survivor made me really wonder about the first assertion ah you didnt get a chance to see guppy yet then miles took a breath and ran through a brief recap of guptas tale or at least the pertinent biological aspects of it as he spoke his hands never stopped shoving bels arms and legs back down or ladling watery ice cubes over the herms burning head and neck he finished i dont know if it was guptas amphibian genetics or something he did that allowed him to survive this hellshit when his friends didnt guppy said their dead flesh steamed i dont know what all this heats coming from but it cant be just fever i couldnt duplicate the jacksonians bioengineering but i thought i could at least duplicate the water tank trick wildassed empiricism but i didnt think there was much time a gloved hand reached past him to raise bels eyelids touch the herm here and there press and probe i see that its really important miles took another gulp of air to stabilize his voiceits really important that this patient survive thornes not just any stationer bel was he realized he didnt know the surgeons security clearance having the portmaster die on our watch would be a diplomatic disaster another one that is and and the herm saved my life yesterday i owebarrayar owes my lord well do our best i have my top squad here well take over now please my lord auditor if you could please step out and let your man decontaminate you another suited figure doctor or medtech appeared through the bathroom door and held out a tray of instruments to the surgeon perforce miles moved aside as the first sampling needle plunged past him into bels unresponsive flesh no room left in here even for his shortness he had to admit he withdrew the spare ward bunk had been turned into a lab bench a third biotainerclad figure was rapidly shifting what looked a promising array of equipment from boxes and bins piled high on a float pallet onto this makeshift surface the second tech returned from the bathroom and started feeding bits of bel into the various chemical and molecular analyzers on one end of the bunk even as the third man arranged more devices on the other roics tall pressuresuited figure stood waiting just past the molecular barriers across the ward door he was holding a highpowered lasersonic decontaminator familiar barrayaran military issue he raised an inviting hand miles returned the acknowledgment nothing further was to be gained in here by dithering more at the medical squad hed just distract them and get in their way he suppressed his unstrung urge to explain to them bels superior right by old valor and love to survive futile he might as well rail at the microbes themselves even the cetagandans had not yet devised a weapon that triaged for virtue before slaughtering its victims i promised to call nicol god why did i promise that learning bels present status would surely be more terrifying for her than knowing nothing he would wait a little longer at least till he received the first report from the surgeon if there was hope by then he could impart it if there was none he stepped slowly through the buzzing molecular barrier raising his arms to turn about beneath the even stronger sonicscrubberlaserdryer beam from roics decontaminator he had roic treat every part of him including palms fingers the soles of his feet and nervously the insides of his thighs the suit protected him from what would otherwise be a nasty scorching leaving skin pink and hair exploded off he didnt motion roic to desist till theyd gone over each square centimeter twice roic pointed to miless control vambrace and bellowed through his faceplate i have the ships com link relay up and running now mlord you should be able to hear me through channel twelve if youll switch over tmedics are all on thirteen hastily miles switched on the suit com can you hear me roics voice sounded now beside his ear yes mlord much better have we blown the tube seals and pulled away from the docking clamps yet roic looked faintly chagrined no mlord at miless chin raised in inquiry he added um you see theres only me ive never piloted a jumpship unless youre actually jumping its just like a shuttle miles assured him only bigger ive never piloted a shuttle either ah well come on then ill show you how they threaded their way to nav and com roic tapped their passage through the code locks all right miles admitted looking around at the various station chairs and their control banks so it was a big ship it was only going to be a tenmeter flight he was a bit out of practice even on pods and shuttles but really given some of the pilots hed known how hard could it be roic watched in earnest admiration while he concealed his hunt for the tube seal controlsah there it took three tries to get in touch with station traffic control and then with docks and locksif only bel had been here he would have instantly delegated this task to he bit his lip rechecking the allclear from the loading bayit would be the cap on this missions multitude of embarrassments to pull away from the station yanking out the docking clamps decompressing the loading bay and killing some unknown number of quaddie patrollers on guard therein he scooted from the communications station to the pilots chair shoving the jump helmet up out of the way and clenching his gloved hands briefly before activating the manual controls a little gentle pressure from the side verniers a little patience and a countering thrust from the opposite side left the vast bulk of the idris floating in space a neat stones throw from the side of graf station not that a stone thrown out there would do anything but keep on going forever no bioplague can cross that gap he thought with satisfaction then instantly thought of what the cetagandans might do with spores i hope it occurred to him belatedly that if the prince xav s surgeon sounded an allclear from the biocontamination alert docking once again was going to be a critically more delicate task well if he clears the ship we can import a pilot then he glanced at the time on a wall digital barely an hour had passed since theyd found bel it seemed a century youre a pilot as well a surprised muffled female voice sounded miles swung around in the pilots chair to find the three quaddies in their floaters hovering in the control rooms doorway all now wore quaddieshaped biotainer suits in pale medical green his eye rapidly sorted them out venn was bulkier sealer greenlaw a little shorter adjudicator leutwyn brought up the rear only in an emergency he admitted where did you get the suits my people sent them across from the station in a drone pod said venn he too wore his stunner holstered on the outside of his suit miles would have preferred to keep the civilians safely locked down in the freight nacelle but there was clearly no help for that now which is still attached to the lock yes venn overrode miless opening mouth thank you said miles meekly he wanted desperately to rub his face and scrub his itching eyes but couldnt what was next had he done all he could to contain this thing his eye fell on the decontaminator slung over roics shoulder it would probably be a good idea to take that back down to engineering and sterilize their tracks mlord said roic diffidently yes armsman i been thinking the night guard saw the portmaster and the ba enter the ship but nobody reported anybody leaving we found thorne i was wondering how the ba got off the ship thank you roic yes and how long ago good question to pursue next whenever one of the idris s hatches opens its lock vid recorders start up automatically we should ought to be able to access tlock records from here id think same as from solians security office roic cast a somewhat desperate eye around the intimidating array of stations somewhere we should indeed miles abandoned the pilots chair for the flight engineers station a little poking among the controls and a short delay while one of roics library of override codes pacified the lockdowns and miles was able to bring up a duplicate file of the sort of airlock security records theyd found in solians office and spent so many blearyeyed hours studying he set the search to present the data in reverse order of time the most recent usage was first up on the vid plate a nice shot of the automated drone pod docking at the outboard personnel lock serving the number two freight nacelle an anxiouslooking venn scooted into the lock in his floater he shuttled in and out handing back green suits folded in plastic bags to waiting hands plus an assortment of other objects a big box of first aid supplies a tool kit a decontaminator somewhat resembling roics and what might be some weapons with rather more authority than stunners miles cut the scene short and sent the search back in time mere minutes before that was the barrayaran military medical patrol arriving in a small shuttle from the prince xav entering via one of the number four nacelle personnel locks the three medical officers and roic were all clearly identifiable hastily unloading equipment a freight lock in one of the necklin drive nacelles popped up next and miles caught his breath a figure in a bulky extravehicularrepairs suit marked with serial numbers from the idris s engineering section lumbered heavily past the vid pickup and departed into the vacuum with a brief puff of suit jets the quaddies bobbing at miless shoulder murmured and pointed greenlaw muffled an exclamation and venn choked on a curse the next record back in time was of themselvesthe three quaddies miles and roicentering the ship from the loading bay for their inspection however many hours ago it had been miles tapped instantly back to the mystery figure in the engineering suit what time roic exclaimed look mlord heitwas getting away not twenty minutes before we found tportmaster the ba mustve still been aboard when we came on even through his faceplate his face took on a greenish tinge had bels conundrum in the bod pod been a fiendishly engineered delaying tactic miles wondered if the knotted feeling in his stomach and tightness in his throat could be the first sign of a bioengineered plague is that our suspect asked leutwyn anxiously where did he go what is the range on those heavy suits of yours do you know lord auditor asked venn urgently those not sure theyre meant to allow men to work outside the ship for hours at a time so id guess if they were fully topped up with oxygen propellant and power damned near the range of a small personnel pod the engineering repair suits resembled military space armor except with an array of builtin tools instead of builtin weapons too heavy for even a strong man to walk in they were fully powered the ba might have ridden in one around to any point on graf station worse the ba might have ridden out to a midspace pickup by some cetagandan coagent or perhaps by some bribed or simply bamboozled local helper the ba might be thousands of kilometers away by now with the gap widening every second heading for entry to another quaddie habitat under yet another faked identity or even for rendezvous with a passing jumpship and escape from quaddiespace altogether station security is on full emergency alert said venn i have all my patrollers and all of the sealers militia on duty out looking for the fellowthe person dubauer cant have gotten back aboard the station unobserved a tremor of doubt in venns voice undercut the certainty of this statement ive ordered the station onto a full biocontamination quarantine said greenlaw all incoming ships and vehicles have been waved off or diverted to union and none now in dock are cleared to leave if the fugitive did get back aboard alreadyit isnt leaving judging by the sealers congealed expression she was by no means sure if this was a good thing miles sympathized fifty thousand potential hostages if its fled somewhere else if our people cant locate this fugitive promptly im going to have to extend the quarantine throughout quaddiespace what would be the most important task for the ba now that the flag had been dropped it had to realize that the tight secrecy it had relied on for protection thus far was irremediably ruptured did it realize how close on its heels its pursuers had come would it still wish to murder gupta to assure the jacksonian smugglers silence or would it abandon that hunt cut losses and run if it could which direction was it trying to move back in or out miless eye fell on the vid image of the work suit frozen above the plate did that suit have the kind of telemetry space armor did more to the pointdid it have the kind of remote control overrides some space armor did roic when you were down in the engineering suit lockers hunting for that pressure suit did you see an automated commandandcontrol station for these powered repair units i theres a control room down there yes mlord i passed it i dont know what all might be in it i have an idea follow me he levered himself from the station chair and left nav and com at a sloppy jog his biotainer suit sliding aggravatingly around him roic strode after the curious quaddies followed in their floaters the control room was scarcely more than a booth but it featured a telemetry station for exterior maintenance and repairs miles slid into its station chair and cursed the tall person whod fixed it at a height that left his boots dangling in air on permanent display were several realtime vid shots of critical portions of the ships outlying anatomy including directional antenna arrays the mass shield generator and the main normalspace thrusters miles sorted through a bewildering mess of data from structural safety sensors scattered throughout the ship finally the work suit control program came up six suits in the array miles called up visual telemetry from their helmet vids five returned views of blank walls the insides of their respective storage lockers the sixth returned a lighter image but more puzzling of a curving wall it remained as static as the vistas from the suits in storage miles pinged the suit for full telemetry download the suit was powered up but quiescent the medical sensors were basic just heart rate and respirationand turned off the lifesupport readouts claimed the rebreather was fully functional the interior humidity and temperature were exactly onspec but the system appeared to be supporting no load it cant be very far away miles said over his shoulder to his hovering audience theres zero time lag in my com linkup thats a relief sighed greenlaw is it muttered leutwyn who for miles stretched shoulders aching with tension and bent again to the displays the powered suit had to have an exterior control override somewhere it was a common safety feature on these civilian models in case its occupant should suddenly become injured ill or incapacitated ah there what are you doing mlord asked roic uneasily i believe i can take control of the suit via the emergency overrides and bring it back aboard wit t ba inside is that a good idea well know in a moment he gripped the joysticks slippery under his gloves gained control of the suits jets and tried a gentle puff the suit slowly began to move scraping along the wall and then turning away the puzzling view resolved itselfhe was looking at the outside of the idris itself the suit had been hidden tucked in the angle between two nacelles no one inside the suit fought back at this hijacking a new and extremely disturbing thought crept up on miles carefully miles brought the suit back around the outside of the ship to the nearest lock to engineering on the outboard side of one of the necklin rod nacelles the same lock from which it had exited opened the lock brought the suit inside its servos kept it upright the light reflected from its faceplate concealing whatever was within miles did not open the interior lock door now what he said to the room at large venn glanced at roic your armsman and i have stunners i believe if you control the suit you control the prisoners movements bring it in and well arrest the bastard the suit has manual capacities too anyone in it who was alive and conscious should have been able to fight me miles cleared a throat thick with worry i was just wondering if bruns searchers checked inside these suits when they were looking for solian that first day he went missing and um what hes likewhat condition his body might be in by now roic made a small noise and emitted an undervoiced plaintive protest of mlord miles wasnt sure of the exact interpretation but he thought it might have something to do with roic wanting to keep his last meal in his stomach and not all over the inside of his helmet after a brief fraught pause venn said then wed better go have a look sealer adjudicatorwait here the two senior officials didnt argue would you like to stay with em mlord roic suggested tentatively weve all been looking for that poor bastard for weeks miles replied firmly if this is him i want to be the first to know he did allow roic and venn to precede him from engineering through the locks into the necklin field generator nacelle though at the lock venn drew his stunner and took position roic peered through the port on the airlocks inner door then his hand swept down to the lock control the door slid open and he strode in he reappeared a moment later halfdragging the heavy toppling work suit he laid it faceup on the corridor floor miles ventured closer and stared down at the faceplate the suit was empty chapter fifteen dont open it cried venn in alarm wasnt planning to miles replied mildly not for any money venn floated closer stared down over miless shoulder and swore the bastards got away already but to the station or to a ship he edged back tucked his stunner away in a pocket of his green suit and began to gabble into his helmet com alerting both station security and the quaddie militia to pursue seize and search anythingship pod or shuttlethat had so much as shifted its parking zone off the side of the station in the past three hours miles envisioned the escape might the ba have ridden the repairs suit back aboard the station before greenlaw had called down the quarantine yes maybe the time window was narrow but possible but in that case how had it returned the suit to the hiding place outside the idris it would make more sense for the ba to have been picked up by a personnel podplenty enough of them zipping around out there at all hoursand have prodded the suit back to its concealment with a tractor beam or had it towed there by someone in another powered suit and tucked out of sight but the idris like all the other barrayaran and komarran ships was under surveillance by the quaddie militia how cursory was that outside guard surely not that inattentive yet a person a tall person sitting in that engineering control booth manipulating the joysticks might well have walked the suit out this airlock and quickly around the nacelle popping it away out of sight deftly enough to evade notice by the militia guardians then risen from the station chair and miless palms itched maddeningly inside his gloves and he rubbed them together in a futile attempt to gain relief hed have traded blood for the chance to rub his nose roic he said slowly do you remember what this he prodded the repair suit with his toe had in its hand when it went out the airlock um nothing mlord roic twisted slightly and shot miles a puzzled look through his faceplate thats what i thought right if miles was guessing correctly the ba had turned aside from the imminent murder of gupta to seize the chance of using bel to get back aboard the idris and dowhatwith its cargo destroy it it would surely not have taken the ba this long to inoculate the replicators with some suitable poison it might even have been able to do them twenty at a time introducing the contaminant into the support system of each rack oreven more simply if all it had wanted was to kill its chargesit might have just turned off all the support systems a work of mere minutes but taking and marking individual cell samples for freezing yes that could well have taken all night and all day too if the ba had risked everything to do that would it then leave the ship without its freezer case firmly in hand the bas had over two hours to effect an escape surely it wouldnt linger muttered miles but his voice lacked conviction roic at least caught the quaver at once his helmet turned toward miles and he frowned they needed to count pressure suits and check every lock to see if any of the vid monitors had been manually disabled no too slowthat would be a fine evidencecollecting task to delegate if one had the manpower but miles felt painfully bereft of minions just now and in any case so what if another suit was found to be gone pursuing loose suits was a job that the quaddies around the station were already turning to by venns order but if no other suit was gone and miles himself had just turned the idris into a trap he gulped i was about to say we need to count suits but ive a better idea i believe we should return to nav and com and shut the ship down in sections from there collect all the weapons at our disposal and do a systematic search venn jerked around in his float chair what do you think this cetagandan agent could still be aboard mlord said roic in an uncharacteristically sharp voice what tmatter with your gloves miles stared down turning up his hands his breath congealed in his chest the thin tough fabric of his biotainer gloves was shredding away hanging loose in strings beneath the lattice his palms showed red their itching seemed to redouble his breath let loose again in a snarl of shit venn bobbed closer took in the damage with widening eyes and recoiled miles held his hands up and apart venn go collect greenlaw and leutwyn and take over nav and com secure yourselves and the infirmary in that order roic go ahead of me to the infirmary open the doors for me he choked back an unnecessary scream of run roic with an indrawn breath audible over the suit com was already moving he dodged through the halfdark ship in roics longlegged wake touching nothing expecting every lumping heartbeat to rupture inside him where had he collected this hellish contamination was anyone else affected everyone else no it had to have been the powersuit control joysticks theyd slid greasily under his gloved hands he had gripped them tighter intent upon the task of bringing the suit back inboard hed taken the bait now more than ever he was certain the ba had walked an empty suit out the airlock and then set a snare for any smartass who figured it out too soon he plunged through the door to the infirmary past roic who stood aside and straight on through the bluelit inner door to the biosealed ward a medtechs suited form jumped in surprise miles called up channel and rapped out someone please then stopped hed meant to cry turn on the water for me and hold his hands under the sluice of a sink but where did the water then go help he finished in a smaller voice what is it my lord audi the chief surgeon began stepping from the bathroom then his glance took in miless upraised hands what happened i think i hit a booby trap as soon as you have a free tech have armsman roic take him down to engineering and collect a sample from the repair suit remote controller there it appears to have been painted with some powerful corrosive or enzyme and and i dont know what else sonic scrubber captain clogston snapped over his shoulder to the tech monitoring the makeshift lab bench the man hastened to rummage among the stacks of supplies he turned back powering on the device miles held out both his burning hands the machine roared as the tech ran the directed beam of vibration over the afflicted areas its powerful vacuum sucking the loosened detritus both macroscopic and microscopic into the sealed collection bag the surgeon leaned in with a scalpel and tongs slicing and tearing away the remaining shreds of gloves which were also sucked into the receptacle the scrubber seemed effective miless hands stopped feeling worse though they continued to throb was his skin breached he brought his nowbare palms closer to his faceplate impeding the surgeon who hissed under his breath yes red flecks of blood welled in the creases of the swollen tissue shit shit shit clogston straightened and glanced around lips drawn back in a grimace your biotainer suits compromised all to hell my lord theres another pair of gloves on the other suit miles pointed out i could cannibalize them not yet clogston hurried to slather miless hands with some mystery goo and wrap them in biotainer barriers sealed to his wrists it was like wearing mittens over handfuls of snot but the burning pain eased across the room the tech was scraping fragments of contaminated glove into an analyzer was the third man in with bel was bel still in the ice bath still alive miles took a deep steadying breath do you have any kind of a diagnosis on portmaster thorne yet oh yes it came up right away said clogston in a somewhat absent tone still sealing the second wrist wrap the instant we ran the first blood sample through what the hell we can do about it is not yet obvious but i have some ideas he straightened again frowning deeply at miless hands the herms blood and tissues are crawling with artificialthat is bioengineeredparasites he glanced up they appear to have an initial latent asymptomatic phase where they multiply rapidly throughout the body then at some pointpossibly triggered by their own concentrationthey switch over to producing two chemicals in different vesicles within their own cellular membrane the vesicles engorge a rise in the victims body temperature triggers the bursting of the sacs and the chemicals in turn undergo a violently exothermic reaction with each otherkilling the parasite damaging the hosts surrounding tissues and stimulating more nearby parasites to go off tiny pinpoint bombs all through the body itshis tone went reluctantly admiringextremely elegant in a hideous sort of way diddid my icewater bath treatment help thorne then yes absolutely the drop in core temperature stopped the cascade in its tracks temporarily the parasites had almost reached critical concentration miless eyes squeezed shut in brief gratitude and opened again temporarily i still havent figured out how to get rid of the damned things were trying to modify a surgical shunt into a blood filter to both mechanically remove the parasites from the patients bloodstream and chill the blood to a controlled degree before returning it to the body i think i can make the parasites respond selectively to an applied electrophoresis gradient across the shunt tube and pull them right on out of the bloodstream wont that do it then clogston shook his head it doesnt get the parasites lodged in other tissues reservoirs of reinfection its not a cure but it might buy time i think the cure must somehow kill every last one of the parasites in the body or the process will just start up again his lips twisted internal vermicides could be tricky injecting something to kill alreadyengorged parasites within the tissues will just release their chemical loads a very little of that microinsult will play hell with circulation overload repair processes cause intense painits its tricky destroy brain tissue miles asked feeling sick eventually they dont seem to cross the bloodbrain barrier very readily i believe the victim would be conscious to a um very late phase of the dissolution oh miles tried to decide whether that would be good or bad on the bright side offered the surgeon i may be able to downgrade the biocontamination alarm from level five to level three the parasites appear to need direct bloodtoblood contact to effect transference they dont seem to survive long outside a host they cant travel through the air clogston hesitated well maybe not until the host starts coughing blood until not unless miles noted the word choice im afraid talk of a downgrade is premature anyway a cetagandan agent armed with unknown bioweaponswell unknown except for this one which is getting too damned familiaris still on the loose out there he inhaled carefully and forced his voice to calm weve found some evidence suggesting that the agent still may be hiding aboard this ship you need to secure your work zone from a possible intruder captain clogston cursed hear that boys he called to his techs over his suit com oh great came a disgusted reply just what we need right now hey at least its something we can shoot another voice remarked wistfully ah barrayarans miless heart warmed on sight he confirmed these were military medicos they all bore sidearms bless them his eye flicked over the ward and the infirmary chamber beyond summing weak points only one entry but was that weakness or strength the outer door was definitely the vantage to hold protecting the ward beyond roic had taken up station there quite automatically yet traditional attack by stunner plasma arc or explosive grenade seemed insufficiently imaginative the place was still on ships air circulation and ships power but this of all sections had to have its own emergency reservoirs of both the militarygrade level five biotainer suits the medicos wore also doubled as pressure suits their air circulation entirely internal the same was not true of miless cheaper suit even before hed lost his gloves his atmosphere pack drew air from the environs through filters and cookers in the event of a pressurization loss his suit would turn into a stiff unwieldy balloon perhaps even rupture at a weak point there were bod pod lockers on the walls of course miles pictured being trapped in a bod pod while the action went on without him given that he was already exposed to whatever peeling out of his biotainer suit long enough to get into something tighter couldnt make things any worse could it he stared at his hands and wondered why he wasnt dead yet could the glop hed touched have been only a simple corrosive miles clawed his stunner out of his thigh pocket awkwardly with his mittened hand and walked back through the blue bars of light marking the biobarrier roic i want you to dash back down to engineering and grab me the smallest pressure suit you can find ill guard this point till you get back mlord roic began in a tone of doubt keep your stunner out watch your back were all here so if you see anything move that isnt quaddie green shoot first roic swallowed manfully yes well see that you stay here mlord dont go haring off on your own without me i wouldnt dream of it miles promised roic departed at the gallop miles readjusted his awkward grip on the stunner made sure it was set to maximum power and took a stance partly sheltered by the door staring up the central corridor at his bodyguards retreating form scowling i dont understand this something didnt add up and if he could just get ten consecutive minutes not filled with lethal new tactical crises maybe it would come to him he tried not to think about his stinging palms and what ingenious microbial sneak assault might even now be stealing through his body maybe even making its way into his brain an ordinary imperial servitor ba ought to have died before abandoning a charge like those hautfilled replicators and even if this one had been trained as some sort of special agent why spend all that critical time taking samples from the fetuses that it was about to desert or maybe even destroy every haut infant ever made had its dna kept on file back in the central gene banks of the star crche they could make more surely what made this batch so irreplaceable his train of thought derailed itself as he imagined little gengineered parasites multiplying frenetically through his bloodstream blipblipblipblip calm down dammit he didnt actually know if hed even been inoculated with the same evil disease as bel yeah it might be something even worse yet surely some cetagandan designer neurotoxinor even some quite ordinary offtheshelf poisonought to cut in much faster than this although if its a drug to drive the victim mad with paranoia its working really well was the bas repertoire of hellpotions limited if it had any why not many whatever stimulants or hypnotics it had used on bel need not have been anything out of the ordinary by the norms of covert ops how many other fancy biotricks did it have up its sleeve was miles about to personally demonstrate the next one am i going to live long enough to say goodbye to ekaterin a goodbye kiss was right out unless they pressed their lips to opposite sides of some really thick window of glass he had so much to say to her it seemed impossible to find where to start even more impossible by voice alone over an open unsecured public com link take care of the kids kiss them for me every night at bedtime and tell them i loved them even if i never saw them you wont be alonemy parents will help you tell my parents tell them was this damned thing starting up already or were the hot panic and choking tears in his throat entirely selfinduced an enemy that attacked you from the inside outyou could try to turn yourself inside out to fight it but you wouldnt succeedfilthy weapon open channel or not im calling her now instead venns voice sounded in his ear lord vorkosigan pick up channel twelve your admiral vorpatril wants you badly miles hissed through his teeth and keyed his helmet com over vorkosigan here vorkosigan you idiot the admirals syntax had shed a few honorifics sometime in the past hour what the hell is going on over there why dont you answer your wrist com its inside my biotainer suit and inaccessible right now im afraid i had to don the suit in a hurry be aware this helmet link is an open access channel and unsecured sir dammit where did that sir drop in from habit sheer old bad habit you can ask for a brief report from captain clogston over his military suits tightbeam link but keep it short hes a very busy man right now and i dont want him distracted vorpatril sworewhether generally or at the imperial auditor was left nicely ambiguousand clicked off faintly echoing through the ship came the sound miles had been waiting forthe distant clanks and hisses of airseal doors shutting down sealing the ship into airtight sections the quaddies had made it to nav and com good except that roic wasnt back yet the armsman would have to get in touch with venn and greenlaw and get them to unseal and reseal his passage back up to vorkosigan venns voice sounded again in his ear strained is that you is what me shutting off the compartments isnt it miles tried and failed to swallow his voice back down to a more reasonable pitch arent you in nav and com yet no we circled back to the number two nacelle to pick up our equipment we were just about to leave it hope flared in miless hammering heart roic he called urgently where are you not in nav and com mlord roics grim voice returned but if were here and hes there whos doing this came leutwyns unhappy voice who do you think greenlaw ripped back her breath huffed out in anguish five people and not one of us thought to see the door locked behind us when we leftdammit a small bleak grunt like a man being hit with an arrow or a realization sounded in miless ear roic miles said urgently anyone who holds nav and com has access to all these shiplinked com channels or will shortly were going to have to switch off the quaddies had independent links to the station and vorpatril through their suits so did the medicos miles and roic would be the ones plunged into communications limbo then abruptly the sound in his helmet went dead ah looks like the ba has found the com controls miles leapt to the environmental control panel for the infirmary to the left of the door opened it and hit every manual override in it with this outer door shut they could retain air pressure although circulation would be blocked the medicos in their suits would be unaffected miles and bel would be at risk he eyed the bod pod locker on the wall without favor the biosealed ward was already functioning on internal circulation thank god and could remain soas long as the power stayed on but how could they keep bel cold if the herm had to retreat to a pod miles hurried back into the ward he approached clogston and yelled through his faceplate we just lost our shiplinked suit coms keep to your tightbeam military channels only i heard clogston yelled back how are you coming on that filtercooler cooler parts done still working on the filter i wish id brought more hands although theres scarcely room in here for more butts ive almost got it i think called the tech crouched over the bench check that will you sir he waved in the direction of one of the analyzers a collection of lights on its readout now blinking for attention clogston dodged around him and bent to the machine in question after a moment he murmured oh thats clever miles crowding his shoulder close enough to hear this did not find it reassuring whats clever clogston pointed at his analyzer readout which now displayed incomprehensible strings of letters and numbers in cheery colors i didnt see how the parasites could possibly survive in a matrix of that enzyme that ate your biotainer gloves but they were microencapsulated what standard trick for delivering drugs through a hostile environmentlike your stomach or maybe your bloodstreamto the target zone only this time used to deliver a disease when the microencapsulation passes out of the unfriendly environment into thechemically speakingfriendly zone it pops open releasing its load no loss no waste oh wonderful are you saying i now have the same shit bel has um clogston glanced up at a chrono on the wall how long since you were first exposed my lord miles followed his glance half an hour maybe they might be detectable in your bloodstream by now check it well have to open your suit to access a vein check it now fast clogston grabbed a sampler needle miles peeled back the biotainer wrap from his left wrist and gritted his teeth as a biocide swab stung and the needle poked clogston was pretty deft for a man wearing biotainer gloves miles had to concede he watched anxiously as the surgeon delicately slipped the needle into the analyzer how long will this take now that we have the template of the thing no time at all if its positive that is if this first sample shows negative id want a recheck every thirty minutes or so to be sure clogstons voice slowed as he studied his readout well um a recheck wont be necessary right miles snarled he yanked open his helmet and pushed back his suit sleeve he bent to his secured wrist com and snapped vorpatril yes vorpatrils voice came back instantly riding his com channelshe must be on duty in either the prince xav s own nav and com or maybe by now its tactics room wait what are you doing on this channel i thought you had no access the situation has changed never mind that now whats happening out there whats happening in there the medical team portmaster thorne and i are holed up in the infirmary for the moment were still in control of our environment i believe venn greenlaw and leutwyn are trapped in the number two freight nacelle roic may be somewhere in engineering and the ba i believe has seized nav and com can you confirm that last oh yes groaned vorpatril its talking to the quaddies on graf station right now making threats and demands boss watts seems to have inherited their hot seat i have a strike team scrambling patch it in here i have to hear this a few seconds delay then the bas voice sounded the betan accent was gone the academic coolness was fraying name does not matter if you wish to get the sealer the imperial auditor and the others back alive these are my requirements a jump pilot for this ship delivered immediately free and unimpeded passage from your system if either you or the barrayarans attempt to launch a military assault against the idris i will either blow up the ship with all aboard or ram the station boss wattss voice returned thick with tension if you attempt to ram graf station well blow you up ourselves either way will do the bas voice returned dryly did the ba know how to blow up a jumpship it wasnt exactly easy hell if the cetagandan was a hundred years old who know what all it knew how to do ramming nowwith a target that big and close any layman could manage it greenlaws stiff voice cut in her com link presumably was patched through to watts in the same way that miless was to vorpatril dont do it watts quaddiespace cannot let a plaguecarrier like this pass through to our neighbors a handful of lives cant justify the risk to thousands indeed the ba continued after a slight hesitation still in that same cool tone if you do succeed in killing me im afraid you will win yourselves another dilemma i have left a small gift aboard the station the experiences of gupta and portmaster thorne should give you an idea of what sort of package it is you might find it before it ruptures although id say your odds are poor where are your thousands now much closer to home true threat or bluff miles wondered frantically it certainly fit the bas style as demonstrated so farbel in the bod pod the booby trap with the suitcontrol joystickshideous lethal puzzles tossed out in the bas wake to disrupt and distract its pursuers it sure worked on me anyway vorpatril cut in privately on the wrist com in an unnecessarily lowered tense tone overriding the exchange between the ba and watts do you think the bastards bluffing mlord doesnt matter if its bluffing or not i want it alive oh god do i ever want it alive take that as a top priority and an order in the emperors voice admiral after a small and miles hoped thoughtful pause vorpatril returned understood my lord auditor ready your strike team yes vorpatrils best strike force was locked in quaddie detention what was the second best one like miless heart quailed but hold it this situation is extremely unstable i dont have any clear sense yet how it will play out put the bas channel back on miles returned his attention to the negotiation in progressnowinding up a jump pilot the ba seemed to be reiterating alone in a personnel pod to the number five b lock and ahnaked horribly there seemed to be a smile in that last word for obvious reasons the ba cut the com chapter sixteen now what delays miles guessed while the quaddies on graf station either readied a pilot or ran the risks of stalling about delivering one into such a hazard and suppose none volunteered while vorpatril marshaled his strike team while the three quaddie officials trapped in the freight nacellewell didnt sit on their hands miles betwhile this infection gains on me while the ba didwhat delay is not my friend but it was his gift what time was it anyway late eveningstill the same day that had started so early with the news of bels disappearance yes though it hardly felt possible surely he had entered some time warp miles stared at his wrist com took a deep terrified breath and called up ekaterins code had vorpatril told her anything of what was happening yet or had he kept her comfortably ignorant miles she answered at once ekaterin love where um are you the tactics room with admiral vorpatril ah that answered that question in a way he was relieved that he didnt have to deliver the whole litany of bad news himself cold youve been following this then more or less its been very confusing ill bet i he couldnt say it not so baldly he dodged while he mustered courage i promised to call nicol when i had news of bel and i havent had a chance the news as you may know is not good we found bel but the herm has been deliberately infected with a bioengineered cetagandan parasite that may may prove lethal yes i understand ive been hearing it all here in the tactics room good the medics are doing their best but its a race against time and now there are these other complications will you call nicol and redeem my word for me theres not no hope but she needs to know it doesnt look so good right now use your judgment how much to soften it my judgment is that she should be told plain truth the whole of graf station is in an uproar now what with the quarantine and biocontamination alert she needs to know exactly whats going on and she has a right to know ill call her at once oh good thank you i um you know i love you yes tell me something i dont know miles blinked this wasnt getting easier he rushed it in a breath well theres a chance i may have screwed up pretty badly here like i may not get out of this one the situation here is pretty unsettled and um im afraid my biotainer suit gloves were sabotaged by a nasty little cetagandan booby trap i triggered i seem to have got myself infected with the same biohazard thats taken bel down the stuff doesnt appear to act very quickly though in the background he could just hear admiral vorpatrils voice cursing in choice barracks language not at all consonant with the respect due to one of his majesty gregor vorbarras imperial auditors from ekaterin silence he strained to hear her breathing the sound reproduction on these highgrade com links was so excellent he could hear when she let her breath out again through those pursed exquisite warm lips he could not see or touch he began again im im sorry that i wanted to give youthis wasnt what ii never wanted to bring you grief miles stop that babbling at once oh uh yes her voice sharpened if you die on me out here i will not be grieved i will be pissed this is all very fine love but may i point out that you dont have time to indulge in angst right now youre the man who used to rescue hostages for a living you are not allowed to not get out of this one so stop worrying about me and start paying attention to what you are doing are you listening to me miles vorkosigan dont you dare die i wont have it that seemed definitive despite everything he grinned yes dear he sang back meekly heartened this womans vor ancestoresses had defended bastions in war oh yes so stop talking to me and get back to work right she almost kept the shaken sob out of that last word hold the fort love he breathed with all the tenderness he knew always he could hear her swallow always she cut her link he took it as a hint hostage rescue eh if you want something done right do it yourself come to think of it did this ba have any idea of what miless former line of work had been or did it assume miles was just a diplomat a bureaucrat another frightened civilian the ba could not know which of the party had triggered its booby trap on the repair suit remote controls either not that this biotainer suit hadnt been useless for space assault purposes even before it had been buggered all to hell but what tools were available here in this infirmary that might be put to uses their manufacturers had never envisioned and what personnel the medical crew had military training right enough and discipline they also were up to their collective elbows in other tasks of the highest priority miless very last desire was to pull them away from their cramped busy lab bench and critical patient care to go play commando with him although it may come to that thoughtfully he began walking about the infirmarys outer chamber opening drawers and cupboards and staring at their contents a muddy fatigue was beginning to drag at his edgy adrenalinepumped high and a headache was starting behind his eyes he studiously ignored the terror of it he glanced through the blue light bars into the ward the tech hurried from the bench heading toward the bathroom with something in his hands that trailed looping tubes captain clogston miles called the second suited figure turned yes my lord im shutting your inner door its supposed to close on its own in the event of a pressure change but im not sure i trust any remotecontrolled equipment on this ship at the moment are you prepared to move your patient into a bod pod if necessary clogston gave him a sketchy salute of acknowledgment with a gloved hand almost my lord were starting construction on the second blood filter if the first one works as well as i hope we should be ready to rig you up very soon too which would tie him down to a bunk in the ward he wasnt ready to lose mobility yet not while he could still move and think on his own you dont have much time then regardless of what the ba does thank you captain miles called let me know he slid the door shut with the manual override what could the ba know from nav and com more importantly what were its blind spots miles paced considering the layout of this central nacelle a long cylinder divided into three decks this infirmary lay at the stern on the uppermost deck nav and com was far forward at the other end of the middle deck the internal airseal doors of all levels lay at the three evenly spaced intersections to the freight and drive nacelles dividing each deck longitudinally into quarters nav and com had security vid monitors in all the outer airlocks of course and safety monitors on all the inner section doors that closed to seal the ship into airtight compartments blowing out a monitor would blind the ba but also give warning that the supposed prisoners were on the move blowing out all of them or all that could be reached would be more confusing but still left the problem of giving warning how likely was the ba to carry out its harried or perhaps insane threat of ramming the station dammit this was so unprofessional miles halted arrested by his own thought what were the standard operating procedures for a cetagandan agentanyones agent reallywhose covert mission was going down the toilet destroy all the evidence try to make it to a safe zone embassy or neutral territory if that wasnt possible destroy the evidence and then sit tight and endure arrest by the locals whoever the locals might be and wait for ones own side to either bail or bust one out depending for the really really critical missions destroy the evidence and commit suicide this last was seldom ordered because it was even more seldom carried out but the cetagandan ba were so conditioned to loyalty to their haut mastersand mistressesmiles was forced to consider it a more realistic possibility in the present case but splashy hostagetaking among neutrals or neighbors blaring the mission all over the news most of allmost of all the public use of the star crches most private arsenal this wasnt the modus operandi of a trained agent this was goddamned amateur work and miless superiors used to accuse him of being a loose cannonhah not any of his most direly inspired messes had ever been as forlorn as this one was shaping up to befor both sides alas this gratifying deduction did not unfortunately make the bas next action more predictable quite the reverse mlord roics voice rose unexpectedly from miless wrist com roic cried miles joyfully wait what the hell are you doing on this link you shouldnt be out of your suit i might ask you the same question mlord roic returned rather tartly if i had time but i had to get out of t pressure suit anyway to get into this work suit i think yes i can hang the com link in my helmet there a slight chink as of a faceplate closing can you still hear me oh yes i take it youre still in engineering for now i found you a real nice little pressure suit mlord and a lot of other tools question is how to get it to you stay away from all the airseal doorstheyre monitored have you found any cutting tools by chance im uh pretty sure thats what these are yes then move as far to the stern as you can get and cut straight up through the ceiling to the middle deck try to avoid damaging the air ducts and grav grid and control and fluid conduits for now or anything else that would make the boards light up in nav and com then we can place you for the next cut right mlord i was thinking something like that might do a few minutes ran by with nothing but the sound of roics breathing broken with a few undervoiced obscenities as by trial and error he discovered how to handle the unfamiliar equipment a grunt a hiss a clank abruptly cut off the roughandready procedure was going to play hell with the atmospheric integrity of the sections but did that necessarily make things any worse from the hostages point of view and a pressure suit oh bliss miles wondered if any of the powered work suits had been sized extrasmall almost as good as space armor indeed all right mlord came the welcome voice from his wrist com ive made it to the middle deck im moving back now im not exactly sure how close i am under you can you reach up to tap on the ceiling gently we dont want it to reverberate through the bulkheads all the way to nav and com miles threw himself prone opened his faceplate tilted his head and listened a faint banging apparently from out in the corridor can you move farther toward the stern ill try mlord its a question of getting these ceiling panels apart more heavy breathing there try now this time the rapping seemed to come from nearly under miless outstretched hand i think thats got it roic right mlord be sure youre not standing where im cutting i think lady vorkosigan would be right peeved with me if i accidentally lopped off any of your body parts i think so too miles rose ripped up a section of friction matting skittered to the side of the infirmarys outer chamber and held his breath a red glow in the bare deck plate beneath turned yellow then white the dot became a line which grew wavering in an irregular circle back to its beginning a thump as roics gloved paw powered by his suit punched up through the floor tearing the weakened circle from its matrix miles nipped over and stared down and grinned at roics face staring up in worry through the faceplate of another repair suit the hole was too small for that hulking figure to squeeze through but not too small for the pressure suit he handed up through it good job miles called down hang on ill be right with you mlord miles tore off the useless biotainer suit and crammed himself into the pressure suit in record time inevitably the plumbing was female and he left it unattached one way or another he didnt think he would be suited up for very long he was flushed and sweating one moment too hot the next too cold though whether from incipient infection or just plain overdriven nerves he scarcely knew the helmet supplied no place to hang his wrist com but a bit of medical tape solved that problem in a moment he lowered the helmet over his head and locked it into place breathing deeply of air that no one controlled but him reluctantly he set the suits temperature to chilly then he slid to the hole and dangled his legs through catch me dont squeeze too hardremember youre powered right mlord lord auditor vorkosigan came vorpatrils uneasy voice what are you doing reconnoitering roic caught his hips lowering him with exaggerated gentleness to the middle deck miles glanced up the corridor past the larger hole in its floor to the airseal doors at the far end of this sector solians security office is in this section if theres any control board on this bloody ship that can monitor without being monitored in turn itll be in there he tiptoed down the corridor roic lumbering in his wake the deck creaked beneath the armsmans booted feet miles tapped out the nowfamiliar code to the office door roic barely squeezed through behind him miles slid into the late lieutenant solians station chair and flexed his fingers contemplating the console he drew a breath and bent forward yes he could siphon off views from the vid monitors of every airlock on the shipsimultaneously if desired yes he could tap into the safety sensors on the airseal doors they were designed to take in a good view of anyone nearas in frantically pounding onthe doors nervously he checked the one for this middle rear section the vista if the ba was even looking at it with so much else going on did not extend as far as solians office door whew could he bring up a view of nav and com perhaps and spy secretly upon its current occupant roic said apprehensively what are you thinking of doing mlord im thinking that a surprise attack that has to stop to bore through six or seven bulkheads to get to the target isnt going to be surprising enough though we may come to that im running out of time he blinked hard then thought to hell with it and opened his faceplate to rub his eyes the vid image unblurred in his vision but still seemed to waver around the edges miles didnt think the problem was in the vid plate his headache which had started as a stabbing pain between his eyes seemed to be spreading to his temples which throbbed he was shivering he sighed and closed the faceplate again that bioshitthe admiral said you got t same bioshit the herm has the crap that melted guptas friends when did you talk to vorpatril just before i talked to you ah roic said lowly i shouldve been t one to run those remote controls not you it had to be me i was more familiar with the equipment yes roics voice went lower you shouldve brought jankowski mlord just a guessbased on long experience mind you miles paused frowning at the security display all right so solian didnt have a monitor in every cabin but he had to have private access to nav and com if he had anything but i suspect there will be enough heroism before this day is done to go around i dont think were going to have to ration it roic s not what i meant said roic in a dignified tone miles grinned blackly i know but think of how hard it would have been on ma jankowski and all the notsolittle jankowskis a soft snort from the com link taped inside miless helmet apprised him that ekaterin was back listening in she would not interrupt he suspected vorpatrils voice sounded suddenly breaking his concentration the admiral was sputtering the spineless scoundrels the fourarmed bastards my lord auditor ah miles was promoted again the goddamn little mutants are giving this sexless cetagandan plaguevector a jump pilot what miless stomach knotted tighter they found a volunteer quaddie or downsider there couldnt be that large a pool of possibilities to choose from the pilots surgically installed neurocontrollers had to fit the ships they guided through the wormhole jumps however many jump pilots were currently quarteredor trappedon graf station chances were that most would be incompatible with the barrayaran systems so was it the idris s own pilot or relief pilot or a pilot from one of the komarran sister ships what makes you think hes a volunteer snarled vorpatril i cant bloody believe theyre just handing maybe the quaddies are up to something what do they say vorpatril hesitated then spat watts cut me out of the loop a few minutes ago we were having an argument over whose strike team should go in ours or the quaddie militias and when and under whose orders both at once with no coordination struck me as a supremely bad idea indeed one perceives the potential hazards the ba was beginning to seem a trifle outnumbered but then there were its biothreats miless nascent sympathy died as his vision blurred again we are guests in their polity hang on something seems to be happening at one of the outer airlocks miles enlarged the security vid image from the lock that had suddenly come alive docking lights framing the outer door ran through a series of checks and goaheads the ba he reminded himself was probably looking at this same view he held his breath were the quaddies under the mask of delivering the demanded jump pilot about to attempt to insert their own strike force the airlock door slid open giving a brief glimpse of the inside of a tiny oneperson personnel pod a naked man the little silver contact circles of a jump pilots neural implant gleaming at midforehead and temples stepped through into the lock the door slid shut again tall darkhaired handsome but for the thin pink scars running miles could now see all over his body in a winding swathe dmitri corbeau his face was pale and set the jump pilot has just arrived miles told vorpatril dammit human or quaddie vorpatril was really going to have to work on his diplomatic vocabulary downsider miles answered in lieu of any more pointed remark he hesitated then added its lieutenant corbeau a stunned silence then vorpatril hissed sonofabitch hsh the ba is finally coming on miles adjusted the volume and opened his faceplate again so that vorpatril could overhear too as long as roic kept his suit sealed it was no worse than ever yeah and how bad is that again turn toward the security module and open your mouth the bas voice instructed coolly and without preamble over the lock vid monitor closer wider miles was treated to a fair view of corbeaus tonsils unless corbeau harbored a poisonfilled tooth no weapons were concealed therein very well the ba continued with a chill series of directions for corbeau to go through a humiliating sequence of gyrations which while not as thorough as a body cavity search gave at least some assurance that the jump pilot carried nothing there either corbeau obeyed precisely without hesitation or argument his expression rigid and blank now release the pod from the docking clamps corbeau rose from his last squat and stepped through the lock to the personnel hatch entry area a chink and a clankthe pod released but unpowered drifted away from the side of the idris now listen to these instructions you will walk twenty meters toward the bow turn left and wait for the next door to open for you corbeau obeyed still almost expressionless except for his eyes his gaze darted about as if he searched for something or was trying to memorize his route he passed out of sight of the lock vids miles considered the peculiar pattern of old worm scars across corbeaus body he must have rolled or been rolled across a bad nest a story seemed written in those fading hieroglyphs a young colonial boy perhaps the new boy in camp or towntricked or dared or maybe just stripped and pushed to rise again from the ground crying and frightened to the jangle of some cruel mockery vorpatril swore repetitively under his breath why corbeau why corbeau miles who was frantically wondering the same thing hazarded perhaps he volunteered unless the bloody quaddies bloody sacrificed him instead of risking one of their own or maybe hes figured out another way to desert i miles held his words for a long moment of thought then let them out on a breath think that would be doing it the hard way it was a sticky suspicion though just whose ally might corbeau prove miles caught corbeaus image again as the ba walked him through the ship toward nav and com briefly opening and closing airseal doors he passed through the last barrier and out of vid range straightbacked silent bare feet padding quietly on the deck he looked cold miless attention was jerked aside by the flicker of another airlock sensor alarm hastily he called up the image of another lockjust in time to see a quaddie in a green biotainer suit whap the vid monitor mightily with a spanner while beyond two more green figures sped past the image shattered and went dark he could still hear thoughthe beep of the lock alarm the hiss of a lock door openingbut no hiss when it closed because it did not close or because it closed on vacuum air and sound returned as the lock cycled the lock therefore had opened on vacuum the quaddies had made their getaway into space around the station that answered his question about their biotainer suitsunlike the idris s cheaper issue they were vacuumrated in quaddiespace that made all kinds of sense half a dozen station locks offered refuge within little more than a few hundred meters the fleeing quaddies would have their pick in addition to whatever pods or shuttles hovered nearby able to swoop down on them and take them inboard venn and greenlaw and leutwyn just escaped out an airlock he reported to vorpatril good timing shrewd timing to go just when the ba was both distracted by the arrival of its pilot and with the real possibility of a getaway now in hand less inclined to carry out the stationramming threat it was exactly the right move to leak hostages from the enemys grip at every opportunity granted this use of corbeaus arrival was ruthlessly calculated in the extreme miles could not be sorry good excellent now this ship is entirely cleared of civilians except for you mlord roic pointed out started to say something else intercepted the dark look miles cast over his shoulder and ran down in a mumble ha muttered vorpatril maybe this will change wattss mind his voice lowered as if directed away from his audio pickup or behind his hand what lieutenant then murmured excuse me miles was not certain to whom so only barrayarans left aboard now plus belon the impsec payroll therefore an honorary barrayaran for all mortal accounting purposes miles smiled briefly despite it all as he considered bels probable outraged response to such a suggestion the best time to insert a strike force would be before the ship started to move rather than to attempt to play catchup in midspace at some point vorpatril was probably going to stop waiting for quaddie permission to launch his men at some point miles would agree miles returned his attention to the problem of spying on nav and com if the ba had knocked out the monitor the way the passing quaddies just had or even merely thrown a jacket over the vid pickup miles would be out of luck ah finally an image of nav and com formed over his vid plate but now he had no sound miles gritted his teeth and bent forward the vid pickup was apparently centered over the door giving a good view over the half dozen empty station chairs and their dark consoles the ba was there still dressed in the betan garb of its discarded alias jacket and sarong and sandals although a pressure suitoneabstracted from the idris s supplies lay nearby flung over the back of a station chair corbeau still vulnerably naked was seated in the pilots chair but had not yet lowered his headset the ba held up a hand said something corbeau frowned fiercely and flinched as the ba pressed a hypospray briefly against the pilots upper arm and stepped back with a flash of satisfaction on its strained face drugs surely even the ba was not mad enough to drug a jump pilot upon whose neural function it would shortly be betting its life some disease inoculation the same problem applied although something latent might docooperate and later i will let you have the antidote or pure bluff a shot of water perhaps the hypospray seemed altogether too crude and obvious as a cetagandan drug administration method it hinted at bluff to miless mind though perhaps not to corbeaus one had no choice but to turn control over to the pilot when he lowered his headset and plugged the ship into his mind it made pilots hard to effectively threaten it did rather put paid to vorpatrils paranoid fear that corbeau had turned traitor volunteering for this as a way to get a free ride out of his quaddie detention cell and his dilemmas or did it regardless of prior or secret agreements the ba would not simply trust when it could it would think guarantee over his wrist com muffled as from a distance miles heard a sudden startling bellow from admiral vorpatril what thats impossible have they gone mad not now after a few more moments passed without further enlightenment he murmured um ekaterin are you still there her breath drew in yes whats going on admiral vorpatril was called away by his communications officer some sort of priority message from sector five headquarters just arrived it seems to be something very urgent on the vid image in front of him miles watched as corbeau began to run through preflight checks moving from station to station under the hard watchful eyes of the ba corbeau made sure to move with disproportional care apparently from the movement of his rather stiff lips explaining each move before he touched a console and slowly miles noted rather more slowly than necessary if not quite slowly enough to be obvious about it vorpatrils voice or rather vorpatrils heavy breathing returned at last the admiral appeared to have run out of invective miles found that considerably more disturbing than his previous naval bellowing my lord vorpatril hesitated his voice dropped to a sort of stunned growl i have just received priority one orders from sector five hq to marshal my escort ships abandon the komarran fleet and head for fleet rendezvous off marilac at maximum possible speed not with my wife you dont was miless first gyrating thought then he blinked freezing in his seat the other function of the military escorts barrayar donated to the komarran trade fleets was to quietly and unobtrusively maintain an armed force dispersed through the nexus a force that could in the event of a truly dire emergency be collected rapidly so as to present a convincing military threat at key strategic points in a crunch it might otherwise be too slow or even diplomatically or militarily impossible to get any force from the homeworlds through the wormhole jumps of intervening local space polities to the mustering places where it could do barrayar some good but the trade fleets were out there already the planet of marilac was a barrayaran ally at the back door of the cetagandan empire from barrayars point of view in the complex web of wormhole jump routes that strung the nexus together a second front as rho cetas immediate neighborly threat to komarr was considered the first front granted the cetagandans had the shorter lines of communication and logistics between the two points of contact but the strategic pincer still beat hell out of the sound of one hand clapping particularly with the potential addition of marilacan forces the barrayarans would only be marshaling at marilac in order to offer a threat to cetaganda except that when miles and ekaterin had left barrayar on this belated honeymoon trip relations between the two empires had been about aswell cordial was perhaps not quite the right termabout as unstrained as they had been in years what the hell could have changed that so profoundly and so quickly something has stirred up the cetagandans around rho ceta gregor had said a few jumps out from rho ceta guppy and his smuggler friends had offloaded a strange live cargo from a cetagandan government ship one with lots of fancy markings a screamingbird pattern perhaps along with one and only one personone survivor after which the ship had tilted away on a dangerous inbound course for the systems suns what if that trajectory hadnt been a swing around what if it had been a straight dive with no return sonuvabitch breathed miles my lord said vorpatril if quiet snapped miles the admirals silence was shocked but it held once a year the most precious cargoes of the haut race left the star crche on the capital world of eta ceta eight ships bound each for one of the planets of the empire so curiously ruled by the haut each carrying that years cohort of haut embryos genetically modified and certified results of all the contracts of conception so carefully negotiated the prior year between the members of the great constellations the clans the carefully cultivated genelines of the haut race each load of a thousand or so nascent lives conducted by one of the eight most important haut ladies of the empire the planetary consorts who were the steering committee of the star crche all most private most secret most nevertobediscussed with outsiders how was it that a ba agent could not go back for more copies if it lost such a cargo of future haut lives in transit when it wasnt an agent at all when it was a renegade the crime isnt murder miles whispered his eyes widening the crime is kidnapping the murders had come subsequently in an increasingly panicked cascade as the ba with good reason attempted to bury its trail well guppy and his friends had surely been planned to die as eyewitnesses to the fact that one person had not gone down with the rest on the doomed ship a ship hijacked if briefly before its destructionall the best hijackings were inside jobs oh yes the cetagandan government must be going insane over this my lord are you all right ekaterins voice in a fierce whisper no dont interrupt him hes thinking he just makes those funny leaking noises when hes thinking from the celestial gardens point of view a star crche childship had disappeared on what should have been a safe route to rho ceta every rescue force and intelligence agent the cetagandan empire owned would have been flung into the case if it were not for guppy the tragedy might have passed as some mysterious malfunction that had sent the ship tumbling out of control and unable to signal to its fiery doom no survivors no wreckage no loose ends but there was guppy leaving a messy trail of wildly suggestive evidence behind him with every flopping footfall how far behind could the cetagandans be by now too close for the bas comfort obviously it was a wonder when guppy had popped up on the hostel railing that the ba hadnt just died of heart failure without any need for the rivet gun but the bas trail marked by guppy with blazing flares led straight through from the scene of the crime to the heart of a sometimesenemy empirebarrayar what were the cetagandans making of it all well we have a clue now dont we right breathed miles then more crisply right youre recording all this i trust so my first order in the emperors voice admiral is to countermand your rendezvous orders from sector five that was what you were about to ask for yes thank you my lord auditor yes said vorpatril gratefully normally that would be a call i would rather die than disregard but given our present situation they are going to have to wait a little vorpatril wasnt selfdramatizing this was delivered as a plain statement of fact not too long i hope they are going to have to wait a lot this is my next order in the emperors voice clear copy everythingeverything you have on record here from the past twentyfour hours and squirt it back on an open channel at the highest priority to the imperial residence to the barrayaran high command on barrayar to impsec hq and to impsec galactic affairs on komarr and he took a breath and raised his voice to override vorpatrils outraged cry of clear copy at a time like this marked from lord auditor miles vorkosigan of barrayar to the most urgent personal attention of ghemgeneral dag benin chief of imperial security the celestial garden eta ceta personal urgent most urgent by rians hair this ones real dag exactly those words what screamed vorpatril then hastily lowered his tone to an anguished repeat what a rendezvous at marilac can only mean imminent war with the cetagandans we cant hand them that kind of intelligence on our position and movementsgiftwrapped obtain the complete unedited graf station security recording of the interrogation of russo gupta and send it along too as soon as you possibly can sooner new terror shook miles a vision like a fever dream the grand faade of vorkosigan house in the barrayaran capital of vorbarr sultana with plasma fire raining down upon it its ancient stone melting like butter two fluidfilled canisters exploding in steam or a fog of plague leaving all the houses protectors dead in heaps in the halls or fled to die in the streets two almost ripe replicators running down unattended stopping slowly chilling their tiny occupants dying for lack of oxygen drowning in their own amniotic fluid his past and his future all destroyed together nikki toowould he be swept up with the other children in some frantic rescue or left uncounted unmissed fatally alone miles had fancied himself growing into a good stepfather to nikkithat was called into deep question now eh ekaterin im sorry it would be hoursdaysbefore the new tightbeam could get back to barrayar and cetaganda insanely upset people could make fatal mistakes in mere minutes seconds and if you are a praying man vorpatril pray that no one will do anything stupid before it gets there and that we will be believed lady vorkosigan vorpatril whispered urgently could he be hallucinating from the disease no no she soothed hes just thinking too fast and leaving out all the intervening steps he does that it can be very frustrating miles love um for the rest of us would you mind unpacking that a little more he took a breathand two or three moreto stop his trembling the ba its not an agent on a mission its a criminal a renegade perhaps insane i believe it hijacked the annual haut childship to rho ceta sent the vessel into the nearest sun with all aboardprobably murdered alreadyand made off with its cargo which transshipped through komarr and which left the barrayaran empire on a trade ship belonging to empress laisa personally and just how incriminating that particular detail is going to look to certain minds inside the star crche i shrink to imagine the cetagandans think we stole their babies or colluded in the theft and dear god murdered a planetary consort and so they are about to make war on us bymistake oh said vorpatril blankly the bas whole safety lay in perfect secrecy because once the cetagandans got on the right trail they would never rest till they tracked this crime down but the perfect plan cracked when gupta didnt die on schedule guptas frantic antics drew solian in drew you in drew me in his voice slowed except what in the world does the ba want those haut infants for ekaterin offered hesitantly could it be stealing them for someone else yes but the ba arent supposed to be subornable well if not for pay or some bribe maybe blackmail or threat maybe threat to some haut to whom the ba is loyal or maybe some faction in the star crche miles supplied except the ghemlords do factions the haut lords do factions the star crche has always moved as oneeven when it was committing arguable treason a decade ago the haut ladies took no separate decisions the star crche committed treason echoed vorpatril in astonishment this certainly didnt get out are you sure i never heard of any mass executions that high in the empire back then and i should have he paused and added in a baffled tone how could a bunch of hautlady babymakers commit treason anyway it didnt quite come off for various reasons miles cleared his throat lord auditor vorkosigan this is your com link yes are you there a new voice and a very welcome one broke in sealer greenlaw miles cried happily have you made it to safety all of you we are back aboard graf station replied the sealer it seems premature to call it safety and you still trapped aboard the idris although not totally without resources or ideas i urgently need to speak to you you can override that hothead vorpatril ah my com link is sustaining an open audio link with admiral vorpatril now maam you can speak to both of us at once if you like miles put in hastily before she could express herself even more freely she hesitated only fractionally good we absolutely need vorpatril to hold repeat hold any strike force of his corbeau confirms the ba does have some sort of a remote control or deadman switch on his person apparently linked back to the biohazard it has hidden aboard graf station the ba is not bluffing miles glanced up in surprise at his silent vid of nav and com corbeau was seated now in the pilots station chair the control headset lowered over his skull his expressionless face even more absent corbeau confirms how he was stark nakedthe ba is watching him every second subcutaneous com link there was no time to find and insert one he undertook to blink the ships running lights in a prearranged code whose idea was that his quick colonial boy the pilot was on their side oh but that was good to know miless shivering was turning to shudders every adult quaddie on graf station not on emergency duty is out looking for the biobomb now greenlaw continued but we have no idea what it looks like or how big it is or if it is disguised as something else or if there is more than one we are trying to evacuate as many children as possible into what ships and shuttles we have on hand and seal them off but we cant even be sure of them really if you people do anything to set this mad creature offif you launch an unauthorized strike force before this vicious threat is found and safely neutralizedi swear i will give our militia the order to shoot them out of space myself do you copy admiral confirm i hear you said vorpatril reluctantly but maamthe imperial auditor himself has been infected with one of the bas lethal bioagents i cannoti will notif i have to sit here and do nothing while listening to him die there are fifty thousand innocent lives on graf station admirallord auditor her voice failed for a second returned stiffly i am sorry lord vorkosigan im not dead yet miles replied rather primly a new and most unwelcome sensation struggled with the tight fear grinding in his belly he added im going to switch off my com link for just a moment ill be right back motioning roic to keep still miles opened the door to the security office stepped into the corridor opened his faceplate leaned over and vomited onto the floor no help for it with an angry swipe he turned his suit temperature back up he blinked back the green dizziness wiped his mouth went back inside seated himself again and called his link back on continue he let vorpatrils and greenlaws arguing voices fade from his attention and studied his view of nav and com more closely one object had to be there somewhere ah there it was a small valisesized cryofreezer case set carefully down next to one of the empty station chairs near the door a standard commercial model no doubt bought off the shelf from some medical supplier here on graf station sometime in the past few days all of this this entire diplomatic mess this extravagant trail of deaths winding across half the nexus two empires teetering on the verge of war came down to that miles was reminded of the old barrayaran folktale about the evil mutant magician who kept his heart in a box to hide it from his enemies yes greenlaw miles broke in do you have any way to signal back to corbeau we designated one of the navigation buoys that broadcasts to the channels of the pilots on cyberneuro control we cant get voice communication through itcorbeau wasnt sure how it would emerge in his perceptions we are certain we can get some kind of simple code blink or beep through it i have a simple message for him urgent get it through if you possibly can however you can tell him to open all the inner airseal doors in the middle deck of the central nacelle kill the security vids there too if he can why she asked suspiciously we have personnel trapped there who are going to die shortly if he doesnt miles replied glibly well it was true right she rapped back ill see what we can do he cut his outgoing voice link turned in his station chair and made a throatcutting motion for roic to do the same he leaned forward can you hear me yes mlord roics voice was muffled through the work suits thicker faceplate but sufficiently audible they neither of them had to shout in this quiet little space greenlaw will never order or permit a strike force to be launched to try to capture the ba not hers not ours she cant there are too many quaddie lives up for grabs trouble is i dont think this placating approach will make her station any safer if this ba really murdered a planetary consort itll not even blink at a few thousand quaddies itll promise cooperation right up to the last then hit the release switch on its biobomb and jump just for the off chance that the chaos in its wake will delay or disrupt pursuit an extra day or three are you with me so far yes mlord roics eyes were wide if we can get as close as the door to nav and com unseen i think we have a chance of jumping the ba ourselves specifically you will jump the ba i will supply a distraction youll be all right stunner and nerve disruptor fire will pretty much bounce off that work suit needler spines wouldnt penetrate immediately either if it comes to that and it would take longer than the seconds youll need to cross that little room for plasma arc fire to burn through it roics lips twisted what if he just fires at you that pressure suits notthat good the ba wont fire at me that i promise you the cetagandan haut and their siblings the ba are physically stronger than anyone but the dedicated heavyworlders but theyre not stronger than a power suit go for his hands hold them if we get that far well the rest will follow and corbeau the poor bastards starkers nothings gonna stop anything fired at him corbeau said miles will be the bas last choice of targets ah his eyes widened and he whirled about in his station chair at the edge of the vid image half a dozen tiny images in the array were quietly going dark get to the corridor get ready to run as silently as you can from his com link vorpatrils volumereduced voice pleaded heartrendingly for the imperial auditor to please reopen his outgoing voice contact he urged lady vorkosigan to request the same leave him alone ekaterin said firmly he knows what hes doing what is he doing vorpatril wailed something her voice fell to a whisper or perhaps it was a prayer good luck love another voice somewhat offsides broke in captain clogston admiral can you reach lord auditor vorkosigan weve finished preparing his blood filter and are ready to try it but hes disappeared out of the infirmary he was right here a few minutes ago do you hear that lord vorkosigan vorpatril tried somewhat desperately you are to report to the infirmary now in ten minutesfivethe medics could have their way with him miles pushed up from his station chairhe had to use both handsand followed roic into the corridor outside solians office up ahead in the dimness the first airseal door across the corridor hissed quietly aside revealing the crosscorridor to the other nacelles beyond on the far side the next door began to slide roic started trotting his steps were unavoidably heavy miles halfjogged behind he tried to think how recently he had used his seizurestimulator how much at risk he was right now for falling down in a fit from a combination of bad brain chemistry and terror middling risky he decided no automatic weapons for him this trip anyway no weapons at all but for his wits they seemed a meager arsenal just at the moment the second pair of doors opened for them then the third miles prayed they were not walking into another clever trap but he didnt think the ba would have any way of tapping or even guessing this oblique line of communication roic paused briefly stepping behind the last door edge and peered ahead the door to nav and com was shut he gave a short nod and continued forward miles in his shadow as they drew closer miles could see that the control panel to the left of the door had been burned out by some cutting tool cousin no doubt to the one roic had used the ba had gone shopping in engineering too miles pointed at it roics face lightened and a corner of his mouth turned up someone hadnt forgotten to lock the door behind them when theyd last left after all it appeared roic pointed to himself to the door miles shook his head and motioned him to bend closer they touched helmets me first gotta grab that case before the ba can react sides i need you to pull back the door roic looked around inhaled and nodded miles motioned him back down to touch helmets one more time and roic im glad i didnt bring jankowski roic smiled miles stepped aside now delay was no ones friend roic bent splayed his gloved hands across the door pressed and pulled the servos in his suit whined at the load the door creaked unwillingly aside miles slipped through he didnt look back or up his world had narrowed to one goal one object the freezer casethere still on the floor beside the absent communication officers station chair he pounced grabbed lifted it up clutched it to his chest like a shield like the hope of his heart the ba was turning yelling lips drawn back eyes wide its hand snaking for a pocket miless gloved fingers felt for the catches if locked toss the case toward the ba if unlocked the case snapped open miles yanked it wide shook it hard swung it a silver cascade the better part of a thousand tiny tissuesampling cryostorage needles arced out of the case and bounced randomly across the deck some shattered as they struck making tiny crystalline singing noises like dying insects some spun some skittered disappearing behind station chairs and into crevices miles grinned fiercely the yell became a scream the bas hands shot out toward miles as if in supplication in denial in despair the cetagandan began to stumble toward him gray face working in shock and disbelief roics powersuited hands locked down over the bas wrists and hoisted wrist bones crackled and popped blood spurted between the tightening gloved fingers the bas body convulsed as it was lifted up wild eyes rolled back the scream transmuted into a weird wail trailing away sandalclad feet kicked and drummed uselessly at the heavy shin plating of roics work suit toenails split and bled without effect roic stood stolidly hands up and apart racking the ba helplessly in the air miles let the freezer case fall from his fingers it hit the deck with a thump with a whispered word he called back the outgoing audio in his com link weve taken the ba prisoner send relief troops in biotainer suits they wont need their guns now im afraid the ships an unholy mess his knees were buckling he sank to the deck himself giggling uncontrollably corbeau was rising from his pilots chair miles motioned him away with an urgent gesture stay back dmitri im about to he wrenched his faceplate open in time barely the vomiting and spasms that wrung his stomach this time were much worse its over can i please die now except that it wasnt over not nearly greenlaw had played for fifty thousand lives now it was miless turn to play for fifty million chapter seventeen miles arrived back in the idris s infirmary feet first he was carried by two of the men from vorpatrils strike force which had been hastily converted to mostly a medical relief team and as such cleared by the quaddies his porters almost fell down the unsightly hole roic had left in the floor miles seized back personal control of his locomotion long enough to stand up under his own power and lean rather unsteadily against the wall by the door to the bioisolation ward roic followed carefully holding the bas remote trigger in a biotainer bag corbeau stifffaced and pale brought up the rear dressed in a loose medical tunic and drawstring pants and shepherded by a medtech with the bas hypospray in another biotainer sack captain clogston came out through the buzzing blue barriers and looked over his new influx of patients and assistants right he announced glowering at the gap in the deck this ship is so damned befouled im declaring the whole thing a level three biocontamination zone so we may as well spread out and get comfortable boys the techs made a human chain to pass the analyzing equipment quickly to the outer chamber miles snared the chance for a few brief urgent words with the two men with medical markings on their suits who stood apart from the restthe prince xav s military interrogation officers not really in disguise merely discreetand miles had to allow they were medically trained the second ward was declared a temporary holding cell for their prisoner the ba who followed in the procession bound to a float pallet miles scowled as the pallet drifted past towed on its control lead by a watchful muscular sergeant the ba was strapped down tightly but its head and eyes rolled oddly and its salivaflecked lips writhed above almost anything else it was essential to keep the ba in barrayaran hands finding where the ba had hidden its filthy biobomb on graf station was the first priority the haut race had some genetically engineered immunity to the most common interrogation drugs and their derivatives if fastpenta didnt work on this one it would give the quaddies very little in the way of interrogation procedures to fall back upon that would pass adjudicator leutwyns approval in this emergency military rules seemed more appropriate than civilian ones in other words if theyll just leave us alone well pull out the bas fingernails for them miles caught clogston by the elbow how is bel thorne doing he demanded the fleet surgeon shook his head not well my lord auditor we thought at first the herm was improving as the filters cut init seemed to return to consciousness but then it became restless moaning and trying to talk out of its head i think it keeps crying for admiral vorpatril vorpatril why wait did bel say vorpatril miles asked sharply or just the admiral clogston shrugged vorpatrils the only admiral around right now although i suppose the portmaster could be hallucinating altogether i hate to sedate anyone so physiologically distressed especially when theyve just fought their way out of a drug fog but if that herm doesnt calm down well have to miles frowned and hurried into the isolation ward clogston followed miles pulled off his helmet fished his wrist com back out of it and clutched the vital link safely in his hand a tech was making up the hastily cleared second bunk readying it for the infected lord auditor presumably bel now lay on the first bunk dried off and dressed in a pale green barrayaran militaryissue patient tunic which seemed at first heartening progress but the herm was grayfaced lips purpleblue eyelids fluttering an iv pump not dependent upon potentially erratic ships gravity infused yellow fluid rapidly into bels right arm the left arm was strapped to a board plastic tubing filled with blood ran from under a bandage and into a hybrid appliance bound around with quantities of plastic tape a second tube ran back again its dark surface moist with condensation s balla bel moaned s balla the fleet surgeons lips pursed in medical displeasure behind his faceplate he edged forward to glance at a monitor blood pressures way up too i think its time to knock the poor bugger back out wait miles elbowed to the edge of bels bunk to put himself in bels line of sight staring down at the herm in wild hope bels head jerked the eyelids flickered up the eyes widened the blue lips tried to move again bel licked them took a long inhalation and tried once more admral portent s bastid hid it in the balla tol me sadistc bastid still going on about admiral vorpatril clogston muttered in dismay not admiral vorpatril me breathed miles did that witty mind still exist in the bunker of its brain bels eyes were open shifting to try to focus on him as if miless image wavered and blurred in the herms sight bel knew a portent no bel was trying to say something important bel wrestled death for the possession of its own mouth to try to get the message out balla ballistic balalaika noballet miles said urgently the ba hid its biobomb at the balletin the minchenko auditorium is that what youre trying to say bel the straining body sagged in relief yeh yeh get s word out in the lights i thin was there only one bomb or were there more did the ba say could you tell don know s homemade i thin check purchses right got it good work captain thorne you always were the best bel miles turned half away and spoke forcefully into his wrist com demanding to be patched through to greenlaw or venn or watts or somebody in authority on graf station a ragged female voice finally replied yes sealer greenlaw are you there her voice steadied yes lord vorkosigan do you have something maybe bel thorne reports the ba said that it hid the biobomb somewhere in the minchenko auditorium possibly behind some lights her breath drew in good well concentrate our trained searchers in there bel also thinks the bomb was something the ba rigged itself recently it may have made purchases on graf station in the persona of ker dubauer that could give you a clue as to how many it could have devised ah right ill get venns people on it note bels in pretty bad shape also the ba could have been lying get back to me when you know something yes yes thank you hastily she cut her com it occurred to miles to wonder if she was locked down in protective bioisolation right now too as he was about to be trying to shape the critical moment at a similar frustrating remove bastid bel muttered paralyzed me put me in s damn bod pod tol me then zipped it up left me to die magining knew it knew about nicol n me saw my vid cube wheres m vid cube nicol is safe miles assured bel well as much as any quaddie on graf station at the momentif not safe at least warned vid cube oh the little imager full of bels hypothetical children your vid cube is put away safely miles had no idea if this last was true or notthe cube might be still in bels pocket destroyed with the herms contaminated clothes or stolen by the ba but the assertion gave bel ease the exhausted herms eyes closed again and its breathing steadied in a few hours im going to look like that then youd better not waste any time now eh with a vast distaste miles suffered a hovering tech to help him off with his pressure suit and underwearto be taken away and incinerated miles supposed if youre tying me down here i want a comconsole set up by my bunk immediately no you cant have that miles fended off the tech who was now trying to pry loose his com link then paused to swallow and something for nausea all right put it around my right arm then horizontal was scarcely better than vertical miles smoothed down his own pale green tunic and gave up his left arm to the surgeon who personally attended to piercing his vein with some medical awl that felt the size of a drinking straw on the other side a tech pressed a hypospray against his right shouldera potion that would kill the dizziness and the cramping in his stomach he hoped but he didnt yelp until the first spurt of filtered blood returned to his body crap thats cold i hate cold cant be helped my lord auditor clogston murmured soothingly we have to lower your body temperature at least three degrees it will buy time miles hunched uncomfortably reminded that they didnt have a fix for this yet he stifled a gush of terror escaping under pressure from the place hed kept it locked for the past hours not for one second would he allow himself to believe that there was no cure to be had that this bioshit would drag him under and this time he wouldnt come back up wheres roic he raised his right wrist to his lips roic im in the outer chamber mlord im afraid to carry this triggering device through the biobarrier till were sure its disarmed right good thinking one of those fellows out there should be the bomb disposal tech i requested find him and give it to him then ride herd on the interrogation for me will you yes mlord captain clogston the doctor glanced down from where he fiddled with the juryrigged blood filter my lord the moment you have a medtechno a doctor the moment you have some qualified men free send them to the cargo hold where the ba has the replicators i want them to run samples try to see if the ba has contaminated or poisoned them in any way then make sure the equipments all running all right its very important that the haut infants all be kept alive and well yes lord vorkosigan if the haut babies were inoculated with the same vile parasites presently rioting through his own body might the replicators temperature be turned down to chill them all and slow the disease process or would such cold stress the infants damage them he was borrowing trouble reasoning in advance of his data a trained agent conditioned to the correct disconnect between action and imagination might have performed such an inoculation cleaning up every bit of incriminating highhaut dna before abandoning the scene but this ba was an amateur this ba had another sort of conditioning altogether yes but that conditioning must have gone very wrong somehow or this ba wouldnt have got this far miles added as clogston turned away and give me word on the condition of the pilot corbeau as soon as you have it the retreating suited figure raised a hand in acknowledgment in a few minutes roic entered the ward he had doffed the bulky powered work suit and now wore more comfortable militaryissue level three biotainer garb hows it going over there roic ducked his head not well mlord t ba has gone into some sort of strange mental state raving but nothing to the point and the intelligence fellows say its physiological state is all out of kilter as well theyre trying to stabilize it the ba must be kept alive miles struggled halfup a vision of having himself carried into the next chamber to take charge running through his head we have to get it back to cetaganda to prove barrayar is innocent he sank back and eyed the humming device filtering his blood hung by his left side pulling out parasites yes but also draining the energy the parasites had stolen from him to create themselves siphoning off the mental edge he desperately needed right now he remarshaled his scattering thoughts and explained to roic the news bel had imparted return to the interrogation room and give them the word on this development see if they can get any crossconfirmation on the hiding place in the minchenko auditorium and especially see if they can get anything that would suggest if there is more than one device or not right roic nodded he glanced over miless growing array of medical attachments by the way mlord had you happened to mention your seizure disorder to the surgeon yet not yet there hasnt been time right roics lips screwed up thoughtfully in an editorial fashion that miles chose to ignore ill see to it then shall i mlord miles hunched yeah yeah roic trod out of the ward on both his errands the remote comconsole arrived a tech swung a tray across miless lap laid the vid plate frame upon it and helped him sit mostly up with extra pillows at his back he was starting to shiver again all right good the device was barrayaran military issue not just scavenged from the idris he had a securable visual link again now he entered codes vorpatrils face was a moment or two coming up riding herd on all this from the prince xav s tactics room the admiral no doubt had a few other demands on his attention at the moment he appeared at last with a yes my lord his eyes searched the image of miles on his vid display he apparently was not reassured by the view his jaw tightened in dismay are you all he began but edited this fatuity on the fly to how bad is it i can still talk and while i can still talk i need to record some orders while were waiting on the quaddies search for the biobombare you following the latest on that miles brought the admiral up to the moment on bels intelligence about the minchenko auditorium and went on meanwhile i want you to select and prepare the fastest ship in your escort that has a sufficient capacity for the load its going to be carrying which will be me portmaster thorne a medical team our prisoner the ba and guards guppy the jacksonian smuggler if i can pry him out of quaddie hands and a thousand working uterine replicators with qualified medical attendants and me put in ekaterins voice firmly from offsides her face leaned briefly into range of vorpatrils vid pickup and she frowned at him shed seen her husband looking like death on a plate more than once before though perhaps she wouldnt be as disturbed as the admiral clearly was having an imperial auditor get melted to steaming slime on his watch would be a notable black mark not that vorpatrils career wasnt in a shambles over this episode already my courier ship will travel in convoy carrying lady vorkosigan he cut across ekaterins beginning objection i may well need one spokesperson along who isnt in medical quarantine she settled back with a dubious hm but i want to make damned sure were not impeded by any hassles along the way admiral so have your fleet department start working immediately on our passage clearances in all the local space polities were going to have to cross speed speed is of the essence i want to get away the moment were sure the bas devildevice has been cleared from graf station at least with us carrying all these biohazards no one is going to want to stop and board us for inspections to komarr my lord or sergyar no calculate the shortest possible jump route directly to rho ceta vorpatrils head jerked back in startlement if the orders i received from sector five hq mean what we think youll hardly get passage there reception by plasma fire and fusion shells the moment you pop out of the wormhole would be what id expect unpack miles ekaterins voice drifted in he grinned briefly at the familiar exasperation in her voice by the time we arrive there i will have arranged our clearances with the cetagandan empire i hope or else they were all going to be in more trouble than miles ever wanted to imagine barrayar is bringing their kidnapped haut babies back to them on the end of a long stick i get to be the stick ah said vorpatril his gray brows rising in speculation give a headsup to my impsec courier pilot i plan to start the moment we have everyone and everything transferred aboard you can start on the everything part now understood my lord vorpatril rose and vanished out of vid range ekaterin moved back in and smiled at him well were making some progress at last miles said to her with what he hoped seemed good cheer and not suppressed hysteria her smile twisted up on one side her eyes were warm though some progress what do you call an avalanche i wonder no arctic metaphors please im cold enough if the medicos get this infestation under control en route perhaps theyll clear me for visitors well want the courier ship later anyway a medtech appeared drew a blood sample from the outbound tube added an iv pump to the array raised the bed rails then bent and began tying down the left arm board hey objected miles how am i supposed to unravel all this mess with one hand tied behind my back captain clogstons orders mlord auditor firmly the tech finished securing his arm standard procedure for seizure risk miles gritted his teeth your seizurestimulator is with the rest of your things aboard the kestrel ekaterin observed dispassionately ill find it and send it across as soon as i transfer back aboard prudently miles limited his response to thank you check back with me before you dispatch itthere may be a few other things ill need let me know when youre safely aboard yes love she touched her fingers to her lips and held them up passing them through his image before her he returned the gesture his heart chilled a little as her image winked out how long before they dared touch flesh to warm flesh again what if its never damn but im cold the tech departed miles hunched down in his bed he supposed it would be futile to ask for blankets he imagined little tiny biobombs set to go off all through his body sparking like a midsummer fireworks display seen at a distance out over the river in vorbarr sultana cascading to a grand lethal finale he imagined his flesh decomposing into corrosive ooze while he yet lived in it he needed to think about something else two empires both alike in indignation maneuvering for position massing deadly force behind a dozen wormhole jumps each jump a point of contact conflict catastrophe that was no better a thousand almostripe haut fetuses turning in their little chambers unaware of the distance and dangers they had passed through and the hazards still to comehow soon would they have to be decanted the picture of a thousand squalling infants dropped upon a few harried barrayaran military medicos was almost enough to make him smile if only he wasnt so primed to start screaming bels breath in the next bunk was thick and labored speed for every reason speed had he set in motion everyone and everything that he could he ran down checklists in his aching head lost his place tried again how long had it been since hed slept the minutes crawled by with tortuous slowness he imagined them as snails hundreds of little snails with cetagandan clan markings coloring their shells going past in procession leaving slimetrails of lethal biocontamination a crawling infant little helen natalia cooing and reaching for one of the pretty poisonous creatures and he was all tied up and pierced with tubes and couldnt get across the room fast enough to stop her a bleep from his lap link thank god snapped him awake before he could find out where that nightmare was going he was still pierced with tubes though what time was it he was losing track altogether his usual mantrai can sleep when im dead seemed a little too apropos an image formed over the vid plate sealer greenlaw good news bad news good her lined face was radiant with relief we found it she said its been contained miles blew out his breath in a long exhalation yes excellent where in minchenko auditorium just as the portmaster said attached to the wall in a stage light cell it did seem to have been put together hastily but it was deadly clever for all of that simple and clever it was scarcely more than a little sealed plastic balloon filled with some sort of nutrient solution my people tell me and a tiny charge and the electronic trigger for it the ba had stuck it to the wall with ordinary packing tape and sprayed it with a little flat black paint no one would notice it in the ordinary course of events not even if they had been working on the lights unless they put a hand right on it homemade then on the spot it would seem so the electronics which were offtheshelf itemsand the tape for that matterare all quaddiemake they match with the purchases recorded to dubauers credit chit the evening after the attack in the hostel lobby all the parts are accounted for there seems to have been only the one device she ran her upper hands through her silver hair massaging her scalp wearily and squeezed shut eyes bounded beneath by little dark halfmoons of shadow that fits with the timetable as i see it said miles right up until guppy popped up with his rivet gun the ba evidently thought it had gotten away clean with its stolen cargo and with solians death everything calm and perfect its plan was to pass through quaddiespace quietly without leaving a trace it would not have had any reason before then to rig such a device but from that botched murder attempt on it was running scared having to improvise rapidly curious bit of foresight though it cant have planned to be trapped on the idris the way it was surely she shook her head it planned something the explosive charge had two leads to its trigger one was a receiver for the signal device the ba had in its pocket the other was a simple sound sensor set to a fairly high decibel level that of an auditorium full of applause for example miless teeth snapped shut oh yes thus masking the pop of the charge and blowing out contaminant to the maximum number of people at once the vision was instant and horrifying so we think people come in from other stations all over quaddiespace to see performances of the minchenko ballet the contagion could have spread back out with them through half the system before it became apparent is it the sameno it cant be what the ba gave to me and bel can it was it lethal or merely something debilitating or what the sample is in the hands of our medical people now we should know soon so the ba set up its biobomb after it knew real cetagandan agents would be following after it knew it would be compelled to abandon the utterly incriminating replicators and their contents ill bet it put the bomb together and slapped it out there in a hurry maybe it was revenge revenge upon the quaddies for all the forced delays that had so wrecked the bas perfect plan by bels report the ba was not above such motivations the cetagandan had displayed a cruel humor and a taste for bifurcating strategies if the ba hadnt run into the troubles on the idris would it have retrieved the device or would it simply have quietly left the bomb behind to go off on its own well if miless own men couldnt get the whole story out of their prisoner he damned well knew some people who could good he breathed we can go now greenlaws weary eyes opened what i meanwith your permission madame sealer he adjusted his vid pickup to a wider angle to take in his sinister medical setting too late to adjust the color balance toward a more sickly green also possibly redundant greenlaws mouth turned down in dismay looking at him admiral vorpatril has received an extremely alarming military communiqu from home swiftly miles explained his deduction about the connection of suddenly increased tensions between barrayar and its dangerous cetagandan neighbor to the recent events on graf station he talked carefully around the tactical use of trade fleet escorts as rapiddeployment forces although he doubted the sealer missed the implications my plan is to get myself the ba the replicators and as much evidence as i can amass of the bas crimes back to rho ceta to present to the cetagandan government to clear barrayar of whatever accusation of collusion is driving this crisis as fast as possible before some hotheadon either sidedoes something that to put it bluntly makes admiral vorpatrils late actions on graf station look like a model of restraint and wisdom that won a snort from her he forged on while the ba and russo gupta both committed crimes on graf they committed crimes in the cetagandan and barrayaran empires first i submit we have clear prior claim and worsetheir mere continued presence on graf station is dangerous because i promise you sooner or later their furious cetagandan victims will be following them up i think youve had enough of a taste of their medicine to make the prospect of a swarm of real cetagandan agents descending upon you unwelcome indeed cede us both criminals and any retribution will chase after us instead hm she said and your impounded trade fleet your fines let on my authority i am willing to transfer of ownership of the idris to graf station in lieu of all fines and expenses he added prudently as is her eyes sprang wide she said indignantly the ships contaminated yes so we cant take it anywhere anyway cleaning it up could be a nice little training exercise for your biocontrol people he decided not to mention the holes even with that expense youll come out ahead im afraid the passengers insurance will have to eat the value of any of their cargo that cant be cleared but im really hopeful that most of it will not need to be quarantined and you can let the rest of the fleet go and your men in our detention cells you let one of them out are you sorry can you not allow lieutenant corbeaus courage to redeem his comrades that has to be one of the bravest acts ive ever witnessed him walking naked and knowing into horror to save graf station that yes that was remarkable she conceded by any peoples standards she regarded him thoughtfully you went in after the ba too mine doesnt count miles said automatically i was already he cut the word dead he was not dammit dead yet i was already infected her brows rose in bemused curiosity and if you hadnt been what would you have done well it was the tactical moment i have a kind of gift for timing you see and for doubletalk that too but the ba was just my job has anyone ever told you that you are quite mad now and then he admitted despite everything a slow smile turned his lips not so much since i was appointed an imperial auditor though useful that she snorted very softly softening miles trotted out the next barrage my plea is humanitarian too it is my beliefmy hopethat the cetagandan haut ladies will have some treatment up their capacious sleeves for their own product i propose to take portmaster thorne with usat our expenseto share the cure that i now so desperately seek for myself its only justice the herm was in a sense in my service when it took this harm in my work gang if you like huh you barrayarans do look after your own at least one of your few saving graces miles opened his hands in an equally ambiguous acknowledgment of this mixed compliment thorne and i both now labor under a deadline that waits on no committee debate im afraid and no ones permission the present palliative he gestured awkwardly at the blood filter buys a little time as of this moment no one knows if it will buy enough she rubbed her brow as if it ached yes certainly certainly you must oh hell she took a breath all right take your prisoners and your evidence and the whole damned lotand thorneand go and vorpatrils men in detention them too take them all away your ships can all go bar the idris her nose wrinkled in distaste but we will discuss the residue of your fines and expenses further after the ship is evaluated by our inspectors later your government can send someone for the task not you by preference thank you madame sealer miles sang in relief he cut the com and collapsed back on his pillows the ward seemed to be spinning around his head very slowly in short jerks it wasnt he decided after a moment a problem with the room captain clogston who had been waiting by the door for the auditor to complete this highlevel negotiation advanced to glower at his cobbledtogether blood filter some more he then transferred his glower to miles seizure disorder eh im glad someone told me yes well we wouldnt want you to mistake it for an exotic new cetagandan symptom its pretty routine if it happens dont panic i come up on my own in about five minutes usually gives me a sort of hangover afterwards not that id be able to tell the difference at the moment never mind what can you tell me about lieutenant corbeau we checked the bas hypospray it was filled with water ah good i thought so miles smiled in wolfish satisfaction can you pronounce him clear of biohorrors then given that hes been running around this plagueship bareass naked not until were sure we have identified all possible hazards that the ba might have released but nothing came up on the first blood and tissue samples we took a hopefulmiles tried not to think overly optimistic sign can you send the lieutenant in to me is it safe i want to talk to him we now believe that what you and the herm have isnt virulently contagious through ordinary contact once were sure the ships clear of anything else well all be able to get out of these suits which will be a relief although the parasites might transfer sexuallywell have to study that i dont like corbeau that much send him in then clogston gave miles an odd look and moved off miles wasnt sure if the captain had missed the feeble joke or merely considered it too feeble to merit a response but that transfer sexually theory kicked off a whole new cascade of unpleasant unwelcome speculation in miless mind what if the medicos found they could keep him alive indefinitely but not get rid of the damned things would he never be able to touch any more of ekaterin than her holovid image for the rest of his life it also suggested a new set of questions to put to guppy about his recent travelswell the quaddie doctors were competent and receiving copies of the barrayarans medical downloads their epidemiologists were doubtless already on it corbeau pushed through the biobarriers he was now somewhat desultorily arrayed in a disposable mask and gloves in addition to the medical tunic and some patient slippers miles sat up pushed away his tray and unobtrusively twitched open his own tunic letting the paling spiderweb of old needlegrenade scars silently suggest whatever they might to corbeau you asked for me my lord auditor corbeau ducked his head in a nervous jerk yes miles scratched his nose thoughtfully with his one free hand well hero that was a very good career move you just made corbeau hunched a little mulishly i didnt do it for my career or for barrayar i did it for graf station and the quaddies and garnet five and glad i am of it nevertheless people will doubtless be wanting to pin gold stars on you cooperate with me and i wont make you receive them in the costume you were wearing when you earned them corbeau gave him a baffled wary look what was the matter with all his jokes today anyway flat flatter flattest maybe he was violating some sort of unwritten auditor protocol and messing up everyone elses lines the lieutenant said in a notably uninviting voice what do you want me to do my lord more urgent concernsto put it mildlyare going to compel me to leave quaddiespace before my assigned diplomatic mission is quite complete nevertheless with the true cause and course of our recent disasters here finally dragged out into the light what follows should be easier besides theres nothing like the threat of imminent death to force one to delegate it is very plain that barrayar is overdue to have a fulltime diplomatic consulate officer assigned to the union of free habitats a bright young man who is shacked up with a quaddie girl no married to wait that wasnt what they called it here is partners with yes very likely but it hadnt happened yet although corbeau was thrice a fool if he didnt grab this opportunity to fix things with garnet five for good and all likes quaddies miles continued smoothly and has earned both their respect and gratitude by his personal valor and has no objection to a long assignment away from hometwo years was it yes two years such a young man might be particularly well placed to argue effectively for barrayars interests in quaddiespace in my personal opinion miles couldnt tell if corbeaus mouth was open behind his medical mask his eyes had grown rather wide i cant imagine said miles that admiral vorpatril would have any objection to releasing you to this detached duty or at any rate to not having to deal with you in his command structure after all these complex events not that id planned to give him a betan vote in my auditorial decrees mind you i i dont know anything about diplomacy i was trained as a pilot if you went through military jump pilot training you have already shown that you can study hard learn fast and make confident rapid decisions affecting other peoples lives objection overruled you will of course have a consulate budget to hire expert staff to assist you in specialized problems in law in the economics of port fees in trade matters whatever but youll be expected to learn enough as you go to judge whether their advice is good for the imperium and if at the end of two years you do decide to muster out and stay here the experience would give you a major boost into quaddiespace privatesector employment if theres any problem with all this from your point of viewor from garnet fives very levelheaded woman by the way dont let her get awayits not apparent to me illcorbeau swallowedthink about it my lord excellent and not readily stampeded either good do so miles smiled and waved dismissal warily corbeau withdrew as soon as he was out of earshot miles murmured a code into his wrist com ekaterin love where are you in my cabin on the prince xav the nice young yeoman is getting ready to help carry my things to the shuttle yes thank you that too right ive just about cracked us loose from quaddiespace greenlaw was reasonable or at least too exhausted to argue any more she has all my sympathy i dont think i have a functional nerve left right now dont need your nerves just your usual grace the moment you can get to a comconsole call up garnet five i want to appoint that heroic young idiot corbeau to be barrayaran consul here and make him clean up all this mess i have to leave in my wake its only fair he certainly helped create it gregordid specifically ask that i assure that barrayaran ships could dock here again someday the boy is wobbling however so pitch it to garnet five and make sure that she makes sure corbeau says yes oh what a splendid idea love they would make a good team i think yep her for beauty and um her for brains and him for courage surely i think it might work out i must think what to send them for a wedding present to convey my personal thanks partnering present i dont know ask nicol oh speaking of nicol miles glanced aside at the sheeted figure in the next bunk crucial message delivered thorne had fallen back into what miles hoped was sleep and not incipient coma im thinking that bel really ought to have someone to ride along and take care of it or of things for it some kind of support trooper anyway i expect the star crche will have a fix for their own weapontheyd have to lab accidents after all if we get there in time but this looks like something thats going to involve a certain amount of really unpleasant convalescence im not exactly looking forward to it myself but consider the alternative ask her if shes willing she could ride in the kestrel with you be some company anyway and if neither he nor bel got out of this alive mutual support certainly ill call her from here call me again when youre safe aboard the kestrel love often and often of course her voice hesitated love you get some rest you sound like you need it your voice has that downinawell sound it gets when there will be time determination flashed through her own audible fatigue i wouldnt dare die theres this fierce vor lady who threatened shed kill me if i did he grinned weakly and cut the com he drowsed for a time in dizzy exhaustion fighting the sleep that tried to overtake him because he couldnt be sure it wasnt the bas helldisease gaining on him and he might not wake up he marked a subtle change in the sounds and voices that penetrated from the outer chamber as the medical team switched over to evacuationmode in time a tech came and took bel away on a float pallet in a little more time the pallet was returned and clogston himself and another medtech shifted the imperial auditor and all his growing array of lifesupport trappings aboard one of the intelligence officers reported to miles during a brief delay in the outer chamber we finally found the remains of lieutenant solian my lord auditor what there was of them a few kilograms of well inside a bod pod folded up and put back in its wall locker in the corridor just outside the cargo hold where the replicators were right thank you bring it along as is for evidence and for the man died doing his job barrayar owes him debt of honor military burial pension family figure it all out later his pallet rose again and the corridor ceilings of the idris flowed past his blurred gaze for the last time chapter eighteen are we there yet miles mumbled muzzily he blinked open eyes that were not oddly enough gluey and sore the ceiling above him didnt waver and bend in his vision as though seen miragelike through rising desert heat breath drawn through his flaring nostrils flowed in coolly and without clogging impediment no phlegm no tubes no tubes the ceiling was unfamiliar he groped for memory fog biotainered angels and devils tormenting him someone demanding he piss medical indignities mercifully vague now trying to talk to give orders till some hypospray of darkness had shut him down and before that near desperation sending frantic messages racing ahead of his little convoy the return stream of daysold accounts of wormholes blockaded outlanders interned by both sides assets seized ships massing telling its own tale to miless mind worse for the details he knew too damned much about the details we cant have a war now you fools dont you know there are children almost present his left arm jerked encountering no resistance except for a smooth coverlet beneath his clutching fingers there yet ekaterins lovely face bent over him from the side not halfhidden behind biotainer gear he feared for a moment that this was only a holovid projection or some hallucination but the real warm kiss of breath from her mouth carried on a puff of laughter reassured him of her present solidity even before his hesitant hand touched her cheek wheres your mask he asked thickly he heaved up on one elbow fighting off a wave of dizziness he certainly wasnt in the barrayaran military ships crowded utilitarian sickbay to which hed been transferred from the idris his bed was in a small but elegantly appointed chamber that screamed of cetagandan aesthetics from the arrays of live plants through the serene lighting to the view out the window of a soothing seashore waves creamed gently up a pale sandy beach seen through strange trees casting delicate fingers of shade almost certainly a vid projection since the subliminals of the atmosphere and sounds of the room also murmured spaceship cabin to him he wore a loose silky garment in subdued gray hues only its odd accessibilities betraying it as a patient gown above the head of his bed a discreet panel displayed medical readouts where are we whats happening did we stop the war those replicators they found on their endits a trick i know it the final disasterhis speeding ships intercepting tightbeamed news from barrayar of diplomatic talks broken off upon the discovery in a warehouse outside vorbarr sultana of a thousand empty replicators apparently stolen from the star crche their occupants gone supposed occupants even miles hadnt been sure a baffling nightmare of implications the barrayaran government had of course hotly denied any knowledge of how they came to be there or where their contents were now and was not believed the baguppy i promisedall those haut babiesive got to you have got to lie still a firm hand to his chest pushed him back down all the most urgent matters have been taken care of who by she colored faintly well me mostly vorpatrils ship captain probably shouldnt have let me override him technically but i decided not to point that out to him youre a bad influence on me love what what how i just kept repeating your messages and demanding they be put through to the haut pel and ghemgeneral benin benin was brilliant once he had your first dispatches he figured out that the replicators found in vorbarr sultana were decoys smuggled out of the star crche by the ba a few at a time over a year ago in preparation for this she frowned it was apparently a deliberate sleight of hand by the ba meant to cause just this sort of trouble a backup plan in case anyone figured out that not everyone had died on the childship and traced the trail as far as komarr it almost worked might have worked if benin hadnt been so painstaking and levelheaded i gather that the internal political circumstances of his investigation were extremely difficult by then he really put his reputation on the line possibly even his life if miles read between these simple lines all honor unto him then the military forcestheirs and ourshave all gone off alert and are standing down now the cetagandans have declared it an internal civil matter he eased back vastly relieved ah i dont think i could have gotten through to them without the haut pels name she hesitated and yours ours her lips curved up at that lady vorkosigan did seem a title to conjure with it gave both sides pause that and yelling the truth over and over but i couldnt have held it together without the name may i suggest that the name couldnt have held it together without you his free hand tightened around hers on the coverlet hers tightened back he started up again waitshouldnt you be in biotainer gear not any more lie down drat it whats the last thing you remember my last clear memory is of being on the barrayaran ship about four days out from quaddiespace cold her smile didnt change but her eyes grew dark with memory cold is right the blood filters fell behind even with four of them running at once we could see the life just draining out of you your metabolism couldnt keep up couldnt replace the resources being siphoned off even with the ivs and nutrient tubes running flat out and multiple blood transfusions captain clogston couldnt think of any other way to suppress the parasites but to put you bel and them into stasis a cold hibernation the next step would have been cryofreeze oh no not again it was the ultimate fallback but it wasnt needed thank heavens once you and bel were sedated and chilled enough the parasites stopped multiplying the captains and crews of our little convoy were very good about rushing us along as fast as was safe or a little faster ohyes were here we arrived in orbit around rho ceta yesterday i guess it was had she slept since then not much miles suspected her face though cheerful now was drawn with fatigue he reached for it again to lightly touch her lips with two fingers as he habitually did her holovid image i remember that you wouldnt let me say goodbye to you properly he complained i figured it would give you more motivation to fight your way back to me if only for the last word he snorted a laugh and let his hand fall back to the coverlet the artificial gravity probably wasnt turned up to two gees in this chamber despite his arm feeling as though it were hung with lead weights he had to admit he didnt feel exactly chipper what then am i all clear of those hellparasites her smile returned all better well that is that frightening cetagandan lady doctor the haut pel brought with her has pronounced you cured but youre still very debilitated youre supposed to rest rest i cant rest what else is happening wheres bel sh sh bels alive too you can see bel soon and nicol too theyre in a cabin just down the corridor bel took she frowned hesitantly took more damage from this than you did but is expected to recover mostly in time miles didnt quite like the sound of that ekaterin followed his glance around right now were aboard the haut pels own shipthat is her star crche ship that she brought from eta ceta the women from the star crche had you and bel carried across to treat you here the haut ladies wouldnt let any of our men aboard to guard you not even armsman roic at first which caused the most stupid argument i was ready to slap everybody concerned till they finally decided that nicol and i could come with you captain clogston was very upset that he wouldnt be allowed to attend he wanted to hold back giving them the replicators till they cooperated but you can bet i put my foot down on that idea good and not just because miles had wanted those little time bombs off barrayaran hands at the earliest possible instant he could not imagine a more psychologically repugnant or diplomatically disastrous ploy at this late hour i remember trying to calm down that idiot guppy who was hysterical about being carried back to the cetagandans making promises i hope i wasnt lying through my chattering teeth was it true he was still harboring a reservoir of parasites did they fix him too or not i swore on my name that if hed cooperate in testifying barrayar would protect him but i expected to be conscious when we arrived yes the cetagandan doctor treated him too she claims the latent residue of parasites wouldnt have fired up again but really i dont think she was sure apparently no one has ever survived this bioweapon before i gathered the impression that the star crche wants guppy for research purposes even more than cetagandan imperial security does for criminal charges and if they have to arm wrestle for him the star crche will win our men did carry out your order hes still being held on the barrayaran ship some of the cetagandans arent too pleased about that but i told them theyd have to deal with you on the subject he hesitated and cleared his throat um i also seem to remember recording some messages to my parents and mark and ivan and to little aral and helen i hope you didnt you didnt send them off already did you i set them aside oh good im afraid i wasnt very coherent by then perhaps not she admitted but they were very moving i thought i put it off too long i guess you can erase them now never she said quite firmly but i was babbling nevertheless im going to save them she stroked his hair and her smile twisted perhaps they can be recycled someday after all next time you might not have time the door to the chamber slid aside and two tall willowy women entered miles recognized the senior of them at once the haut pel navarr consort of eta ceta was perhaps the numbertwo woman in the strange secret hierarchy of the star crche after the empress haut rian degtiar herself in appearance she was unchanged from when miles had first met her a decade ago except perhaps for her hairstyle her immensely long honeyblond hair was gathered today into a dozen braids hanging from a level running around the back of her head from one ear to the other their decorated ends swinging around her ankles along with her skirt hem and draperies miles wondered if the unsettling faintly medusalike effect was intended her skin was still pale and perfect but she could not even for an instant be mistaken for young too much calm too much control too much cool irony outside the innermost sanctuaries of the celestial garden the high haut women normally moved in the privacy and protection of personal force bubbles screened from unworthy eyes the fact that she strode here unveiled was alone enough to tell miles that he now lay in a star crche reserve the darkhaired woman beside her was old enough to have streaks of silver in the hair looping down her back among her long robes and skin that while unblemished was distinctly softened with age chill deferential unknown to miles lord vorkosigan the haut pel gave him a relatively cordial nod i am pleased to find you awake are you quite yourself again why who was i before he was afraid he could guess i think so it was quite a surprise to me that we should meet again this way although not under the circumstances an unwelcome one miles cleared his throat it was all a surprise to me too your babies in their replicatorsyou have them back are they all right my people completed their examinations last night all seems to be well with them despite their horrific adventures im sorry that the same was not so for you she gave a nod to her companion the woman proved to be a physician who with a few brusque murmurs completed a brief medical examination of their barrayaran guest signing off her work miles guessed his leading questions about the bioengineered parasites met polite evasion and then miles wondered if she were physicianor ordnance designer or veterinarian except that most veterinarians hed met showed signs of actually liking their patients ekaterin was more determined can you give me any idea of what longterm sideeffects we should watch for from this unfortunate exposure for the lord auditor and portmaster thorne the woman motioned for miles to refasten his garment and turned to speak over his head your husband she made the term sound utterly alien in her mouth does suffer some muscular and circulatory microscarring muscle tone should recover gradually over time to near his prior levels however added to his earlier cryotrauma i would expect greater chance of circulatory mishaps later in his life although as shortlived as you people are perhaps the few decades difference in life expectancy will not seem significant quite the reverse madam strokes thromboses blood clots aneurysms miles supposed was what this translated to oh joy just add them to the list along with needler guns sonic grenades plasma fire and nerve disruptor beams and hot rivets and hard vacuum and seizures so what interesting synergies might be expected when this circulatory microscarring crossed paths with his seizure disorder miles decided to save that question for his own physicians later they could use a challenge he was going to be a damned research project again military as well as medical he realized with a chill the haut woman continued to ekaterin the betan suffered notably more internal damage full recovery of muscle tone may never occur and the herm will need to be on guard against circulatory stress of all kinds a low or zerogravity environment might be the safest for it during its convalescence i gathered from its partner the quaddie female that this may actually be easy to provide whatever bel needs will be arranged miles vowed for such a debilitating injury in the emperors service it shouldnt even take an imperial auditor to get impsec off bels neck and maybe rustle up a little medical pension in the bargain the haut pel gave a tiny jerk of her chin the physician favored the planetary consort with an obeisant bow and excused herself pel turned back to miles as soon as you feel sufficiently recovered lord auditor vorkosigan ghemgeneral benin begs the opportunity to speak with you ah dag benins here good i want to talk to him too does he have the ba in his custody yet has it been made crystal clear that barrayar was an innocent dupe in your bas illicit travels pel replied the ba was of the star crche the ba has been returned to the star crche it is an internal matter although we are of course grateful to ghemgeneral benin for his assistance dealing with any persons outside our purview who may have aided the ba in its mad flight so the haut ladies had their stray back miles suppressed a slight twinge of pity for the ba pels quelling tone of voice did not invite further questions from outlander barbarians tough pel was the most venturesome of the planetary consorts but his likelihood of ever getting her alone facetoface after this moment was slight and her likelihood of discussing the matter frankly in front of anyone else even slighter he forged on i finally deduced the ba must be a renegade and not as id first thought an agent of the star crche im most curious about the mechanics of this bizarre kidnapping guppythe jacksonian smuggler russo guptacould only give me an exterior view of events and that only from his first point of contact when the ba offloaded the replicators from what i assume was the annual childship to rho ceta yes pel inhaled but conceded stiffly yes the crime was long planned and prepared it now appears the ba slew the consort of rho ceta her handmaidens and the crew of the ship by poison just after their last jump they were all dead by the time of the rendezvous it set the ships autonavigation to take the vessel into the sun of the system thereafter to the bas credit this was intended as a befitting pyre of sorts she conceded grudgingly given his prior exposure to the arcana of haut funeral practices miles could almost follow this evident point in the prisoners favor without his brain cramping almost but pel spoke of the bas intention as fact not conjecture therefore the haut ladies had already had more luck in their interrogation of the deranged ba in one night than miless security people had gained on their whole voyage here luck i suspect has nothing to do with it i thought the ba should have been carrying a greater variety of bioweapons if it had any time to loot the childship before the vessel was abandoned and destroyed pel was normally rather sunny as haut planetary consorts went but this elicited a freezing frown these matters are altogether not for discussion outside the star crche ideally no but unfortunately your private items managed to travel quite a way outside the star crche indeed as i can personally testify they became a source of very public concern for us when apprehending the ba on graf station at the time i left there no one was certain if wed identified and neutralized every contagion or not reluctantly pel admitted the ba had planned to steal the complete array but the haut lady in charge of the consorts supplies although dying managed to destroy them before her death as was her duty pels eyes narrowed she will be remembered among us the darkhaired womans opposite number perhaps did the chilly physician guard a similar arsenal on pels behalf perhaps aboard this very ship complete array eh miles filed that tacit admission silently away for later sharing with impsecs highest echelons and swiftly redirected the conversation but what was the ba actually trying to do was it acting alone if it was how did it defeat its loyalty programming that is an internal matter too she repeated darkly well ill tell you my guesses miles burbled on before she could turn away and end the exchange i believe this ba to be very closely related to emperor fletchir giaja and therefore to his late mother im guessing this ba was one of the old dowager empress lisbets close confidants during her reign her biotreason her plan to split the haut into competing subgroups was defeated after her death not treason haut pel objected faintly as such unsanctioned unilateral redesign then for some reason this ba was not purged with the others of her inner cadre after her deathor maybe it was i dont know demoted perhaps but anyway im guessing this whole escapade was some sort of misguided effort to complete its dead mistresssor mothersvision am i close the haut pel eyed him with extreme distaste close enough it is truly done now in any case the emperor will be pleased with youagain some token of his gratitude may well be forthcoming at the childship landing ceremonies tomorrow to which you and your ladywife are invited the first outlanderseverto be so honored miles waved aside this little distraction id trade all the honors for some scrap of understanding pel snorted you havent changed have you still insatiably curious to a fault she added pointedly ekaterin smiled dryly miles ignored pels hint bear with me i dont think ive quite got it yet i suspect the hautand the baare not so posthuman yet as to be beyond selfdeception all the more subtle for their subtlety i saw the bas face when i destroyed that freezer case of genetic samples in front of it something shattered some last desperate something he had slain mens bodies and bore the mark and knew it he did not think hed ever before slain a soul yet left the body breathing bereft and accusing i have to understand this pel was clearly not pleased to go on but she understood the depth of a debt that could not be paid off with such trivialities as medals and ceremonies the ba it seems she said slowly desired more than lisbets vision it planned a new empirewith itself as both emperor and empress it stole the haut children of rho ceta not just as a core population for its planned new society but as mates consorts aspiring to even more than fletchir giajas genetic place which while part of the goal of haut does not imagine itself the whole hubris she sighed madness in other words breathed miles the ba wanted children in the only way it could conceive ekaterins hand which had drifted to his shoulder tightened lisbet should not have told it so much said pel she made a pet of this ba treated it almost as a child instead of a servitor hers was a powerful personality but not always wise perhaps selfindulgent in her old age as well yesthe ba was fletchir giajas sibling perhaps the cetagandan emperors nearclone elder sibling test run and the test judged successfuland decades of observant service in the celestial garden thereafter with the question always hoveringso why was not the ba instead of its brother given all that honor power wealth fertility one last question if you will what was the bas name pels lips tightened it shall be nameless now and forevermore erased let the punishment fit the crime miles shivered the luxurious lift van banked over the palace of the imperial governor of rho ceta the sprawling complex shimmering in the night the vehicle began to drop into the vast dark garden laced with veins of lights along its roads and paths which lay to the east of the buildings miles stared in fascination out his window as they swooped down then up over a small range of hills trying to guess if the landscape was natural or artificially carved out of rho cetas surface partly carved at any rate for on the opposite side of the rise a grassy bowl of an amphitheater sheltered in the slope overlooking a silky black lake a kilometer across beyond the hills on the lakes other side rho cetas capital city made the night sky glow amber the amphitheater was lit only by dim glowing globes lavishly spread across its width a thousand haut lady force bubbles set to mourning white damped to the barest visible luminosity among them other pale figures moved softly as ghosts the view turned from his sight as the driver of the van swung it about and brought it down to a gentle landing a few meters inward from the lake shore at one edge of the amphitheater the vans internal lighting brightened just a little in red wavelengths designed to help maintain the passengers dark adaptation in the aisle across from miles and ekaterin ghemgeneral benin turned from his window it was hard to read his expression beneath the formalized swirls of blackandwhite face paint that marked him as an imperial ghemofficer but miles took it for pensive in the red light his uniform glowed like fresh blood all in all and even taking into account his sudden close personal introduction to star crche bioweapons miles wasnt sure if hed have cared to trade recent nightmares with benin the past weeks had been exhausting for the senior officer of the celestial gardens internal security the childship carrying star crche personnel who were his special charge vanishing en route without a trace garbled reports leaking back from guppys scrambled trail hinting not only at breathtaking theft but possible biocontamination from the crches most secret stores the disappearance of that trail into the heart of an enemy empire no wonder that by the time he had arrived in rho cetan orbit last night to interrogate miles in personwith exquisite courtesy to be surehed looked as tired even under the face paint as miles felt their contest for the possession of russo gupta had been brief miles certainly sympathized with benins strong desire with the ba plucked from his hands by the star crche for someone to take his frustrations out onbut first miles had given his vor word and secondly he discovered he could apparently do no wrong on rho ceta this week nevertheless miles wondered where to drop guppy when this was all over housing him in a barrayaran jail was a useless expense to the imperium turning him loose back on jacksons whole was an invitation for him to return to his old haunts and employmentno benefit to the neighbors and a temptation to cetagandan vengeance he could think of one other nicely distant place to deposit a person of such speckled background and erratic talents but was it fair to do that to admiral quinn bel had laughed evilly at the suggestion till it had to stop to breathe despite rho cetas key place in barrayaran strategic and tactical considerations miles had never set foot on the world before he didnt now either at least not right away grimacing he allowed ekaterin and ghemgeneral benin to help him from the van into a floater in the ceremony to come he planned to stand on his feet but a very little experimentation had taught him that he had better conserve his endurance at least he wasnt alone in his need for mechanical aid nicol hovered shepherding bel thorne the herm sat up and managed its own floater controls only the oxygen tube to its nose betraying its extreme debilitation armsman roic his vorkosigan house uniform pressed and polished took up station behind miles and ekaterin at his very stiffest and most silent spooked half to death miles gauged miles couldnt blame him deciding he represented the whole of the barrayaran empire tonight and not just his own house miles had elected to wear his plain civilian gray ekaterin seemed tall and graceful as a haut in some flowing thing of gray and black miles suspected underthetable female sartorial help from pel or one of pels many minions as ghemgeneral benin led the party forward ekaterin paced beside miless floater her hand resting lightly upon his arm her faint mysterious smile was as reserved as ever but it seemed to miles as though she walked with a new and firm confidence unafraid in the shadowed dark benin stopped at a small group of men glimmering up out of the murk like specters who were gathered a few meters from the lift van complex perfumes drifted from their clothing through the damp air distinct yet somehow not clashing the ghemgeneral meticulously introduced each member of the party to the current haut governor of rho ceta who was of the degtiar constellation cousin in some kind to the present empress the governor too was dressed as were all the haut men present in the loose white tunic and trousers of full mourning with a multilayered white overrobe that swept to his ankles the former occupant of this post whom miles had once met had made it plain that outlander barbarians were barely to be tolerated but this man swept a low and apparently sincere bow his hands pressed formally together in front of his chest miles blinked startled for the gesture more resembled the bow of a ba to a haut than the nod of a haut to an outlander lord vorkosigan lady vorkosigan portmaster thorne nicol of the quaddies armsman roic of barrayar welcome to rho ceta my household is at your service they all returned suitably civil murmurs of thanks miles considered the wordingmy household not my government and was reminded that what he was seeing tonight was a private ceremony the haut governor was momentarily distracted by the lights on the horizon of a shuttle dropping from orbit his lips parting at he peered up into the glowing night sky but the craft banked disappointingly away toward the opposite side of the city the governor turned back frowning a few minutes of polite small talk between the haut governor and beninformal wishes for the continued health of the cetagandan emperor and his empresses and somewhat more spontaneoussounding inquiries after mutual acquaintanceswas broken off again as another shuttles lights appeared in the wide predawn dark the governor swung around to stare again miles glanced back over the silent crowd of haut men and haut lady bubbles scattered like white flower petals across the bowl of the hillside they emitted no cries they scarcely seemed to move but miles felt rather than heard a sigh ripple across their ranks and the tension of their anticipation tighten this time the shuttle grew larger its lights brightening as it boomed down across the lake which foamed in its path roic stepped back nervously then forward again nearer to miles and ekaterin watching the bulk of it loom almost above them lights on its sides picked out upon the fuselage a screamingbird pattern enameled red that glowed like flame the craft landed on its extended feet as softly as a cat and settled the chinks and clinks of its heated sides contracting sounding loud in the breathless waiting stillness time to stand up miles whispered to ekaterin and grounded his floater she and roic helped hoist him out of it to his feet and step forward to stand at attention the closecut grass beneath his booted soles felt like thick fine carpeting its scent was damp and mossy a wide cargo hatch opened and a ramp extended itself illuminated from beneath in a pale diffuse glow first down it drifted a haut lady bubbleits force field not opaque as the others but transparent as gauze within its float chair could be seen to be empty miles murmured to ekaterin wheres pel thought this was all her baby its for the consort of rho ceta who was lost with the hijacked ship she whispered back the haut pel will be next as she conducts the children in the dead consorts place miles had met the murdered woman briefly a decade ago to his regret he could remember little more of her now than a cloud of chocolatebrown hair that had tumbled down about her stunning beauty camouflaged in an array of other haut women of equal splendor and a ferocious commitment to her duties but the float chair seemed suddenly even emptier another bubble followed and yet more and ghemwomen and ba servitors the second bubble drew up beside the haut governors group grew transparent and then winked out pel in her white robes sat regally in her float chair ghemgeneral benin as you are charged please convey now the thanks of emperor the haut fletchir giaja to these outlanders who have brought our constellations hopes home to us she spoke in a normal tone and miles didnt see the voice pickups but a faint echo back from the grassy bowl told him their words were being conveyed to all assembled here benin called bel forward with formal words of ceremony he presented a high cetagandan honor to the betan a paper bound in ribbon written in the emperors own hand with the odd name of the warrant of the celestial house miles knew cetagandan ghemlords who would have traded their own mothers to be enrolled on the years warrant list except that it wasnt nearly that easy to qualify bel dipped its floater for benin to press the beribboned roll into its hands and though its eyes were bright with irony murmured thanks to the distant fletchir giaja in return and kept its sense of humor for once under full control it probably helped that the herm was still so exhausted it could barely hold its head upright a circumstance for which miles had not expected to be grateful miles blinked and suppressed a huge grin when ekaterin was next called forward by ghemgeneral benin and bestowed with a like beribboned honor her obvious pleasure was not without its edge of irony either but she returned an elegantly worded thank you my lord vorkosigan benin spoke miles stepped forward a trifle apprehensively my imperial master the emperor the haut fletchir giaja reminds me that true delicacy in the giving of gifts considers the tastes of the recipient he therefore charges me only to convey to you his personal thanks in his own breath and voice first prize the cetagandan order of merit and what an embarrassment that medal had been a decade ago second prize two cetagandan orders of merit evidently not miles breathed a sigh of relief only slightly tinged with regret tell your imperial master from me that he is entirely welcome my imperial mistress the empress the haut rian degtiar handmaiden of the star crche also charged me to convey to you her own thanks in her own breath and voice miles bowed perceptibly lower i am at her service in this benin stepped back the haut pel moved forward indeed lord miles naismith vorkosigan of barrayar the star crche calls you up hed been warned about this and talked it over with ekaterin as a practical matter there was no point in refusing the honor the star crche had to have about a kilo of his flesh on private file already collected not only during his treatment here but from his memorable visit to eta ceta all those years back so with only a slight tightening of his stomach he stepped forward and permitted a ba servitor to roll back his sleeve and present the tray with the gleaming sampling needle to the haut pel pels own white longfingered hand drove the sampling needle into the fleshy part of his forearm it was so fine its bite scarcely pained him when she withdrew it barely a drop of blood formed on his skin to be wiped away by the servitor she laid the needle into its own freezer case held it high for a moment of public display and declaration closed it and set it away in a compartment in the arm of her float chair the faint murmur from the throng in the amphitheater did not seem to be outrage though there was perhaps a tinge of amazement the highest honor any cetagandan could achieve higher even than the bestowal of a haut bride was to have his or her genome formally taken up into the star crches banksfor disassembly close examination and possible selective insertion of the approved bits into the haut races next generation miles rolling his sleeve back down muttered to pel its probly nurture not nature yknow her exquisite lips resisted an upward crook to form the silent syllable sh the spark of dark humor in her eye was veiled again as if seen through the morning mist as she reactivated her force shield the sky to the east across the lake and beyond the next range of hills was turning pale coils of fog curled across the waters of the lake its smooth surface growing steel gray in reflection of the predawn luminescence a deeper hush fell across the gathering of haut as through the shuttles door and down its ramp floated array after array of replicator racks guided by the ghemwomen and ba servitors constellation by constellation the haut were called forth by the acting consort pel to receive their replicators the governor of rho ceta left the little group of visiting dignitariesheroes to join with his clan as well and miles realized that his humble bow earlier had not been any kind of irony after all the whiteclad crowd assembled were not the whole of the haut race residing on rho ceta just the fraction whose genetic crosses arranged by their clan heads bore fruit this day this year the men and women whose children were here delivered might never have touched or even seen each other till this dawn but each group of men accepted from the star crches hands the children of their getting they floated the racks in turn to the waiting array of white bubbles carrying their genetic partners as each constellation rearranged itself around its replicator racks the force screens turned from dull mourning white to brilliant colors a riotous rainbow the rainbow bubbles streamed away out of the amphitheater escorted by their male companions as the hilly horizon across the lake silhouetted itself against the dawn fire and above the stars faded in the blue when the haut reached their home enclaves scattered around the planet the infants would be given up again into the hands of their ghem nurses and attendants for release from their replicators into the nurturing crches of their various constellations parent and child might or might not ever meet again yet there seemed more to this ceremony than just haut protocol are we not all called on to yield our children back to the world in the end the vor did in their ideals at least barrayar eats its children his mother had once said according to his father looking at miles so miles thought wearily are we heroes here today or the greatest traitors unhung what would these tiny high haut hopefuls grow into in time great men and women terrible foes had he all unknowing saved here some future nemesis of barrayarenemy and destroyer of his own children still unborn and if such a dire precognition or prophecy had been granted to him by some cruel god could he have acted any differently he sought ekaterins hand with his own cold one her fingers wrapped his with warmth there was enough light for her to see his face now are you all right love she murmured in concern i dont know lets go home epilogue they said goodbye to bel and nicol at komarr orbit miles had ridden along to the impsec galactic affairs transfer station offices here for bels final debriefing partly to add his own observations partly to see that the impsec boys did not fatigue the herm unduly ekaterin attended too both to testify and to make sure miles didnt fatigue himself miles was hauled away before bel was are you sure you two dont want to come along to vorkosigan house miles asked anxiously for the fourth or fifth time as they gathered for a final farewell on an upper concourse you missed the wedding after all we could show you a very good time my cook alone is worth the trip i promise you miles bel and of course nicol hovered in floaters ekaterin stood with her arms crossed smiling slightly roic wandered an invisible perimeter as if loath to give over his duties to the unobtrusive impsec guards the armsman had been on continuous alert for so long miles thought hed forgotten how to take a shift off miles understood the feeling roic was due at least two weeks of uninterrupted home leave when they returned to barrayar miles decided nicols brows twitched up im afraid we might disturb your neighbors stampede the horses yeah said bel miles bowed sitting his floater bobbed slightly my horse would like you fine hes extremely amiable not to mention much too old and lazy to stampede anywhere and i personally guarantee that with a vorkosigan liveried armsman at your back not the most benighted backcountry hick would offer you insult roic passing nearby in his orbit added a confirming nod nicol smiled thanks all the same but i think id rather go someplace where i dont need a bodyguard miles drummed his fingers on the edge of his floater were working on it but look really if you nicol is tired said ekaterin probably homesick and she has a convalescing herm to look after i expect shell be glad to get back to her own sleepsack and her own routine not to mention her own music the two exchanged one of those league of women looks and nicol nodded gratefully well said miles yielding with reluctance take care of each other then you too said bel gruffly i think its time you gave up those handson ops games hey now that youre going to be a daddy and all between this time and the last time fate has got to have your range bracketed bad idea to give it a third shot i think miles glanced involuntarily at his palms fully healed by now maybe so god knows gregor probably has a list of domestic chores waiting for me as long as a quaddies arms all added together the last one was walltowall committees coming up with if you can believe it new barrayaran biolaw for the council of counts to approve it took a year if he starts another one with youre half betan miles youd be just the man i think ill turn and run bel laughed miles added keep an eye on young corbeau for me eh when i toss a protg in to sink or swim like that i usually prefer to be closer to hand with a life preserver garnet five messaged me after i sent to tell her bel was going to live said nicol she says theyre doing all right so far at any rate quaddiespace hasnt declared all barrayaran ships non grata forever or anything yet that means theres no reason you two couldnt come back someday bel pointed out or at any rate stay in touch we are both free to communicate openly now i might observe miles brightened if discreetly yes thats true they exchanged some unbarrayaran hugs all around miles didnt care what his impsec lookouts thought he floated holding ekaterins hand to watch the pair progress out of sight toward the commercial ship docks but even before theyd rounded the corner he felt his face pulled around as if by a magnetic force in the opposite directiontoward the military arm of the station where the kestrel awaited their pleasure time ticked in his head lets go oh yes said ekaterin he had to speed his floater to keep up with her lengthening stride up the concourse gregor waited to greet lord auditor and lady vorkosigan upon their return at a special reception at the imperial residence miles trusted whatever reward the emperor had in mind would be less disturbingly arcane than that of the haut ladies but gregors party was going to have to be put off a day or two the word from their obstetrician back at vorkosigan house was that the childrens sojourn in their replicators was stretched to nearly its maximum safe extension there had been enough oblique medical disapproval in the tone of the message it didnt even need ekaterins nervous jokes about tenmonth twins and how glad she was now for replicators to get him aimed in the right direction and no more damned interruptions hed undergone these homecomings what seemed a thousand times yet this one felt different than any before the groundcar from the military shuttleport armsman pym driving pulled up under the portecochre of vorkosigan house looming stone pile that it ever was ekaterin bustled out first and gazed longingly toward the door but paused to wait for miles when theyd left komarr orbit five days ago hed traded in the despised floater for a slightly less despised cane and spent the journey hobbling incessantly up and down what limited corridors the kestrel provided his strength was returning he fancied if more slowly than hed hoped maybe he would look into getting a swordstick like commodore koudelkas for the interim he pulled himself to his feet swung the cane in briefly jaunty defiance and offered ekaterin his arm she rested her hand lightly upon it covertly ready to grab if needed the double doors swung open on the grand old blackandwhite paved entry hall the mob was waiting headed by a tall woman with roanred hair and a delighted smile countess cordelia vorkosigan actually hugged her daughterinlaw first a whitehaired stocky man advanced from the antechamber to the left face luminous with pleasure and stood in line for his chance with ekaterin before turning to his son nikki clattered down the sweeping stairway and into his mothers arms and returned her tight hug with only a tinge of embarrassment the boy had grown at least three centimeters in the past two months when he turned to miles and copied the counts handshake with dauntingly grownup resolve miles found himself looking up into his stepsons face a dozen armsmen and servants stood around grinning ma kosti the peerless cook pressed a splendid bunch of flowers on ekaterin the countess handed off an awkwardly worded but sincere message of felicitation for their impending parenthood from miless brother mark at graduate school on beta colony and a rather more fluent one from his grandmother naismith there ekaterins older brother will vorvayne unexpectedly present took vids of it all congratulations viceroy count aral vorkosigan was saying to ekaterin on a job well done would you like another im sure gregor can find you a place in the diplomatic corps after this if you want it she laughed i think i have at least three or four jobs already ask me again in oh say about twenty years her glance went to the staircase leading to the upper floors and the nursery countess vorkosigan who caught the look said everything is waiting and ready as soon as you are after the briefest of washups in their secondfloor suite miles and ekaterin made their way down a servitorcrowded hallway to rendezvous with the core family again in the nursery with the addition of the birth teaman obstetrician two medtechs and a biomechanicthe small chamber overlooking the back garden was as full as it could hold it seemed as public a birth as those poor monarchs wives in the old histories had ever endured except that ekaterin had the advantage of being upright dressed and dignified all of the cheerful excitement none of the blood or pain or fear miles decided that he approved the two replicators released from their racks stood side by side on a table full of promise a medtech was just finishing fiddling with a cannula on one shall we proceed inquired the obstetrician miles glanced at his parents how did you all do this back then aral lifted one latch said his mother and i lifted the other your grandfather general piotr lurked menacingly but he came around to a wider way of thinking later his mother and his father exchanged a private smile and aral vorkosigan shook his head wryly miles looked to ekaterin it sounds good to me she said her eyes were brilliant with joy it lifted miless heart to think that he had given her that happiness they advanced to the table ekaterin went around and the techs scrambled out of her way miles hooked his cane over the edge supported himself with one hand and raised the other to match ekaterins a double snap sounded from the latches they moved down and repeated the gesture with the second replicator good ekaterin whispered then they had to stand out of the way watching with irrational anxiety as the obstetrician popped the first lid swept the exchange tube matting aside slit the caul and lifted the pink squirming infant out into the light a few heartstopping moments clearing air passages draining and cutting the cord miles breathed again when little aral alexander did and blinked his blurring lashes he felt less selfconscious when he noticed his father wipe his eyes countess vorkosigan gripped her skirts at her sides forcibly making hungry grandmotherly hands wait their turn the counts hand on nikkis shoulder tightened and nikki in his frontandcenter viewpoint lifted his chin and grinned will vorvayne bobbed around trying to get better vid angles until his little sister put on her firmest lady ekaterin vorkosigan voice and quashed his attempts at stage directing he looked startled but backed off by some tacit assumption ekaterin got first dibs she held her new son and watched as the second replicator yielded up her very first daughter miles leaned on his cane at her elbow his eyes devouring the astonishing sight a baby a real baby his hed thought his children had seemed real enough when hed touched the replicators in which they grew that was nothing like this little aral alexander was so small he blinked and stretched he breathed actually breathed and placidly smacked his tiny lips he had a notable amount of black hair it was wonderful it was terrifying your turn said ekaterin smiling at miles i i think id better sit down first he halffell into an armchair brought hastily forward for him ekaterin tucked the blanketwrapped bundle into his panicked arms the countess hovered over the back of the chair like some maternal vulture he seems so small what four point one kilos chortled miless mother hes a little bruiser he is you were half that size when you were taken out of the replicator she continued with an unflattering description of miles at that moment that ekaterin not only ate up but encouraged a lusty yowl from the replicator table made miles start he looked up eagerly helen natalia announced her arrival in no uncertain terms waving freed fists and howling the obstetrician completed his examination and pressed her rather hastily into her mothers reaching arms miles stretched his neck helen natalias dark wet wisps of hair were going to be as auburn as promised he fancied when they dried with two babies to go around all the people lined up to hold them would have their chances soon enough miles decided accepting helen natalia still making noise from her grinning mother they could wait a few more moments he stared at the two bundles more than filling his lap in a kind of cosmic amazement we did it he muttered to ekaterin now perching on the chair arm why didnt anybody stop us why arent there more regulations about this sort of thing what fool in their right mind would put me in charge of a baby two babies her brows drew together in quizzical sympathy dont feel bad im sitting here thinking that eleven years suddenly seems longer that i realized i dont remember anything about babies im sure itll all come back to you like um like flying a lightflyer he had been the end point of human evolution at this moment he abruptly felt more like a missing link i thought i knew everything surely i knew nothing how had his own life become such a surprise to him so utterly rearranged his brain had whirled with a thousand plans for these tiny lives visions of the future both hopeful and dire funny and fearful for a moment it seemed to come to a full stop i have no idea who these two people are going to be then it was everyone elses turn nikki the countess the count miles watched enviously his fathers sure grip of the infant on his shoulder helen natalia actually stopped screaming there reducing the noise level to one of more generalized desultory complaint ekaterin slipped her hand into his and gripped tightly it felt like free falling into the future he squeezed back and soared
