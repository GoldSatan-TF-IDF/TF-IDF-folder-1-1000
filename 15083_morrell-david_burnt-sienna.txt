david morrell burnt sienna to danny baror foreign agent extraordinaire thats my last duchess painted on the wall looking as if she were alive robert browning one from newsweek that was a long time ago i dont think about it malone claims but if according to the critics his paintings celebrate life more than any artist since the impressionists one cant help suspecting that the sensuality in his work is a reaction to the nightmare he barely survived on the night of december during the us invasion of panama a painter who was once a military helicopter pilot in the cutthroat competition of todays art world that dramatic juxtaposition between malones violent past and artistic present accounts for part of his mystique but while his marine background is exotic to some patrons it also initially made critics skeptical that his work had merit as douglas fennerman malones art representative points out chase had to work twice as hard to earn his reputation from that point of view it doesnt hurt to have a soldiers background if you want to survive on the battlefield of the galleries in manhattan certainly malone looks more like a soldier than any stereotype of an artist six feet tall sinewy more than muscular he has a sunbronzed face and ruggedly attractive features interviewed on the beach near his home on the mexican resort of cozumel he had just completed his daily exercise of a fivemile jog coupled with an hour of calisthenics his sandy hair bleached by the caribbean sun matches the color of the beard stubble that adds to his rugged handsomeness apart from the paint smears on his tshirt and shorts there is no hint of his place in the art world he is thirtyseven but it isnt hard to imagine that he didnt look much different in his lieutenants uniform ten years earlier when his helicopter gunship was shot down by a panamanian rocket that happened at am on december and while malone refuses to talk about the incident jeb wainright the copilot who was shot down with him remembers it vividly in the night there were so many tracers and rockets flying around not to mention flames shooting up from explosions on the ground it looked like the fourth of july in hell to soften everything up we hit first from the air fixedwing aircraft and helicopters like a swarm of gigantic mosquitoes with damned big stingers fortymillimeter vulcan cannons millimeter howitzers laserguided antitank missiles the works one of the principal targets was the headquarters of the panamanian defense forces a factorylike building in a shanty section of panama city called el chorrillothe little stream the enemy put its headquarters there us military planners theorized so that panamanian troops could use the twenty thousand people in el chorrillo as a shield and something like that happened wainright continues when our choppers attacked the headquarters the enemy ran for cover in the surrounding area but we kept after them and thats when chase started shouting into the radio to tell our command post that civilians were under fire they sure were almost at once five square blocks burst into flames command central didnt have a chance to respond before we were hit i still remember my teeth snapping together from the explosion chase fought to keep control of the gunship it was full of smoke spinning and veering all the while dropping chase is the best chopper pilot i ever saw but i still dont know how he managed to get us safely on the ground the nightmare was only beginning in the darkness with the fire spreading from shack to shack malone and wainright struggled to escape as the twenty thousand residents of el chorrillo swarmed in panic through a maze of alleys malone and his copilot were shot at by panamanian forces as well as by us gunships whose crews didnt realize american fliers were on the ground then a bullet hit me in the leg wainright says i have no idea from which side while the civilians rushed past us chase rigged a pressure bandage on my leg heaved me over his shoulder and tried to get away from the fires at one point he had to use his service pistol against panamanian soldiers holed up in a building i later realized it took him until after dawn to get us out of there we were slumped against a wall soot falling all around us when american tanks and flamethrowers showed up to level what was left of el chorrillo two thousand civilians died that night god knows how many were wounded all twenty thousand lost their homes shortly afterward malone left the marine corps chase had always been drawing stuff when we werent training wainright recallssometimes instead of going on leave he stayed in the barracks and worked on his sketches it was obvious he had talent but i had no idea how much until after he committed himself to trying to earn a living at itthat night in el chorrillo he made up his mind and he never looked back a viewer will find no hint of violence in malones paintingsthey are mostly colorful landscapestheir vibrant details which are reminiscent of van gogh and yet distinctly his own communicate a passionate joy in the senses a thrill of sensual appreciation for the natural world that perhaps only someone who has survived a facetoface encounter with apocalyptic violence and death could be moved to depict as waves lapped at malones sneakers the sunset reflected off the caribbean creating a hue that seemed never to have existed before he was conscious of the gritty sand beneath his shoes of the balmy breeze against his thick curly hair and of the plaintive creecreecree of seagulls overhead raising his brush to the halffinished canvas he concentrated to get it all in not just the shapes and colors but also the sounds the fragrances and even the taste of the salt air to attempt the impossible and embed those other senses in a visual medium so that the painting would make a viewer feel what it had been like to stand in this spot at this magical moment experiencing the wonder of this sunset as if there had never been another abruptly something distracted him when malone had been in the military his ability to register several details at once had been a survival skill but it was as an artist and not a soldier that he now noticed movement at the edge of his vision it came from his right from a stand of palm trees a hundred yards along the deserted beach near where the unseen dirt road ended a shifting shadow became a squat man stepping onto the sand the intruder raised a hand to shield his spectacles from the sunsets brilliance and peered in malones direction as the man approached his dark suit revealed itself to be royal blue the black of his shoes was soon covered with the white of the sand that he walked across his briefcase a chalk gray that matched his hair had bumps on it ostrich skin malone wasnt puzzled that he had failed to hear the mans car after all the roar of the surf on the shore was so strong that it obscured distant sounds nor was he puzzled by the intruders joyless clothing even an island paradise couldnt relax some harried business travelers what did puzzle him however was that the man approached with a resolve that suggested he had come specifically because of malone but malone had not told anyone where he would be he took all this in while appearing not to do so using the need of tilting his head toward his palette to disguise his periodic glances in the mans direction as he intensified the scarlet on his canvas he heard the intruder come so close that the crunch of his shoes was distinct then the crunch stopped an arms length from malones right mr malone malone ignored him im alexander potter malone continued to ignore him i spoke to you on the phone yesterday i told you i was flying in this afternoon you wasted your time i thought i made it clear im not interested very clear its just that my employer doesnt take no for an answer hed better get used to it malone applied more color to the canvas seagulls screeched a minute passed potter broke the stalemate perhaps its a matter of your fee not being sufficient on the phone i mentioned two hundred thousand dollars my employer authorized me to double it this isnt about money malone finally turned to him what is it about i was once in a position where i had to follow a lot of orders potter nodded your experience in the marines after i got out i promised myself that from then on i was going to do only what i wanted a half million id been obeying commands for too long many of them didnt make sense but it was my job to follow them anyhow finally i was determined to be my own boss the trouble is i needed money and i broke my promise to myself the man who hired me saw things differently than i did he kept finding fault with my work and refused to pay me that wouldnt happen this time potters tie had red blue and green stripes the banner for an ivy league club that would never have asked malone to join and to which he would never have wanted to belong it didnt happen then either malone said believe me i convinced the man to pay i meant that this time no one would find fault with your work youre too famous now six hundred thousand thats more than any of my paintings has ever sold for my employer knows that why why is it worth so much to him he values the unique just for me to do a private portrait no this commission involves two portraits one of the subjects face the other full length nude nude can i assume your employer is not the subject of the portraits malone was making a joke but potter evidently didnt have a sense of humor his wife mr bellasar doesnt allow even his photograph to be taken bellasar derek bellasar is the name familiar to you not at all should it be mr bellasar is very powerful yes im sure he reminds himself of that every morning i beg your pardon how did you know i was here the abrupt change of subject caused a shadow of confusion to glide behind potters glasses he raised his brow in what passed for a frown its hardly a secret the manhattan gallery that represents you confirmed what was in the recent newsweek article you live here on cozumel thats not what i meant how did i know where to phone you potters expression displayed total confidence again theres no mystery the article mentioned your passion for privacy that you dont have a telephone and you live in a sparsely inhabited part of the island the article also mentioned that the only building near you is a restaurant called the coral reef where you receive your mail and take your business calls it was simply a matter of my being persistent of phoning that restaurant until i happened to catch you thats still not what i meant then im afraid i dont understand how did you know i was here malone pointed toward the sand at his feet ah i see someone at the restaurant told me where youd gone no this afternoon i came here on the spur of the moment i didnt tell anyone theres only one way you could have known you had someone following me potters expression didnt change he didnt even blink youre trouble malone said leave perhaps we can discuss this over dinner hey what part of no dont you understand potter was sitting at a table directly across from the entrance staring as malone stepped into the coral reef the mans solemn business suit contrasted with the colorful tops and shorts of the many tourists who had made the tenkilometer drive from cozumels only town san miguel to visit this locally famous restaurant years ago it had been no more than a beer and snack shop for divers attracted to the clear water of the nearby reef but over time the building and the menu had expanded until the restaurant was now listed among the mustsees in every cozumel travel guide potter had every right to be a customer of course but although the place was usually busy malone considered the coral reef to be his private refuge and he resented that potter had contaminated it pausing he gave potter a long hard look then turned to yatbalam the roundheaded broadfaced highcheeked mayan proprietor softening his features malone said hello he had never needed a lot of friends in order to be happy an only child who had been raised by a single mother and who had been left alone a great deal as a child he had learned to feel comfortable being alone to be a good companion to himself he didnt feel isolated living away from the only town on this small island off the eastern coast of mexicos yucatán peninsula nonetheless the restaurant had become important to him he visited it every day he had established a warm rapport not only with yat but also with yats wife who was the cook and yats three teenage children who were the waiters along with occasional visitors from the art world and malones former marine unit not to mention divers who returned to the area often enough to be regulars they fulfilled his social needs until three months ago there had also been a woman but that had ended unhappily for she had definitely not enjoyed an isolated life even if it was on a caribbean paradise and had returned to manhattans art galleries and receptions after a few pleasantries yat said there is a man who has been sitting all evening but refuses to order anything except iced tea he keeps staring at the entrance he says he is waiting for you yat directed his almondshaped eyes in potters direction yes i saw him when i came in he is a friend a nuisance there will be a problem no but id better get this settled so i can enjoy my meal whats the special for tonight huachinango veracruz malones mouth watered in anticipation of the red snapper prepared with green peppers onions tomatoes olives and spices bring him one and put it on my bill ill have the same ill get another place setting no need i wont be eating with him better bring us each a margarita also i have a feeling hes going to want a drink after ive finished talking to him as malone started past the busy tables toward potter yat put a cautionary hand on his arm malone gave him a reassuring smile its okay i promise there wont be trouble the restaurant had an octagonal design with thatched walls that stopped at waist level allowing a view of the ocean a full moon illuminated the surf over the bar next to the restaurants entrance hung a painting malone had given to yat depicting the beach here and there posts supported beams that spread out like spindles on a wheel and held up the round tentshaped thatched roof the effect was spacious and airy no matter how crowded the room was potter hadnt taken his gaze off malone approaching malone decided that on the beach the sunset had made potter look healthier than he now appeared the pallor of his skin suggested that he was seldom out of doors behind his spectacles his eyes had a grave expression join me potter gestured toward the chair across from him afraid not but ive taken the liberty of ordering for you a specialty of the house youll find it one of the most delicious meals youve ever eaten this way you wont go back without getting something out of the trip continuing to fix his gaze on malone potter tapped his fingers on the table im afraid i havent made it clear that failure to convince you to accept the commission is not an option i cannot go back to mr bellasar and tell him you refused his offer then dont go back tell him you quit potter tapped his fingers harder that is not an option either hey everybodys got job problems it doesnt matter how much he pays you if you dont like what youre doing youre mistaken i enjoy my employment very much fine then deal with his reaction its my own reaction i care about i am not accustomed to lack of results you must understand how serious this matter is what can i give you to convince you to agree its the other way around malone said if i took the assignment id be losing the one thing that matters the most to me and what is that potters gaze intensified my independence look ive got more than enough money i dont have to be at the beck and call of any son of a bitch who thinks hes rich enough to tell me what and how to paint malone didnt realize he had raised his voice until he noticed a silence around him turning he discovered that the diners had stopped eating and were frowning at him as was yat who stood in the background sorry malone made a calming gesture he turned back to potter this is an extension of my home dont make me lose my temper here your refusal to take the assignment is absolute have you got a hearing problem theres nothing i can do or say to change your mind jesus isnt it obvious fine potter stood ill make my report to mr bellasar whats your hurry enjoy your meal first potter picked up his briefcase mr bellasar will want to know your decision as soon as possible a quarter mile offshore the occupants of a fortyfoot sailboat anchored near the reef were more interested in the lights of the restaurant than they were in the moons reflection off the sea while the four men studied the beach they listened to a radio receiver in the main cabin the transmitted voices were clear despite the murmur of people talking and eating in the restaurant im not close enough to hear what malone told him a male voice said from the radio but potter sure looks pissed hes standing a female voice said hes grabbing his briefcase hes in a hurry to get out of here back to the airport would be my guess the thinhaired senior member of the team on the sailboat said we know how suspicious bellasar is about telephones hell want potter to use the scramblerequipped radio on the plane to get in touch with him the female voice continued from the radio rodriguez is posing as a cabdriver hell follow the car potter rented and find out what hes up to in the meantime malones gone over to the guy who owns the restaurant the male voice said he seems to be apologizing he looks annoyed with himself but more annoyed with potter for a moment only the drone of the restaurant came from the radio then the male voice said hes sitting down to eat on the sailboat the senior member of the team sighed in frustration the bobbing of the craft in the water made him queasy or perhaps he was queasy from what hed just heard thats it for tonight im afraid the shows over and malone didnt accept the offer the heavyset man next to him said just as you predicted well i was his copilot ive kept in touch with him since we got out of the marines i know how he thinks hes determined to be his own man we might never have as good a chance as this youre the expert on him how the hell do we get him to be our man tensing malone heard the roar before he veered his jeep around palm trees and came within sight of his house or what under usual circumstances would have been within sight of his house the dust cloud that confronted him and the mechanical chaos within it were so startling that he braked abruptly to a stop staring paralyzed at the hazeconcealed dinosaurlike shapes of rumbling machines bulldozers one two three jesus christ half a dozen of them tearing up the sand dunes and palm trees around his home when he had first seen this isolated cove on the eastern shore of cozumel he had known immediately that this was where he wanted to live the calm waters on the opposite side of the island made that area more attractive for tourists and developers which was fine with malone who wanted to be away from crowds but the dramatic surf on this unprotected side not to mention the remote intimacy of this rugged cove with its stretches of white sand punctuated by craggy black limestone was irresistible to him according to mexican law a foreigner could purchase land only after he or she obtained a permit from the ministry of foreign affairs in the case of beach property however the situation was more complicated because the government needed to make certain that so precious a resource would be respected thus it had been necessary for malone to purchase the property through a fiftyyear trust agreement with a local bank which retained the title and acted as a guardian of the beach he had then hired a prizewinning mexican architect to design the house the attractive sprawling onestory structure was made from a normally unattractive substance concrete which was less affected by the regions humidity than the upright wooden poles lashed together that formed the walls of many homes on the island every corner and edge of the concrete was contoured eliminating sharp angles softening its appearance it was stuccoed a dazzling white enhanced by numerous colorful flowering shrubs and topped with a roof of thatched palm fronds providing a traditional look several arches and courtyards allowed breezes to circulate freely reducing the need for air conditioning but everything was changed now the house was coated with a thick layer of grit thrown up by the bulldozers a normally benevolent breeze was carrying the grit into the house the sand dunes among which his home had nestled were flattened carcasses of palm trees lying everywhere and still the relentless bulldozers kept gouging and tearing savaging the cove as malone stared at the desecration his paralysis broke furious he leapt from his jeep and stormed toward the nearest bulldozer motioning urgently for the driver to stop either the driver didnt see him or else the driver didnt care for the bulldozer rumbled past malone ramming down another palm tree with greater outrage malone charged after the bulldozer grabbed a handhold on the side pulled himself up reached for the ignition key and turned off the engine damn it i told you to stop malone shouted in spanish the driver muttered an obscenity and grabbed malones hand to try to get the key back what the hell do you think youre doing here malone demanded cursing the driver grabbed harder for the key malone threw it into the sand at once the cove became silent as the other drivers having seen what was happening turned off their machines and jumped to the ground racing to help their compatriot answer me malone said what do you think youre doing this is my home you dont have a right the other drivers flanked the bulldozer two on one side three on the other leave my brother alone one of them warned youre at the wrong place i live here for gods sake youve made a mistake the mistake is yours if you dont get away from my brother the man scrambled onto the bulldozer listen to me no spinning the driver from whom he had taken the key aimed a fist at malones stomach with only slightly less speed than when hed been in the military malone grabbed the mans arm yanked him from his seat and hurled him off the bulldozer into the sand in the same fluid motion he ducked avoiding the punch that the drivers brother directed toward his face surging upward he plunged his fist into his attackers solar plexus and flipped him after his brother with a painful wheeze the second man landed next to the first the remaining four drivers gaped no longer certain how far they wanted to push this nobody has to get hurt except you the first man struggled to catch his breath and stand im telling you i dont want to fight just stop while we figure this out youre not supposed to be here with this equipment the man who hired us was very specific one of the other drivers said angrily he led us to this property we asked him about the house he said the land belonged to him he told us to level everything for a new hotel what man whoever it was didnt know what the hell he was talking about did he give you his name when malone heard who it was his chest heaved with greater rage roberto rivera bank officer malone shoved the door open with such force the frosted glass almost shattered rivera a lean man with dark hair and a thin mustached face jerked his head up the elderly client on the opposite side of his desk stopped in surprised midsentence and inhaled making a strangling sound as if hed swallowed a peach pit señor rivera i tried to stop him the secretary insisted from the doorway behind malone malone fixed his gaze on rivera my business couldnt wait im calling the police the secretary swung toward the phone on her desk not just yet rivera faced his client who had recovered his breath but continued to look startled señor valdez i apologize for the interruption would you please wait outside for a moment while i take care of this unpleasantness as soon as the client left and the door was closed malone stalked toward rivera you son of a bitch why did you send those bulldozers to wreck my property obviously theres been a misunderstanding not according to the guys driving the bulldozers malones muscles compacted with fury they were very clear you sent them oh theres no misunderstanding about that rivera said what i sent them all right you actually admit it about to drag rivera from his chair malone stopped in amazement totally the misunderstanding i referred to was your reference to the bulldozers being on your property that section of land isnt yours any longer you bastard i paid for it in a trust agreement with this bank which kept the title in its name but weve had too many complaints about your eyesore of a house what and the rumors about drugs being smuggled ashore there cant be ignored any longer i spoke to the ministry of foreign affairs the trust agreement was revoked i purchased the property jesus christ you cant do that but its already happened rivera said obviously you havent picked up your mail yet or you would have found the banks notice of termination i paid for that land you would also have found a check for the amount that you invested i added although i didnt have to a modest profit to compensate you for the increased market value of the property compensate you prick youre destroying my home suddenly something one of the drivers had said struck him a hotel what you sold the property to a developer it was too good an offer to pass up it certainly must have been malone grabbed him well its going to be awfully hard to spend the money when youre in a wheelchair call the police now rivera shouted to his secretary in the other room malone dragged him to his feet think twice rivera warned in mexico there arent any prisoner rights youll spend a long time in jail waiting for your assault case to go to trial malone drew back a fist itll be worth it and when you finally do go to trial i assure you that mexican judges take a harsh view of foreigners attacking respected members of the community the secretary opened the door the police are on their way thank you now its up to señor malone to decide whether theyre needed riveras gaze was defiant a respected member of the community malone wanted to spit in disgust he lowered his fist yeah it must have been a damned good offer blame the man who negotiated with me he knows you he insisted that i pass along his respects his respects i dont whats his name alexander potter potter he said to tell you that his employer also sends his regards the coral reefs parking lot was empty a taxi headed away its passengers looking disappointed malone got out of his jeep crossed the sand toward the restaurants front door and found a sign that read closed all the shutters were down he frowned the silence from inside made the roar of the surf seem extra loud as he told himself that yat had such a strong work ethic the only reason he would close without warning would be that something had happened to him or his family he tried the door it was locked he pounded on it no one answered with long urgent strides he rounded the building and reached a back door that led to the kitchen this door when he tried it budged open leading him into the shadows of the cooking area where the previous nights savory odors still lingered from last night he emphasized to himself for the several stoves were cold there was no sign of any meal in preparation beyond swinging doors a troubled voice asked whos there yat who is it the voice demanded uneasily me yat its chase oh one of the swinging doors came open yats round pensive face peering through i thought it was another customer malone felt his chest turn warm from the compliment of being considered more than a customer whats happened whats wrong wrong yat assessed the word everything beyond him in the murky dining area someone knocked on the front door a second sequence of knocking louder ended with disappointed voices and the sound of a car driving away at first i explained to everyone who came that we were closed but finally there were too many it became too much weary yat gestured for malone to join him in the dining area to the right on the bar malone saw a tequila bottle and a halfempty glass whats the matter tell me yat stared toward the front door they kept wanting to know when the restaurant would be open again and i couldnt bear repeating so many times that i didnt know in the end i finally just sat here and listened to them bang on the door youve got to tell me malone said a man came here this morning and offered to buy the coral reef for more money than i ever expected to see in a lifetime malone had a sick sinking feeling i spoke to my wife and children about it they work so hard we all work so hard yat shook his head depressed it was too much to resist potter malone said yes alexander potter the same man who was here the other night he said to tell you he sends his regards and those of a man named derek bellasar yes the coral reef is to remain closed indefinitely until señor bellasar decides what to do with the property yat stared at his glass picked it up and took a deep swallow i should have thought about it longer i should have waited before i signed the papers now i understand that the money means nothing if i dont know what to do with my time i didnt realize until now how important coming here was to me yats use of the past tense was so poignant that malone poured tequila into a glass i know how important it was to me when malone swallowed the clear sharp slightly oily liquid his eyes watered but not just from the alcohol he felt as if someone had died bellasar you son of a bitch im going to get you for this he thought i almost forgot yat said you had a phone call what malone wrinkled his brow from whom a man at the gallery in new york that sells your paintings he said he had something important to talk to you about with an even sicker feeling malone reached for the phone you sold the gallery malone dismally repeated what he had just heard hey im as surprised as anybody douglas fennermans voice was faint the telephone connection a hiss believe me it was the last thing on my mind but out of the blue this absolutely fantastic offer came in from a man named alexander potter negotiating for someone called derek bellasar thats a funny thing chase potter said youd know who bought the gallery even before i told you the name but just in case you didnt he said to make sure i passed along his regards are you clairvoyant and bellasars regards also amazing do you know these people well no but believe me i intend to then everythings going to work out you and i go back so far youd have been the first person i called even if potter hadnt suggested it i want to tell you how honored i feel to have represented you malone felt a tightness in his throat if you hadnt promoted me so tirelessly i never would have had any breaks hey youre the one with the talent im just the messenger but just because were not in business together any longer that doesnt mean we wont still be friends sure malone managed to say well still get together from time to time sure doug sounded melancholy you bet he tried to muster his former enthusiasm and at least it wont be like youre in business with strangers since you and potter and bellasar are acquainted with one another its something to build on after youve worked with them for a while you might even get to be friends i dont think so you never know i do know malones jaw muscles hardened well you wont be in business with them anytime soon doug said i dont understand bellasar plans a complete renovation of the gallery all your paintings are being put in storage until the jobs completed what youre going to be off the market temporarily could be a wise move my guess is once the gallery reopens your work will increase in value because its been unavailable malone tightened his grip on the phone and my guess is bellasar will guarantee those paintings are unavailable for a very long time what are you talking about making bellasar and potter wish theyd never heard of me wait a minute chase obviously i havent been clear theres no reason to feel threatened if theres something youre worried about if you need to be reassured about something just tell me im meeting them wednesday morning at an auction at sothebys ill pass your message along sothebys malone quickly calculated wednesday mornings thirtysix hours from now he gripped the phone so hard that his hand cramped chase the husky shout made malone turn from the suitcase he was furiously packing are you in there chase peering through a bedroom window malone saw a tall heavychested man with short blond hair and a sunburned bigboned face standing on the devastated beach jeb he yelled the big man chuckled jeb my god why didnt you let me know you were coming i can hear you but i cant see you buddy where are you ill be right out when malone hurried from the house onto the back patio jeb wainright broke into a grin thirtyseven the same age as malone he wore sandals baggy brown shorts and a garish flowerpatterned shortsleeved shirt that had its three top buttons open and showed the curly blond hair on his chest his shorts revealed the bullet scar on his left thigh from the night malone had saved his life after theyd been shot down during the panama invasion even after ten years he still had his military physique broad shoulders welldeveloped muscles i knocked but i didnt get an answer jeb grinned more broadly as malone came toward him his face was as craggy as the exposed limestone around him i started to worry that you didnt live here anymore especially after i saw all this he gestured toward the tornup beach and the toppled palm trees what the hell happened it looks like a hurricane hit this place its a land developers idea of civic improvements these arent the only changes i drove past that fantastic restaurant we went to the last time i figured wed have dinner there but its closed courtesy of the same land developer i dont want to ruin my mood by talking about it malone gripped jebs shoulders its good to see you how long has it been at least a year jeb nodded and now im back for another diving vacation maybe a little windsurfing wheres your stuff in a rented car out front ill help you carry it in youll stay here of course a troubled thought made malone hesitate but youll have the place to yourself you caught me at a bad time i have to fly to new york tomorrow what but i just got here cant you put off the trip for a couple of days malone shook his head no anger quickened his pulse i need to settle a score with the guy whos responsible for all this youll understand when those bulldozers get cranked up again you might even find yourself sleeping on the beach if they get orders to push these walls down as bad as that worse tell me about it jeb pointed toward the beach lets take a walk as they reached the pounding surf jeb scanned the horizon making sure there werent any boats in view after the demolition job the bulldozers had done there werent any nearby places where someone could hide and aim a shotgun microphone at them all the same jeb had to be cautious it started with a guy named potter malone said yeah i know about him malone turned to him in surprise and i also know about bellasar jeb said the reason i wanted to come down to the water is your house is probably bugged but this surf is loud enough its all anybody will hear if a mike is trained on us from a distance my house is bugged malone looked as if jeb spoke gibberish why would bellasars thorough he would have checked you out before potter approached you and he would have kept the surveillance in place to monitor your reaction to what hes done to you how do you malones features hardened so you didnt just happen to show up for a vacation thats right then maybe you should tell me a couple of things old buddy like for starters what in christ are you really doing here i switched jobs since i saw you last malone stared and waited im not in corporate security anymore i work for a different kind of company the word had implications surely youre not talking about the agency jeb held his breath waiting for a reaction this was the moment hed been dreading after his years in the military malones aversion to authority was such that if he thought he was being manipulated friendship wouldnt matter hed force jeb to leave oh thats just swell malone said great fucking fabulous now before you get yourself worked up let me explain how much do you know about bellasar malones mouth twisted hes a bully with too much money and do you know how he got that money oil shipping widgets what difference does it make blackmarket weapons malones gaze intensified his blue eyes becoming like lasers bellasars one of the three biggest arms dealers in the world jeb said name any civil war going on right now theyre using bellasars weapons to destroy each other but hes not just satisfied to wait for an opportunity to knock if a countrys on the brink he likes to send agitators in to bomb buildings assassinate politicians pin the blame on rival factions and make the civil war happen thanks to him iraq got the technology to build a nuclear reactor capable of manufacturing weaponsgrade plutonium ditto pakistan and india ditto north korea he sold sarin nerve gas to that cult in japan that let it loose in the subways as a dress rehearsal for taking out tokyo hes rumored to be peddling nuclear weapons he got his hands on when the soviet union collapsed hes my personal candidate for worlds scariest guy and if you think you can just fly to new york and settle a score with him as you put it youre going to find out what a hornet feels like when it gets splattered on the windshield of a car going a hundred miles an hour malones voice sounded like two pieces of flint being scraped together i guess you dont know me as well as i thought jeb frowned what do you mean have you ever known me to back off never jeb said it isnt going to happen this time either i dont care how powerful bellasar is he isnt going to get away with what hes done to me i had a good life here it took a lot of effort to build it and now the son of a bitch is destroying it no matter what it costs him just because he cant stand anybody to say no well hes going to find out what no sounds like in thunder hey im not saying dont get even im on your side make him pay what i am saying is be smart about how you do it stick it to him where it really hurts and where would that be accept the commission he offered you the surf pounded nonetheless a silence seemed to gather around them accept the malone gestured as if the idea was outrageous the agencys been wanting to get close to bellasar for a long time jeb said if we can find out what his plans are we might be able to stop them theres no telling how many lives we could save but bellasar comes from a family of experts in survival his father was an arms merchant so was his grandfather and his greatgrandfather all the way back to the napoleonic wars its not just his familys business its in his genes hes got an incredible sixth sense about avoiding traps and sniffing out surveillance every time weve tried to get somebody near him weve failed but now hes handing us a chance this is a joke right you cant seriously be suggesting that i cooperate with him with us and if bellasar still has people watching me he now knows someone from the cia is trying to recruit me an old friend who showed up unexpectedly for a week of diving and windsurfing as far as anybody can tell im still in corporate security when bellasar checks me out he wont find any tie between me and the agency this conversation hasnt tainted you im an artist not a spy the thing is i was hoping youre still a soldier jeb said that was a long time ago you were too good at being a soldier ever to stop but i did stop remember malone stepped closer you should have been able to predict i wouldnt ever let anybody tell me what to do again the surf seemed to pound louder spray drifted over them as they stared at each other do you want me to leave jeb massaged the bullet scar on his thigh what are we still friends or should i find a place in town to spend the night what are you talking about of course were still friends then hear me out malone raised his hands in exasperation please jeb put a wealth of meaning into the word theres something i have to show you as the rented ford jounced along a potholed road that led past vinecovered mahogany trees jeb checked his rearview mirror to make sure they werent being followed he took his right hand from the steering wheel and gestured toward his suitcase on the backseat look in the side flap despite his annoyance malone pivoted in the passenger seat and leaned back to unzip the flap but what he found puzzled him the only thing in here is a magazine glamour what does a fashion magazine have to do with anything check the date six years ago now take a good look at the woman on the cover more puzzled malone studied her she was dressed in a black evening gown only the top of which was visible its tastefully revealing bustline was highlighted by a perfect string of pearls matching earrings and an intriguing black hat with a wide slightly drooping brim that reminded malone of the sophisticated look costume designers had given movie actresses in the fifties i didnt know women wore hats anymore malone said it was a retro issue keep looking at her the woman on the cover was a fiery brunette she had a strong welltoned presence that suggested shed been swimming or jogging before she got dressed and made up even though she had been photographed only from the waist up malone had the feeling that she was tall and that her figure when seen from feet to head would be athletic and alluring he was reminded of sophia loren and not just because she too was a voluptuous brunette with full lips and arousingly dusky eyes but also because their skin color was the same a smoldering earth color to which malone had always been attracted it made him suspect that the woman had something else in common with sophia loren both were italian the car hit another pothole shes bellasars wife jeb said malone looked up in surprise the woman whose portrait bellasar wants you to paint jeb said i feel as if ive seen her before because she was featured on about a hundred magazine covers not to mention thousands of ads for lipstick shampoo eyeliner you name it newsweek time and people did articles about her she had a bestselling bathingsuit calendar she had a onceaweek fashiontip segment on the today show she was so famous all you had to do was mention her first name and people in the fashion industry knew who you were talking about sienna the color of her skin the first thing i thought of was the city in italy jeb said youre not an artist burnt siennas the most brilliant earth color reddish brown and fiery fiery yeah that describes the impression she creates all right jeb said she was as super as supermodels get five years ago she gave it all up why who knows she was twentyfive almost past the prime age for a model maybe she thought shed get out while she was ahead or maybe she fell in love with mr i wont take no for an answer that could be exactly what happened maybe bellasar wouldnt take no for an answer but now he wants me to paint two portraits of her one of her face the other full length nude i get the feeling im missing something yes the way jeb said it made malone shift his gaze from the magazines cover bellasar was married three times before malone frowned all of his wives were gorgeous and all of them died young what the first lost control of her sports car and went over a cliff the second broke her neck while skiing the third drowned in a diving accident it sounds like its bad for a womans health to be bellasars wife malone said with a track record like that whod be foolish enough to marry him youre assuming the other marriages were publicized bellasars a hundred times more sensitive about his privacy than you are about yours in his case its a survival trait believe me the facts about his marriages and the subsequent quiet funerals are hard to come by jeb paused to emphasize what he was about to say before each wife died bellasar hired a noted painter to do a portrait of her malone felt a cold ripple along his skin the paintings hang in a secluded room in bellasars mansion in southern france theyre a private collection of his trophies he cant stand imperfection when his wives get to be about thirty when they start to lose the bloom of youth and show the slightest blemish a faint wrinkle around the eyes or an isolated gray hair that hints of aging he wants nothing more to do with them but his suspicious nature prevents him from merely divorcing them after all theyve been around him too long theyve seen and heard too much they could be a threat i dont understand if he knows hes going to get rid of them why does he take the trouble of marrying them why doesnt he just ask them to be his mistresses because hes a collector i still dont the way he looks at it if he didnt marry them he wouldnt own them jesus malone glanced down at the magazine cover and after theyre dead he still owns them as portraits painted by masters their beauty immortalized never aging jeb said malone kept staring at the magazine cover so now hes getting ready to have this wife killed sure looks that way to us jeb let malone think about it but if you go in and paint her you might be able to figure a way for us to rescue her the things she knows she could be very helpful to us dusk cast shadows the cars headlights illuminated the vinecovered trees no no im sorry this woman has a problem but i dont know her malone said shes a face on a magazine cover she doesnt have any connection with me but you cant let her i dont want to get mixed up with you guys even if its a way to get even with bellasar i can do that myself i dont need to let anybody use me i cant believe your attitude youre just going to stand back and let her die seems to me thats what youre doing malone said dont push the responsibility onto me i didnt know anything about this woman until a few minutes ago if you think shes in that much danger send in a team right now and grab her cant the timings wrong the moment we play our hand bellasar will tighten his security even more well lose our chance to get someone close to him so when it comes right down to it you dont care about the woman either jeb didnt respond shes only a device youre using to try to recruit me malone said getting me in there to look around is more important than saving her the two go together not as far as im concerned i wont be manipulated ill get even with him on my own if youd just listen to reason for a damn it you and bellasar have something in common you wont take no for an answer jeb assessed him a moment so thats how its going to be thats how its going to be fine jebs voice was flat he frowned toward the lights of san miguel ahead of them his voice became flatter i need a drink no hard feelings it takes more than an argument to end a friendship but malone couldnt help feeling that the end of a friendship was precisely what had happened they headed along the main street of the picturesque town and stopped at a restaurant called costa brava across from the waterfront all the while malone drank a beer with jeb he barely tasted it they both had trouble making small talk the specialty of the house a lobster dinner was everything it should have been but malone couldnt help wishing he was back at the coral reef he was only now beginning to realize the full force of what he had lost they returned home earlier than they usually would have malone offered a nightcap but jeb excused himself claiming travel fatigue malone went out to his shadowy courtyard and stared at the savaged dunes and palm trees he slumped on a hammock closed his eyes to the stars and brooded about bellasar about the woman called sienna and the death sentence she didnt know had been given to her when he had first seen the magazines cover the face on it had struck him as being commercially beautiful no more than that but as he had looked harder he had begun to notice the subtlety around the lips the nuance of the way she cocked her head and positioned her eyes her eyes there was something about them something in them that spoke of a deeper beauty now that face and those eyes hovered in his memory he kept thinking about her fiery brown skin burnt sienna his favorite color he dozed and woke several times continuing to brood about the beautiful doomed woman hed been asked to paint in an uneasy state between sleeping and waking he imagined her perfect sensuous features imagined not remembered for it wasnt the face on the magazine cover that occupied him instead it was his conception of that face his depiction of the beauty behind it a beauty that would be destroyed if he didnt help her and in the process hed be getting even with bellasar at dawn he was waiting outside when jeb carried his suitcase from the house ill do it malone said two sothebys was on manhattans exclusive upper east side where york avenue intersected with seventysecond street the february sky was a gunmetal gray that threatened flurries ignoring a cold wind malone kept his hands in the pockets of a fleecelined leather bomber jacket and watched the entrance to the blocklong auction house from a bus stop on the opposite side of the street a succession of taxis and limousines halted in front their welldressed passengers entering the building the time was shortly after am when malone had arrived at kennedy airport late the previous afternoon there had been just enough time to phone sothebys before it closed and find out the subject of its auction today expressionist paintings as well as the time the auction began he had spent a restless night at the parker meridian doug fennerman had said that hed be meeting bellasar and potter here this morning malone hoped that the plan hadnt changed his own plan depended on it having agreed to cooperate with jeb he had tried to think of a way to accept bellasars commission without arousing suspicion after all he had been adamant in his refusal to do the portraits now that bellasar had gone to considerable expense to punish malone by tearing apart his life would bellasar believe it likely that malone would simply throw up his hands in surrender admit the error of his ways and agree to do the portraits wouldnt bellasar question this reaction wasnt it more in character for malone to respond with rage do what i intended to do before jeb showed up malone had decided the only thing thats changed is im getting even in a different way than i imagined his face felt burned by anger as much as the cold he checked his watch again returned his gaze to sothebys entrance and saw two muscular men get out of a limousine their cropped hair and rigid bearing suggested they had recently been in the military their slightly toolarge suits allowed for concealed firearms while giving their bodies room to maneuver if they needed to act in a hurry after scanning the area they nodded toward the limo to indicate it was safe to get out malone felt a spark shoot through his nervous system when potter stepped into view the short somber man wore a funereal overcoat that emphasized the pallor of his skin his thinning hair was tugged by the wind as he stepped back to allow another man to emerge from the limo malone stiffened from a dossier jeb had shown him malone knew that the second man was sixtyone but amazingly he seemed only in his late forties he was tall but had a presence that made him appear to have even more stature he had thick wavy dark hair and broad handsome features that malone associated with mediterranean countries he had a solidlooking physique he wore a white silk scarf over a superbly cut dark brown blazer and light brown slacks no overcoat he was oblivious to the weather the impressiveness of the mans separate parts was heightened by their totality producing a sense of power and strength that made those around him seem insubstantial derek bellasar potter had said bellasar didnt allow his photograph to be taken but jeb had shown malone photos taken secretly from a distance there was no mistaking him immediately another man appeared rushing out of sothebys revolving door smiling broadly extending his right hand in welcome he was malones art dealer doug fennerman his red hair matched by his flushed face bellasar responded with only a cursory greeting the gangs all here malone thought crossing the street walking quickly closer but unable to reach the group before all of them disappeared into sothebys he entered the reception area about fifteen seconds after they did making his way through the crowd he saw doug give bellasar a catalog of the auction retaining one for himself along with a small numbered paddle that was used for bidding evidently doug was here to act as an adviser to bellasar and do the bidding for him bellasar must have thought it demeaning to raise his own hand the group including the bodyguards went up a marble staircase with brass railings and turned to the left toward a spacious auction room upstairs malone reached a desk where a sothebys employee was registering anyone who intended to bid on the paintings this close to the start of the auction most of the attendees had already put in their names so it took only a minute for malone to present his drivers license give his name and address and provide a signature chase malone the man asked in surprise are you the before the man could say anything about his work malone went into the brightly lit greencarpeted auction room the murmurs of several hundred people filled it scanning the crowd malone spotted bellasar potter and doug halfway down the middle aisle the bodyguards stood at each side of the room studying everyone as the only voice became that of the auctioneer malone leaned against a stone pillar at the back and waited the first piece a notbad kandinsky went for watching the price displayed in various currencies on an electronic board at the front of the auction room malone couldnt help remembering that ten years earlier his own work had been priced at a hundred dollars now it went for hundreds of thousands given the poverty in the world was any painting no matter who created it worth these exorbitant amounts his complaint was hypocritical he knew for until now he hadnt refused any money most of his earnings had been saved to protect his independence a good thing he mentally added for if the gamble he was about to take failed he was going to need all his financial resources the next item a betterthanaverage klee went for but it wasnt until the auctioneer introduced the third painting a starkly bleak munch in the style of his famous the scream that a whisper went through the room in the catalog the item had a minimum estimated value of million as was customary the auctioneer began the bidding at percent of that figure malone noticed a shift in the way bellasar sat a compacting of muscles a gathering of energy doug made a slight gesture with his paddle indicating to the auctioneer that he would open the bid at the requested amount the auctioneer automatically raised the bid to which someone else took and which doug capped as soon as the auctioneer went to that was the pattern with barely a motion of his paddle doug outdid every offer the signal was clear others in the room could bid all they wanted but doug would always go higher the bidding languished at million going once the auctioneer said going twice one point one malone said the auctioneer steadied his gaze toward the back of the room seeming to ask for confirmation one point one malone repeated puzzled doug turned to see who was bidding against him and blinked in surprise when he saw malone something he said made bellasar and potter spin one point one million the auctioneer said the bid is one point one do i have two doug said three malone said four five even from a distance it was obvious that the auctioneer was sizing up malone troubled by his sneakers jeans and leather jacket wondering if he had the money to back up his bid sir if an assistant approached the auctioneer and whispered into his ear what he said was presumably what several members of the audience were already telling one another they had recognized malone his name was being murmured very well the auctioneer said one point five million do i have six the voice was no longer dougs but bellasars a baritone with a hint of an italian accent and more than a hint of annoyance eight malone said two million bellasar said defiantly its yours malone shrugged i guess you just cant take no for an answer the fury in bellasars eyes was palpable a blackmarket arms dealers money is as good as anybodys right malone asked the auctioneer bellasar stood of course theres blood all over the money malone said but who says blood and art dont go together the bodyguards approached from the sides avoiding them malone walked down the aisle toward bellasar chase what are you doing doug asked in alarm murmurs in the room grew louder bellasars face was rigid with anger you just forced me to pay a million more than i had to for that painting i dont recall twisting your arm maybe its gods way of letting you know you have too much money why dont you add that amount to what it cost you to tear apart my life youre interested in my paintings ive decided to change my style im now into performance art reaching into the pockets of his bomber jacket malone came out with a tube of oil paint in each hand the caps had already been removed squeezing hard he shot two streams of scarlet paint over bellasars dark brown blazer bellasar jerked his head back in shock the color of blood malone said you could call it a metaphor he reached back to drive a fist into bellasars stomach but changed position as one of the bodyguards lunged pivoting malone grabbed the mans arm swung and sent him flying into a row of chairs emptied by members of the audience anxious to get away from the commotion call the police someone yelled as the chairs crashed and the bodyguard rolled malone prepared a second time to hit bellasar but the other bodyguard rushed him malone knocked the man to the floor felt something sting his neck and spun to thrust the sharp object away realizing with alarm that bellasar had pricked him with something on a ring he wore something inside the ring as bellasar swiveled the rings crested top back into place malones neck felt on fire the heat rushed through his body he had time to punch the first bodyguard before his mind swirled frantic he struggled but somebody hit him and the floor became rubbery his knees collapsing as outoffocus hands grabbed him dragging him along the blurry aisle his hearing lasted slightly longer than his fading vision he tried to thrash but was powerless the last thing he remembered was the scrape of his shoes on carpet he awoke to a raging headache finding himself strapped to a chair in a large dark echoing area the only light was from a harsh unshielded bulb above his head two men a different pair than the first two played cards at a nearby table need to go to the bathroom one of them asked yes too bad besides you already did malones jeans were wet where hed urinated on himself his stomach was queasy the back of his neck ached where bellasars ring had jabbed him in the distance a door opened and closed with a metallic thump two pairs of footsteps scraped on concrete approaching through the darkness bellasar and potter stepped into view bellasar now wore a navy blazer and gray slacks potter looked even more somber than usual bellasar studied him youre a fool im not the one who paid a million more than he had to for a painting bellasar spread his hands money can be replaced i was referring to your refusal to cooperate with me if youd accepted my commission your life wouldnt be in such disarray at the moment yeah but i didnt and it is bellasar studied him harder then shook his head what did you hope to accomplish with that incident at sothebys i sure as hell wasnt going to try to get my hands on you when nobody else was around enough important people saw us together at sothebys that if my body gets fished out of the east river youll be the first man the police want to talk to bellasar whose tan was enhanced by his brilliant smile chuckled i assure you if i wanted something to happen to you your body wouldnt be found in the east river or anywhere else for that matter he let the threat sink in you have only yourself to blame i made a fair offer you chose to insult me by refusing but im a reasonable man ill give you a second chance ill arrange for your life to be put back the way it was ill even raise my offer to seven hundred thousand dollars but i warn you i am not known for my patience there wont be a third chance he let that threat sink in also why are you so fixated on me i can name a dozen artists with bigger reputations get one of them to do the portraits malone mentioned the name of the most famous realist currently working i already own a portrait by him you underestimate yourself im confident that one day your reputation will be bigger than his im a collector its well known that you never accept commissions if i could persuade you to accept a commission from me after youve turned down so many others id be receiving something unique malone didnt respond prides a wonderful thing bellasar sighed but bear in mind i have pride as much as you do this stalemate cant go on forever one of us has to relent but i cant be the one who does in my business its crucial that i never show weakness that i get what i want if you relent you receive an honest wage for honest work if i relent i tempt dangerous men to test me given those alternatives you have the most to gain and the least to lose by forgoing your pride for a time honest work painting a likeness of your wife you could get any competent sketch artist to do it i didnt say anything about a likeness what i wouldnt hire a worldclass artist and expect him to accept a preconceived notion of what a portrait is bellasar said that would be absurd your style is representational rather than abstract so i assumed the portraits would be in that manner but i wouldnt hold you to that approach inspiration mustnt be constrained all i ask is that you be totally honest to yourself and to the subject malone pretended to debate with himself his objection to accepting the commission had been that he had to maintain his independence but bellasar had just given him all the independence an artist could want bellasar had also given him a reason to accept without making bellasar suspicious honesty to myself and to the subject thats all and when i finished that would be the end of it youd put my life back the way it was i could walk away and id never hear from you again you have my word of course if you do decide to accept my offer i hope that the drama you arranged at sothebys gave you enough emotional satisfaction that we can be civil to each other malone couldnt help thinking that the drama had been arranged by both of them bellasar wouldnt have made the appointment to meet doug at sothebys if he hadnt assumed doug would tell malone bellasar had expected malone to show up youve got a deal malone said bellasars gulfstream took off from kennedy airport at midnight with modifications for a shower and a galley the luxurious coporate jet had twenty seats fifteen of which were occupied excluding bellasar potter malone and the two pairs of guards whom malone had seen there were eight passengers whose function malone tried to figure out three broadshouldered men might have been further bodyguards four attractive young women spent a lot of time working on laptop computers the final passenger a statuesque blonde with a crisp white silk blouse and a scandinavian accent turned out to be a flight attendant may i get you anything orange juice shall i add some champagne no thanks the tranquilizer bellasar had injected him with made him feel dehydrated alcohol would make him feel even more parched besides he needed to be alert as the jet streaked through the darkness he peered out his window trying to see lights below him i dont approve of this potter said standing beside him malone turned toward the aisle you had your chance you didnt want it the harsh cabin lights reflected off potters glasses you were punished for not cooperating that should have been the end of it we shouldnt have anything more to do with you im not exactly eager to be here either did you really expect me to do nothing after those bulldozers showed up at my house that would have been the smart reaction the smart thing would have been to leave me alone how did you describe me the first time we met i was trouble you said potters expression became more pinched we have something in common as potter stepped away the flight attendant came back with malones orange juice well be serving a choice of entrées she said which would you prefer london broil cornish hen or risotto alla milanese malone wasnt hungry but knew he had to keep up his strength risotto we also have an excellent selection of wines all the pleasures more than you can imagine the attractive flight attendant gave him an encouraging look then proceeded to another passenger comfortable bellasar came along the aisle potter isnt its his job to be unhappy do the fresh clothes my men bought you fit malone barely nodded one of them also went to the parker meridian collected your luggage and paid your bill malone reached for his wallet i always pay my own way how much was it bellasar spread his hands in amusement until the portraits are completed all of your expenses are my expenses youll find im extremely generous to those who cooperate with me i meant what i said i hope we can put our disagreement behind us believe me its my goal to get through this with as little friction as possible malone glanced toward the darkness beyond the window do you mind telling me where were headed southern france i have a villa near nice thats where your wife is yes patiently waiting belassars dark brown eyes changed focus is the fact that im in the arms business the reason you didnt want to accept my offer at the time i didnt know what your business was but at sothebys you announced it to the world how did you find out the question sounded casual but malone had no doubt he was being tested a friend of mine came to visit me on cozumel hes a security expert i told him what had happened when i mentioned your name he said hed heard of you he said to stay away from you he said youre a very scary guy that would be mr wainright you were having me watched i like to stay informed he seems to be enjoying his vacation you mean the bulldozers havent pushed down my house yet theyve been called off as i promised im going to reassemble your life you do object to my business i guess i keep thinking of all the children whove been killed by the land mines you sell to whatever third world dictator is in power this month most of those children would eventually have starved to death bellasars gaze drifted toward potter coming along the aisle a phone call it cant wait potters silence said everything bellasar turned to malone next time lets discuss your business instead of mine a little after ten in the morning bellasars jet approached nices airport the blue of the mediterranean reminded malone of the caribbean the palm trees too reminded him of home but the overbuilt coastline and the exhaust haze were nothing like the clear solitary splendor he had enjoyed on cozumel bitter he looked away from the view some chablis he had drunk with dinner much of which he hadnt eaten had helped to relax him enough to sleep although his dreams had been fitful interspersed with images of children being blown up by land mines and a beautiful womans face rotting in a coffin he never got into the airport terminal officers from customs and immigration came out to the jet where they stood on the tarmac and spoke to potter who apparently had an understanding with them for they looked briefly into the aircraft nodded to its occupants then stamped the passports potter handed them presumably their expeditious attitude would be rewarded under less public circumstances letting potter handle the details bellasar had gone to a cabin in the rear before the authorities arrived he hadnt given potter his passport there was no proof that he had entered the country or that i did either malone thought when potter had gone along the aisle collecting passports he had taken malones but instead of showing it to the authorities potter had kept it in his pocket malone was reminded of how easy it was to disappear from the face of the earth they got off the plane and broke into two groups most of them remaining to transfer luggage to a waiting helicopter while bellasar potter three bodyguards and malone walked to a second helicopter the familiar whumpwhumpwhump of the rotors wasnt reassuring feeling the weight of liftoff seeing the airport get smaller beneath him malone pretended that it was ten years earlier that he was on a military mission put yourself in that mindset start thinking like a soldier again more important start feeling like one he glanced toward the front of the chopper comparing its levers pedals and other controls to those he had been familiar with there were several advances in design particularly a group of switches that the pilot didnt use and whose purpose malone didnt understand but at heart the principle of flying this craft was the same and he was able to detach his mind from the tension around him and imagine that he was behind the controls guiding the chopper bellasar said something what malone turned i cant hear you the noise of the rotors bellasar spoke louder i said ive purchased the contents of the best artsupply shop in nice the materials are at my villa at your disposal you were that certain id eventually agree the point is this way you wont have any delay in getting started i wont be able to start right away anyhow what do you mean i cant just jump in i have to study the subject first bellasar didnt reply for a moment of course potter kept concentrating on malones eyes but dont study too long bellasar said you didnt mention there was a time limit you told me i could do this the way i needed to if id known there were conditions i wouldnt have no conditions but my wife and i might soon have to travel on business if you can get your preparations concluded before then perhaps you can work without her from a sketch perhaps thats not how i do things you wanted an honest portrait working from a sketch is bullshit if i cant do this right i wont do it at all youre buying more than just my autograph on a canvas you didnt want to accept the commission but now youre determined to take the time to do it properly belassar turned toward potter impressive very potter kept his eyes on malone there bellasar pointed through the plexiglas malone followed his gesture ahead to the right nestled among rocky wooded hills a threestory château made of huge stone blocks glinted in the morning sun if malone had been painting it he would have made it impressionistic its numerous balconies gables and chimneys blending framed by a swirl of elaborate flower gardens sculpted shrubs and sheltering cypresses the pilot spoke french into a small micophone attached to his helmet presumably identifying himself to his security controller on the ground as the helicopter descended malone saw stables tennis courts a swimming pool and another large stone building that had a bell tower and reminded malone of a monastery beyond high walls farmland spread out vineyards cattle he could discern small figures working and as the helicopter settled lower toward a landing pad near the château the figures became large enough for malone to see that many were guards carrying weapons can you tolerate it here belassar sounded ironic its beautiful malone acknowledged if you ignore the guards it belonged to my father and grandfather and greatgrandfather all the way back to the napoleonic wars thanks to arms sales malone thought the chopper set down the roar of the motors diminishing to a whine these men will show you to your room bellasar said ill expect you for cocktails in the library at seven im sure youre looking forward to meeting my wife yes malone said for seven hundred thousand dollars im curious what my subject looks like the spacious bedroom had oak paneling and a fourposter bed after showering malone found a plush white robe laid out for him he also found that his bag had been unpacked and was on the floor next to the armoire opening the armoire he saw that his socks and underwear had been placed in a drawer his turtlenecks and a pair of chino slacks in another he had used a packaged toothbrush and razor he had found on a ledge above the marble sink now he carried his toilet kit into the bathroom and arranged its various items on that shelf throwing out the designer shampoo and shaving soap bellasar had provided the small gesture of rebellion gratified him he put on the chinos and a forest green turtleneck looking for the tan loafers that had been in his bag he found them in the walkin closet along with the sneakers hed been wearing and paused in surprise at the unfamiliar sport coats dress slacks and tuxedo hanging next to his leather jacket before he tried on one of the sport coats he already knew it would fit him perfectly yes there was little about him bellasar didnt know malone realized warily except the most important thing bellasar didnt know about his deal with jeb malone took that for granted because if bellasar had known malone would have been dead by now from his years in the military malone had learned that no matter how tired he was after a long flight it was a mistake to take a nap the nap would only confuse his alreadyconfused internal clock the thing to do was push through the day and go to sleep when everybody else normally went to sleep the next morning hed be back on schedule opening the bedroom door he found a man in the hallway the man wore a beretta mm pistol and carried a twoway radio with a slight french accent and in perfect english the man said mr bellasar asked me to be at your disposal in case you wanted a tour of the grounds he certainly pays attention to his guests proceeding along the corridor malone listened to his escort point out the various paintings tables and vases all from the french regency period other corridors had their own themes he learned and every piece was museum quality they went down a curving stairway to a foyer topped by the most intricate crystal chandelier malone had ever seen its five hundred years old the escort explained from a venetian palazzo the marble on this floor came from the same palazzo malone nodded yes bellasar was definitely a collector outside the sun felt pleasant but malone ignored it concentrating only on his surroundings as he strolled with his escort through gardens past topiaries and ponds toward the swimming pool abruptly he whirled gunfire crackled from the testing range the escort explained gesturing toward an area beyond an orchard several assault rifles made it sound as if a small war were taking place over there the escort avoided going in that direction just as he avoided going toward the large stone building whose bell tower had made malone think of a monastery and which was in the same direction its called the cloister the escort said before the french revolution monks lived there but after the churchs lands were confiscated one of mr bellasars ancestors acquired the property not before a mob destroyed all the religious symbols though theres still a room that you could tell was a chapel if you were allowed over there which youre not malone shrugged pretending to be interested only in what the escort showed him and in nothing that the escort avoided for now what he was mainly interested in were the high stone walls that enclosed the grounds and were topped by security cameras the entrances at the back and front had sturdy metal barriers and were watched by guards with automatic weapons getting out wouldnt be easy when something blew up past the orchard the explosion rumbling none of the guards reacted malones escort didnt even bother looking in that direction ill show you where your painting supplies are mr bellasar suggests that you work in a sunroom off the terrace it has the best light when malone returned to his room a thick pamphlet lay on his bedside table its paper was brown with age carefully he picked it up and turned the stiff brittle pages the text was in english the author thomas malthus the title an essay on the principle of population a handwritten note accompanied it i thought youd enjoy some leisure reading leisure malone thought with a title like that on an inside page he read that the pamphlet had been published and printed in london in a priceless first edition the note concluded cocktails and dinner are formal to reinforce the point the tuxedo that malone had noticed in the closet was now laid out on the bed along with a pleated white shirt black pearl cuff links and studs a black silk cummerbund and a black bow tie the last time malone had worn formal clothes had been eight years earlier at his art dealers wedding he hadnt enjoyed it had felt constricted but he was damned if he was going to let bellasar sense his discomfort when he entered the library two hours later he looked as if he wore a tuxedo every day of his life the large twostory area had shelves from floor to ceiling on all four sides every space filled with books except where there were doors and windows ladders on rollers allowed access to the highest shelves on the main level similar ladders on rollers were on a walkway on the second level the glow from coloredglass lamps reflected off leather reading chairs and welloiled side tables next to a larger table in the middle bellasar commanding in his tuxedo his dark hair and italian features made more dramatic by his formal clothes raised a glass of red liquid to his lips a male servant stood discreetly in the background feeling rested bellasar asked fine malone held up the pamphlet im returning this i hate to think something might happen to it in my room just because its a first edition its awfully expensive bedside reading all of these are rare first editions i wouldnt read the texts in any other form whats the point of collecting things if you dont use them whats the point of collecting things in the first place pride of ownership malone set the pamphlet on a table perhaps a paperback is more my style did you get a chance to look through it its a classic discussion of the causes of overpopulation and of ways to control it id heard of malthus before id just never looked at his actual words bellasar sipped more of the red liquid what would you like to drink im told you like tequila you dont miss much i was raised to believe its a sin to be uninformed may i recommend a brand from a private estate in mexicos jalisco region the agave juice is distilled three times and aged twenty years the family makes only limited quantities that it sells to preferred customers this particular lot had a quantity of only two hundred bottles i purchased them all itll be interesting to find out what the rest of the world is missing in the background the servant poured the drink and make me another of these bellasar said the servant nodded since youre a connoisseur what special vodka do you prefer in your bloody mary malone asked vodka good heavens no this isnt a bloody mary its a blend of fresh vegetable juices i never drink alcohol it damages brain and liver cells but youre not bothered if the rest of us drink it as malthus might have said alcohol is a way of reducing the population it wasnt clear if bellasar was joking to the left a door opened and the most beautiful woman malone had ever seen stepped into the room malone had to remind himself to breathe it was obvious now why bellasar had insisted that cocktails and dinner be formal bellasar wanted a stage in which to present another of his possessions the womans evening dress was black but caught the lamp glow around her in a way that made it shimmer it was strapless leaving the elegant curve of her tan shoulders unbroken it was lowcut revealing the smooth tops of her breasts its waist left no doubt how firm her stomach was its sensuous line flowed over her hips and down to her ankles emphasizing how long and statuesque her legs were but the ultimate effect was to focus attention on her face the magazine cover hadnt done justice to the burnt sienna color of her skin her features were in perfect proportion the curve of her chin paralleled the opposite curve of her eyebrows which further paralleled the way she had twisted her long lush fiery brunette hair into a swirl but the grace of symmetry was only a partial explanation for her beauty her eyes were the key and the captivating spirit behind them captivating even though she was troubled the others are late her voice made malone think of grapes and hot summer afternoons there wont be any others bellasar said but when you told me the evening was formal i thought itll be just the three of us i want you to meet chase malone hes an artist perhaps youve heard of him malone felt his cheeks turn warm with selfconsciousness as she looked at him i recognize the name her accent was american she sounded hesitant theres no reason you should know my work malone said the art worlds too preoccupied with itself but you will know his work bellasar said she looked puzzled hes going to paint you mr malone allow me to introduce my wife sienna you never mentioned anything about this sienna said its an idea ive been considering when i had the good fortune to cross paths with mr malone i offered a commission he graciously accepted but why would to immortalize you my dear throughout the afternoon malone had begun to wonder if jeb had been telling the truth about the danger sienna was in after all jeb might have been willing to say anything to get malone to accept the assignment but a darkness in bellasars tone now convinced him for her part sienna seemed to have no idea how close she was to dying can you start tomorrow morning bellasar asked her if thats what you want she sounded confused if you want youre not being forced bellasar said but that was exactly how sienna looked forced when she turned toward malone what time is nine oclock too early no im usually up by six siennas an avid horsewoman bellasar explained early every morning she rides bellasars pride in siennas riding seemed artificial malone thought he sensed another dark undertone and couldnt help recalling that bellasars three previous wives had died in accidents was that how bellasar planned for sienna to be killed in a faked riding accident he nodded i used to ride when i was a kid nine oclock then in the sunroom off the terrace good as bellasar leaned close to kiss siennas right cheek he was distracted by something at the edge of her eye whats the matter she asked nothing he turned toward malone you havent tasted your tequila the dining room had logs blazing in a huge fireplace the table was long enough to seat forty and looked even longer with just the three of them bellasar took the end while malone and sienna sat on each side of him facing each other as candlelight flickered the movements of servants echoed in the cavernous space food and sex bellasar said malone shook his head in puzzlement he noticed that sienna kept her eyes down concentrating on her meal or was she trying to avoid attracting bellasars attention food and sex malone asked two of the four foundations of malthuss argument bellasar looked at a plate of poached trout being set before him humans need food their sexual attraction is powerful and the other two population grows at a geometric rate one two four eight sixteen thirtytwo in contrast food production grows at a mathematical rate one two three four five six our ability to reproduce always outreaches our ability to feed the population as a consequence a considerable part of society is doomed to live in misery bellasar paused to savor the trout of course we can try to check the growth of population by contraception chastity and limiting the number of children a woman may have some societies recommend abortion but the power of the sex drive being what it is the population continues to grow this year alone the worlds population has swelled with the equivalent of everyone living in scandinavia and the united kingdom were approaching the six billion mark with ten billion estimated by the middle of the twentyfirst century there wont there cant be enough food to sustain them all but other factors come into play for gods merciful plan arranges that whenever theres a drastic imbalance between population and food supply pestilence and war reduce it gods merciful plan malone asked in disbelief according to malthus but i agree with him he was an anglican minister by the way he believed that god allowed misery to be part of his plan in order to test us to make us try to rise to the occasion and strengthen our characters by overcoming adversity when those who have been sufficiently challenged and bettered die they go on to their eternal reward in the meantime because of starvation pestilence and war theyve endured hell on earth sienna said obviously you havent been listening closely my dear otherwise you wouldnt have missed the point sienna concentrated on her plate so wars a good thing malone said acidly and so are weapons merchants its easy to condemn what you dont understand incidentally my greatgreatgreatgrandfather had a friendship with malthus what after the first edition of his essay was published malthus traveled from england to the continent my ancestor had the good fortune to meet him at a dinner party in rome they spent many evenings together exchanging ideas that pamphlet i lent to you was given to my ancestor by malthus himself youre telling me that because of malthuss ideas your ancestor became an arms dealer he considered it a vocation bellasar looked with concern toward sienna my dear you dont seem to be enjoying the trout perhaps the rabbit in the next course will be more to your liking malone lay in his dark bedroom staring troubled at the ceiling the evening had been one of the strangest he had ever experienced the conversation on such a surreal level that he felt disoriented his mind swirling worse than when hed been tranquilized jet lag insisted his eyelids fluttered shut he dreamed of two men wearing wigs and frilly long jackets from huddled by a fire in a smoky tavern pointedly discussing the fate of the multitudes he dreamed of sienna on horseback galloping through cypresses never seeing the trip wire that jerked up toppled her horse and snapped her neck he dreamed of the roar of a helicopter coming in for a landing barely pausing before it lifted off the rumble of its engine receding into the distance his eyes jerked open as he realized that the helicopter had not been a dream getting out of bed he approached the large windows opposite him peering out he saw the shadows of trees across gardens and moonlight reflecting off ponds floodlights illuminated courtyards and lanes a guard stepped into view throwing away a cigarette shifting his rifle from his left shoulder to his right far off the angry voices of two men were so muffled that malone couldnt tell what they shouted at each other the guard paid them no attention the argument stopped as silence drifted over the compound malone wiped a hand across his weary face and returned to bed about to sink back into sleep when he heard a distant gunshot he was willing to bet that the guard didnt pay attention to that either three startled by the sudden approach of the helicopter siennas arabian stallion faltered at the jump nearly throwing her into the stream momentarily off balance she tightened her thighs against the horses flanks as the stallion threatened to lurch down the streams bank she eased the pressure from her right thigh applied more pressure to the left and simultaneously did the same with her hands on the reins turning the horse away from the stream she pressed down on her heels while expertly easing back on the reins then came to a stop just as the helicopter thundered past overhead an opening in the trees allowed her to glimpse it while only someone peering directly down would have been able to spot her then the helicopter was gone approaching the hills patting the arabians neck whispering assurances sienna waited for the roar to recede completely the time was a little before eight the estate had two helicopters and at dawn as she had reached the stable the first one had taken off she couldnt help wondering if derek was aboard either of them in fact she hoped he was she dreaded going back to the château finding him there and straining to adjust to whatever mood he was in this morning hed been gone for six days and it had taken her three of those days to recover from his icy attitude before he left during the past few months no matter how she had tried to relate to him she hadnt been successful interpreting his thoughts had become impossible sometimes she wondered what would happen if she just kept riding taking a crosscountry route avoiding roads and lanes heading up into the hills how far could she get and what would she be able to do once she was far from the estate she had no food or water certainly shed arouse suspicion if she packed saddlebags with provisions before she set out for her daily ride she had never been able to prove it but she suspected that derek had men watching her from a distance as she rode through the outreaches of the estate if she did manage to prove she was being watched derek would no doubt shrug and say he wanted to make certain she was protected she had no money had no access to it derek kept strict control of that she could have pocketed some of her jewels but where was she going to find anyone in the countryside who could pay her what they were worth without money she couldnt feed herself get a hotel room or even buy a bus ticket if she tried to get away from derek however she looked at it she was trapped perhaps that was why the helicopter had thundered in this direction to remind her that she was never really alone that she had no hope of leaving riding back toward the compound she barely noticed the sunbathed scenery around her she was too preoccupied knowing that in less than an hour she would have to deal with the new complication that derek had introduced the artist he had hired to paint her artist she didnt understand derek never did anything on a whim what was he thinking rubbing her left arm where he had twisted it sharply before he left the previous week she told herself that regrettably she would soon find out when the stables came into view she dismounted took off her helmet and shook her head letting her lush hair fall loose as she led the arabian along a lane bordered by cypresses she knew she could have asked one of the stable men to walk the horse and cool it down but she enjoyed the intimacy of taking care of her horse as much as she did the exertion of riding it she turned to pat the horses neck and murmur endearments looked ahead and faltered at the sight of the artist coming out of the stables and leaning against a rail the formal dress of last nights dinner had made it difficult for her to assess his bearing a tuxedo always gave a man more presence than he normally had now the artists casual clothes sneakers jeans and a blue chambray shirt the cuffs of which were folded up made it easier to assess him he was tall six feet or so trim yet muscular obviously accustomed to exercise his tan face was attractive in a rugged fashion his sandcolored hair slightly long curling at the back of his neck the way he crossed his arms made him seem comfortable with himself good morning his smile was engaging did you have a good ride very she lied but i must have lost track of the time i was supposed to meet you in the sunroom at nine am i late no im early getting to know you where well be working seemed limited i thought it would be helpful if i met you at a place where you feel at ease i feel at ease everywhere mr malone please call me chase my husband didnt mention it last night but i used to be a model ill feel at ease wherever you pose me but posing isnt what i want from you sienna shook her head in confusion then how are you going to do the portrait well figure that out together her puzzlement was interrupted when a sudden nudge from behind nearly pushed her off balance it came from her horse excuse me she said he feels ignored sure finish cooling him down you know about horses at once she remembered thats right last night you said you rode when you were a boy at my grandfathers farm do you want me to get a halter why not youll find one in the tack room in the stable first door on the right i saw it when i was looking around when he came back with the halter sienna switched it for the bit and bridle on the stallion then led the horse to a rail she raised the left stirrup and unbuckled the saddle what did you mean well figure out together how to do the portrait im not a portrait artist my specialty is landscapes what sienna straightened then why did my husband hire you actually its called offer a commission im sensitive about the word hire basically your husband likes my work and hes awfully hard to turn down thats my husband all right but i do know how to paint mrs bellasar i dont doubt it call me sienna have you eaten yet just a couple of apples i shared with my friend here then maybe we could have breakfast while a guard watched from a side of the terrace they sat at a wroughtiron table an umbrella sheltering them from the sun which was warm for february chase she sipped her coffee thats an unusual first name actually its a nickname my first name is charles but at one of the grade schools i went to one of them i went to a lot its a long story the teacher put a list of our names on a bulletin board to make it easier for us to get to know one another to save time she used abbreviations richard was rich daniel was dan charles was chas she put a period after it but the period had a little curlicue that made it look like an e so the kids started making fun of me calling me chase it didnt bother me though in fact i thought it sounded kind of cool so i kept it nothing metaphysical about being chased or chasing your destiny sienna picked up a croissant there were plenty of instances especially in the military when chasing was going on as far as being an artist goes i think i did find my destiny but youre not doing a portrait of me i need to learn about you i thought youd be working by now a voice interrupted when sienna turned and saw her husband standing at an open door that led to the terrace her stomach contracted no longer hungry she set down her croissant but chase took a bite from his own responding calmly weve already started you have a strange way of painting paintings the easy part its the thought that goes into it thats hard im being efficient eating breakfast while i study my subject chase made it sound like a joke but when he glanced at her his gaze assuring sienna suddenly realized how attentive his blue eyes were despite the casual way hed been looking at her she had the sense that shed never been looked at so totally not even when shed been a model a burst of machinegun fire broke the stillness from the range beyond the cloister on edge sienna jerked her head in that direction managing to calm herself she returned her attention to her husband noticing that neither he nor chase had been distracted sounds like acaliber chase said you have a good ear well ive been shot at by them often enough one of my engineers is working on a modification a faster feeding mechanism how are they compensating for the increase in heat thats the problem the subject infuriated her no inwardly shaking her head she corrected herself what infuriated her was that the man with whom she had been talking an artist who had seemed to display sensitivity during the conversation was as comfortable talking about guns as was her husband the two were no different she stood if youll excuse me ill go shower fix my hair and get ready for the session she made herself look indifferently down at chase what would you like me to wear those boots jodhpurs and leather jacket youve got on are fine and if you wouldnt usually shower right now i wish you wouldnt i want to get an idea of what you are not what youd like me to think you are dont fix your hair or freshen your makeup dont do anything special just let me look at you his gaze was once again total it made her shiver whumpwhumpwhump with an increasing roar one of the helicopters returned a distant speck that enlarged into a grotesque dragonfly and set down on the compounds landing pad halfway between the château and the cloister i look forward to seeing the progress you make her husband said a vague warning in his voice but it was obvious that his attention was elsewhere as he stepped from the terrace and walked with anticipation along a stone path near a rose garden and a fountain approaching a man stepping down from the helicopter the man was too far away for malone to get more than a general look at him the hearty way he and bellasar shook hands then gripped each others arms it was clear the two knew each other well and hadnt seen each other for a while wider at the hips and waist than at his chest the newcomer had rounded forwardleaning shoulders which suggested he spent a lot of time hunched over a desk he wore a suit and tie was caucasian and had hair only at the sides of his head at a distance his age was hard to tell maybe midforties he turned with concern toward several large wooden crates being unloaded from the helicopter each crate was heavy enough to require two men to lift it and as one of the men stumbled almost losing his grip on his end of the crate the newcomer stepped frantically backward gesturing in alarm his barked command to be careful echoing the hundred yards to the terrace ah the artists life a caustic voice said reluctantly malone switched his attention from the helicopter toward potter who stepped from the château a pleasant chat over a late breakfast no schedule to worry about ive already had this conversation with your boss malone said then theres no point in being repetitive potter took off his glasses and polished them i never question methods of working as long as they get results good morning sienna good morning alex did you enjoy your ride he didnt wait for an answer are you getting along with mr malone he has a tendency to be abrasive i havent noticed then perhaps its only to me potter put his glasses back on and stepped from the terrace his squat figure got smaller as he followed the same route past the rose garden and fountain that bellasar had joining the group as they entered the cloister he obviously doesnt like me malone said but am i wrong or did he seem a little distant to you theres only one person he gets along with and thats my husband a firstclass guard dog the sunroom smelled musty it was a singlestory extension of the château built onto the terrace the floor made of the same flagstones that led into it with a southern exposure it had a wall of windows and several skylights it must be ten degrees warmer than outside malone said i imagine you eat breakfast in here on chilly days no the room hasnt been used since ive lived here with a view like this derek isnt fond of the place it was spacious with a high ceiling except for several wooden tables along the left side it was so empty their footsteps echoed are you sure you dont want me to change my clothes sienna asked i dont want anything except for you to do what youd normally do malone sat on one of the tables his legs dangling see my problem is how to do this portrait so it captures you so someone who knows you will say yes thats sienna there all right thats not only how she looks but what she is whatever that is malone chuckled theres nothing like a heavy conversation to put you at ease you dont need to entertain me after all the weeks i spent learning to play the banjo sienna halfsmiled the next few seconds stretched on and on as malone studied the curve of her slightly parted lips the unique combination of brightness and vulnerability in that half smile what are you doing doing the way youre even when i was a model no one ever stared that hard at me sorry malone felt his cheeks turn warm with selfconsciousness i dont mean to seem rude i have to look at you that way by the time this project is finished ill know your face better than ive known anyone elses in my life can i ask you a question she looked unsure i told you how i got mine how did you get yours i dont your first name oh she seemed relieved theres not much to tell my parents were italianamericans from a little town in illinois but their parents had come from italy from siena and all the old folks ever talked about was how wonderful that part of italy was so when my parents went on their honeymoon thats the place they chose they couldnt think of a more loving first name to give me your parents were italianamericans they died when i was twelve im sorry malone said my mother was killed in a car accident my father had a heart attack two months later but i always thought it was literally a broken heart you loved them very much the way you said that did you really think i might say no everybodys situation is different you didnt get along with your parents malone was surprised that hed opened the subject i never had any arguments with my father he surprised himself further its hard to fight with somebody youve never met a burst of machinegun fire broke the moment malone turned toward the sunrooms open door the stuttering blast echoed from behind the cloister doesnt that get on your nerves actually the pauses are what bother me she said its like when i lived in manhattan i got so used to the noise of traffic even in the middle of the night that i felt something was wrong if i was somewhere quiet well this sunrooms about as quiet as its going to get malone brought a chair from a corner and set it in the light it was wooden with a slotted back this doesnt look very comfortable we should bring a cushion from its not a problem but when sienna lowered herself onto the chair she did look uncomfortable what do you want me to do do nothing just sit there but how do you want me head tilted to the right or left eyes up or down whatever way you feel natural malone picked up a large sketch pad and a box of charcoal crayons this is very preliminary do you mind if i stand so long as you keep your face in my direction the charcoal scratched on the pad she looked more uneasy photographers hated it if i stood still i had to keep moving often there was rock music when the film in one camera was exposed theyd quickly hand it to an assistant then switch to another camera and never miss a shot theyd have a fan pointed at my hair so when i spun my hair twirled theyd tell me to keep fluffing it with my hands malones charcoal crayon stopped scratching whats the matter she asked youre going to have to keep still for me dont exaggerate but i do need you a little less animated if im going to make a good likeness can i talk at least photographers also hated it when i talked be my guest malone made a few more scratches with the charcoal then tore the sheet from the pad and set it on a table that one didnt turn out did i move too much no its fine for what it is malone resumed scratching on the pad its just a study ill do hundreds before i try anything permanent hundreds to get a feel for your face the photographers i worked with sometimes took hundreds of exposures in a session well this is going to take longer sienna raised her eyebrows the expression was marvelous good madame will you be wanting lunch confused malone turned toward an aproned servant standing in the doorway so early its almost two monsieur malones confusion changed to amazement when he looked at the table behind him a chaos of sketches littered it my god he told sienna you must be exhausted she was sitting on the chair by now a little but you were so engrossed i didnt want to say anything besides its been interesting she thanked the servant interesting malone followed sienna onto the terrace his eyes adjusted to the increased brightness watching me draw no talking with you malone tried to remember their conversation hed been so absorbed in working while glancing surreptitiously outside toward the helicopter area and the cloister that the things theyd talked about were a blur i havent had a long conversation with anybody in quite a while sienna sat at a table and told the servant just a salad and iced tea please malone ordered the same yes your husbands so busy you must be alone a lot sienna didnt respond but something in her eyes made malone suspect that even when she and bellasar were together they didnt talk you never met your father the question caught him by surprise it took him a moment to recall their unfinished topic from when theyd entered the sunroom sienna looked apologetic dont answer if im being too personal no thats all right i dont mind talking about it my mother was a drunk malone tried to sound matteroffact but he couldnt stop bitterness from creeping into his voice she had a string of boyfriends i was supposed to call dad but i never did at the stables you mentioned something about a grandfather my mothers father he took care of me on his farm when my mother wasnt dragging me from state to state with whatever boyfriend she had at the time i spent a lot of time by myself thats when i started to draw it just goes to show sometimes good can come out of bad she sounded as if she wanted to believe it excellent bellasar said approaching from the sunroom youve begun sienna stiffened you saw the sketches malone asked theyre very promising any of them could be the basis for a splendid portrait bellasar said they probably wont be ive got a long way to go but sometimes first instincts are best its possible to overthink something true im glad we agree not every task has to be difficult and take forever my wife is an uncommonly beautiful woman all you have to do is portray her beauty but shes beautiful in a hundred different ways malone said since im not going to do a hundred portraits i need to figure out which way most reflects her nature sienna glanced down at her hands forgive us my dear bellasar said for what speaking about you as if youre not here going back to work wasnt too tedious not at all i found it interesting well then bellasar said lets hope it continues that way it certainly continued that way for malone he couldnt help thinking about the proverb that equated hell with interesting times the days assumed a pattern each morning before work he did calisthenics by the pool he would have preferred to jog but needed to be stationary at a location that allowed him to keep watch on the helicopter pad and the cloister after sienna returned from horseback riding he joined her for breakfast then went to work with her trying to conceal his interest in what was going on outside as the afternoon progressed he offered to quit early in case she was tired always she told him she wanted to continue when they separated at five he knew that he would see her again for cocktails at seven that was bellasars evening routine cocktails although bellasar kept to his vegetable juice and dinner the dress always formal malone hoped someone else would be invited the man who had arrived on the chopper that first morning and who had been so nervous about the rough way the crates he had brought were being unloaded malone wanted a closer look at him perhaps the man would reveal something about his relationship with bellasar but as far as malone could tell the man remained in the cloister sometimes malone found another centuriesold first edition on his bedside table to be analyzed by bellasar during dinner hobbess leviathan was one a treatise maintaining that warfare was the natural state of humans and that the only way to achieve peace was by the force of a dictator bellasars implication was that supplying arms to repressive regimes wasnt the evil it was made out to be by preventing the masses from following their natural instincts and lunging for one anothers throats dictatorships saved lives so did arms dealers after conversations of this sort during which sienna remained silent malone climbed the curving staircase to his secondstory room more on guard than hed been since hed left the military no matter his tense sleep he awoke the next morning with greater concentration more committed to the dangerous balance he had to maintain if he focused his attention too much on sienna he risked failing to notice something important at the cloister but if he didnt focus on her he wouldnt accomplish the quality of work that he wanted and that could be equally dangerous for bellasar might think that he wasnt making an effort you wont be working today sienna looked disappointed why were ready to begin the next stage i have to get the surface ready malone showed her a large piece of plywood on a table i thought painters use canvas the kind of paint im going to use is called tempera it needs a more rigid surface than canvas this piece of plywood is old enough that it wont warp anymore the chemicals in it have evaporated so they wont affect the paint but just in case im going to seal it with this glue he pointed toward a pot of white viscous liquid on a hot plate it smells chalky thats whats in it malone dipped a brush into the pot and applied the mixture to the board as soon as the board was covered he set down the brush and rubbed his fingers over the warm glue why are you doing that to get rid of the air bubbles sienna looked intrigued care to try he asked youre serious if you dont mind getting your hands sticky she hesitated her cinnamon eyes brightened when she ran her fingers through the glue it reminds me of when i was in kindergarten doing finger painting except that in this case we dont want to leave a pattern malone brushed the layer smooth it never occurred to me that painting involved more than drawing shapes and using color if you want it to last it involves a lot of other things malone handed her the brush why dont you put on the next coat but what if i make a mistake ill fix it she dipped the brush into the pot not very much right thats the idea is there any special way to do this pick a corner she chose the upper right now brush to the left you can use short backandforth strokes but when it comes to the finishing strokes brush only to the left go down a little and move to the left again excellent make sure everythings smooth are you feeling any drag on the brush a little resistance good stop a minute we want it to start drying but not get hard since youre moving to the next stage you must have decided how you want to pose me malone nodded what pose is it how am i going to look see for yourself he pointed toward a sketch on another table she approached it uncertainly peering down for long seconds she didnt say anything im smiling but i look sad and vulnerable but determined not to get hurt anymore siennas voice was almost a whisper thats how i seem to you one of the ways do you object she kept staring at the sketch no i dont object you have all kinds of expressions but most of them dont show whats going on behind your eyes at first i assumed it was a habit from when you were a model after all the company that hired you to pose in whatever dress they were selling couldnt have cared less if you happened to be feeling glum when you did the sitting they just wanted you to make the damned dress look good so i imagine you did your job turned on your smile put a glint in your eyes and lowered a shield behind those eyes a lot of days it was like that but every once in a while when i was studying you which i dont mind any longer by the way im amazed that ive gotten used to it when i was a model the looks i got were usually predatory but yours dont threaten me they make me feel good about myself you dont normally feel good about yourself the man who drew that sketch knows the answer every once in a while when i was studying you the shield behind your eyes would disappear and this is how you seemed to me your sadness and vulnerability are what make you beautiful or maybe its the reverse the reverse i wonder if its your beauty that makes you sad and vulnerable siennas throat sounded dry in the sketch im looking to my right at what whatevers important to you a breeze from that direction is blowing my hair somehow youve created the illusion that whatever im looking at is passing me the important things are passing all of us sienna hurried up the steps to the sunbathed terrace and tried not to falter when she didnt see chase at the wroughtiron table where they usually met before going to work im a little early she told herself hell be here shortly but before she could sit down she saw a servant carry a large bowl of something into the sunroom puzzled she followed the servant came out as sienna entered she saw chase peering down at what was now visible to her in the bowl eggs good morning he smiled good morning youre going to have breakfast in here i might not have breakfast at all im too eager to get started chase picked up an egg cracked it divided its shell and poured the yolk from one half to the other making the white drop into a bowl still thinking he intended to eat the eggs for breakfast sienna asked how are you going to cook them im not im going to make paint with them what chase eased the yolk from the half shell and placed it on a paper towel where he rolled it gently blotting off the remainder of the white youre gentle sienna said id have broken the yolk by now believe me years ago i broke plenty when i was learning with a thumb and forefinger chase picked up the yolk by the edge of its sack and dangled it over a clean jar feel like helping id break it at this point we want to use that knife to puncture the bottom of the yolk carefully good chase let the yolk drip from its sack then delicately squeezed the remainder out here he handed her an egg what help me prepare more yolks but you saw how its done the worst that can happen is we have to get more eggs she chuckled yesterday i was finger painting today youve got me playing with food but after she cracked the egg and separated the white from the yolk she wasnt prepared for how sensual it felt to roll the intact yolk in a paper towel and blot off the remainder of the white the soft pouch felt extremely vulnerable through the paper towel needing to be handled with the utmost care when she transferred it to the palm of her hand the yolk felt surprisingly dry delicately quivering the tactile sensation intensifying thank you she said why i cant remember the last time i had a pleasurable new experience if separating eggs is your idea of a good time now it was chases turn to chuckle she enjoyed the sound of it how many do you need eight he lanced the yolk he held what do you want with them after dinner last night i came back here and ground the pigments you see in those other jars sienna studied them white black red blue green yellow violet and brown except for one they were common colors and yet she didnt think shed ever seen any so pure and lustrous that shade of brown is unusual burnt sienna she felt a shock of recognition the shade of your skin chase said your parents named you well it happens to be my favorite color she looked in amazement from the jar to her arm its distinguished by a brilliant transparent fiery undertone thats especially suited for a medium as brilliant and luminous as tempera chase said after adding one pigment to each of the yolks he blended the mixtures with distilled water until they were fluid enough to be applied to a surface and now were ready to rock and roll the plywood was on an easel its chalk surface covered with a version of the sketch that chase had selected so now you color the sketch sienna asked no its more complicated than that he guided her toward her chair which he had placed in front of the easel the sketch is only a blueprint until that moment she had thought that hed stared at her as intensely as anyone possibly could but now she realized that he hadnt really stared at her at all the power of the concentration he now directed toward her was eerie from five feet away his gaze seemed to touch her along her neck her lips her eyelids her brow she felt invisible fingers caress her skin making it tingle she felt something from him sink beneath her warming her becoming one with her are you all right what she straightened in the chair you look like youre falling asleep if you want to get some rest we can try again later no she said quickly im fine keep going chase managed to keep his intense gaze focused on her all the while he dipped his brush into a jar of paint used his left thumb and forefinger to squeeze some of the paint from the brush and applied the paint to the rigid surface sometimes his hand went to the surface automatically as if he knew how the image he was creating appeared without needing to look at it except for quick glances while he concentrated on her overwhelmed needing to talk but not knowing what about she said the first thing that came into her mind i can feel you painting me if this makes you uncomfortable no i dont mind it at all how long will the portrait take as long as it needs thats one of the advantages of tempera i can add layer after layer for weeks before the yolk finally becomes so inert it refuses to accept another level dont worry though this isnt going to take weeks sienna surprised herself by thinking that she wouldnt mind if it did a muffled explosion rattled the windows what are they doing over there chase asked i have no idea ive never seen that part of the estate chase looked surprised when derek and i were married he told me i wasnt allowed over there i didnt know how serious he was until curiosity got the better of me and i tried to get a look a guard stopped me before i was halfway there that night the discussion at dinner wasnt pleasant i never tried again you didnt know how he earned his money when you married him sienna rubbed her forehead sorry thats a question i have no business asking no its all right she exhaled wearily i should have asked more questions of my own i had a vague idea of what he did but i didnt make certain connections what is it they say the devils in the details once i began to understand the specifics i wished i were still naïve the next thing chase was standing over her are you okay her shoulder tingled from the touch of his hand its nothing a headache maybe we should stop until after lunch no we had a rhythm going its exquisite bellasars smile was as bright as malone had ever seen it emphasizing the tan of his broad handsome face better than i dared hope more imaginative than i dreamed a portrait could be isnt it alex yes potter said without enthusiasm it was eight days later they were in the library where bellasar had insisted on a special unveiling champagne for everyone except of course bellasar theres something dark and unsettling about it at the same time its bright with celebration bellasar said a study in contrasts the paradox of beauty that was the idea malone said then i understand it bellasar was pleased you see whatever your opinion of me i do have an appreciation of art there was a moment i confess when your attitude made me wonder if id chosen the right artist potter nodded his spectacled eyes fixed not on the portrait but on malone what do you think my dear bellasar turned toward where sienna stood uncomfortably in the background how does it feel to have your beauty immortalized the glory of beauty the sadness that it doesnt last but here in this painting its preserved forever bellasar looked at malone for reassurance you did say the materials were chosen to last an unusually long time oil on canvas tends to crack after several hundred years malone said but tempera on wood with six layers of foundation beneath the paint and the glaze i put over it yes bellasars eyes were intense i dont see why in a thousand years itll look any different a thousand years imagine bellasar was spellbound impermanent beauty made permanent dantes beatrice although malone understood the reference bellasar felt the need to explain when dante was nine he saw a girl a few months younger than himself her beauty so struck him that he worshiped her from afar until her death sixteen years later her name was beatrice and she so inspired dante to meditate about ideal beauty that the divine comedy was the consequence siennas beauty inspired you in a similar way and of course the inspiration will become greater as you work on the second portrait second portrait sienna sounded puzzled but this one turned out so well why would you want because the second will emphasize your body as much as this does your face my body nude nude sienna turned toward malone did you know about this reluctantly awkwardly he said yes she spun toward bellasar i wont have anything to do with this of course you will well talk about it upstairs bellasar gripped her arm the force of his hand whitening her dark skin as he led her across the library at the door he glanced back at malone if youre curious about dante and beatrice rossetti translated dantes autobiography he gestured proprietarially toward the far wall youll find an edition of dante and his circle over there although naturally my own preference is to read the original italian then bellasar and sienna were gone leaving malone with potter and the servant who had poured the champagne potter stopped scowling at malone and addressed his attention to the portrait his slight nod might have been in approval but the sarcasm in his voice was unmistakable a careerdefining work its too bad no outsider will ever see it he gestured to the servant who set down the dom pérignon and draped a dust cloth over the portrait coming potter asked malone youll want to get ready for dinner i think ill stay here a moment and find that book with a gaze that made clear nothing malone did would ever be good enough potter left the room malone turned toward the bookshelves making a pretense of searching for the book behind him he heard the servant lift the portrait off the easel and take it from the library malone waited ten seconds then followed he reached the vestibule in time to see the servant carrying the portrait up the curving staircase keeping a careful distance malone started up as the servant passed the next level and proceeded toward the top a carpet on the stairs muffled malones footsteps the servant couldnt hear him climb higher peering beyond the final steps malone watched the servant carry the portrait to a door halfway along the middle corridor as the servant knocked on the door malone eased back down the stairs four a chopper took off and roared away its blades glinting in the morning sunlight but as far as malone could tell the man he had seen arrive the first day wasnt aboard finishing his calisthenics by the pool scanning the estate he couldnt think of a way to get sienna out as soon as he finished the portraits and left if he was allowed to leave he was supposed to tell jeb how to rescue her but now that he had studied the compounds defenses it was obvious that even the best extraction team would have trouble to add to his apprehension this was the first morning he hadnt seen her ride from the stable it was so important a part of her routine that he could imagine only the worst reasons for her to have abandoned it had bellasar decided that one portrait of her was enough and it was finally time to rid himself of an unwanted spouse making his way to his room to shower and dress he tried to convince himself that there might be an innocent reason for sienna to have failed to go out for her ride she might not be feeling well for example in which case she would send word via a servant while he was having breakfast but all the while he sat alone on the terrace no messenger arrived i wonder he asked the servant who brought his coffee if you know why madame isnt joining me this morning have you heard if shes ill no monsieur i havent heard anything a half hour later sienna still hadnt arrived and malone was forced to admit she wasnt coming his stomach uneasy he decided that his only option was to ask a servant to knock on her door and try to find out what had happened he felt his pulse speed with the premonition that she was in trouble perhaps unconscious from a drug bellasar had given her on edge he rose to tell a servant to check on her and froze with relief when sienna stepped onto the terrace she wore dusty boots faded jeans and a denim work shirt as if she had dressed to go riding but had been detained her long hair was tied back in a ponytail emphasizing the classic contour of her chin and jaw but her pulledback hair also emphasized a severity in her eyes that malone hadnt seen before an anger something had happened whatever vulnerability hid behind her beauty was definitely not in evidence this morning im glad to see you malone said when you didnt show up for breakfast i got worried without a word sienna walked resolutely toward him her boots and jeans emphasizing her long legs and tightly belted waist whats wrong malone asked you look as if im late her words were clipped were wasting time wasting time what are you talking about lets get to work but whats the matter tell me what sienna pivoted and crossed the terrace marching toward the sunroom malone followed mystified noting her resolute stride and rigid posture although the sunroom was bright it was less so than outdoors and his eyes needed a moment to adjust to the difference he was twice as mystified and suddenly alarmed as she angrily unbuttoned her shirt and threw it onto the floor wait a minute malone said why are she jerked off her bra and hurled it past the shirt would you please tell me whats going on malone said i dont im getting ready for work she yanked off her boots and socks for god sake stop whats happened tell me why youre im doing what my husband wants she savagely opened her belt took off her jeans and threw them the buckle clattering across the floor her white bikini panties went after the jeans in a final defiant gesture she untwisted the clasp that bound her ponytail freeing her hair so it hung to her shoulders outraged she stood before him her burnt sienna skin uniform from head to toe what are you waiting for she asked get your damned sketch pad get started malone found it nearly impossible to speak he took a deep breath and forced out the words this isnt what i want im supposed to assume a provocative pose is that it no then what the hell do you want stop confusing me tell me what im supposed to do put on your shirt he picked it up offering it to her she glared i mean it malone said you accepted the commission didnt you obviously and you knew the second portrait was supposed to be nude yes dont you think it would have been polite to tell me all the time you were staring at me i was flattered because it wasnt like you were staring she struggled to order her thoughts you were admiring without being predatory making me feel good about myself i thought finally heres somebody who understands me as a person not an object and now i find out this was just a job for you make the bitch feel at ease and do what youre paid for no malone said this wasnt just a job please he continued to hold out her shirt she grabbed it her harsh gaze remained fixed on him but he never looked away from her eyes never let his own gaze waver lest he unwittingly suggest he wasnt being truthful she put on the shirt listen to me malone said at the start this was just a job yes i didnt know you the first time we met was uncomfortable it looked like we might not get along i figured this was going to be the hardest work id ever attempted and i wished id never gotten involved she glared but day by day we got to know each other malone said more important we seemed to enjoy each others conversation i looked forward to getting up in the morning to meeting you at breakfast and going to work each day the project became important to me i realized that id never done better work in my life because id never had a better subject she glared harder and each day as the first portrait came closer to completion malone said i felt increasingly tense because i knew that id soon have to do the second portrait but i didnt want the first one to be completed talking with you identifying with you transmitting my imagination through you had become so meaningful to me that i didnt want it to end i knew of course it was going to have to end i couldnt postpone completing it forever but i couldnt adjust to the thought of what it was going to be like painting you under different circumstances with everything strained and me having to stare at you all over again getting to know your body as well as i know your face i can paint whatever i set my mind to but if its going to be the best work i can do i cant be objective what im going to say is probably the strangest thing youve ever heard a man tell you given the relationship weve established the last thing i wanted was to see you naked id have been content just to study your face and i had no idea how i was going to deal with the problem when i couldnt avoid it any longer the last of malones words echoed into nothingness silence gathered finally broken by the scrape of his shoes on the flagstones as he walked to her jeans picked them up and returned them to her the shirt which she had rebutttoned was long enough to cover her even so he wanted her to feel totally at ease a tear trickled from her left eye why does derek want these portraits in the first place i dont understand any of this the only reason i know is what he told you malone lied he wants to preserve your beauty to make it permanent including my body including your body the next thing hell have me shot and stuffed she said her statement was so close to the truth that malone fought hard not to react if im so beautiful why wont he look at me siennas voice quavered everything i do is wrong as far as hes concerned the disapproving way he treats me not just disapproving hes contemptuous why would he want portraits of someone who disgusts him tears streamed down her face now reddening her eyes bringing out the fire beneath her tan skin before malone realized she was leaning against him holding him with a desperation that made him think of someone struggling not to drown her shoulders heaved her deep sobs racking them he smelled apricots in her hair nutmeg on her skin he felt her tears drip onto his shirt they soaked through burning his chest at the same time he felt her breasts beneath her shirt they pressed against him making him terribly aware of the jeans she hadnt put on her legs were bare so were her hips beneath her shirt so was is this a technique they teach in art school bellasar asked from the doorway with a frightened gasp sienna jerked away from malone and spun toward her husband some kind of artistic encouragement bellasar asked but is the artist encouraging the model or the model encouraging the artist this isnt what youre thinking sienna said how do you know what im thinking you were expected to take your clothes off after all if youre afraid ill think ive caught you having an affair dont worry ive never once doubted that youd remain faithful to me you wouldnt have the nerve to do otherwise sienna flinched and ive never yet heard of a tryst in which the woman made herself sexually attractive by sobbing all over her lover bellasar approached and drew a hand along the tears that trickled down her cheeks youre a mess my dear you look the way you did when i first saw you in milan you werent photographable then and youre certainly not anything id like to see a portrait of now siennas sobs came from deep within her your nose is running your mouth is how on earth is this man supposed to do his work malone couldnt help noticing that bellasar never once looked at him go to your room and clean yourself up bellasar said when you return after lunch i expect you to have repaired the damage youve done to yourself and be ready to pose siennas lips trembled damn it what are you waiting for bellasar asked move for once in your life do something right through tearblurred eyes she looked at bellasar then switched her emotionravaged features toward malone abruptly she ran from the room it had taken all of malones willpower not to stop bellasar from humiliating her the rage that had prompted him to accept bellasars commission seethed twice as strongly in him more than anything he wanted to get even but not here not now he kept telling himself attacking bellasar for what hed just done breaking his arms and legs and as many other bones as malone could before the guards rushed in wasnt the punishment bellasar deserved it wouldnt help sienna it wouldnt get her safely off the estate keep control malone urged himself as sienna disappeared beyond the wall of windows silence gathered the sunroom seemed to shrink i want to ask your professional opinion about something bellasar said anything you want to know about painting ill do my best to answer this isnt about painting the stutter of a machine gun grew louder as malone aproached the shooting range he noted that the shrublined path bellasar had chosen avoided the cloister he also noted an increase in guards and remembered that sienna had told him she had never been allowed to enter this section of the estate so why is bellasar bringing me here malone thought does he feel free to show me the shooting range because he knows ill never live to tell anyone what i see the machine gun stopped then started again from the force of its bursts malone identified the weapon as acaliber one and its astonishingly rapid rate of fire made him conclude that the problem bellasar had mentioned weeks earlier how to compensate for the heat that a faster feeding mechanism generated had been solved the shrubs gave way to an open area in which there were several wooden shooting stalls that resembled roadside vending stands with the difference that although each had a roof there wasnt a back wall where fruits and vegetables would normally be on display there were spotting scopes and clamps for bracing weapons whose sighting mechanisms needed calibration between two of these stations a machine gun had been mounted on a tripod a man in gray coveralls pulled plugs from his ears leaned over to examine the weapon then reached for a tool in a box next to it an ammunition belt its rounds as thick and long as a finger fed into the weapon from a large metal bin on the right expended brass casings littered the ground glinting in the sun but malone gave these details only passing notice too preoccupied by where the machine gun was aimed that area was spacious several hundred yards square it contained a village in which everything had been devastated by explosions and bullets huge jagged holes gaped in concreteblock buildings walls had toppled ceilings collapsed the scorched frames of cars and trucks littered what had once been streets but were now wastelands of rubble and craters movement attracted malones attention back to the man in coveralls who at the sound of approaching footsteps straightened from the machine gun behind drab spectacles potters eyes hardened when he saw malone youre more versatile than i thought malone said oh youd be surprised what i can do potter turned toward bellasar he shouldnt be here i want to show him something its against your rules and since theyre my rules i can break them bellasar pointed toward the machine gun if youve finished adjusting it put up some targets but do what youre told i dont pay you to argue potters cheek muscles twitched with a glance toward malone that left no doubt whom he blamed for the reprimand he had just received he went over to one of the shooters stations and flicked a switch malone momentarily thought his eyes were deceiving him the ravaged village came to life soldiers ran from one building to another civilians scurried for cover jeeps bumped along the wreckagescattered streets to the right an armored personnel carrier lumbered into view turning to cross in front of the village two large tarpaulincovered trucks hurried after it none of this was what it seemed the soldiers and civilians were lifelike mannequins dressed for their various roles they moved in a way that suggested they were attached to a motorized track below ground level the personnel carrier and the trucks moved on motorized tracks also impressive malone said bellasar nodded as if he took for granted that the setup was exceptional my clients want weapons demonstrated under as close to lifelike conditions as possible its sort of like your own huge electric train set bellasar looked puzzled i once went to school with a kid who built electric train sets so he could put firecrackers under the bridges and in the water towers and the boxcars and blow them all up malone said id never met anybody who liked to destroy things so much lets see how much you like to destroy things what do you mean get over here and testfire this weapon you were in the marines give me your expert opinion on what acaliber gun feels like with a faster feeding mechanism im afraid my opinion wouldnt be worth much its been ten years since i handled a weapon a weapons like a bicycle the statement was a command you never forget derek potter cautioned stay out of this bellasar kept his gaze rigidly on malone fine malone held up his hands in mock surrender im not sure what point you want to make but ill go along as malone approached the machine gun potter put his earplugs back in then reached his right hand beneath the bib of his coveralls to draw a handgun if the situation got out of control malone assumed guards unslung their rifles youll want these bellasar said throwing him a set of earplugs then putting in his own malone pushed the earplugs into place noting how wary potter looked he made an exaggerated show of keeping the machine gun aimed toward the devastated village he looked at bellasar anything special you want me to blow apart the truck on the right because of malones earplugs bellasars voice was muffled when malone aimed and squeezed the trigger the sudden roaring assault made malone feel as if he were trying to control a powerful living thing he had expected an upward kick he had braced his arms to compensate but the force of what he held was far beyond his expectation the recoil from an unimaginable rate of fire thrust the barrel violently into the air as malone shoved it back down he aimed at the truck on the right and if he hadnt been concentrating so hard to control the weapon he would have gaped at the damage it did its massive spray of bullets disintegrating the back of the truck reaching the front and blasting the entire vehicle into pieces when malone released the trigger his hands and arms vibrated anyone unfamiliar with acaliber weapon would have dislocated both shoulders he was certain have you got extrapowerful loads in these rounds bellasar shrugged whats your opinion of the modifications if you dont find a way to stabilize the recoil nobodys going to be able to handle this thing i dont know what recoil youre talking about bellasar stepped to the weapon aimed and pressed the trigger malone wasnt prepared as the machine gun roared making a rhythm like a locomotive at full speed bellasar controlled it with seeming effortlessness his arms dominating the weapons powerful inclination to jerk upward empty shell casings flew through the air with a velocity that made them look blurred bellasars broad shoulders muscular chest and ramrodstraight posture had made malone suspect that the man exercised frequently probably with weights and was in exceptional condition especially for a man in his early sixties but what malone saw now was a bravado demonstration of strength far beyond anything he would have believed the ease with which bellasar handled the bucking recoil was awesome he blew the second truck apart switched his aim to the jeeps in the village blew them apart and the soldiers and the civilians and finally swung the barrel toward the personnel carrier inflicting what malone would have considered impossible damage to the armored vehicle its treads bursting loose a hatch blowing open smoke and flames spewing out jesus this ammunition has armorpiercing heads and explosive charges malone thought as bellasar released the trigger and swung the machine gun in malones direction malones heartbeat lurched apparently his wasnt the only one seeing the barrel being swung past him potter stumbled to keep out of its way in the background the guards rushed toward the cover of trees bellasar peered along the barrel toward malones chest despite the effort it must have taken to control the weapon during the damage he had inflicted on the village bellasar looked as if he had expended no more energy than steering a car ill show you what it feels like on the opposite end of the recoil bellasar said how would you like a couple of hundred rounds through your chest i think im missing something here no i dont believe you are i think you know exactly whats going on christ does he know im working with jeb malone wondered bluff he warned himself he couldnt assume anything he didnt dare risk showing even the slightest sign of having been caught at anything just so theres no confusion why dont you be explicit do you think im a fool never did you think i wouldnt know the effect it would have on you to be with my wife all day every day did you think i wouldnt expect you to be attracted to her when she took her clothes off i knew you wouldnt be able to keep from imagining what it would be like to make love to her malones heart pounded less violently so this wasnt about jeb youve got the wrong idea about shut up i want you to understand something very clearly i cant control what you feel when youre with my wife but if you ever act on those feelings if you ever touch her in a way thats more than what i saw a while ago if you ever react to her more than an artist merely giving comfort to his model ill drag you back here and my wife belongs to me i dont like people touching what i own is that clear very youre certain you understand absolutely bellasar swung the barrel back toward the village and squeezed the trigger atomizing the walls of several buildings until the last round fed through the firing mechanism and the gun became lifeless he glared toward the ruins a tremble working through him but not from the effect of the massive recoil when he finally spoke his voice was tight now get the hell back to work im sorry malone looked up from a sketch he was doing from memory sienna stood at the entrance to the sunroom he wouldnt have thought it possible for someone whose face had been so ravaged by tears to repair the damage in such a short time she wore a loose pullover and a similar anklelength skirt both of them a blue that reminded him of the jade of the caribbean that he had loved to look at from the beach of his home on cozumel had loved he emphasized to himself even though bellasar had promised to return the property to its original condition malone would never go near it again what are you sorry about he asked making a scene you didnt make a scene your husband did no i apologize for being unprofessional we both had jobs to do i didnt approach mine very well its not a big deal we had some issues to work out and now that theyve been settled sienna gripped the bottom of her pullover and started to raise it over her head stop i dont want to make derek any angrier than he is youve never seen him when hes truly upset we have to do this second portrait the sooner the better sit down is that how you want to pose me its where i want you to relax a minute while i talk to you no please we have to work if derek thinks were wasting time hell malones muscles tightened im the one doing the portrait let me worry about your husband i want you to sit down please sienna peered nervously toward the door hesitant she did what she was asked malone brought over a second chair straddling it resting his arms on its back he hoped that his casual movements would put her at ease he spoke softly when your husband came in this morning he said you looked the way you did when he first saw you in milan he said you werent photographable then sienna peered down at her hands what was he talking about malone asked something in her eyes went somewhere else she was silent for so long that malone didnt think she was going to answer that was a bad time for me she said when was this five years ago malone waited i malone gave her an encouraging look you have to understand she took a deep breath models are the most insecure women youll ever meet malone didnt respond afraid that if he said anything he might make her too selfconscious to keep talking we keep trying to assure ourselves that were more than just a beautiful package we worry about aging were always afraid that our best days are behind us malone forced himself to remain silent oh there are exceptions but i wasnt one of them imagine what its like to have to stay so thin that if you eat even a small amount the camera shows the bulge in your stomach to go as long as you can without eating or to eat and then make yourself throw up along the way you try a little cocaine it doesnt put on any weight and for a while it makes you feel better about yourself so you try a little more and meanwhile with so many people trying to manipulate you you hope for a man stronger than the others to help you get your life together but when you think youve found him he turns out to be a son of a bitch who wants to control everything you do and sienna had spoken faster and faster and now all of a sudden she seemed to realize that malone was before her he took the risk of saying something tell me what your husband meant about your face not being photographable back then id been eating so little i finally got too thin even for the camera worse the cocaine had put a permanent glaze in my eyes worse than that the man i was living with had split my lip and given me two black eyes malone felt sick her hands fidgeted this happened in milan i was there for the fall shows but after i got beaten up i obviously couldnt work i stayed in my hotel room while the guy i was with went out to screw everything in sight and the next thing i knew there was a knock at the door when i opened it derek was standing there ill never forget it he was wearing a tuxedo and holding red roses in my blur from the cocaine i frowned at that handsome tan face and i swear for a moment i thought he was rossano brazzi that italian actor i have no idea how he knew where i was or what had been done to me he put a hand under my chin and said ive come to take care of you dont bother packing just get your coat and come with me i blinked i nodded i didnt even bother with the coat i just shut the door behind me and went down to his limousine but you told me you had a loving family why would you have been insecure i didnt say i had a loving family only loving parents i dont understand sienna swallowed after my parents died when i was twelve i was sent to live with my uncle he couldnt keep his hands off me whenever his wife wasnt around hed try to malone tasted bile a couple of times he forced me to jesus he warned me that if i told anybody hed throw me out id be sleeping in the gutter he said i couldnt concentrate i did poorly in school i cried myself to sleep finally i retreated into a fantasy world all i did was read fashion magazines and fantasize about being a model and having a glamorous life this went on until my sixteenth birthday when he snuck into my room again i screamed that i wasnt going to do it anymore i woke up his wife and kids my aunt wouldnt believe what i said had been happening he beat me blackandblue for telling what he claimed were lies about him i hurt so much i had to stay in bed for two days the third day while they were at work i stole money from under the flour jar where i knew my aunt hid it from him i hoped shed think hed found it and taken it to buy booze i packed a bag and took a bus to chicago where i lived in a boardinghouse and worked at every rotten job you can imagine but i never stopped dreaming about becoming one of those women in the fashion magazines i found a company that gave modeling classes at night i worked as hard as anybody can imagine to make good on my dream and by god from modeling for underwear ads in the newspaper to doing swimsuit ads in catalogs to appearing in vogue to doing covers for it and cosmopolitan and every other major fashion magazine you can think of i finally got what i wanted the only trouble was it wasnt what id dreamed of it wasnt glamorous it was a meat market what happened when you went away with bellasar in the limousine as we drove to the airport he looked at the bruises on my face he told me he couldnt let beauty be destroyed he said he was going to make sure no one ever harmed my face again and that i never harmed myself either he brought me here he had a plastic surgeon waiting to make sure the injuries to my face wouldnt leave scars he had a medical team detoxify me he had a psychologist who specialized in eating disorders cure me of thinking food was my enemy it took six months before the results met with dereks approval he was so proud hed created me he said hed walk around me study me from all angles beam and say that my beauty wouldnt have existed without him she shrugged wearily he was right at the downward rate i was going id have been dead in the time he took to resurrect me so he gave you what you needed finally you had someone to take care of you until three months ago malone frowned what happened then he came back from a business trip and all of a sudden hed changed he complained about the start of wrinkles at the corners of my eyes he claimed he saw a strand of gray in my hair he warned me to stop being expressive with my face the movement was starting to cause furrows in my brow he said i kept asking myself what had happened on that business trip to make him change had he fallen in love with another woman when i raised the issue with him it made him furious he told me i was imagining things that i had to get control of myself i had my hair dyed had facial scrubs did whatever i thought would please him but he only became more impatient with me nothing i did was good enough i began to look forward to his trips away they gave me a measure of peace but each time he came back he was even more critical malone opened his mouth to reassure her and abruptly stopped as something behind him made sienna stiffen she jerked to her feet honestly derek were just talking about how to pose me were just about to start working i swear it bellasar stood in the doorway were flying to istanbul be ready at five he narrowed his gaze toward malone you have two weeks to finish your work that might not be enough time make it enough when i agreed to do the portraits i told you i had to do them on my terms you accepted those conditions the conditions have changed how am i supposed to work without a model how long will sienna be away as long as necessary well the longer shes gone the longer itll take me to finish bellasars eyes darkened im beginning to agree with alex it was a mistake to get involved with you five oclock he turned angrily and left the room watching him cross the terrace sienna shivered what time is it a little after three god that doesnt give me enough time as she stood malone asked whats in istanbul whats so important her voice was tight whenever this happens its business several of dereks clients enjoy spending time with me derek has an easier time negotiating with them because im around malone nodded sure bellasar would be a bigger man in their eyes because he was married to a woman so beautiful i cant talk any longer as she hurried away malone continued his thought yes so much beauty might dazzle a client might subtly affect his judgment but what about when that beauty developed flaws bad for business bad for the rigid standards of a husband who couldnt settle for less than perfection bad all the way around when someone stopped fulfilling a necessary function a replacement had to be found the sun was low enough to throw the terrace into shadow but not enough that it didnt cause a reflection off the spinning blades of a helicopter malone watched as sienna bellasar potter and three bodyguards got into it she wore an elegant suit her hair impeccably arranged even from a distance her beauty was overwhelming but also from that distance malone was able to tell how reluctantly she got into the chopper in fact she had the manner of a welldressed prisoner being taken to a trial or to a funeral the metaphor made him uneasy as the helicopter roared away he felt a stab of separation five accustomed to cocktails with sienna each evening at seven malone was more uneasy as that hour approached i would have started down to the library by now he thought instead he roamed those sections of the grounds permitted to him a frustrated animal trying to relieve tension when sunset finally tinted the shrubs statues and ponds of the estate he decided that he ought to try to eat something but sitting alone at the long candlelit table he only poked at the veal cutlets that had been prepared for him he couldnt stop wondering where sienna was and what she was doing if she was still alive he had a sudden harrowing image of bellasar hurling her from the chopper of her body crashing onto rocks or of potter blowing her brains out and dumping her into the sea no he kept telling himself bellasars manner suggested that he needs her for now at least the crisis wont come until after istanbul he slept fitfully in the morning trying to subdue his mind he extended his calisthenics from one to two hours but his fear for sienna intensified he went to the sunroom and spread out his sketches gazing at her features drawing her from memory he imagined that she was seated before him talking to him he went to the library smelling the must of its ancient volumes he crossed the carpet to the far wall and climbed a ladder to the middle shelves it was toward them that bellasar had gestured the evening the portrait had been unveiled the evening bellasar had compared sienna to dantes beatrice the inspiration for the divine comedy if youre curious about dante and beatrice rossetti translated dantes autobiography bellasar had said youll find an edition of dante and his circle over there bellasar had said something else that beatrice had died young and that dante had obsessed about her ever after malone couldnt avoid the insistent comparison is sienna going to die young ive got to stop thinking about death because the books were arranged alphabetically by author he had no trouble finding the volume he wanted in the process he thought it curious that rossettis first name was dante the same as the poet whose autobiography he had translated he sat in a leather chair opened the book and came to the first time dante had seen beatrice her dress on that day was of a most noble colour a subdued and goodly crimson at that moment i say most truly that the spirit of life which hath its dwelling in the secretest chamber of the heart began to tremble so violently that the least pulses of my body shook yes malone thought two nights later sienna still hadnt returned malone lay tensely on his bed listening to the sounds of guards patrolling in the darkness beyond his window the intervening slow passage of time had been agonizing but it had given him a chance to plan rosettis translation of dante lay open before him the same wonderful lady appeared to me dressed all in pure white because it was the first time that any words from her reached mine ears i came into such sweetness that i parted thence as one intoxicated sweat beaded his brow he went into the bathroom rinsed his face with cold water then shut off the lights in his room and went over to the window across from his bed watching the shadows and floodlights on the gardens and paths a glance at his watch showed that the time was almost midnight in a few moments a guard would appear on the right and walk along a whitepebbled path in the middle his boots making crunching sounds malone shifted next to the window where not even his shadow would be seen he waited there the sound of boot steps preceding him the guard came into view malone nodded ten minutes later another guard would appear this one on the left five minutes after that a third guard would become visible from beyond the changing rooms at the swimming pool heading toward the chopper pads the schedule hadnt varied in the weeks since malone had noted it he picked up the book and left his room the dimly lit corridor was deserted his footsteps made no sound on the runner that covered the floor he reached the top of the curving staircase started down and heard boot steps on the marble floor below as a guard emerged from a room on the right watching him descend couldnt sleep malone showed the guard the book i came to get another the guard looked puzzled by the notion of finishing one book and wanting to read more malone didnt linger to talk about it he went along the corridor on the left and opened the library door in the darkness that faced him the room had a smothering staleness that reminded him of the funeral parlor in which his grandfathers body had lain the only thing missing was the cloying scent of too many flowers stop thinking that way malone warned himself he flicked a switch on his left blinked from the glare of the overhead light and closed the door behind him the books were arranged not only by author but in categories fiction nonfiction and reference the latter on the right as malone headed in that direction he heard the door open behind him turning he saw the guard with a nod malone resumed his search the encyclopedia was easily located britannica he didnt know anything about rare books but he did know about bellasars tastes and he would have bet anything that this particular edition the copyright page on the volume he selected showed was the classic version preferred by collectors the guard kept watching malone nodded to him again but this time with a slight impatience as if saying fine youve made your point youve been a good watchdog now get on with your rounds and let me read in peace the guards puzzled gaze wavered after he stepped back into the corridor his steps receding along the marble floor malone went over and shut the door being sure that the latch made a noise to let the guard know he didnt want to be disturbed again he carried the volume he had chosen for subjects that began with r to an easy chair and as he turned the heavy books brittle pages smelling its must he tried to stifle his apprehension everythings going to be okay he assured himself just keep following the plan he found the article he wanted rossetti dante gabriel english painter and poet a founder of the preraphaelite movement born in died in stop thinking about death he told himself rossettis original first names had been gabriel charles dante but his obsession with the italian poet from the middle ages had prompted him to insist on being called dante the obsession had taken another form when he identified his beautiful wife elizabeth with dantes beatrice and dedicated himself to a passionate translation of dantes devotion to that woman in effect describing the love he himself felt for elizabeth after elizabeths death early in their marriage rossetti had buried the manuscripts of all his poems with her and had painted a symbolic portrait of his idealized love for her calling it beata beatrix blessed beatrice again the subject was death struggling to distract himself malone found significance in the parallel he shared with rossetti they were both painters and their lives had been changed because of a woman each had fallen in love with while doing a portrait of her love for the first time malone realized that he had consciously used the word in connection with what he was feeling a half hour later when the guard again looked in malone pretended to be asleep in the chair his eyes closed his head drooping the encyclopedia open on his lap this time the guard shut the door when he went away immediately malone stood turned off the lights and went over to a casement window seeing no one outside he opened the window eased down to the murky ground shut the window behind him and sank behind a shrub if the guard returned to the library he would decide that malone had wakened and gone back to his room staying low malone assessed the spotlights in the darkness after assuring himself that no one was in this area he crossed a path reached shrubs and crept behind them in the direction of the cloister its bell tower silhouetted against the starry sky moving cautiously working to blend with shadows he took a half hour to cover a distance that would normally have been a fiveminute stroll his palms sweated having been away from the military for a decade he had to work to shut down his emotions his heart pounded his lungs couldnt seem to get enough air leaving the cover of a fountain and reaching a clump of sculpted evergreen shrubs he sank to the ground and stared at the arched windows of the cloister although most were in darkness it puzzled him that all of the basement windows were brightly lit as he debated whether to risk crawling closer he was startled by an outside door that opened revealing a mans shadow against an interior light a guard with a rifle stepped out closed the door stared up at the starry sky and lit a cigarette malone silently gave thanks that he had hesitated to crawl toward the basement windows no problem ill just wait until he goes back inside or moves on but with bellasar and potter away the guard wasnt in a hurry indeed after finally finishing the cigarette then stubbing it out with his boot the guard continued to remain where he was only when the door opened and another man came out this one wearing a kneelength white coat did the guard assume a professional stance as if hed been standing at attention watching the door the second man tall with dark hair blocky features and a husky build wasnt anyone malone had seen before with help from the hallway light spilling from the open door malone studied him trying to memorize his broad lips thick eyebrows and square face there was little time the whitecoated man pointed toward the crushed cigarette at the guards feet and said something curt with the immediate result that the guard came to greater attention a further disapproving remark caused the guard to follow the man back into the building the door banged shut blocking the interior light but there was still ample illumination from the security lights in the area and malone took a long careful time to watch for other guards before he reconsidered approaching the basement windows why had the man been wearing a kneelength white coat he wondered it looked like the kind of coat a doctor would wear in a hospital or a technician in a laboratory what was behind those basement windows ignoring a metal band that seemed to tighten around his chest he stayed low and darted toward shrubs at the side of the cloister no sooner had he disappeared behind one than boot steps rounded a corner passing close enough to malone for him to hear a scrape of metal against metal perhaps from a rifle against an equipment belt other sounds attracted malones attention muffled voices the rasp of what sounded like wood against stone wary he peered through a window staying to the side so he wouldnt be seen not that it did him any good the illumination through the glass was filtered by a blind the voices seemed to come from farther along however and when he crawled to the next window reaching the cover of another shrub he discovered that instead of a blind this window had an inside shutter the slats of which had not been completely closed he was able to see part of a room segments of a stone floor tables cabinets laboratory instruments computers and various electronic devices two large appliances against the far wall looked like an industrialgrade freezer and refrigerator the voices became more distinct as the guard and the whitecoated man stepped into view the man spoke what sounded like russian which the guard didnt seem to understand and malone certainly didnt but the gist was clear the man wanted the guard to open a wooden crate nails screeched as a crowbar pried them free when the guard rammed so hard that a board shattered malone heard another voice cry out in protest a third man stepped into view he too wore a kneelength white coat he gestured in alarm speaking in agitated russian the frantic point of which was obvious be careful malone had seen those gestures before in fact he had seen this man before the same balding stoopshouldered man he had watched get out of the helicopter the first morning he had been on the estate the man had been dismayed by the rough way bellasars men had handled the crates he had brought just as he was dismayed now finally getting a closer look at him malone focused all his concentration straining to fix the mans features in his memory the deep eyes the high forehead the oval face the a distant rumble made malone flinch as it rapidly swelled to a whumping roar an icy hand seemed to squeeze his heart a helicopter jesus is bellasar returning is sienna with him the roar became loud enough that the men in the basement heard it and turned toward the window malone jerked to the side nothing in the way they spoke made him suspect that they had noticed him but in the heightened security that would result from bellasars return a guard was bound to see him thered be so much activity at the château malone wouldnt be able to sneak back inside his only chance was to take advantage of the brief distraction the choppers arrival would create blinding lights came on between the château and the cloister illuminating the helicopter pad almost at once another glaring light illuminated the area but this one blazed from the sky from the nose of the swiftly approaching helicopter the guards will be looking from one light to the other malone thought urgently but the moment the chopper sets down everythingll be back to business as usual this is my only chance move but even as he braced himself to run from the shrubs at the side of the cloister toward the greater number of shrubs across from him a guard charged past malone barely checked his impulse in time he looked to make sure that another guard wasnt hurrying after the first one yes theyre temporarily distracted he fought to assure himself i can do this the moment the chopper roared overhead its spotlight flashing past malone sprinted from the side of the building he reached the opposite shrubs at the same time he heard russian voices as the door to the cloister banged open behind him it sounded as if they were headed toward the landing pad but he didnt look behind him he didnt stop it had taken him thirty minutes to get here creeping from statue to fountain to hedge to whatever other murky cover hed been able to find but now he had to cover the same distance quicker than it would take to walk it staying low moving with furtive speed trying to blend with shadows he heard the chopper set down to his right its rotors slowing any moment now bellasar or whoever was in the chopper please god let sienna be all right would get out and proceed toward the château bellasar would ask the guards about malones activities while he had been gone the guard whod seen malone go into the library would report that the last time hed checked malone was still in the library asleep in a chair bellasar would want to see for himself and if im not in that chair when bellasar looks in malone thought he might get suspicious enough to check if im in my room as a guard loomed into view malone dropped to a crouch beside another statue and froze praying that the guard wouldnt look in his direction on the right through a gap in some bushes malone saw the starkly illuminated landing pad angrily bellasar got out of the helicopter before the whitecoated men could reach him he turned away followed by his bodyguards he took long strides toward the château but there wasnt any sign of potter far more important where was sienna my god has something happened to her the next instant someone shifted within the helicopter a figure came slowly into view but malones relief when the figure turned out to be sienna was immediately replaced by worry when he saw how hesitantly she got down from the helicopter even at a distance she looked dazed move malone warned himself theres nothing you can do for her now and if you dont get back to the library before bellasar looks in on you you wont be able to help her anytime hell you wont even be able to help yourself as the guard that blocked his way moved on malone looked once more at sienna noted how unsteadily she walked across the landing pad and urged himself past the statue then toward the château lights came on in several upper windows presumably bellasars suite maybe bellasar intends to go directly to bed malone thought hopefully maybe he wont check on me until the morning malones chest heaved as he reached the final protective section of shrubs he peered urgently around to make certain there werent any guards in the immediate area that no one would see him dart across the whitepebbled walkway open the library window and crawl back inside as assured as he could be under the circumstances knowing that he had to commit to taking the risk he braced himself for a final effort and felt a cold paralysis seize his muscles as the library windows suddenly blazed with light you told me he was in here bellasar shouted squinting from the bright overhead light he was the guard insisted i saw him asleep in that chair an hour ago then where the hell is he now he must have wakened and gone to his room suddenly he has an interest in old books suddenly hes hanging around the library at midnight you never saw him go back to his room the guard spread his hands guiltily no bellasar stormed toward the casement windows scowled at each of them and noted that one was open a crack enough space for fingers to pry in and open it farther if someone had gone out that way closed it and wanted to reopen it easily damn it find him go to his room i want to know where he is as the guard hurried into the hallway bellasar went after him in the vestibule he yelled for the three bodyguards whod been with him to follow taking the curving staircase three steps at a time he rushed up passing the guard he had sent ahead of him at the top he slowed just enough for the group to catch up to him then charged along the corridor reached the door to malones room thrust it open turned on the light and blinked at the empty bed the covers of which werent turned back search the grounds search everywhere the guards scrambled to obey following bellasar encountered sienna as she wearily reached the top of the staircase hes missing bellasar said if i find him where he shouldnt be you wont need to worry about posing for the second portrait hell be dead brushing past her bellasar charged down the stairs check every room he ordered a group of guards who had heard the commotion and run into the vestibule seeing the russians and another group of guards at the open doorway he told them search the cloister give me your pistol he ordered a guard who raced past he worked the mm sigsauers injection slide to make sure a round was in the firing chamber paused long enough to be satisfied that his commands were being obeyed then rushed outside to join the search flashlights zigzagged as guards searched under bushes and among trees to bellasars left glass crashed voices shouted one louder than the rest was terribly clear weve found him here over here pretending to have been shocked awake malone jerked up from the settee on which he lay in the darkness men barged into the sunroom with such force that the glass door slammed against the huge window next to it shattering both panes shards of glass hit the stone floor exploding into smaller pieces crushed by the boots of the men who charged in aimed pistols and flashlights and yanked him to his feet what the malone tried to sound disoriented a man rushed outside weve found him here over here what the hells going on malone murmured why are you the lights still hadnt been turned on the flashlights were aimed at his eyes one of the beams so blindingly close that he raised his left arm to brush it away only to have his arm thrust down and the flashlight whacked across the side of his face the impact sent a burst of colors through his mind for a moment those colors swirled his legs bent he started to fall but the men jerked him to his feet and the flashlight was cocked back to strike him once again when several more people rushed into the room bellasar demanded where is he show me the son of a bitch the overhead lights came on the blow to malones face had blurred his vision but now he managed to focus it seeing bellasar stalk through the guards bellasars normally handsome features were twisted with rage the first time we met you were tied to a chair youd pissed your pants bellasars chest heaved driven by the force of his emotions as he put on leather gloves i dont understand malone said why shut your mouth bellasar punched it malones head jerked back for a moment he saw more colors flash his ears rang as his disorientation cleared he became aware of blood trickling down his chin from his split lips joined by blood from a throbbing gash on his left cheekbone where the flashlight had struck him that first time i saw you as i looked at the piss beneath your chair i said you were a fool for refusing to cooperate with me bellasars voice trembled but i also said that i was reasonable that i was willing to give you a second chance i warned you though he punched malone again mangling his lips further i never give third chances the men holding malone were jolted back by the strength of the blow malone needed a few seconds longer before his mind stopped spinning i dont give third chances either youve hit me twice try doing it again what without your guards hanging on to me this close to dying you have the nerve to talk to me like that why in christs name are you threatening me you actually think you can bluff your way out of this out of what you deny sneaking out of the library window sneaking out of the library window do you have any idea how crazy that sounds you deny you were in there of course i was in there you made such a big deal about dante and beatrice i read the book you suggested you want a question and answer session you want me to tell you what beatrice was wearing when dante first saw her a red dress do you want to know the color of her dress the next time he saw her white the time after that he saw her in church the time after that she was at a why was the library window open a crack beats the shit out of me i didnt know it was the guard didnt see you leave the library that makes us even because when i left i didnt see him either malone wiped blood from his face reading about beatrice got me thinking about sketching sienna without her being in front of me so i came over here and tried something new but i was sleepier than i thought and i took a nap on that settee the next thing i knew your storm troopers were barging in prove it wheres the new sketch on the floor next to the settee one of your guards is standing on it im afraid it got a little smeared from my blood spattering over it the guard who was standing on the sketch stepped away frowning at the blood and boot marks on it bellasar picked up the wrinkled page ive seen all the sketches you did of her if this is the same as his voice faltered when he looked at it malone had sketched it two days previously when his obsession with sienna had compelled him to depict an idealized version of her beauty bellasars mouth opened as if he wanted to say something when he finally managed to get the words out his voice was a whisper its stunning yeah with the boot marks and the blood i cant wait to see it framed bellasar gazed at it awestruck breathtaking at last he lowered it apparently i was mistaken that makes my face feel a whole lot better ill send for a doctor while youre being so kindhearted how about telling your goons to take their hands off me bellasar gave him a warning look when he nodded to his men it was as if he had pressed a switch they instantly let malone go malone wiped more blood from his mouth glancing past bellasar he saw sienna in the doorway she seemed even more dazed bellasar noticed her theres nothing to worry about my dear youll be able to pose tomorrow sienna didnt respond the dark of her eyes was huge her expression listless malone wondered if shed been drugged outside on the harshly lit terrace the two russians waited as bellasar went to speak to them malone made another attempt to memorize their faces then knowing he couldnt keep staring at them he did what he wanted to do more than anything to look at sienna to try to get a sense of what had happened in istanbul of what she was thinking and feeling something sank within him when she turned away he couldnt tell if it was from fear or because she was horrified by the injuries to his face but in that case if she had any regard for him wouldnt she have given him a look of sympathy not if she was afraid of bellasars reaction when bellasar came back from speaking to the russians he sienna and malone went through the terrace doors into the château they were followed by three bodyguards as the group climbed the curving staircase bellasar said from now on if you intend to work at night ask a guard to escort you you make it sound like im a prisoner with no reply bellasar led sienna up to the final level two of the bodyguards went with them a third stayed with malone bellasars voice echoed faintly from above no my dear im not finished talking with you malones stomach squirmed but with the guard watching him he forced himself to look as if he didnt care about what hed heard then a heavyset man holding a medical bag came up the stairs and malone had something to distract him the doctor made the repairs in malones room washing off the blood then applying sharpsmelling disinfectant to the gashes the one caused by the flashlight blow to malones cheek required five stitches the mangled lips the doctor concluded would mend on their own keep the stitches dry the doctors english was heavily accented take two of these pills every six hours theyll relieve the pain ill come back to examine you tomorrow a guard was in the hallway when the doctor left malone closed and locked the door yanked off his bloody clothes and threw them into a hamper mindful of what the doctor had said about keeping the stitches dry he leaned his head back from the shower spray when he turned on the faucets the steaming water rinsed the blood from his chest arms and hands but no matter how hard he scoured his body he couldnt feel clean the bastard he kept saying to himself his anger was balanced by apprehension the situation was out of control toweling himself roughly he risked a glance at the bathroom mirror and was startled by how ravaged his mouth and cheek were initially trauma had numbed the injuries but now pain overtook them even so he couldnt risk swallowing the pills the doctor had given him he had no idea what they were or how strong bellasar might have told the doctor to drug him ive got to think clearly after putting on boxer shorts and a tshirt malone picked up a small sketch pad he always kept on his bedside table he sat against the headboard closed his eyes to focus his memory then opened them and started drawing the face of the russian he had seen the morning hed arrived and again tonight oval face deep eyes high forehead concentrating to remember whether the mans jaw was pronounced or shallow whether his eyebrows were arched or straight malone drew hurriedly as the likeness took shape he refined it recalling more details making it more vivid finally satisfied after twenty minutes and three attempts he set the drawing aside and began to sketch the other russian the tall stocky man with thick eyebrows and blocky features this one took longer it wasnt until a half hour later that malone was satisfied immediately he turned it and the first sketch upside down so he wouldnt be tempted to look at them beginning the process anew searching his memory using shortcuts that the process of doing the first sketch had taught him he was able to produce another likeness of the first russian much quicker in less than ten minutes he did the same with a new sketch of the second russian he compared these sketches with the previous ones and assured himself that they were more or less identical that his memory wasnt straying he went through the process again and again each version took less time and each was the same as the others when he was confident that his memory had been so reinforced that hed be able to produce a sketch of either man at will he folded each eightbyteninch piece of paper into oneinch strips so the sheets resembled accordions he opened each accordion enough so it could stand upright in the bathroom sink he struck a match and lit the top of each accordion watching the flame burn down to the bottom the accordion shape caused the page to burn evenly and completely equally important it resulted in almost no smoke the trick was something he had learned in an otherwiselongforgotten high school physics class who says educations wasted on the young he thought as he washed the ashes down the sink he would have torn the pages into small pieces and flushed them down the toilet but he couldnt be sure that some of the pieces wouldnt drift back up later as toilet paper sometimes did and be discovered when the maid came in to clean the room she might have instructions to tell bellasar about anything unusual that she found and if bellasar ever learned that malone had sketched the russians that would be all the evidence bellasar would need his lips and cheekbone throbbed as he opened the window to make sure every slight trace of smoke dispersed satisfying himself that everything was in order he shut off the light and crawled into bed the time was almost am but he didnt sleep six good morning good morning i missed you at breakfast malone said at the entrance to the sunroom sienna looked down at her feet i wasnt hungry although her movements werent as listless as the night before she still didnt seem alert her face was puffy her skin was pale her eyes had slight hollows beneath them perhaps because she knew she didnt appear at her best she kept her gaze slightly away from him or perhaps she wanted to avoid seeing what had been done to him how bad does it hurt she still didnt look at his face id give you a stiffupperlip attitude but my upper lip is too mashed it was a weak attempt at humor but at the moment weary from a sleepless night and afraid of how she was going to react to what he planned to tell her he couldnt think of anything else worse how was he going to appeal to her if she wouldnt even look at him the gash on his cheek had swollen his mouth was scabbed it was a wonder she didnt run from him in horror and you he asked softly how are you ive been better how was istanbul humid crowded what i meant was i know what you meant i think we should talk about something else she wore sandals and a loose anklelength skirt of beige linen the pullover top was ecru her hands fidgeted with its hem then suddenly let go as footsteps outside made her spin she didnt relax when she saw that it was only a servant going past we have to get started something in her eyes reminded him of an animal that had been disciplined so much its spirit was broken derek changed his mind she said he wants me to pose only partially nude bellasars sudden change in plans puzzled malone but he was too preoccupied to consider the implications it was as if he and sienna hadnt spent weeks together as if there were a million miles between them where do you want me she asked this wasnt how he had imagined their reunion he had assumed that she would be communicative that she would leave him an opening instead he had the nervous feeling that they were opposed over there against the wall with the sunlight on you she did what she was told but something about the way she moved made him straighten wait a second are you limping what she sounded as if shed been caught doing something wrong youre limping no sure you are you look like youre in pain its nothing my legs got cramped from sitting too long on the plane yesterday i dont believe you come back this way walk toward me im telling you its just a walk toward me she didnt move malone approached her studying her whats happened she looked away what did he do nothing i dont understand what youre talking about malone felt a terrible urgency he had always been careful about what he said in the sunroom assuming that bellasar had microphones hidden there a couple of times he had pushed the boundary hence bellasars sudden appearances to assert his authority but now as events spiraled out of control malone knew that no matter how guarded sienna was being with him he had to take the risk okay he said she looked puzzled as if she had braced herself to keep resisting and hadnt expected him to back off if youre not hurt we can get to work your husband wont like it if we waste time in fact ive already decided on the pose i want we can skip doing further sketches im going to start painting right away as he spoke he took her arm and guided her toward the back of the sunroom what are you but he cut her off i need to get some supplies from the storage room wait out here ill just be a minute in contradiction to what he said however he took sienna with him through a door in back into the storage room it was small damp and faintly lit crammed with painting supplies there werent any windows what are you doing keep your voice down malone shut the door then guided her past easels and boxes toward a sink he couldnt be sure that the storage room wasnt bugged given how cramped it was bellasar would probably have dismissed it as a place where conversations would be held but just to make sure malone turned on the faucets hoping that the sound of running water would obscure their voices im afraid there are microphones where we work microphones as the idea struck her sienna gripped the sink tell me what he did to you no we have to get out of here if derek i can help you no one can help me please let me try they stood frozen staring at each other slowly she raised a finger toward his ravaged face she almost touched his mangled lips she traced an imaginary line around the stitches on his swollen cheek im so sorry she whispered last night when i saw what hed done to you i wanted to cry but what did he do to you her eyes misted she shook her head from side to side youve seen what derek can be like dont get involved in this i have to after the most poignant look anyone had ever given him sienna bent slowly her hands trembled as she raised her skirt first past her ankles then past her shins malone gaped at the bruises above her knees her thighs were a purple mass of them they looked like beefsteak jesus he murmured in pain she lowered the hem of her skirt back down to her ankles straightening pulling the waistband slightly away from her body she showed him where the angrylooking bruises continued to the top of her hips what the hell did he the man derek was meeting barely noticed me sienna shuddered in fact he couldnt wait for me to leave it was the first time that had ever happened when derek came back to our suite at three in the morning he was furious it was my fault he said that the negotiation had almost fallen through he told me i was useless to him that he could barely stand to look at me that malone touched her arm easy you dont have to put yourself through it again for the first time since ive known him he made a fist to hit me it was like i was back in milan five years ago with the boyfriend who beat me up she flinched as if seeing the fist again then he looked shocked realizing what he was doing the one thing i thought i could always count on was that hed never hurt me all of a sudden he started kicking me the way hed kick a football the tips of his shoes coming at me he chose a spot where the bruises wouldnt show above the hem of my dress i tried to defend myself to get behind a table but he kept coming at me kicking and the next thing i knew i was on the floor he wouldnt stop if it hadnt been for alex coming in im afraid he might have where is alex why didnt he return with you and derek he stayed in istanbul something to do with the negotiations some trick derek has him up to as a way of putting pressure on the man hes dealing with hes coming back this afternoon this afternoon sienna frowned you make it sound important why i have to explain something no if derek doesnt see some progress i realize i look like hell but this isnt a photograph its a portrait you can fake it you can make me look as beautiful as listen to me please i dont want to be kicked again i dont want dont worry malones voice hardened if i have anything to do about it your husbands never going to kick you again no one is what do you mean if i can get you out of here will you go with me will you take the chance to escape and there it was the words so long restrained were finally free he couldnt turn back he held his breath fearing her reaction if hed misjudged her if she was uncontrollably dominated by bellasar to the point where she could never imagine going against him he had just guaranteed that hed soon be dead she would look at him in dismay she would accuse him of having misjudged her she would tell bellasar escape sienna made the word sound like nonsense have you lost your mind jesus i made the wrong choice malone thought i just threw my life away it isnt possible to escape she said what malone shook his head in confusion if she was going to turn against him this wasnt what he had expected dont you think ive considered it dont you think i would have done it if i could have found a way youll come with me how where even if we could get out of here derek would never rest until he found us hed use all his power and money every resource at his disposal to track us down but we wouldnt be alone malone wanted to tell her if we can get out of here well have all the help we could ever want he didnt dare say it if she thought he was a spy if she thought he had come here to use her we have to take the chance he said we cant look you dont have to do this you dont have to risk your life for me complete the portrait and leave and what about you ive been taking care of myself since i was twelve i survived what derek did to me in istanbul and ill survive worse as long as he tolerates me but ill never survive if he finds out ive betrayed him listen to me malone hesitated there wasnt an easy way to say this hes planning to have you killed what hes been married three times before what are you talking about all of his wives were beautiful but when they got to be around thirty and started to show signs of aging they died in various accidents siennas mouth opened but she seemed to have lost the power of speech before each accident your husband hired a prominent artist to do a portrait of each woman to memorialize her after death to have a trophy to make her beauty permanent now its your turn i dont how on earth do you know this some of it i heard from the other artists malone lied the rest of it we dont have time for me to explain theres a room on the third level in the middle hallway about halfway along on the left sienna concentrated trying to get over her shock yes where derek keeps his business documents youve been in the room youve seen the documents no its always locked when i first came here i asked what was in there and thats what he told me thats where the portraits of the other wives are this cant theres one way to prove it trying to hide her fear sienna reached the top floor her legs in pain she walked along the middle corridor and almost flinched when the door to dereks bedroom opened but it wasnt derek who came out only a servant after a cursory nod sienna continued toward her own room entered left a slight gap when she shut the door and listened for the servant to go away the moment the receding footsteps became so soft that they couldnt be heard she eased the door open peered out and assured herself that the corridor was deserted immediately she went back down the hall and tried the door chase had mentioned as she expected it was locked but she had needed to make the attempt on the chance that it might not have been she went one door farther along to the one from which the servant had just left slipped inside and shut the door she had been in dereks room only once before five years earlier repressing her memories of that night she saw that nothing seemed to have changed the place was still decorated with antiques from the italian renaissance including a canopied bed its four posts intricately carved the sight of the bed increased her anxiety she shifted her attention to a door on the right which led to the room she was interested in although it too was probably locked she allowed herself to hope when she tried it only to lower her head in discouragement when the door didnt budge i need a key she thought derek was scrupulously thorough anything important had to have a backup sometimes more than one didnt it make sense that hed want to have a spare key hidden within easy reach allowing herself to hope again she turned to face the room across from her a fivehundredyearold medici bureau brought back more memories of the only other time she had been in this room derek had waited to marry her until the bandages had come off her face and her beauty had been recreated as he phrased it the wedding had occurred in a rose garden on the property just the two of them a minister and potter as the witness she had been so grateful to have been rescued from her former life that she hadnt regretted not having a bigger celebration in the dining hall a string quartet had played waltzes she and derek had danced they had cut the wedding cake and given pieces of it to the staff her wedding gift had been a diamond necklace she remembered how heavy it had felt as derek had escorted her up to his room there the loneliness of her marriage had begun wanting more than anything to make love to the man she had married three hours previously she had reached for him then became dismayed when his ardor changed to hesitancy then to frustration and then to anger she had tried everything to arouse him her final attempt had made him push her to the floor derek its okay she had tried to assure him these things happen its the excitement of the wedding all we need is a little time get out of here shed been sure she hadnt heard correctly what get out theres a room at the end of the hall take it sleep there but arent we going to share damn it i told you to get out he had thrown a robe at her barely giving her a chance to put it on before he shoved her into the corridor in her room she had wept trying to understand what had happened she had hoped to sleep but her turmoil had kept her awake until finally she had walked down the hall and opened his door saying derek if theres a problem lets talk about it whatever it is we can slamming a drawer shut he had spun toward her his face twisted with more fury than she had ever seen dont ever come in this room again stunned by the emotion of his outburst she had retreated into the corridor he had slammed the door making her realize that she had exchanged one hell for another the next morning wary about what would happen next she had waited a long time before going downstairs only to be surprised by the gracious way derek greeted her as if the previous night had been a fabulous beginning to their marriage they never discussed what had come between them they never again tried to have sex and she never again went into his room it was so much wiser not to so much better when derek wasnt displeased but she never forgot the abrupt way derek had slammed the drawer as if he had been hiding something now she crossed the room toward the medici bureau she opened its hinged panels and pulled out the middle drawer it revealed cashmere sweaters nothing else i was wrong disheartened she turned to leave the room but he looked like he was hiding something she insisted to herself where maybe it isnt something in the drawer maybe she knocked on the drawers bottom it sounded hollow she ran her fingers along the inside did the same thing underneath and tensed when she felt a catch at the back when she pushed it the inside bottom of the drawer came loose hand trembling she tilted it up a shallow compartment contained passports for various countries a pistol and a single key on a gold chain reaching for the key she frowned at how the trembling in her hand increased she pressed down on the bottom shut the drawer closed the bureau and whirled toward the sound of someone approaching along the hallway as the doorknob turned she hurriedly crouched behind a large upholstered chair she held her breath if derek came in if he found her the door opened whoever it was crossed the room and entered the bathroom a moment later the person came out passed the chair and left shutting the door sienna exhaled it was probably a servant putting fresh towels or something in the bathroom she thought her crouched position aggravated the pain from her bruises straightening stiffly she listened for more movement in the hallway when she heard nothing she moved quickly toward the door tried the key and felt her breathing quicken when it worked with a harrowing sense that this was the most significant threshold she would ever cross she eased the door open stepped inside closed the door and found herself staring at what seemed like ghosts the murkiness of the room enhanced the illusion thick draperies filtered most of the outdoor light across from her the faces of several women seemed to float in dense twilight more disturbing while sienna recognized the portrait chase had done of her she had the sensation of seeing herself reflected in mirrors so closely did the other portraits resemble her but how could that be if she had never sat for them she flicked an electrical switch on her left blinked from the assault of light and stared with growing shock at the wall of portraits there were seven the one devoted to her and three sets of two each composed of a face and a fulllength nude each set had the style of a different artist but the faces were unnervingly similar sharing the same shape and proportion definitely the flowing hairstyle was the same it was one that derek had always insisted on from a distance or in shadow the other women could have been mistaken for sienna sienna could have been mistaken for the other women my god she thought shivering she approached the paintings some had been done in oil others in watercolor the signatures on them confirmed that each of the three sets had been done by a different artist their names were in the pantheon of latetwentiethcentury artists so famous that even people unfamiliar with art would recognize them the dates next to the signatures had unnerving implications the first was fifteen years previously the second seven years later the third three years after that but the faces in the portraits remained the same age thirty or so proving that unless the portraits werent true likenesses a different model had been used for each set more unnerved sienna noticed that the date on the third set was the same year derek had rescued her in milan jesus she thought he got tired of the woman before me when she started showing the slightest signs of age he got rid of her and chose someone younger who looked like her like all of them me but when derek had come to her hotel five years ago why hadnt he been turned off by her haggard look and the bruises on her face she shivered as she remembered the plastic surgeon who had been waiting at the estate he had said that he was going to hide the scars from the beating she had received after the bandages had been removed she had noticed that she looked slightly different not better or worse just different her cheekbones slightly more pronounced for example but she had attributed that to an unavoidable consequence of hiding the scars now she realized my god derek told the surgeon to make me look more like those other women in dismay she peered around the room so cold now that her teeth chattered when she saw photographs on the other walls some were in black and white others in color some were closeups others group shots some were taken in outdoor settings others in palatial interiors but they all had one common denominator the same woman was in all of them although the younger shots of her made her somewhat hard to identify there was no mistaking her features as she became a teenager and then a young adult she looks like me sienna thought like the other women in the portraits no thats wrong ive got it backward we look like her thats why derek chose us but who in gods name was she womens shoes had been arranged on shelves her shoes sienna thought mannequins supported festive dresses her dresses sienna thought she reached for a leatherbound scrapbook opened it and shuddered when she stared at a birth certificate for christina gabriela bellasar dereks sister born in rome on may one year after derek was born glancing with greater distress toward the photographs on the wall sienna confirmed another common factor in none of the photos was the woman ever seen as old pulse rushing sienna flipped to the back of the scrapbook and found the document that would logically end a scrapbook that began with a birth certificate a death certificate on the final page there was a yellowed clipping from a rome newspaper her parents had insisted that sienna learn italian she had no trouble reading the small item christina gabriela bellasar the last name suggested she had never married had died in rome on june as a consequence of a fall from a balcony on the twentieth floor of a hotel sienna subtracted from christina had been thirty as old as i am sienna thought as old as the women in the portraits seemed with soulnumbing dread she felt compelled to turn toward a corner of the room where she saw an antique table upon which sat an urn the urn seemed centuries old its faded paint showing maidens lying beside a stream in an idyllic forest sienna had no doubt whose ashes were in that urn just as she had no doubt what derek would do to her if he discovered that she had violated this shrine he wouldnt wait for the second portrait to be completed he would kill her now descending the stairs she was certain that every servant and guard she passed must be sensing the fear she struggled to conceal despite the pain in her thighs she felt a panicked need to run but no one looked at her strangely and her body obeyed her fierce will maintaining an apparently untroubled pace when she entered the sunroom she saw that chase had rejected tempera paint in favor of oil having attached a canvas to a frame he was sketching on it her angle of approach prevented her from seeing the image she didnt care all that mattered was getting him where they could talk without fear of microphones chase looked at her troubled by the stark expression on her face ive been thinking this should be set outdoors sienna said for the benefit of anyone who might be eavesdropping oh the first portrait was inside the second ought to have a different setting theres a place on the terrace i think might work why dont you show me when she took his arm leading him her trembling fingers made him frown they emerged onto the sunbright terrace sienna guiding him toward a corner of its stone railing here she said like this she pretended to show him a pose at the same time lowering her voice do you think we can be overheard a machine gun rattled in the distance no but if we stay outside too long we might attract suspicion what did you find were you serious about taking me out of here absolutely you honestly think theres a chance i wouldnt try it otherwise but if you stay here theres no chance the words rushed out of her do it what you saw was that bad as soon as possible this afternoon chase said the sense that everything was speeding up made her lightheaded how when he told her and explained what she was going to need her dizziness intensified time had never seemed so swift and yet so slow she felt pushed forward and shoved back suddenly it was lunch hour but as quickly as the morning had passed the meal itself seemed to last forever derek stopped by to express his enthusiasm for how much work had been accomplished that morning and sienna tried not to look puzzled wondering what on earth he was talking about work no work had been done but when she and chase returned to the sunroom she realized she had been too preoccupied all morning to pay attention to how much chase had accomplished the sketch had been completed it showed her only from the waist up naked standing against a blank background her back straight her arms behind her a defiant gaze directed toward anyone viewing the canvas the lack of detail in the background gave the impression that she was so furious about being forced on display that she had detached herself from her surroundings her body here but her mind miles away that wasnt an exaggeration she felt so apprehensive about what they would soon try that everything around her was a haze even chase seemed as insubstantial as smoke and as for her halfnaked body before him she was hardly conscious of it the only reality was in her imagination as she brooded about the future she shivered but not at all because her skin was uncovered maybe this isnt a good idea she thought maybe we shouldnt try it but i have to its my only chance but maybe we should think about it more maybe this isnt the right time maybe we should wait for a better from the testing range a burst of machinegun fire brought her back to the moment the sunroom seemed to materialize before her the haze dispersed she became aware of chase studying her darting his brush toward the canvas a distant explosion rattled windows immediately another sound rattled windows the din of an approaching helicopter pressing the bridge of his spectacles against his nose potter stared down toward the estates walls trees ponds and gardens they seemed to enlarge as the helicopter descended specks of figures became distinct guards watching the entrances others patrolling gardeners tending the grounds servants going about their business smoke from an explosion rose from the testing area but there was no sign of activity at the landing area no guards converged no one waited in greeting derek would long ago have heard the helicopter approaching he would have had ample time to stop what he was doing and walk to the landing area to welcome him but that isnt dereks way potter thought burning with resentment no derek likes others to come to him no matter how interested he was in what potter had to report he would never stoop to do anything that implied how dependent he was on potters help he had to treat everyone as inferior except for the artist potter thought angrily oh derek was eager enough to make allowances for malone all right potter had seen derek order men shot for showing half the insolence that malone did and still derek put up with malones behavior because he wanted the portraits why derek wanted the portraits so badly potter had no idea if derek felt like getting rid of his wives fine take some snapshots for old times sake then arrange an accident but his obsession about the portraits was puzzling and dangerous this morning when potter had made a preliminary report to derek on a scramblerprotected phone he had learned about the incident the previous night about malones disappearance and dereks suspicion that malone had tried to find out what was in the cloister a false alarm derek had said wrong potter thought the incident had happened too conveniently while they were away the explanation had been too complicated potter intended to conduct a painstaking investigation and trap malone in inconsistencies for example if the artist had been suddenly inspired to do some latenight sketching in his workroom he would have had to turn on a light but had the guards been asked if any of them had seen that light ill expose the flaws in his story potter vowed we should never have gotten involved with him after we punished him for refusing to accept the commission that should have been the end i havent forgotten how he manipulated derek into criticizing me at the shooting range ive been made to look like a fool a dozen times over well not any longer now its my turn as the helicopter set down potter released his seat belt and shoved the hatch open eagerly waiting for the speed of the rotors to reduce so he could get out and find derek the whine from the spinning blades hurt his ears the wind they created stung his eyes and ruffled his thinning hair then he couldnt force himself to wait any longer his short stature made it difficult for him to climb down requiring a slight jump to the concrete pad clutching his briefcase he bent his knees on impact despite his shortness he took care to stoop as he ran beneath the spinning blades pressed down by the gust of the blades he hurried toward the weaponstesting area but a noise behind him made him stop a shout surely that isnt possible he told himself as close as he was to the helicopter the shriek from the rotors would have overwhelmed other sounds and yet he was certain hed heard a muffled outcry puzzled he turned to look back toward the helicopter and if he couldnt have heard the shout he was equally positive that he couldnt be seeing the commotion behind him when malone heard the approaching helicopter his hand and the paintbrush it held froze over the canvas a startled portion of his mind wondered if hed had a stroke then his heartbeat lurched jumpstarting his body he turned toward sienna who stared toward the windows and the increasing roar of the chopper this is it he said she seemed not to have heard him mechanically she put on her top but continued to stare distractedly toward the windows are you ready she still didnt respond with growing unease malone set down his brush and walked toward her look at me he put his hand on her face turning it toward him if were going to do this we have to move now he no longer worried about hidden microphones if this effort failed eavesdroppers would be the least of his problems i didnt expect to be so afraid if you stay here youll die we cant wait any longer we have to move the chopper sounded closer she studied him with an intensity that rivaled the way he had studied her for weeks now her eyes blazed with resolution yes she had followed malones instruction and exchanged her sandals for walking shoes now she went with him to the doorway watching the chopper approach the landing pad despite the distance potters pinched features were distinct behind the hatchs plexiglas he seemed to be the only passenger no one gathered at the landing pad a few patrolling guards glanced in the choppers direction most went about their business malone grabbed a sketch pad so the reason he and sienna were outdoors would appear to be related to work the chopper set down they left the sunroom crossed the terrace and descended the stone steps toward the path to the cloister malone heard siennas fast breathing then the rapid rise and fall of his own chest warned him that she wasnt the only one in danger of hyperventilating a guard blocked their way you cant go near the cloister we need to speak to mr potter sienna motioned toward the helicopter where potter jumped to the landing pad and turned toward the cloister and the weaponstesting area alex the noise from the chopper would prevent potter from hearing her but the guard would think she was making an honest attempt to get his attention well lose the rest of the day if sienna moved forward alex but potter was hurrying toward the cloister alex sienna called again moving more quickly forward malone noted that the other guards sporadically placed werent paying attention alex sienna ran now malone with her the chopper was only fifty yards ahead of them the pilot had not yet turned off the engines the blades continued to spin the guard behind them yelled something his gruff voice obscured by the whine of the choppers blades malone imagined him frowning then unslinging his rifle from his shoulder but would he dare to shoot the chopper was in his line of fire one of his targets was his bosss wife that would make him think twice in the meantime the chopper was closer thirty yards now but if sienna was a target who would make the guard hesitate malone was another matter he felt a spot between his shoulders get colder and tighter in anticipation of a bullet that would shatter his spine racing to his limit he strained to convince himself that his apprehension was baseless the guard didnt have a reason to assume the helicopter was their objective had any of them even been told that malone had once been a chopper pilot as far as the guard was concerned the problem was to keep them out of a restricted area alex sienna shouted again another guard yelled a warning twenty yards amazingly despite the noise from the helicopter potter heard the commotion and turned despite his frantic emotions malone enjoyed a microsecond of satisfaction from the way potter gaped then he and sienna reached the helicopter a guard raced toward them as malone grappled with the man knocking him to the ground sienna did what she had been told never looking back never faltering she scrambled up through the open hatch immediately malone lost sight of her as he raced around to the pilots side caught the surprised man looking the other way toward sienna pulled his harness free and yanked him out he had a sense of guards racing in his direction as he surged up behind the controls secured the harness and increased power to the idling rotors seeing how the extra noise and wind sent potter staggering back malone felt another microsecond of enjoyment but then as he worked the controls his sense of near victory turned sour when the helicopter struggled five feet into the air sank back to the landing pad rose awkwardly again and veered as if obeying its own impulses toward the château get your safety harness fastened malone yelled sienna fumbled to snap it into place adrenaline and the roar through the open hatches made her shout i was afraid we were going to crash everythings fine theres nothing to watch out were speeding toward the château at a height of about twenty feet malone urged the helicopter into a steep ascent that pressed his stomach against his spine sienna moaned fighting for altitude malone saw the châteaus upper stories seem to rush toward him then only the third story then only the hazy sky was before him as he felt a jolt that made the helicopter shudder what was something hit the rudder something theyre shooting another impact shook the controls as the chopper twisted to the left and tilted sienna was thrust halfway out the open hatch dangling her harness straining to hold her shut the hatch malone yelled trying despite his fear for her he couldnt risk looking at her he was too busy fighting the controls can you reach it think i got it from the corner of his eye he saw the desperate effort she put into tugging the hatch shut the noise suddenly lessened with equal suddenness he brought the helicopter back to a level position slamming his own hatch shut he took a momentary delight in the relative silence the roar from the engines muffled enough that he and sienna didnt need to shout anymore he studied the panel of unfamiliar switches that had puzzled him when hed been flown to bellasars estate the pilot hadnt used them so malone had no idea what purpose they served but this wasnt the time to experiment the chopper was close to stalling as it passed over fields and stone fences malone felt the controls buck ahead a cypressstudded hill blocked the way he urged the chopper higher but the response was sluggish whats wrong malone glanced urgently toward the control panel the oil pressures dropping a bullet must have hit he angled toward the lowest section of the hill barely cresting it he winced from another jolt as one of the landing skids brushed a cypress top are we going to sienna sounded terrified no if i think were even close to crashing ill set us down first but we wont get far enough away were still over dereks property hell she stared out the hatch smoke black clouds of it spewed from the engine if we can just stay in the air a little longer malone checked the compass on the control panel theres a small airfield ahead of us where i dont see it in the next valley how do you know back on cozumel when malone had agreed to work with jeb they had calculated several rescue plans if malone had a chance to get sienna away from bellasar one had involved reaching a café in nice where the proprietor was on the cias payroll and would hide malone and sienna until jebs team arrived another plan had involved going to cannes and contacting a pleasureboat operator who sometimes worked for the agency but those areas were in the opposite direction malone was heading inland not toward the sea and that left him with a remaining option an airfield that jeb had told him about the compass bearings for which malone had memorized jeb had promised to have a pilot and a small plane waiting for them if you can reach that airfield jeb had said youre as good as out of the country i dont understand sienna said how do you know about the airfield i dont have time to explain you knew about the portraits of dereks other wives the chopper dipped making her gasp how did you learn so much about malone struggled with the controls ill tell you the first chance i my god are you a what a spy as an engineer aimed another missile at a tank in the weaponstesting area bellasar tensed at the sound of shots from the château he grabbed a pistol from one of the guards and raced along a hedgelined path toward the cloister assuring himself that the area wasnt under attack he charged down another path this one toward the château and stopped abruptly surprised to see the helicopter veer over the building its landing skids barely missing the roof guards firing at it what the hell happened seeing potter to his right he rushed toward him potters face was livid as he stared toward the retreating helicopter they stole it what are you talking about malone and your wife theyre in that helicopter sienna they waited for me to land before the pilot shut off the engine they tricked a guard into believing they needed to talk to me the next thing they took off bellasar was so stunned he couldnt speak i warned you potter said i told you he couldnt be trusted briefly the helicopter was out of sight behind the château it reappeared on the right receding into the distance it sputtered and lurched black smoke trailed from it we hit it a guard said he made a fool of you potter said what do you suppose has been going on all the time theyve been together dont call me a fool bellasar drove a fist into potters stomach doubling him over sending him to his knees gasping for air potter peered up his spectacles askew his features contorted with pain maybe youd better figure out he managed a breath whos your friend and whos your enemy in the distance the helicopter kept sputtering bellasar pivoted toward the guards the second chopper was due to return with a load of lab equipment in thirty minutes until then the only way to go after malone and sienna was in vehicles bellasar shouted orders as the guards rushed to obey potter groaned holding his stomach he tried to straighten if im right he squeezed the words out this isnt just about malone and your wife its about what he might have seen at the cloister last night bellasar squinted toward the smoke trailing from the receding helicopter the damage to it reduced its speed enough that the vehicles wouldnt be outdistanced the smoke would make it easy to follow help me catch them the controls had become so stiff that malone could hardly move them the chopper twisted sickeningly at once it dropped ten feet with such force that malones lungs seemed to soar into his throat he needed all his strength to stop it from plummeting farther but no matter how hard he tried he couldnt keep it steady for a moment he was back in panama struggling to control his gunship after it had been shot brace yourself find a place thats flat where we can land i dont see any staring down malone didnt see any either they were over a rocky shrubdotted slope there was no way the chopper would ever clear the top the controls shuddered violently if he didnt land now the chopper was going to make the decision for him using every skill he could remember he forced the chopper out of a dizzying spiral wobbled along the side of the slope glimpsed a space between boulders gave one last determined command to the resisting controls and slammed down the impact rammed his teeth together ignoring the pain that shot along his jaw he shut off the engines unsnapped his safety harness and spun toward sienna her head was drooped my god is she but before the thought could be completed she raised her hand toward the back of her neck and rubbed it shaking her head in a daze are you okay he blurted head hurts we have to get out of here he coughed from the black smoke that swirled around him stinging his throat this thing might explode that caught her attention after one more dazed look at him she was suddenly animated freeing her harness shoving at the hatch on her side of the chopper its stuck it wont malone desperately tried his own side and groaned when he found that it too was stuck the impact having twisted it sweat stung his eyes as he strained to his limit his nerves quickening when the hatch reluctantly creaked open one of the blades had been bent down by the force of the landing rotating it had struck a boulder and frozen jamming the rotor so that the other blades were frozen also at least i dont have to worry about one of them spinning out of control and chopping my head off he thought he had plenty to worry about as it was when he jumped free then turned to grab siennas hand and help her out he saw flickers of crimson in the swirling black smoke on top of the chopper the engine wasnt just overheated it was on fire jesus if the flames reach the fuel tank leaping down sienna saw the flames too her panicked look communicating that he didnt have to tell her to run as far and fast as she could they raced dodging boulders sprinting past bushes charging along the slope malones throat already irritated by the oily smoke was made more raw by his quick deep strident breathing his legs stretched to their maximum beside him sienna strained to run faster hearing a whoosh behind him malone recognized the distinctive sound of flames reaching spilled fuel he barely saw a gully suddenly appear before he had time to jump instead of stumble into it he landed and rolled sienna tumbling next to him the shock wave from an explosion striking his eardrums it was far more powerful than the blast from a burning gas tank numerous secondary explosions were almost as strong punctuated by the crackle of bullets jesus had there been munitions aboard malone wondered in dismay as something else exploded chunks of smoking metal clanged off boulders and rebounded down the gully then the afternoon was silent except for malones and siennas gasping attempt to catch their breath and the muted rumble of the unseen flames they stared apprehensively at each other their eyes asking if either was hurt each quietly responding im all right but what about you tasting sweat smoke and dust malone tried his arms and legs after sienna did the same and nodded in assurance they rose cautiously to peer over the rim toward the blazing hulk of the chopper how far is that airfield siennas face was smeared with soot maybe a half mile were wasting time she climbed painfully out of the gully but if we ever get away youre going to tell me how you learned about this place he didnt know how to respond not that it mattered as they climbed the rocky slope another sound intruded malone now had an added taste in his mouth coppery that of fear as he turned toward approaching engines and saw three fourwheeldrive vehicles speed past trees on a road below him they swerved into the bumpy field that led in this direction people from a nearby farm malone wondered did they see the chopper go down and come to help the stateoftheart vehicles almost military in design made his heart sink with doubt so did the relentlessness with which their occupants ignored the jostling punishment of the uneven terrain its derek sienna said despite her bruised legs she spun toward the crest and ran as his vehicle jolted across the field bellasar gripped the steering wheel harder and glared through the windshield toward the smoke and flames billowing from the wreckage does anybody see survivors increasing speed despite the shocks to the vehicle he scanned the rocky slope the spreading haze made it difficult to distinguish shapes his vision was unsteady because of the jouncing shudder of the vehicle even so he thought he saw figures moving to the right of the blazing wreckage he shoved his foot harder onto the accelerator stiffening his neck to keep his head from jerking back there damned well had better be survivors he thought steering sharply toward the right it no longer mattered to him that he had been making arrangements for siennas death now more than anything he wanted her alive and malone he wanted to see their faces he needed to study the fear in their eyes when he made them pay i see movement the guard next to bellasar pointed toward the right toward where bellasar steered even the toughest civilian fourwheeldrive vehicle would have long since broken its suspension so punishing was the rocky terrain but one of bellasars engineering teams had developed a military version that had civilian styling rode well was heavily armed and would survive just about any hardship demanded of it a number of drug lords and dictators had ordered the armorplated model but before making delivery bellasar had wanted to test it further it gave him great satisfaction that its performance this afternoon left no doubt that it was ready you think you can get away from me he mentally shouted toward the two partially glimpsed figures who scrambled up the slope you think you have even the slightest chance reaching the bottom of the slope not bothering to reduce speed as he jolted upward he saw the smoke disperse enough to verify that the scurrying figures were in fact sienna and malone he raised the lid on a console next to him exposing a button and two small joysticks the button he pressed opened a port beneath each headlight exposing the muzzle of acaliber machine gun built into each wheel well each weapon was capable of swiveling within a thirtydegree radius of being raised and lowered within a similar range and of firing independently bellasar didnt worry that shots would bring the police this was still his property he sometimes tested weapons here farmers in the area would think it was business as usual judging the distance and angle he used his right hand to maneuver the right stick pressed a button on top of it and heard a brrrrp its vibration negligible as a stream of bullets tore up the slope to the right of his targets he didnt want to hit them god no he wanted to scare them and convince them that running any farther was futile he wanted them alive to make them suffer sienna and malone frantically changed direction angling to the left as they charged up the slope bellasar switched to the other stick maneuvered it pressed the button on it and sent a burst of bullets into the slope above them spraying dirt shattering rocks and disintegrating bushes he redirected the stick curving the bullets downward to the right then up again blocking the next route they tried sienna and malone flinched bent low and reversed their direction sprinting again to the left heading back toward the wreckage bellasar tracked them with the left machine gun about to press its button and tear up the slope farther to their left he had to jerk his hand from the stick and grip the steering wheel needing both hands to veer around a boulder that loomed ahead of him the instant he was safely around it he gripped the stick again and refocused his gaze on the running figures or tried to in the few seconds it had taken him to avoid the boulder sienna and malone had reached the smoke from the wreckage his vision obscured bellasar steered to the left now following them speeding farther up the hill without warning a gully blocked his way he stomped on the brakes so hard that he lurched painfully forward his shoulder harness cutting into him the guards in the back slammed forward as the brakes gripped tires skidding the gully got closer wider deeper bellasar didnt realize he was holding his breath until the vehicle stopped its front end tilting downward he exhaled immediately he grabbed the microphone from the dashboards twoway radio keep after them block their route the machine guns in the other vehicles began shooting into the smoke damn it dont shoot to kill i want them alive use your bullets to block their route instantly he changed to another frequency contacting potter at the château potters voice crackled from the radio the second helicopter has arrived bring it ive found them bellasar blurted directions to where he was im activating a homing signal follow it dropping the microphone bellasar drew his pistol and hurried from the vehicle spread out he ordered the guards theyre hiding up there in the smoke as far as i know malone isnt armed you dont need to shoot to kill find them bring them to me preparing to hurry down into the gully and up the other side bellasar took a second to admire the two vehicles beyond it as they sped up the slope on his left veering among bushes and boulders easily handling the rough landscape the sound of their engines was solid and powerful five minutes from now alex and the second helicopter would arrive bellasar would order the pilot to hover over the wreckage the downdraft from its whirling blades would disperse the smoke making it easy to find where sienna and malone were trying to hide among the rocks its only a matter of time bellasar assured himself soon ill have them in fact for a moment a deep sound blended with that of the vehicles and made him think that the second helicopter had arrived more quickly than he expected as the deep sound became a rumble he realized how wrong he was coughing so hard that he feared he might vomit his eyes watering from the smoke that swirled around him malone heard the vehicles roaring up the slope toward sienna and him the burning wreckage and the smoke from it temporarily shielded them but the relentless vehicles would soon burst into view hunched next to him behind a boulder sienna coughed as hard as he did lets see if we can move this thing she said what this boulder as the vehicles charged closer up the hill malone suddenly understood the smoke thinned enough for him to see a glint of hope in her raw red irritated eyes they rose to a crouch and pressed both hands against the boulder shoving against it harder groaning with effort malone felt something in him thrill as the boulder shifted more the boulder tilted rolling gaining momentum rumbling out of sight through the smoke they raced toward another desperation fueling their strength they got it rolling faster than the first one and immediately rushed to another and then another crisscrossing the slope protecting both sides of the flaming wreckage the combined rumble reminded malone of thunder but the thunder became distant the boulders were taking too long they must have passed the vehicles and continued toward the bottom at once a crash of rock glass and metal echoed from below a second crash was even more violent before the engines died sienna was already in motion she ran up the slope coughing straining to break free of the smoke a third crash made malones spirits soar as he hurried after her gagging he left the smoke but he was too distracted to enjoy the sweet clean air he sucked into his lungs the crest of the slope was only thirty yards ahead but it might as well have been a mile he had no way of telling how damaged the vehicles were he didnt dare waste time looking behind him to check if the machine guns havent been disabled we dont have a chance he thought indeed he did hear gunshots but they were single fire not from automatic weapons and the bullets were ricocheting off rocks below him that meant the gunmen were aiming as if they were on level ground to hit a target moving uphill they had to aim slightly above what they were shooting at letting the target rise into their sights but they would soon make that adjustment of that malone had no doubt sienna was so propelled by fear that he had trouble keeping up with her the top of the slope seemed as far away as when he had started the singlefire bullets whacked closer behind him and he realized with alarm that the gunmen werent making a mistake theyre aiming low on purpose he thought they dont want to kill us theyre shooting toward our legs they want to cripple us so bellasar can take us alive what sounded like superfast bumblebees sped past his legs one of them nicked his jeans and stung his left calf racing harder he stared toward the top he swore his eyes were playing tricks everything seemed to become magnified the crest suddenly close before him he saw sienna disappear over it and a moment later chased by bullets he joined her lurching onto a flat ridge that led to a gradual descent to olive trees in a valley in the distance was a gray ribbon of concrete flanked by a handful of matchboxlooking buildings the airfield the crunch of metal and the shatter of glass sent a wave of nausea through bellasar his sick feeling quickly changed to the most intense fury he had ever known his engineers had assured him that these vehicles could withstand an attack from assault rifles grenades and even a glancing hit from a rocket but the boulders had crushed the front of the cars and bounced up to strike the bulletresistant windshields smashing through and crushing the men in the front seats bellasar screamed in outrage with the men from his car and the survivors who lurched from the other cars he fired toward sienna and malone determined more than ever to take them alive aiming at their legs he emptied his pistol but before he could eject its magazine and shove in a new one they disappeared over the crest cursing bellasar leapt back into his vehicle the men with him barely had a chance to jump in before he rammed the gearshift into reverse tore up dirt backing away from the gully spun the steering wheel and sped up the slope but the incline steepened and the ground became more uneven the engine strained to its limit could no longer propel the weight of the reinforced body the more it slowed the more bellasar pressed the accelerator until with a bang that shook the vehicle the transmission failed the vehicle rolling backward bellasar stomped the brake pedal twisted the steering wheel and yanked the lever of the emergency brake slamming a fresh magazine into his pistol he charged out and ran for the top as malone reached the cover of the olive trees at the bottom of the slope he risked a precious few seconds to catch his breath and check behind him but any hope that bellasar might have been left back there was destroyed when he saw the tiny figures of men hurry over the crest at their lead his suit and tie somehow more threatening than the rugged clothes of the guards his broad shoulders and strong chest unmistakable was bellasar malone raced on the olive trees were dense enough that he couldnt see sienna but the snap of branches and the crunch of footsteps ahead told him where to run to catch up to her despite his excellent physical condition he had trouble narrowing the distance between them at once he glimpsed her the earth colors of her skirt and top helping her blend with the trees as she fled through them he managed to join her as the trees gave way to a field a fence quonset huts and the airstrip all the while he and sienna raced across the field malone was intensely aware of the cold spot on his back where he expected to be shot sienna got to the fence first dropped to her back pushed up the lowest strand of wire and squirmed under shouts from the trees behind malone added to his speed when he gripped a post and vaulted the fence to catch up to her the quonset huts were rusted he saw when he reached them cracks in the airstrip were choked with grass christ its abandoned he thought jeb what have you sent me to but even as unnerving doubts seized him he and sienna rounded a corner and almost bumped into a pickup truck past it were an old renault sedan and a beatup station wagon three singlepropeller planes stood at the side of the runway about to hurry into the largest building malone bumped into a bearded man coming out dressed in mechanics coveralls and carrying a greasy rag with his limited french malone tried to blurt his apologies quickly adding im looking for a man named harry lockhart the man raised his eyebrows and hands in confusion harry lockhart malone couldnt help noticing the frown sienna gave him do you know a man named the mystified expression on the frenchmans face made malone give up speak english monsieur i dont understand your french ive never heard of anyone named harry lockhart but hes supposed to meet me here siennas frown became more severe are you certain you came to the right airfield the frenchman asked is there another one around here no then im in the right place youre bleeding monsieur what your face youre bleeding malone had assumed the moisture he felt was sweat for a moment he feared hed been shot then he realized that the blood came from the scabs on his cheek and mouth the exertion had opened them two other men stepped from the building they too wore coveralls and although one was a little heavier than the other they looked like brothers the first man turned to them and asked something in french at the mention of the name harry lockhart they shook their heads no then looked puzzled at the blood on malones face damn it jeb you promised hed be here malone thought what happened to you the first man asked in english were you in those explosions we heard sienna kept glancing nervously back toward the field they had run across we cant wait any longer if this guy lockhart isnt here to help us she started to run malone spoke more frantically to the frenchmen did anybody show up here in the past couple of weeks and say he was waiting for chase malone no monsieur the only people who come here are the three of us and a few others in the area who like to fly old planes you bastard jeb you swore youd back me up the frenchmans gaze drifted toward the sky and the swiftly approaching sound of a helicopter oh shit malone thought he pulled his steel and gold rolex from his wrist and put it in the mans hand this is worth six thousand dollars show me how fast you can get your plane in the air halfway across the field bellasar faltered at the sound of a small plane sputtering then droning the engine gained more power sounding as if it was about to take off no he raged charging forward again faster if sienna and malone are in that plane the engine reached full power the distinctive thrust of a plane speeding along a runway ive lost them bellasar thought he came to a breathless stop his sweatdrenched suit and white shirt clinging to him he stared at the sky above the metal buildings raising his pistol his men doing the same he got ready to fire the instant the plane soared into view his intentions were rash he knew given that there would probably be witnesses at the airfield the imprecision bothered him also the risk of stray bullets killing sienna and malone rather than merely forcing the plane down but by god he had to do something he wasnt just going to stand there and watch malone fly away with his wife when potter saw the smoking wreckage of the helicopter and then the three abandoned vehicles two of them crushed the doors of the third one open as if its occupants had left in a hurry he was reminded of the aftermath of an ambush hed seen in the balkans a month earlier except in this case there werent any bodies where was about to tell the pilot to keep a distance until he figured out what was going on he heard his cell phone ring and he answered it im in the next valley bellasar shouted theres an airstrip sienna and malone are in a plane about to take off as bellasar told him what to do potter felt uncustomarily euphoric the helicopter increased speed clearing the top of the hill immediately the airfield was in view so was the tiny outline of the singleprop airplane taking off although the airplane rapidly gained altitude the turbocharged helicopter climbed much faster making potter feel energized pressing his stomach pleasantly against his back the airplane leveled off speeding toward rugged hills to the west the helicopter raced after it gaining quickly coming abreast of it on the left potter studied the shapes of passengers in the backseat and motioned for the planes pilot to set down the pilot ignored him the plane dipped sharply so did the helicopter the plane veered more sharply to the right so did the helicopter get ahead of him potter said keep cutting him off force him to go back to the airfield but before the helicopters pilot could do what he was told the plane soared so did the helicopter unexpectedly the plane swooped toward the countryside and banked beneath the helicopter speeding in the opposite direction the pilot muttered chasing the plane narrowing the distance between them now he matched everything the airplane did dipping banking soaring each maneuver bringing him closer the pilot took the offensive and cut ahead of the plane compelling it to turn when it dipped he anticipated which side the planes pilot was going to choose and was waiting for him forcing him to turn again when the plane soared the helicopter pilot again anticipated which side he would bank to and waited to block his way as the helicopter nudged closer the bearded face of the planes pilot became distinct although his plexiglas window was scratched and dusty there was no mistaking his alarm potters french was excellent and so was his ability to read lips the pilot was cursing the man grabbed his radio microphone the choppers pilot found the frequency he was using what the hell do you think youre doing the frenchman demanded go back to the airfield set down potter said you dont have a right your passengers give me the right what passengers are you talking about a suspicion struck potter so hard that he felt punched in the seat behind you those are duffel bags get closer potter ordered his pilot when the pilot started to object that it was too dangerous potter shouted do it staring as the plane seemed to enlarge next to him he strained to see past the dusty rear plexiglas and decipher the dark forms that he had taken for granted were malone and sienna no he thought distinguishing the torsoshaped outlines of what were indeed duffel bags go back he yelled to his pilot how much did they pay you bellasar demanded the overweight man in coveralls looked baffledme they didnt pay me anything i dont know whats going on they gave pierre an expensive watch for doing what he was going to do anyhow take off and fly to marseilles where are they the man pointed toward a path that went through trees on the opposite side of the airfield they stole two bicycles right bellasar thought or maybe you sold the bicycles for one of siennas bracelets then it isnt too late they cant go far he pulled out a money clip and peeled off several largedomination bills give me the key to the station wagon it wont do any good what are you talking about the man pointed toward the front right tire it was flat so was a tire on the pickup truck and the renault before the man left he did that fix them furious about the waste of time bellasar didnt wait for potter to return he ran toward the path potter will scan the countryside from above he promised himself a man and a woman on bicycles wont be hard to see well keep going well catch them ill never stop pedaling as hard as he could malone steered around a wooded bend the trees opened up facing a paved road he squeezed the brake levers on the handlebars to his right from beyond a curve he heard a truck approaching sienna stopped beside him quickly malone said we have to get to the other side he dismounted and hurried with the bicycle laying it on the pavement in front of the yetunseen truck after wiping his hand across his face smearing the blood over a wider area he lay on the road and pulled the bicycle over him look panicked he told sienna wave for the driver to stop the truck sped into view sprawled on the ground gripping his leg allowing himself to show pain malone suddenly worried that the truck was approaching too fast for it to be able to stop in time tangled with the bicycle he wouldnt be able to crawl free and roll to the side of the road fast enough jesus sienna waved frantically hes going to hit us as she lunged to pull malones bicycle off him brakes squealed but they didnt seem to do any good the truck kept hurtling toward them she threw the bicycle to the side and dragged malone off the road as the trucks brakes squealed louder and smoke came from the tires on an angle the truck skidded to a stop twenty yards beyond where malone had been lying the truck larger than a pickup had wooden sides across which a tarpaulin was stretched the inside was filled with ladders sawhorses and lumber the drivers door banged open a sunburned man wearing sawdustspotted clothes ran around the back and shouted angrily the mans french was far too rapid for malone to understand but sienna answered him as rapidly gesturing toward the blood on malones face the mans anger turned to surprise and then shock paralyzed for a moment he broke into motion rushing to help malone toward the truck i told him you were hit by a car hes taking you to a doctor sienna said ask him if theres room in the back for the bicycles as the man helped sienna set the bikes out of sight under the tarpaulin malone climbed into the front and leaned his head back as if in pain the next moment the driver hurried behind the steering wheel sienna getting in the other side putting the truck into gear the driver sped along the road he says the nearest hospital is ten minutes away sienna explained that might not be soon enough malone tried to sound in agony despite the rattle of the truck he heard the helicopter in the distance hoping the driver would go faster he made himself wince and moan the man came out with another torrent of french malone barely listened too busy concentrating on the approaching sound of the helicopter he assumed that the truck would soon attract its attention after all he hadnt seen any other vehicles on this road how long would it take bellasar to conclude that they had reached the road and caught a ride isolated houses appeared as the truck sped around another curve malone saw cars trucks bicycles and people walking the driver had reached a town its speedzone sign forcing him to slow imagining the view from the chopper malone had a mental overhead image of the speck of a truck blending with other specks at a fourway stop he noticed vehicles heading away in each direction and finally relaxed deciding that for now there was no way bellasar could track them for now but bellasar wouldnt stop searching and plenty of other problems remained malone knew he needed to convince the truck driver not to go into the hospital with him he needed to find a place where he could clean himself up a mens room near the emergency ward perhaps then he had to find a way out of town before bellasars men converged on it the first chance he got he would use the emergency phone number jeb had given him but that was another problem why hadnt jeb followed through on the rescue plan theyd arranged and that question in turn made malone dread an even more immediate problem the hard look in siennas eyes as she studied him impatient to ask how hed known about the airfield and what the hell this was all about seven whos harry lockhart siennas tone was subdued presumably to avoid alarming passengers near them on the bus but her question was obviously a demand i dont know ive never laid eyes on him a pilot with that name was supposed to meet us they were in the backseat the ticket seller at the depot had taken so long agreeing to accept some of the dollars malone had brought with him from the united states that they had barely gotten to the bus before it moved out as they left the outskirts of town dusk thickened lights coming on in houses malone glanced out the rear window to see if any cars seemed to be following them sienna continued to press him who was supposed to arrange for lockhart to be there a friend of mine except he didnt is he the same friend who told you about what happened to dereks other wives her voice was sharper yes you planned to get me out of there from the first day you arrived yes which means you intended to use me against derek from the start no malone said it wasnt like that the buss motor was beneath them its raucous vibration muffling their voices who do you work for nobody the back of the bus was cast in shadows you just admitted that you have people providing you with information you have a group that was supposed to give you backup it isnt what you im working with some people yes but i dont work for them the cia yes he said reluctantly jesus sienna threw up her hands if derek finds out if he thinks im cooperating with im not a spy damn it what do you call it then their voices had become louder causing people in the seats ahead of them to look back calm down if youll let me explain malone said softly thats what ive been waiting for the strain of lowering her emotionladen voice tightened the sinews in siennas neck all right malone took a deep breath then told her what had happened on cozumel your husband destroyed most of what was important to me when my friend turned up and offered me a way to get even i took it and used me to pay derek back that isnt why i trusted you i thought you were my friend but all this time youve been lying to me playing up to me to i never lied you sure as hell never told me the truth not all of it but what would you have done if i had told you she opened her mouth but seemed not to know what to say your husband really was planning to kill you but if id told you how i knew would you have believed me would you have gone with me or would you have suspected i was trying to trick you she still didnt know what to say i am your friend malone held out his hand she didnt take it i never used you malone said i dont care if you never tell the agency a thing all that matters to me is that i got you out of there sienna was so motionless she didnt seem to be breathing i dont know what to believe she looked at him for the longest time when she finally gripped his hand it was as if she were on the brink of a cliff depending upon him to keep her from falling the bus pulled into nice around midnight given the combination of darkness and glaring lights malone wasnt able to get an impression of the city even the salt smell from the sea didnt register on him so desensitized were his nostrils by the diesel smell of the bus to guard against the risk that bellasars men might be waiting at the bus depot malone chose a busy intersection at random and asked the driver to stop the instant they stepped off malone led sienna into a crowd i dont know what went wrong at the airfield he said but jeb and i had a backup plan they went into a latenight convenience store where malone used nearly all of his few remaining dollars to buy sandwiches fruit bottled water and a telephone card now lets find a pay phone there was one around the corner and as sienna anxiously watched malone inserted the phone card then pressed the numbers jeb had given him to memorize it wont be long now he thought well soon be out of here on the other end the phone rang twice before it was answered pulse rushing malone started to use the identification phrase hed been given the painter when a computerized voice cut him off its french was too hurried for him to understand the connection was broken what the sienna stepped closer is something wrong i must have pressed the wrong numbers he tried again but the same computerized voice cut him off i dont understand what its saying you try he told her the numbers and watched her press them nervous she listened seconds later she frowned and lowered the phone that numbers been disconnected what maybe the cia doesnt pay its phone bills she said bitterly the lines no longer in service jeb you son of a bitch malone thought what are you doing to me whats gone wrong it was almost am as they walked wearily at random along narrow shadowy side streets that hotel up ahead looks good sienna said it sure does but they passed the welcoming entrance knowing that they didnt dare check in without enough cash to rent a room malone would need to use a credit card but by now bellasar would have ordered his computer experts to access the databases of every creditcard company looking for any transactions in malones name if malone used a credit card bellasar and his men would storm into the hotel room before morning i brought some jewelry sienna said but we wont be able to sell it until the secondhand stores open tomorrow morning we might have to wait longer what do you mean your husband will check to see if any of your jewelry is missing hell anticipate that youll try to sell it we might walk into a trap everything seems a trap the fear on her face made him touch it keep remembering youre not alone not alone around the next corner they discovered that their aimless path had brought them to a park overlooking the harbor between palm trees a bench invited them in the distance yachts gleamed faint music drifted from one a piano playing i concentrate on you men and women in evening clothes were chatting and drinking cocktail malone opened one of the bottles of water and handed it to her i could use one hors doeuvres malone set out the choices of sandwiches egg salad tuna salad and chicken salad thats quite a selection the best in town the service is awfully good well have to recommend it to all our friends and leave a generous tip absolutely a generous tip siennas willingness to go along with his attempt at humor encouraged him as long as their spirit persisted they werent defeated but as a breeze scraped palm leaves above them he noticed that she hugged her arms shivering take my sport coat then youll be the one whos cold ill sit close to you he stood and put the coat around her his hands lingering on her shoulders then he realized how tired he was and eased back onto the bench he was so thirsty it took him only a few deep swallows to drink a quarter of a liter of water the egg salad tasted like the waxed paper it had been wrapped in the bread was stale he didnt care under the circumstances it was the most delicious meal he had ever eaten on the yacht below them the piano player shifted to the days of wine and roses care to dance he asked sienna looked at him bewildered i couldnt help thinking about the lyrics to that song he said about regret and time passing if we were another couple sitting here this would be a beautiful night a moments what we make of it i guess yes id like to dance as they stood and faced each other malone felt pressure in his chest he tried to keep his right hand steady when he put it around her waist her left hand trembled a little when she put it on his shoulder they turned slowly to the distant mournful music that evoked children running through a meadow never to reach a door to infinite possibilities barely able to breathe malone drew her closer to him certain he was going to pass out if he didnt get more air into his lungs he felt her breasts rising and falling as she too tried to get enough air pivoting tenderly with her he saw the shadowy path behind them where an elderly man and woman were walking their poodle through the park and had stopped to watch them dancing the couple looked at each other then back at malone and sienna smiling the man took the womans hand and continued walking through the park then malone was aware of nothing around him only of sienna in his arms as the piano brought the haunting melody to a close malone recalled the lonely nights of the lyrics when he and sienna kissed he felt as if he were a youngster lightheaded his first time they spent the night sitting on the bench she slept with her head on his shoulder he kept an arm around her not sleeping as much as dozing his troubled thoughts often waking him below the lights on the various yachts gradually went out the traffic sounds from the city lessened in a while he was able to pretend that he and sienna were in a private universe but the real world would intrude all too soon he knew bellasar would relentlessly hunt them and the moment they sold siennas jewelry or malone was forced to use his credit card the focus of the hunt would narrow we have to get out of nice he thought hell we have to get out of the country out of europe but even if they had money they still couldnt leave bellasar had their passports without jebs help malone reluctantly confessed to himself we dont have a chance in misty morning sunlight the thinfaced waiter narrowed his disapproving eyes as malone and sienna made their way among the sidewalk tables toward him early customers peered up from their coffee and frowned malone imagined what he looked like his clothes rumpled his cheeks unshaven his lips and upper left cheek scabbed and swollen some homeless people look better than i do he thought i bet thats what the waiter thinks i am he probably figures i want a handout although malones nostrils were too accustomed to the smell for him to notice it he was also sure that he reeked of smoke from the helicopter crash and sweat and fear thank god sienna looks better he thought in fact even though her clothes too were rumpled and her makeup had worn off she looked terrific a few strokes from a comb shed borrowed from him had given her hair a sheen her tan skin glowed no matter how bad she felt malone sensed it was impossible for her to look bad monsieur the waiter raised his hands to keep malone at a distance although his french was too quick for malone to understand it the gist was clear the café had standards it would be better if malone went somewhere else sienna didnt give him a chance to finish her hurried question to him included a word that sounded like proprietor the waiters reply accompanied by gestures suggested that the proprietor wasnt necessary to deal with this problem sienna turned to malone do you remember the owners name pierre benét the bosss name made the waiter pay closer attention then sienna told the waiter malones name pointing at him as she did adding something in french that might have been your boss is expecting us the effect was immediate the waiter jerked his head back a torrent of words from him left sienna looking shocked what is it malone asked whats he saying they know who you are but they werent expecting us what the operation was canceled jesus not another screwup worse than that they think youre dead chase this is terrible i cant tell you how rotten i feel about this jeb said it was twelve hours later they were in an apartment above the café where jeb out of breath from having charged up the stairs looked heavier than the last time malone had seen him his blocky face redder than usual i was in washington when i heard i got here as soon as possible i dont want you to think i left you hanging it occurred to me christ jeb slammed his hands against his legs buddy weve been through a lot together you saved my life i swear to you id never knowingly fail to back you up have they been taking care of you malone pointed toward a stack of used cups glasses and plates on a counter whatever you said to them on the phone theyve been coming up every hour it seems with food and coffee my god your face what happened to it you should have seen how bad it looked before i got cleaned up malone explained how hed received the injuries the bastard i can think of stronger ways to say that and what about jeb turned toward sienna malone had introduced her as soon as jeb had entered the room but since then jebs apologies had taken up most of the conversation he seemed selfconscious as if trying not to stare at her beauty are you hurt no sienna assessed him but after what happened im not exactly filled with confidence i dont blame you for thinking i dont know my job please listen to me for a minute jeb ran a flustered hand through his short blond hair chase after you picked that fight with bellasar at sothebys you disappeared from the face of the earth the last time anybody saw you was when bellasar jabbed you with his ring and his men dragged you out of sothebys sienna hadnt heard the details of the confrontation she leaned forward troubled we know you were driven away in bellasars limo and after that poof two days later a body too mangled to identify im talking no fingers and no teeth was found floating in the east river the face had been burned with a blowtorch sienna paled it was dressed like you it had your height and weight it had a parker meridian room key in its bomber jacket pocket the same hotel where you were staying you can understand why we made assumptions except bellasars men had already picked up my luggage and checked me out malone said when you learned i wasnt registered there any longer it should have been obvious the body wasnt mine the problem is nobody checked you out of your room what you were still listed as a guest your clothes and things were still in your room when we went there somebodys but not mine my bag was on bellasars jet did you bother to compare the hair samples on those clothes with ones at my home on cozumel did you try to match dna samples from the body with what chase your home doesnt exist anymore after you left the bulldozers leveled it trucks hauled the pieces away for a moment malone was speechless but bellasar told me the bulldozers had stopped he told me he was going to restore his voice became hoarse just like he told me his men checked me out of my hotel room even then i didnt give up jeb said i tried to find out if anybody had seen you get on bellasars jet no luck i checked with the airport authorities at nice to see if they had any record that youd entered the country no luck there either i waited for a signal from you nothing its been five weeks chase for gods sake we had a wake for you i never expected to see you again i did my best to convince my supervisor not to do it but he finally pulled the plug malone peered down at his hands i can understand if youre pissed at me jeb said but what would you have done that i didnt i swear to you it wasnt anybodys fault jebs suit was rumpled from the long flight his eyes were swollen from lack of sleep his burly frame looked puffy from sitting too long its okay malone said really i want to put this behind us chase i dont want you thinking i let you down im not everythings fine were back on track youre positive no hard feelings none but in the meantime my husbands still looking for me siennas stark tone made clear that whatever malone felt she herself was not reassured i keep worrying that he and his men are going to smash through that door any minute how are you going to help us for the first time jeb looked directly at her itll be my pleasure to show you i can do my job after nightfall twenty miles east of nice a van stopped along the narrow coastal road malone and sienna got out accompanied by jeb and three other armed men as the van drove away they clambered down a rocky slope to where a motorized rubber raft waited in a cove a half mile offshore they boarded a small freighter and set out for corsica two days from now youll be transferred to a us aircraft carrier on maneuvers in the region jeb said after using a scramblerequipped radio to verify the schedule from there youll be flown to a base in italy and from there he spread his hands home wherever that is sienna murmured the three of them sat in the dimly lit galley while their escorts and the crew remained on deck watching for any approaching lights can i get you anything jeb asked coffee hot chocolate something stronger the hot chocolate sounds good sienna said same here malone said coming up jeb said and after that given all youve been through im sure youre exhausted there are bunks in the stern im too on edge to sleep she said then why dont we talk about why were here cant this wait until tomorrow malone asked im not trying to force anything jeb tore open an envelope of hotchocolate mix whatever sienna wants the smell of diesel fumes hung in the air its okay she exhaled wearily lets get it over with this is going to take a lot longer than you think malone told her the freighter rocked as it passed through waves chase im trying to make this as pleasant as possible jeb said well move at whatever pace she wants then ill go first malone said giving her a chance to rest i saw two men at the estate jeb paused in the midst of pouring the hotchocolate mix into a cup they were russians malone went on one of them brought in several crates of equipment via chopper when the guards mishandled the crates the russian got very nervous as if he was afraid of what might happen if something inside broke i managed to get over to the building where the russians were staying i got a look through a window the crates contained lab equipment sienna frowned realizing how little she had known about what malone had been doing at the estate lab equipment jeb asked what for beats the hell out of me describe the russians i can do better than that what do you mean jebs look of curiosity was matched by siennas have you got any sheets of paper around here jeb freed the latches on several drawers and peered inside finally locating a pencil and a pad of eightbyten yellow paper malone ordered his thoughts then began to draw calling not so much on his memory of the mens faces as on his memory of the numerous drawings he had done of them two nights previously he had reproduced the faces enough times that he had little trouble replicating the strokes that filled in their features on occasion when the freighter shuddered from the impact of a wave his pencil missed its mark but he quickly erased the errors and added more details time seemed to stop only later when his pencil quit moving and the faces were complete did he realize twenty minutes had gone by silence had seemed to envelope him now he shoved the sketches across the table to jeb look familiar afraid not jeb held them closer to the light but these are vivid enough im sure somebody in the agency will be able to identify them vivid hell theyre close to being photographs what you just did ive never seen anything like it malone turned toward sienna if youre not tired id like to try something what is it i think itll save time in your debriefing but we can wait until tomorrow if no youve got me curious did the man your husband met in istanbul ever give his name the reference caught jeb by surprise he leaned forward what man i never knew the names of anybody derek did business with sienna said whenever he used me as window dressing the people he met avoided referring to one another even by their first names istanbul jeb asked when was this sienna gave him the details it was an important meeting derek was very tense about it weve been trying to keep track of your husbands activities jeb said but i had no idea about this meeting thats not a confidence booster sienna said jeb looked down at his cup malone readied his pencil describe the man sienna nodded understanding he was middle eastern describe the shape of his face she looked across the galley focusing her memory rectangular how narrow very any facial hair a thin mustache curved or straight as jeb watched malone began putting a face to siennas description most of his questions were based on geometry the shape of the mans lips his nose and his eyes high or low forehead how old was he late forties malone put crowsfeet around the eyes and added wrinkles to the forehead is this starting to resemble him the lips were fuller malone made the correction the eyes looked harsher good malone tore off the page and started a new one copying details from the first rough sketch leaving out smudges from erasures and the clutter of needless lines he went to work on the eyes adding the harshness that sienna had mentioned what about his cheekbones he often looked like hed tasted something sour his cheeks were sucked in malones pencil moved faster jeb peered over malones shoulder jesus i recognize this guy what when i was assigned against bellasar i had to familiarize myself with other blackmarket arms dealers this is tariq ahmed his main competitor a couple of years ago they agreed on which territories each could have without interference from the other bellasar took africa europe and south america ahmed took the mideast and asia bellasar cheated when it came to iraq ahmed cheated in ethiopia but basically they got along especially when they had problems with other arms dealers trying to take some of their territories so what did they need to meet about is their truce falling apart i havent the faintest idea sienna answered my husband never talked about business in my presence it was only indirectly that i learned how he made his fortune youre telling me he never once mentioned a name or a detail about a transaction thats right what did you talk about very little once derek married me i was just another possession jeb looked frustrated obviously hed expected more thats why i wanted to give you these drawings right away malone said theyre the only things of substance youre going to get out of this maybe not once we debrief the two of you its hard to say what might turn up something you remember some reference you overheard but didnt understand or think was important the sooner i do it the sooner im free first thing in the morning sienna asked jeb nodded as sienna and malone stood moving toward bunks in the stern jeb added uh chase i wonder if i could talk to you a minute sure on deck sure malone repeated puzzled he touched siennas shoulder see you later she returned his touch then disappeared into the shadows of the stern malone followed jeb up the steps to the murky deck the canopy of stars was brilliant he couldnt recall ever having seen so many a cool breeze ruffled his hair i need a little clarification jeb said about i just wanted to make sure it wasnt my imagination the way youre so concerned about her the way you touched her shoulder just now do you and she have something going excuse me its not a hard question to understand are the two of you emotionally involved what the hell business is it of yours look as your case officer case officer you havent had the psychological training so let me just tell you it gets messy when an operative becomes emotionally involved with an informant among other things you lose your objectivity theres a risk youll miss something we need to know youre talking as if i work for you malone said well isnt that what were doing here when i went into this i told you it was personal it had nothing to do with the agency well you sure need us now jeb said so maybe youd better rethink your position shes the most beautiful woman ive ever seen its understandable youre attracted to her but shes bellasars target more than you are if you stay with her youre doubling the chances hell catch up to you not if you do your job jeb looked toward the pitchblack sea working to calm himself im just trying to be your friend youre making a mistake the mistake would be to pass up the chance to be with her hey im doing my best to be tactful about this jeb said this isnt the first time this kind of situations come up nine times out of ten when an operative gets romantically involved with an informant the romance collapses as soon as the pressure of the assignment passes buddy youre setting yourself up for a fall i think from now on malones voice became severe youd better assume im not one of your operatives whatever you want thats right malone said whatever i want the debriefing began the next morning it continued into the next day until they were transferred to the aircraft carrier they had a rest while they were flown to the base in italy but as soon as a us air force c transport plane took off from there carrying them toward the united states jeb resumed the debriefing one of the armed escorts assisted him sometimes questioning malone sometimes sienna always in separate areas where they couldnt be overheard jeb and the escort sometimes changed places the idea was that the person being debriefed shouldnt get accustomed to a particular style of questioning and that one debriefer might take a question the other had already asked and rephrase it in a way that opened the memory of the person being questioned it wasnt an interrogation although the polite but insistent seemingly inexhaustible sequence of questions had aspects of one for sienna the daunting task was to reconstruct the five years of her marriage for malone there were only five weeks to account for but the more he was asked to reexamine a weariness set in that made him sympathize with how exhausted sienna with so much more to try to remember had to be feeling from the start of the debriefing malone and sienna were never allowed to meet with each other the theory was that they might compare what each had said and inadvertently contaminate each others memories making the two versions conform jeb and his associate were the only ones allowed to compare eager to find inconsistencies and use them to ask more refined questions that would perhaps open new memories after the transport plane landed at andrews air force base the group was flown by helicopter to a clearing in a wooded estate in the virginia hills there to malones displeasure he and sienna were kept apart again driven in separate cars to a low sprawling modernistic house made of metal and glass the house was smaller than bellasars its materials and design were not at all similar but he couldnt suppress the disturbing sense that little had changed that he was back where he had started the gardeners who showed no interest in gardening and who seemed out of place in late march reinforced that conviction they were guards siennas car arrived first as malone got out of his three men were already taking her through the doubledoored entrance to the house she had a chance to look back only briefly her unhappy gaze fixed on him reminding him of an anxious animal being put in a cage and then she was gone jeb was nowhere to be seen without anyone in authority to object to malone allowed himself to be taken inside the house had slate floors and beamed ceilings there were corridors to the right left and straight ahead malone had no way of telling where sienna had been put but he himself was taken to the left to a bedroom at the far end the room was spacious with institutional furnishings but what malone paid most attention to was the large single window which couldnt be opened and which was unusually thick suggesting it was bulletresistant he looked out toward a swimming pool that still had its winter cover on leafless treed hills beyond it he saw a tennis court a stable and a riding area all of which looked as if they hadnt been used in a long time he doubted that theyd be used while he and sienna were there either he saw a gardener peering up at him turning he studied what might have been a hole for a needlenose camera lens in the opposite top corner of the room his legs ached from having been on too many aircraft his head pounded from jet lag his eyes burned from lack of sleep he hadnt had a chance to talk to sienna in two days where was she what were they doing to her he kept feeling he was back on bellasars estate this is bullshit he said directing his remark to where he assumed the hidden camera and microphone were he walked to the door through which he had entered tried to open it and found it locked a number pad on the right seemed the only way to disengage the lock hey he pounded on the door whoevers out there open up no response he pounded louder open the damn door nothing fine he picked up a bedside lamp and hurled it against the window shattering the lamp but having no effect on the glass he grabbed the lamp on the other side of the bed and threw it against the mirror above the bureau protecting his face as chunks of glass flew he pulled out a dresser drawer and heaved it down through a glasstopped table in a corner he hurled a second drawer toward an overhead light fixture disintegrating it he yanked out a third drawer and was about to head toward the mirror in the bathroom when a metallic sound directed his attention toward the door someone was turning the knob the door swung open jeb stepped into view shaking his head in displeasure his suit seemed to constrict his large frame what do you think youre doing wheres sienna when were finished you can see her no ill see her now malone started past him jeb put a restraining hand on his shoulder this isnt the time get out of my way look we have procedures that need to be followed not anymore where is she chase youre making a malone pushed him aside stop malone stalked from the bedroom an armed man appeared before him holding up his hand sir youre going to have to go back to go to hell malone shoved past him sienna stop jeb repeated at the foyer a guard blocked malones way shoving him back malone pretended to lose his balance when the overconfident guard came forward to shove him again malone stiffened the fingers of his right hand and drove them into the mans diaphragm wheezing suddenly pale the man sank to his knees malone whirled and used the heel of his palm to stiffarm the other guard who rushed toward him struck in the chest the man jerked back as if yanked by a rope then slammed onto the floor malone braced himself raising his hands offensively against jeb you want some of this mr malone malone turned toward a bureaucraticlooking man in his late fifties i think we should talk the man said the man had thinning gray hair and was of average height and weight but his rigidly straight posture and commanding eyes seemingly magnified by his metalrimmed spectacles gave him a presence out of proportion to his size accompanied by two assistants he had just emerged from a room farther along the hallway the door remained open is sienna in there the man spread his hands see for yourself malone passed the first guard ignoring the injured mans attempt to stand rapidly he also passed the bureaucrat and entered the room which was an office with glass bookshelves a computer on a desk and several closedcircuit tv monitors one of which showed the wreckage in malones room he didnt find sienna in the office and he didnt see her on any of the screens ive told you what i know malone said as the man entered with his assistants followed by jeb who shut the door i didnt get involved in this to be treated like a prisoner wheres sienna i want to see her yes your file made clear you have a problem dealing with authority you want to see a problem malone picked up the computers monitor and hurled it onto the floor the screen shattered you want to see another problem youre a problem youve made your point now let me make mine why do i get the feeling were still not communicating ten minutes what you need to understand some things malone tensed studying the man suspicious youve had a long journey take a seat would you like something to eat or drink youre wasting your ten minutes my name is jeremy laster i doubt youd give me your real name but if thats how you want it fine youre jeremy laster laster sighed considering your relationship with mrs bellasar he put a slight emphasis on mrs as if he felt malone needed to be reminded i can understand why youre impatient to see her but that cant be permitted for a while how long its impossible to say thats what you think malone started toward the door lasters two assistants blocked it i still have nine minutes laster said malone debated whether to try to force his way out then told laster use them youve insisted youre not associated with us that makes it difficult to confide in you within the agency we operate on a needtoknow basis but someone on the outside laster made a gesture of futility join the agency and youll tell me whats going on is that it hardly ive seen enough to be sure we dont want you im glad we agree about something what im trying to do is make clear how unusual the circumstances are that would lead me to explain anything to you laster went over to the desk and picked up a onepage document this is a confidentiality statement it forbids you to disclose what im about to tell you the penalty for violating it is severe like an unmarked grave in the woods be serious whos joking malone took the document and read it so im supposed to sign this and then youll tell me whats going on laster handed him a pen malone impatiently used it fine now talk at last were making progress laster put the document in his briefcase and pulled out a blackandwhite photograph of the man sienna had met in istanbul it was similar to malones sketch as mr wainright told you he recognized this man tariq ahmed another blackmarket arms dealer were extremely curious about the purpose for their meeting and we think the answer involves the two men you saw at bellasars estate laster pulled out two other blackandwhite photographs thanks to your accurate sketches a team from our russian desk was able to identify them as vasili gribanov and sergei bulganin laster paused theyre specialists in biowarfare bio in the soviets established a biological weapons research and production system called biopreparat gribanov and bulganin came on board in various scientists had their specialties marburg anthrax pneumonic plague gribanov and bulganin chose smallpox malone felt cold but i thought smallpox had been destroyed eradicated from the general population yes the last known case was in but if it ever came back the world health organization decided that a small amount of the virus ought to be kept frozen for research purposes the united states has some so do the russians scientists being what they are they love to tinker gribanov and bulganin decided that smallpox in its natural form wasnt deadly enough they altered its genetic makeup to make it more aggressive but thats insane malones skin itched as if hed been infected for eight years gribanov and bulganin worked happily running their experiments and performing tests but in the soviet union collapsed and the research money stopped they found themselves out of a job so they offered their skills to another employer bellasar laster nodded as it turns out ahmed is less thorough in his security arrangements than bellasar by intensifying our electronic surveillance on his associates weve been able to learn about the meeting in istanbul it seems bellasar has no qualms about selling a biological weapon to anyone prepared to meet his price but he doesnt want to be linked directly to the weapon what hed prefer is to sell it to ahmed and then let ahmed dispose of it as he wishes thats why the meeting didnt go as smoothly as bellasar hoped ahmed figures that if hes going to take the heat for making the weapon available he wants better financial terms than bellasar is offering bellasars argument is that ahmed shouldnt be greedy that ahmeds already guaranteed a hefty profit when he sells it to whom thats one of various things were hoping mrs bellasar will tell us she doesnt know laster only stared at him malone shook his head in disgust whats the weapons delivery system microscopic powder released via aerosol containers the best method is to have an aircraft open the containers while flying over a city our experts calculate that a half dozen aerosol containers opened on a windy day could contaminate several square miles but the things uncontrollable malone said before victims start showing symptoms some of them could get on planes and fly to major cities all over the world it could cause a global epidemic not in this case laster said the weapon has a failsafe feature that prevents it from spreading beyond its target failsafe what makes the weapon so unique is that gribanov and bulganin genetically engineered the smallpox virus so it cant infect anyone unless it combines with another virus a benign but rare one why what purpose would that serve you release the benign virus first as soon as the target population is infected the lethal virus is then released but anyone who hasnt been infected with the benign virus cant be infected by the lethal one which means that even if someone whos infected with the lethal virus gets on a plane before the symptoms show up that person isnt going to start an epidemic in another country because that other population hasnt previously been exposed to the companion virus unless someone exposed to the benign virus has already traveled to that country cant happen why not the benign virus has a sixhour life span when it isnt combined with the lethal one it doesnt travel well by the time someone flew from tel aviv to rome paris or new york say it would have died anyone arriving with the lethal virus couldnt pass it on jesus this is a quantum leap in the notion of what a weapon can be laster said controlled massive destruction of human life without any destruction to property why would anybody want to develop a weapon like that jeb interrupted how the hell rich does bellasar need to be its not about money its about power malone said laster nodded so our profilers suggested but their conclusion is theoretical weve never had access to anyone who spent as much time with him as you did except for sienna she knows the mechanisms that trigger his emotions in our efforts to put him out of business no observation from his wife is too small not to be of value to us so basically the debriefing could go on forever laster spread his hands fatalistically you prick millions of lives are at stake that doesnt mean she has to be a prisoner bellasars never going to stop searching for her do you honestly believe if we let her out of here i dont care under what new identity that he wont eventually find her this is the safest place in the world for her then why wont you let me see her because if she feels as powerfully about you as you do about her the longer shes away from you the more frustrated shell become thatll give us leverage were not sure we can trust her maybe shes having second thoughts about betraying her husband maybe shes withholding crucial information but if she knows she cant see you until she convinces us she doesnt have anything more to tell us shell have greater motivation to confide in us to call you a prick is being generous malone said you want to put bellasar out of business send in a blackops team and assassinate him bomb the hell out of the place scorch it to the ground and pour salt all over it wed love to so why dont because we have to make sure the biological weapon is secure when our team moves in its going to be at the proper time and with the proper information sienna and i gave you all the information we have that remains to be determined i want to see her by all means laster pointed toward one of the closedcircuit television monitors malone walked to it and felt his pulse increase seen from the back sienna peered out a large window similar to the one in his room the image was black and white and grainy from an angle that looked down and across the room at her the lens had a fisheye distortion but nothing could obscure her beauty this evening were going to question her again about bellasars sister laster said none of us knew about her were eager for more details knock yourself out when malone returned to his room it had been restored the light fixture table and mirror replaced the broken glass removed noticing that the closet door was ajar he pulled it open and found clothes on hangers a sport coat two shirts a pair of jeans and a pair of slacks all of them in his size and all of them new yeah just like at bellasars he thought through the window the sky was becoming bleak a shower approaching leafless branches wavering in the breeze he went over and watched specks of rain hit the glass the room light was off as the sky became grayer the late afternoon felt like evening i should have made another attempt to reach her with those two guards waiting for an excuse to get even he thought one of lasters assistants had been holding something that looked suspiciously like the kind of flat black case doctors kept syringes in malone was certain that if hed made another attempt to get to sienna hed have been sedated the way bellasar had jabbed him with his ring at sothebys calm down he thought get control think this through right he thought even if he and sienna had the freedom to leave this place what were they going to do about it malone had counted on the agency to solve the problem for them but laster had as much as admitted that the agency didnt have a solution bellasar would keep coming and coming and a man with his resources would eventually find a lead in the meantime every shadow would make them flinch even on the most basic level they needed the agency to supply them with new identities and documentation how were they going to keep on the move without new credit cards drivers licenses and passports the rain pelted the window it was gloomy enough outside that malone could see his troubled reflection in the glass someone knocked on his door turning he saw it opening and noted that the hand coming into view didnt have a key he couldnt help concluding that even though a combination of numbers had to be pressed on the pad next to the door to unlock it from the inside the door could be unlocked from the outside merely by turning the knob jeb appeared looking sheepish holding a sixpack of budweiser in one hand and a bottle of jack daniels in the other peace offering you really let me down the assignment was taken from my control was it ever in your control i thought so i was wrong can i come in since when does anybody around here ask permission of the prisoners since now malone exhaled and waved him forward what would you like jeb set the whiskey and the beer on the bureau some passports would be nice jeb frowned a set of new ids just to give me the illusion theres a future jeb opened his mouth closed it thought a moment and finally said ill see what i can do i sort of hoped they were already in the works jeb avoided the subject what would you like for dinner youre the food director now just trying to make you happy next thing youll be leaving chocolates on the bed hey this is a shitty deal i admit but its like what they say about a real prison you can do easy time or hard time why dont the two of us get loaded eat a steak dinner and watch the lakers game tonight things could be worse i want to see her i know pal take me to her im sorry i really am for what its worth shes been insisting to see you too malones chest ached thats all she wants listen if the decision was up to me jeb twisted the cap off the liquor bottle but lasters determined to give her a reason to remember harder he figures if she has everything she wants why should she help us one day he and i are going to have a long talk about this the rain lanced harder against the window have you got any glasses jeb asked maybe in the bathroom thunder rumbled ill go look jeb said the next rumble shook the building the thickness of the window wasnt enough to shut out a muffled scream jeb froze on his way to the bathroom that wasnt thunder malone said christ jeb rushed toward the door and jabbed numbers on the pad when he yanked the door open malone was immediately behind him hearing a commotion down the hallway urgent footsteps frantic voices in back breached the outside a burst from an assault rifle was followed by a scream and another explosion jeb ran along the corridor yelling to malone stay here like hell malone thought then charged after him in the foyer the two guards he had struggled with earlier had drawn their pistols aiming toward the front entrance other guards raced along corridors louder gunfire a third explosion i have to find sienna malone thought in the foyer he turned toward the middle corridor where he saw laster and his two assistants rush from a room halfway along on the left lasters face was pale as he slammed the door shut behind him grabbed a guard running past and blurted questions malone whirled toward the guard he had earlier struck in the stomach give me a pistol sweat beading his forehead the guard stared toward the front entrance and didnt seem to hear him listen damn it i need a pistol go back to your room laster shouted reaching him wheres sienna an explosion shook the front doors smoke appeared at the end of the middle corridor although the exterior of the house was made of metal and glass reinforced to withstand an attack the interiors wooden walls and beams had caught on fire outside the shots intensified then suddenly the shooting wasnt outside any longer malone heard an eartorturing burst from an assault rifle rapid single shots from pistols followed the smoke worsened go back to your laster started to repeat gunfire interrupted him tell me where sienna is i dont understand how they laster spun toward an assistant get the woman the assistant stared at the smoke churning toward him and backed away get her laster repeated where is she malone demanded in the room you just left laster whirled toward the sound of an explosion outside damn you malone took a deep breath and shoved past as the smoke enveloped him it stung his eyes and blurred his vision for all he knew it was poison gas but he didnt allow himself to think about it he had to find sienna in the swirling haze he couldnt tell how far along the corridor he had gone he reached a door turned the knob and thrust inside sienna the room was free of smoke sweet air entered his lungs then smoke gusted in but not before he saw that the room was empty there werent even any sheets on the bed in the last of the unfouled air he took another deep breath and lunged back into the smokefilled corridor rushing farther sienna he shoved open the next door and found another empty room from down the hallway he thought he heard a muffled cry chase was he imagining it was he making himself hear what he wanted to hear he ran to the next door and this time when he charged in she was there before him rushing toward him coughing he wanted to slam the door behind him to prevent the smoke from spilling in but he realized that hed be locking them in that he had to keep the door open he grabbed a chair and braced it between the door and the jamb they held each other he wanted to keep his arms around her forever but as nearby gunfire made her flinch the smoke began to fill the room help me he said we need wet towels in the bathroom he filled the sink with cold water sienna grabbed two towels and plunged them in soaking them the gunfire was closer smoke reached the bathroom coughing malone pressed a dripping towel against his face although it was hard to breathe through the moisture filtered some of the smoke but that wouldnt last long he knew as sienna covered her face with the other towel they made their way toward the door he shoved the chair aside grasped siennas hand and entered the chaos of the hallway someone ran past not seeing them in the smoke shots at the end of the corridor made malone crouch forcing sienna down with him he led her to the right toward the foyer where he had been with laster and his assistants jeb where was he unable to see the floor malone almost tripped over something a body sienna made a choking sound he released her hand and stooped toward the corpse his hand touched warm sticky liquid on the unmoving chest he felt a suit and wondered if the body belonged to laster or one of his assistants he checked the bodys right hand found a pistol and shoved it under his belt he probed the inside suit pockets and found a wallet which he also grabbed the moment he shoved the wallet into his jeans he urged sienna farther along the corridor the wet towel became harder to breathe through the smoke too thick sienna coughed but malone wasnt afraid that the sound would attract attention to them there were too many other sounds shots screams racing footsteps the roar of a fire at the end of the corridor behind them he kept his shoulder against the wall then suddenly the wall was gone hed reached the foyer but the area seemed abandoned the shots screams and footsteps became eerily silent the only noise the growing whoosh of the flames behind him is everybody dead he wondered chase someone called malone spun chase the hoarse voice was jebs to the right worried that someone might be forcing jeb malone took the towel from his mouth long enough to whisper to sienna grab the back of my belt dont let go he returned the towel to his mouth not that it did much good any longer the smoke was too strong as she grabbed his belt he pulled out the pistol he had taken from the body chase jeb sounded closer at once he appeared amid the smoke his face red from coughing startled by the weapon malone pointed at him as smoke seared malones throat he could barely say get us out of here jeb tugged his arm leading him to the right outside two shots made sienna tighten her grip on malones belt abruptly jeb reached a door and opened it pulling them into a dimly lit room the area was comparatively free of smoke and as malone and sienna breathed in trying to fill their lungs jeb quickly closed the door but this is a trap malone thought how are we going to leave the building immediately he noticed concrete steps leading downward theres a utility tunnel that goes to the pool house jeb said malone didnt need to hear any more he and sienna ran down at the bottom they paused only long enough for jeb to find a light switch and flick it on a concrete corridor was lined with doors pipes passed along the ceiling interspersed with glaring bulbs as malone ran his labored breathing echoed he and sienna threw their towels into a laundry area a door banged open behind them they raced harder the corridor turned sharply to the left bringing them to an unlit segment of the tunnel it was cool damp and smelled of mold the instant malone rushed around the corner he took cover in the shadows and aimed back along the corridor at the far end footsteps clattered down the stairs four men rushed into view they held assault rifles one of them shouting check every room as the men split up malone held his fire there were too many men they were too far away he glanced toward jeb whose strained eyes seemed to be reading his thoughts jeb cocked his head toward the continuation of the tunnel as if to say our best chance is to get the hell out of here hoping that the sounds the men made would prevent them from hearing other sounds malone sienna and jeb hurried on but the farther they went from the lights at the other end of the tunnel the more darkness gathered around them they had to slow feeling ahead of themselves to make sure they didnt bump into something the steps caught malone by surprise his right shoe striking one he felt a metal rail to his left and started up only to stiffen as a furious voice in the other corridor shouted i heard something malone worked higher up the stairs sienna rushed next to him ahead jeb attempted to free something making a noise as what sounded like a lock was released that way the angry voice shouted jesus malone thought as the mens footsteps raced closer jeb yanked open a door gray light spilled in the doors hinges grated around that corner one of the men yelled silhouetted against the light in the tunnel behind them the men rounded the bend and raised their rifles malone fired hit one of them and fired again absorbing the pistols recoil while the remaining three men scrambled back around the corner one of them cursed but malone barely heard it his ears rang painfully as if someone had slammed hands against them he whirled and ran the rest of the way up the steps entering a utility room where sienna shifted a table toward him while jeb slammed the door dusky light through an opposite doorway revealed the pump filter and water heater for the swimming pool but malone paid little attention without a key they couldnt lock this door from the outside rushing he helped sienna move the table jamming it against the door a moment before a bullet walloped against it from the other side the door was metal the bullet didnt pierce it but the table wasnt heavy enough to keep three men from forcing the door open jeb hefted a large plastic container marked chlorine tablets and set it on the table malone did the same with a second container it was heavy but not enough any moment the men would ram their shoulders against the door malone hurried with jeb and sienna to a canopied area next to the pool in the dimming light rain pelted a cover stretched over the pool his pistol ready malone scanned the lawn stable tennis court and misted hills turning to the left he saw the house in flames figures in confusion around it the roar of the fire must have prevented them from hearing his shots there was no way to tell whether they were lasters men or bellasars if the latter malone couldnt risk attempting to ambush the men behind him when they charged from the pool house in the open the shots would bring more pursuers the only choice was to keep running the stable malone thought he motioned for jeb and sienna to run to the right toward a gate that led to a lane after the heat of his exertions the rain felt welcomely cool but as his wet clothes clung to his legs back and chest a shiver swept through him his shoes slipped on mud he fought for traction and ran harder the rain made the dusk gray enough that he prayed they couldnt be seen from the burning house or from the pool area the stable loomed closer they splashed through puddles reaching a door the rectangular building hadnt been used in quite a while a horse trailer was covered with cobwebs the ten stalls along each side were empty except for dusty straw and more cobwebs straining to catch his breath malone peered out the open door toward the pool area while he had time he ejected the magazine from the grip of his pistol and checked to see how many rounds were left he couldnt assume that it had been full when he picked it up the man from whom he had taken it might have fired several times before he was shot he was right the weapon a mm beretta the same type of pistol malone had used in the military could hold as many as sixteen rounds but only nine were left do you see anybody jeb asked there sienna pointed toward the rainshrouded lane where a man with a rifle hurried in their direction but i dont see the others malone immediately understood jesus theyve split up theyll be coming at us from three sides jeb pulled out a pistol there arent any doors along each side ill watch the one at the far end how can i help sienna asked we dont have another gun take cover i see one of them jeb said from the other end hes still too far away i cant get a shot at him malone stared at the man hurrying toward them along the lane abruptly the man sank behind the fence that flanked it this ones taking cover sneaking up but wheres the third one jeb asked straining for a glimpse of a target malone told sienna better get behind those hay bales but when he glanced in her direction he didnt see her he looked in another direction and saw a ladder that led to a platform above him she was halfway up what are you immediately he quit talking his attention totally focused on the gunman in the lane who suddenly appeared at an open gate and dashed through the rain to the cover of a shed malone aimed ready for him to emerge on the right or the left above amid the rain drumming on the corrugated metal roof malone heard sienna on the platform theres a window she said for god sake be careful he kept aiming im high enough that i can see him behind the shed hes her abrupt silence made malone tense hes motioning to someone on your right she said hes pointing toward the side of the building the third man must be heading toward it hes going to sneak along it on your blind side several rapid thunks at jebs end of the building sounded like bullets slamming into wood jesus are you okay malone asked i didnt hear the shots hes using a silencer jeb said a thought nagged at malone but before he could analyze the implications the man behind the shed fired three rapid shots toward the open door as malone pressed himself against the wall next to the door bullets splintered the slats of a stall behind him but he didnt hear the shots and not because of the ringing in his ears this gunman too was using a sound suppressor why the one behind the shed is looking to your right again sienna said from above toward the side of the building i get the sense that the third mans farther along it malone understood the gunman behind the shed would keep firing to distract malone while the third man crept next to the door and waited for malone to return fire the moment malone revealed his position the third man would make his move the man behind the shed just nodded sienna said theyre ready prepared for the gunman behind the shed to show himself malone pulled the trigger the instant he saw motion shooting one two three times the pistol bucking in his hands as the gunman pitched backward malone dove forward through the doorway landing in mud firing to his right toward where sienna had predicted the third gunman would be the mans face twisted in surprise unable to redirect his aim before malones bullets struck him in the chest knocking him down malone scrambled back to the cover of the building studying the men he had shot to make sure they werent moving he realized that sienna was next to him jeb was next to him also the third man took off through the woods but the ones at the house are running this way they work for laster malone said how do you know the thought that had nagged at malone became clear the men i shot wouldnt have used sound suppressors unless they didnt want the men at the house to hear them lasters men managed to fight off the attack yes jeb said i see laster go out and tell him were safe malone said youre not coming with me sienna and i need a minute by ourselves jeb hesitated massaging his left thigh where hed been shot the night malone had saved his life in panama city sure he hesitated longer youve earned it he stepped into the dusky rain heading toward the rapidly approaching men who were outlined by the smoke of the burning house watching jeb walk away malone led sienna deeper into the stable they had their chance they cant protect us your husband couldnt have found us this fast unless he has an informant in the agency siennas eyes darkened at the thought of bellasar hell learn about every other place the agency tries to hide us the only way well be safe is on our own where we wont be in prison where nobodyll keep us apart i dont want to be separated from you ever again she said malone took her hand leading her toward the back door the cold rain lessened to a drizzle as they ran out toward murky trees in a few minutes it would be too dark for laster and his men to see to follow maybe we can circle around to the front and steal a car malone thought or maybe we can vague possibilities encouraged him he had the wallet from the dead man in the house he had money credit cards a new identity he knew that laster would eventually figure out whose identity he was using bellasars spy would pass the word but that was a problem to be worried about tomorrow for now the two of them were free vanishing into the mistshrouded woods eight the hypnotic clackclackclack of the trains wheels reinforced malones exhaustion he and sienna slumped next to each other in a locked compartment barely noticing the lights of towns that flashed past it was almost midnight they had boarded the train an hour earlier at washington dcs union station where they had driven after malone had followed his first impulse and stolen a car from the front of the burning house while laster and his men searched the woods hoping to conceal his trail malone had left the car in a restaurants parking lot and taken a taxi to the train station there he had used the credit card in the dead mans wallet to buy two tickets to dallas despite the rain the burned house wouldnt have cooled enough for lasters men to search it they wouldnt find the body for quite a while even then there was a good chance the fire had so charred the corpses clothes that no one would realize the wallet was missing when the creditcard charges persisted after the mans death laster would understand what had happened but by then it would be too late meanwhile malone and sienna were together that was all he cared about hungry sienna looked at the bag of sandwiches theyd bought she shook her head no tell me what were going to do it depends on your expectations were not going to be able to live the way you did on your husbands estate i wouldnt want to i dont mean the tension you went through im talking about the absence of luxury ive got plenty of money in various places but i cant think of a way to get to it without letting your husband or the cia know where we are theyll have computer experts watching for any transactions in my accounts the instant i order a wire transfer to a bank in dallas say theyll be after us the airport the train station the carrental agencies theyll all be watched you make it sound hopeless even in her damp rumpled blazer her hair combed with her hands sienna somehow managed to look more beautiful than ever how do i hide one of the most striking women in the world he thought i promise there is a way out of this but its going to be a lot less firstclass than youre used to is that why were going to dallas were not going there but our tickets were getting off before then at a town called braddock in case derek finds out we took the train and hes waiting for us in dallas malone nodded and because theres someone i have to meet in braddock the texas sky was cobalt blue as they stepped from the train and studied the small depot and waiting area beyond were low buildings a gas station next to a carrepair shop a hardware store next to a bar a few trucks moved along the street otherwise the town seemed deserted a place this small its a wonder it has its own train station sienna said clints got the influence to make sure he gets what he wants youre telling me people other than actors actually have names like clint chase ol pal its been too damn long a mans voice said in the deepest twangiest drawl sienna had ever heard she turned toward the open door to the waiting room from which a man in cowboy boots jeans with a belt buckle shaped like a saddle a denim shirt a leather vest and a cowboy hat stepped grinning into view embracing malone slapping his back why didnt you let me send the jet to pick you up the man asked and how come you phoned collect all the money i paid you over the years you cant be short of cash sort of the man looked puzzled a long story well i hope youll be stayin long enough for me to hear it still smiling the man turned expectantly toward sienna and what a lovely lady youve brought along clint this is my friend beatrice beatrice i want you to meet clint braddock im one of chases biggest fans braddocks smile was even broader sienna was tall enough that she wasnt used to looking up at most men but for braddock she had to tilt her head back to look him in the eyes his cowboy hat made him seem even taller he had grainy tan skin and a bushy saltandpepper zapatastyle mustache clint you did what i asked right malones tone was serious you didnt tell anybody about my phone call you didnt let anybody know i was coming hey this is me compadre remember when have i ever let you down youre the man what you say goes malone visibly relaxed but whats goin on when i offered to send the jet you said you couldnt go near an airport i couldnt help wonderin if youre in trouble youre not far wrong wheres your car i dont want to stand around in the open around the corner pard wherere your bags we dont have any the wrinkles around braddocks eyes deepened yeah youre in trouble all right at the side of the depot they reached an almost empty gravel parking lot the prominent vehicle in which was a gleaming red pickup truck with fence posts in the back as braddock got in the drivers side malone guided sienna toward the passenger door whispering to her dont let the drawl and the getup fool you clints real first name is peter he was born and raised in philadelphia what they got into the truck clint i was just explaining to my friend that you saw a lot of westerns when you were a kid and grew up to earn the bucks to live em braddock smiled see a movie be a movie bucks is right sienna thought watching the grassland stretch away every mile or so a shade tree punctuated the view but otherwise there was only sky and land and cattle plenty of cattle and then an oil pump then another and another until hundreds cluttered the landscape their armatures bobbing up and down braddock had been driving for a half hour before they got to a sprawling twoandahalfstory white house with a porch that went along almost the entire front it made sienna think shed seen it before then she realized she had recognize it braddock asked wasnt this in that james dean movie giant she asked in amazement sort of braddock said the real house is south of here on somebody elses spread its not even a real house its just a shell they built for exteriors and then let fall apart when they were done with the movie so i had this replica built they drove through an arched entrance that had the word riata written across it the same name as the ranch in giant with all your interest in the west malone said i never understood why you collected me instead of remington or another western painter variety and all the time i thought it was my genius i didnt want you to get a swelled head braddock chuckled the truth is little lady the first time i saw chases work i knew i had to own it sienna understood after they parked on the curved driveway in front of the house then crossed the lawn and the echoing porch to go inside braddock stayed outside to give instructions to one of his ranch hands then joined them enjoying the way sienna admired the paintings on the walls there were at least twenty all landscapes all vibrant with color she saw chases signature on the bottom of several and turned toward him in surprise how many of these are yours braddock answered for him all of them ive got some in the dining room too how come youre surprised its just well the only work of chases ive seen was a portrait of me and some sketches of me and she looked at him in amazement i had no idea what your real work was like the portrait of you was the best thing ive ever done chase said braddock straightened is it for sale im afraid that cant be arranged moneys no object it isnt with the man who owns it either plus there are malone hesitated personal reasons for him to want to keep it ive never seen paintings that make me feel so many other senses i can almost smell the dew on the grass sienna said you should have been an art critic dont joke hes not braddock said you got the point right off chases paintings celebrate life youd be a better art critic than those sobs who dont know pretension from piss sienna laughed the two of you had breakfast braddock asked no why dont i tell the cook to fix you somethin siennas stomach rumbled she laughed again but i warn you braddock said my cooks not one of those nambypambies who worries all day about how much cholesterols in his menus hell give you good honest bacon and eggs hash browns and pancakes or a breakfast burrito with salsa and refried beans sounds wonderful sienna said meantime the biggest guest bedrooms to the left at the top of the stairs the two of you go get yourselves cleaned up the closet has extra clothes in various sizes i like to keep spares for my guests im bettin youll find this or that to fit you thanks sienna said then well get down to business braddock directed his gaze firmly at chase and find out what kind of trouble youre in sienna bit into a chunk of burrito stuffed with eggs rice beans and sausage great especially the sausage ive never tasted anything like it chorizo its mexican braddock said not too hot for you i cant get enough of it she spooned more green chili over the burrito yeah youve got fiery skin a lady after my own heart malone raised his spoon from a bowl of refried beans topped with red chili and melted cheese what i need he said is a patron braddock set down his coffee and waited for him to continue somebody to subsidize me what are you talkin about somebody to buy my paintings in advance braddock narrowed his grizzled eyebrows you need cash that bad things are a little tight after everything i bought from you braddock pointed toward the dining room wall across from him where there were three other of malones paintings over the years i mustve paid what six million what on gods earth did you do with the money i still have it but i cant get to it as soon as i try someone whos looking for us will know where we are braddock squinted at sienna then back at malone somebody like a husband malone spread his hands braddocks bushy eyebrows narrowed more severely then his head started to bob he laughed shoot boy why didnt you just say so twenty years ago i had a situation along husband lines myself i always had a suspicion you and i were alike you want some travelinaround money while he cools off is that what youre askin maybe more than just travelingaround money hes not going to cool off for quite a while in fact i dont think hes ever going to cool off braddock studied sienna for several seconds then nodded pensively yeah i can see why this husband you cant use offshore accounts to dodge him i wouldnt dare try malone said and id never risk getting a friend to do it for me but isnt that what youre doin right now askin a friend to pay me in advance for paintings ill deliver assumin you live to complete em braddock said sienna felt the color drain from her face its that serious right braddock asked your husbands a player yes who doesnt believe in rules yes braddock thought a moment then whistled to himself low and pensively how much do you need a million dollars braddock didnt even blink in cash hundreds malone said exactly what am i gonna get for this lavish amount ten paintings ten thats a hundred thousand apiece i never paid less than two hundred thousand for any of your work call it a fire sale if word gets around if you do this with any of your other collectors youll drive down the market youre the only one i approached malone said the only one ill ever approach where do you figure to hide you dont want to know braddock thought about it youre right and you dont want me to know either in case somebody comes around sienna broke her silence how can we be sure someone wont she looked at malone one of your biggest collectors isnt it logical that my husband will make the connection and wonder if we asked for help nobody knows im one of chases biggest collectors braddock said one of the reasons im successful is i dont let people know my business then youll do it malone asked braddock thought about it with a condition name it one of the works has to be of braddock looked at sienna i assume your real name isnt beatrice no she sounded apologetic id like one of the paintings to be of you dont worry malone smiled in a way she is beatrice from now on ill be doing a lot of paintings of her thank you sienna kissed braddocks cheek it was ten the next morning the sky was bright the breeze smelled fresh malone sienna and braddock stood on the front porch he rubbed his skin where shed kissed him then blushed shoot thats almost fairenough payment for what i gave you malone held the money in a brown suitcase that braddock had supplied ten thousand onehundreddollar bills took up less room than malone had expected and weighed less only about twenty pounds to fill out the suitcase braddock had added some denim shirts and jeans in malones size siennas suitcase contained similar basic articles of clothing as soon as we settle somewhere ill get to work malone said in a month or two youll start receiving paintings no rush whenever inspiration strikes ive got plenty of that malone smiled at sienna by the way clint wherever i ship the paintings from wont be where were staying i figured im also figurin i wont see you for a while malone shrugged maybe a long while malone looked away be careful my friend braddock said believe me im going to try a silent moment lengthened i guess wed better get moving malone finally said his mouth was dry from emotion he shook hands with braddock firmly as he and sienna got into the car his chest ached with the regret of severing this connection its a good thing i dont have close family he thought id need to sever those connections too then he realized he was wrong he did have close family he studied sienna as she got into the car wishing he had the time to sketch how she looked this morning it wasnt just that the white blouse braddock had found for her brought out the quality of her skin and the luster in her hair it was something deeper something that he knew he would never stop wanting to draw the car was an eightyearold ford explorer that braddock had bought from one of his ranch hands for more money than the man had ever seen at one time in his life it had a dented front fender and spewed foul black smoke but it would get them where they needed to go the wallet malone had taken from the dead man contained id for dale perry in abilene malone used it to get a texas drivers license in perrys name he registered the explorer in perrys name they headed west yuma arizona malone had been there twelve years earlier on a military training exercise at the marine corps air station on the edge of town during the summer the city was small about fifty thousand people but during the winter the population doubled the areas sunny climate and the colorado river attracting snowbirds from the north most of whom stayed in trailer parks at the end of march the city was still booming malone and sienna rented a selfstorage unit and stuffed it with old tables and bureaus the furniture in such poor condition that anyone who broke in would curse and go on to other targets in back was an old chest in which malone hid the suitcase containing the million dollars he locked the pulldown metal door gave sienna one key and pocketed the other with the twenty thousand dollars they kept they went to various banks avoiding attention by never exchanging more than two thousand at any one place where they were going twenty thousand in pesos would last them quite a while they loaded up on things they might need then headed south reaching the mexican border in forty minutes the crossing was at a city called san luis where the mexican guards barely looked at the explorer it was the same casual attitude malone recalled from when he had crossed the border years earlier while on leave from military exercises in yuma normally visitors driving a vehicle into mexico needed a tourist card and a temporary vehicle import permit but malones destination was part of an area called the sonoran free trade zone and such documents werent necessary the length of visits was unrestricted even if these guards had decided to stop and search the explorer malone wouldnt have cared he had nothing incriminating the handgun he had taken from dale perrys body was down a sewer in yuma the city gave way to small farms then the farms became sporadic until there was only sand and tufts of grass smell it malone asked what the gulf of california separated mainland mexico from its western peninsula baja california in his youth malone had been surprised to learn how close the pacific ocean was to southern arizona less than two hours away and had never forgotten driving down to it the moist air the salt smell we ought to have a glimpse of the sea over the next rise instead they faced a military roadblock sienna tensed take it easy malone said theyre looking for drugs smuggled in by boat theyre interested in vehicles coming from the sea not toward it each side of the barricade had three armed soldiers on the opposite side of the road a battered pickup truck was being searched the officer in charge a mustached leanfaced captain watched from behind mirrored sunglasses sienna wore sunglasses also a droopy straw hat no makeup shed done everything practical to conceal her features without being conspicuous about it nonetheless malone worried that the guards would sense how attractive she was and want to take a look his worry turned out to be groundless the soldiers were so interested in what was going on with the pickup truck that they waved him on looking in the rearview mirror malone saw the captain watching the explorer drive away there he told sienna no problem i see it sienna pointed to the right where a distant sheet of blue glinted from reflected sunlight the road paralleled the water gradually narrowing the space between in a couple of miles buildings appeared then palm trees the outskirts of a town malone drove past a convenience store and a carrepair shop a sandcolored twostory house had a redtiled roof the house beside it was made from cinder blocks next came a refuselittered lot and after that a shack that was the pattern expensive houses next to poor ones in a seaside community that didnt have the pretensions of a beach resort farther into town the pavement ended the wide road turning to sand on the right was an open square with benches underneath shade trees flanked by a police station and a small grocery store on the left past a chainlink fence was a row of oneroom school buildings each well maintained the grounds immaculate as were the children playing at recess this is santa clara malone said its a fishing village that got discovered by americans with motor homes who were looking for a place to take cheap vacations so many americans come and go down here we wont look out of place in fact as long as we stay to ourselves and contribute to the local economy well be welcome staying to ourselves is definitely what i want to do a few streets veered to the left but most led to the right toward palm trees and clapboard bars and restaurants along the sea malone ignored these turnoffs driving straight ahead passing a row of rv parks finally stopping when there were no further buildings only sand and the sea this is the end of the road he said so were going to drive back to town and find a place to stay sienna asked not exactly why dont we get out and stretch our legs baffled sienna followed him across the sand until they reached where the waves lapped at their shoes seagulls glided overhead in the distance the specks of low motorized fishing boats bobbed in the water the sun was hot the sky as blue as the sea malone savored the salt smell god i love living near water for a moment he was reminded of what bellasar had done to his home on cozumel he calmed himself up this far near the tip of the gulf were close to baja california if you look real hard you can see the opposite shore its kind of hazy today but you should be able to see the rocky cliffs theyre about five miles away farther south the gulfs a lot wider as much as a hundred miles malone pivoted to study the northern shoreline where pickup trucks hooked cables to fishing boats and pulled them onto the sand the towns bigger than when i was here twelve years ago two of those rv parks werent here or that restaurant with the outdoor dining area but thats to be expected what he hadnt expected was that the seaside part of town would look rundown sun shelters made of poles supporting palm fronds had toppled as had a concrete retaining wall chainlink fences leaned carports had collapsed what on earth had happened then he realized they had a hurricane last year i remember how powerful the newspapers said it was theyre still digging out from the wreckage i imagine itll take a while but sienna didnt look anywhere he pointed she just stared at him what do you mean were not going back into town to find a place to stay were going somewhere else didnt you say this was the end of the road yes then malone hesitated hed prepared her for everything except this we agreed that the only way to get away from your husband and laster is to go to the end of the earth and pull the edges in after us she nodded down here american drifters are part of the economy if somebody wonders where you came from you can tell whatever lie you want and nobodyll think twice or be the wiser the locals dont care where your money comes from and they dont ask for social security numbers but just to be extra safe malone turned toward the southern shore and the widening gulf i wonder if there isnt an even better edge of the world when i was here the last time a villager was renting out dune buggies one of my buddies and i drove along this shore theres nothing for fifteen miles then just before the beach runs out theres a fishing camp you mean a village smaller maybe a dozen trailers its simple the scenerys spectacular the people who live there are loners therell be no one to account to or to bother us for a moment the only sound was the distant drone of a motorboat thats where youd like to go sienna asked malone couldnt decide if her tone was dismay its as perfect a place to disappear as i can think of then well figure out our next move she seemed lost its not forever a man in your husbands line of work theres a good chance the authorities or one of his competitors will get to him we just have to survive long enough for that to happen surviving is dereks specialty a sober moment lengthened sienna looked at him looked at the sea looked east past the sand dunes whats on that hill a lighthouse the locals told me it was abandoned can we climb to it of course but itll take us the rest of the day to get there and back not today it was malones turn to look puzzled later she said after we get settled youre willing to stay my lifes been too complicated for a very long time i kept telling myself i had to simplify she took his hand it wont be like were hermits malone squeezed her fingers if we want some nightlife we can go into town the last time i was here the restaurants were good the town has fiestas people do come here for vacations after all lets try it if it doesnt work out well find somewhere else the fourwheeldrive explorer had no trouble on the hardpacked sand with the windows open and the breeze ruffling her hair sienna smiled as they drove along the unmarked beach i feel like were the first ones to do this lewis and clark she chuckled captain kirk where no one has gone before to keep the tires from digging into the sand they didnt drive faster than twenty miles an hour the slow smooth almost hypnotic ride took forty minutes before they came around a final dune and stopped where a rocky outcrop blocked the way farther south the camp didnt look the way malone remembered it the dozen or so trailers he had seen twelve years earlier had been reduced to two one of which was tilted partially buried by sand the other had an awning extending from it a fishing net hung on a wall faded shorts jeans and other laundry dangling from it in front a charfilled fire pit was surrounded by blackened rocks a motorboat had been hauled up onto the beach a sunwizened mexican man worked on its engine while two children stopped scampering in the waves and looked warily toward malone and sienna as they got out of the explorer a pensive woman appeared in the trailers doorway assessing the new arrivals malone gestured reassuringly to her and walked with sienna to the motorboat the mans face was so suncreased he might have been anywhere from forty to sixty his hands were gnarled from years of working with fishing lines the logo on his baseball hat had faded so much it was impossible to read in spanish malone introduced themselves as dale and beatrice perry he offered his hand the man looked suspiciously at it then shook it his calluses palpable his name was fernando he said the last time i came here twelve years ago there were more people malone said what happened malone listened then told sienna he says the hurricane last summer was very bad the americans with trailers got away before it arrived they never came back it killed one fisherman and scared the others enough to leave they never came back either the hurricane season will soon start again the other fishermen dont want to be around when it does so weve pretty much got the place to ourselves yes better than we hoped malone turned toward fernando my wife and i were thinking about camping here for a while would you object fernando seemed pleased that malone had used usted the formal word for you people could come and go as they liked he said but we want to be good neighbors maybe you could use some help with the boat maybe we could contribute something in exchange for being here malone reached into his shirt pocket and removed a pack of cigarettes although he didnt smoke he knew they could be handy as gifts as fernando smoked one they discussed the weather the boat and other seemingly casual subjects when fernando finished the cigarette he pinched off the end and pocketed the remnant of tobacco pointing toward the tilted trailer partially buried in the sand he explained something what did he tell you sienna asked that the trailer isnt as damaged as it looks he says that with the fourwheeldrive vehicle we have we can pull the trailer upright repair it and live in it gracias she told fernando it was as near to paradise as malone had ever come swimming sailing fishing hiking or merely lying in a hammock reading but most of all it was painting trying to capture something in siennas eyes that had become his single goal to depict beatrice indeed sometimes fernandos tenyearold boy came over and looked spellbound at malones images of her would you like to learn to do this the boy nodded solemnly one lesson turned into several the boy went around with a sketch pad drawing everything he saw as if hed discovered magic at night as malone and sienna lay in bed together she whispered you have a way with children with one child anyhow he joked be serious its a nice thing youre doing well hes a good kid but what youre teaching him isnt simple you know how to get a child to listen youd make a good father make a wait a minute are you telling me you want to have a child the thought crossed my mind with all the trouble were in i didnt say right now but if we werent in trouble how would you feel about having a child with you yes if it would make you happy happier in the night they held each other not doing anything else just holding at his table on the châteaus terrace his coffee and croissant untasted potter listened to the roar of the machine gun his face felt tight his eyes were gritty to be expected after all the machine gun had wakened him before dawn as it had on the previous morning and the morning before that on occasion it was interrupted by explosions and handgun fire but mostly it was the machine gun all day every day potters nerves werent the only ones affected the guards looked on edge interrupting their patrols to stare toward the shooting range and frown at one another potter didnt understand how dereks body his hands arms and shoulders could withstand the relentless punishment he subjected them to the machine gun itself couldnt sustain it derek had already broken one tripod destroyed two feeding mechanisms and burned out a dozen barrels in contrast dereks body showed no signs of wearing down his fury so great that only if he didnt vent it would he suffer physically dereks emotions were another matter potter had never seen him so distraught from the day sienna had escaped with malone derek had been unable to concentrate on anything except revenge important business matters went unattended he haunted the weaponstesting range firing every weapon he could get his hands on reducing the mock village to rubble ordering his men to rebuild it then reducing it to rubble again not a wall or a house remaining when overuse broke the weapons he screamed at his engineers to design them better and to bring him others to test when he tired of firearms he changed to grenades and rocket launchers the enraged expression on his face demonstrating the schemes of revenge he imagined potter finally couldnt bear it he rose from the table and made his way along a path to the testing range he saw derek bent over the machine gun cursing as he yanked at its firing mechanism but couldnt get it to eject a jammed shell derek wore earplugs so he didnt know potter was in the area until potter stepped in front of him rage swelled dereks body giving him an even more imposing presence than usual his huge eyes were dark with fury have you found them no were still looking you have to stop this derek youre due in miami tomorrow find them damn it derek freed the jammed cartridge and fired at a mannequin that moved along a track blowing it to pieces find them the restaurant was called el delfin the dolphin it was a couple of blocks from the beach on a sandy street a dingy onestory building with an orange shingled roof and an air conditioner braced in a window an utterly unassuming place with the exception that it served the best food in santa clara at dusk malone and sienna opened the restaurants screen door and stepped onto the faded linoleum floor for a moment all the tables seemed occupied then malone noticed an empty one in back on the righthand side he noticed something else a mexican military captain talking with three male civilians the captain had a lean sallow mustached face that reminded malone of a hawk he had a pair of mirrored sunglasses folded hanging from a shirt pocket by one of the bows behind you sienna said as she and malone sat across from each other yes malone said the officer from the roadblock no big deal everybodys got to eat when the waitress came they each ordered a beer then studied the wrinkled singlesheet menu malone reached across the table and grasped her hand hungry famished this shrimp dish sounds good i recommend it a voice said they turned the captain stood next to their table then ill have it malone said captain ramirez the man smiled pleasantly as he held out his hand malone shook it dale perry beatrice perry sienna shook his hand a pleasure malone noticed that ramirez looked to see if she wore a wedding ring they had bought two before they left yuma i apologize for interrupting but i like to say hello to our visitors from the united states it gives me a chance to practice my english which is very good ramirez made a modest gesture would you care to join us malone asked perhaps for a minute or two una otra cerveza ramirez told the waitress then pulled out a chair and sat next to malone are you enjoying your visit very much you dont find it a little hot this time of year most of your countrymen have left by now actually we like it hot malone said you must have fire in your blood only when i was a teenager yes to be a teenager again ramirez chuckled mrs perry most of the americans who come down here are retired its rare to see a woman from the north whos so young he paused and so beautiful she looked uncomfortable thank you youre obviously too young to have retired perhaps you won the lottery dont we wish dale was a commercial artist in abilene texas the practiced story accounted for their texas car plate and drivers license but a couple of months ago the company went out of business unfortunate ramirez said dale always wanted to be a painter when the company folded i told him it was gods way of urging him to follow his heart we took our life savings and drove across the southwest stopping when dale saw something he wanted to paint eventually we headed down here youre an understanding woman to go along with your husbands dreams all i want is what makes him happy im sure you do what make him happy the waitress brought the beers as ramirez picked his up an anxious soldier entered the restaurant and motioned for ramirez to step outside ramirez nodded then turned to sienna as you can see i must leave nice chatting with you malone said but ramirez kept his eyes totally on sienna the pleasure was mine nos vemos as ramirez walked to the door sienna asked what did he just say well see each other the screen door banged shut behind ramirez and the soldier everybody in the place had been watching the conversation now they went back to their meals sienna leaned close to malone pretending to murmur endearments i think im going to be sick take a deep breath all the while he was sitting there i was sure i was going to throw up a film of sweat slicked her face did it show what the hell was he doing she kept her voice down afraid shed be overheard i have no idea doing his best to look relaxed malone took a long swallow of beer and wished it were stronger at least he didnt ask to see your id which means he cant have been that interested in us maybe he just felt like jerking some gringos chains but he certainly had a lot of questions he knows almost as much as if he had looked at my id youre not reassuring me sienna said im not reassuring myself im not kidding im sick lets get out of here we cant what suppose he sees us come out hell wonder why he upset us so much that we didnt stay for dinner jesus we dont have a choice malone said when the waitress returned they ordered the shrimp malone gave sienna credit she did what was necessary and ate what was on her plate on the way back to the trailer she had to get out and throw up she didnt sleep lying in the darkness she stared at the ceiling and hoped that the lapping of the waves would soothe her but the calm they usually gave wouldnt come maybe ramirez was just practicing his english she tried to assure herself the area depends on tourism after all why would he bother two of the few visitors still remaining in town it doesnt make sense he was just being friendly sure she thought but she couldnt shake the apprehension that what had happened at the restaurant was the same as what had happened at every fashion show and modeling assignment shed ever been a part of at every party at every it didnt matter that she hadnt worn makeup that she hadnt taken off her hat and that she had kept her gaze downward ramirez had come over to their table because of her looks we have to get out of here she told chase in the morning the haggardness around her eyes showed how little shed slept yet she didnt look as plain as she wanted to be outside as they loaded the explorer the sound of an approaching engine made her turn at first she thought it was a motorboat but as she scanned the waves movement farther along caught her attention not on the water on the shore a military jeep its top was down showing that the only person in it was the driver her muscles compacted when she saw twin glints of light reflecting off mirrored sunglasses as ramirez parked next to the trailer fernandos wife urged her children into their trailer her panicked reaction gave ramirez a look of satisfaction as he got out of his vehicle and straightened his sunglasses his uniform was pressed stiffly emphasizing his taut stomach and rigid back his pistol was prominent on his right side unsmiling he approached the trailer good morning buenos dias malone said trying to sound friendly please in english the contrast between ramirezs polite words and his stern expression was vivid i so enjoyed our conversation yesterday evening that i regretted having to leave i decided to pay you a visit malone spread his hands in a welcoming gesture you werent easy to find ramirez concentrated on sienna malone imagined the effect she had on him without the hat she had worn in the restaurant her beauty was striking despite her restless sleep her skin had a smoldering quality you so impressed me with the sacrifice youre willing to make for your husbands artistic career i thought id come and see his paintings ramirez said theyre not as good as id like malone said but nonsense im sure youre being too critical ramirez turned toward a canvas leaning against the explorer where malone had been about to load it getting ready to leave a day trip up the coast theres an area i want to paint but you said you did landscapes this is a painting of your wife every once in a while i do one of her ive never seen anything so beautiful from the curve of siennas hips waist and breasts in the portrait he turned toward the real thing im surprised you dont live in town mrs perry arent you lonely down here dale says he doesnt want to be distracted i should think you would distract him we enjoy the peace and quiet and to tell the truth malone said were trying to save money in santa clara wed have to pay rent ramirez kept his attention on sienna what do you do for amusement mrs perry she looked more puzzled swim read go sailing and thats enough in abilene we were always worried about dales job then the worst happened and we didnt have to worry anymore a simple life has been very satisfying to make up for my early departure last evening id like you to be my guest for dinner certainly dale and i would be honored actually the invitation was only for ramirez aimed his mirrored sunglasses at malone may i see your tourist card tourist card malone looked baffled but we dont need one here santa claras part of the sonoran free trade zone thats correct but this isnt santa clara you dont live in the free trade zone your tourist card please ramirez held out his hand we dont have one that presents a problem ramirez said it certainly does wed better drive back to the border and pick one up that wont be necessary but you just said i have business at the border ill obtain a tourist card for you malone frowned but dont they have to be picked up in person ill see that an exception is made thats very generous not at all ramirez stared again at sienna itll give me a chance to visit again but i have to verify your names the immigration officer i obtain the card from will need to be assured of your identities may i see your drivers license mr perry of course malone pulled out his wallet and handed over the license ramirez looked at the photograph of malone that the texas clerk had laminated onto the license he read the name dale perry an excellent likeness he put the license in his shirt pocket wait a minute why are you i need to keep this so i can present it as corroboration when i get the tourist card but its strictly a formality ill return it as soon as possible you werent planning to drive out of the area were you no then you wont be needing it he wants me sienna said yes numb they watched ramirez drive along the shore toward santa clara hell run dale perrys name through the computer to see if theres anything he can use against me sienna found it impossible to take her gaze from the receding jeep to demand sex from me yes by now whoever perry worked for knows his wallet is missing either my husband or laster will have computer specialists checking for anybody who tries to use perrys credit cards or his social security number yes well soon have company as ramirezs jeep disappeared into the heat haze sienna was finally released from staring at it her mouth was dry so what in gods name are we going to do you said it earlier leave but how theres only one road to the border theres a roadblock ramirez will have his men watching for us chase turned to the south toward the rocky bluff where the beach ended i wasnt thinking of the road you want to go around that and walk to the next town she referred to puerto peñasco a hundred miles to the south that would take days in this heat we might not make it besides by then ramirez would have figured out what we were doing hed have soldiers waiting when we got there i wasnt thinking of walking then chase stared toward the gulf with a tingle she understood when fernando comes back from fishing ill pay him to take us down to puerto peñasco chase said well be there in a couple of hours ramirez wont have time to get back here by then and realize what were doing well find an american a hardluck story and a couple of hundred dollars ought to get us a ride to the states but what about fernando ramirez will suspect he helped us well be putting fernando in danger not if fernando claims i made him do it in fact ive got a better idea well pay him to let us have the boat hell tell ramirez we stole it and ask a friend to take him down to puerto peñasco to get it back they studied each other we dont have a choice siennas voice was unsteady its going to be okay chase held her by tonight well be back in the states well take a bus to yuma get our money out of the storage locker and find another place as good as this she held him tighter wanting to believe him there are other places at the edge of the earth chase said by tonight this will have been just another nightmare we put behind us sure dont sound so low i promise well get out of this he kissed her his affection flowing into her come on lets hurry and pack so were ready when fernando returns we dont want to waste time time she thought they left most of their things putting only essential toiletries and a change of clothes in their knapsacks sienna set them against the kitchen door she couldnt repress her wistful feelings as she peered back at the trailer it had been their home they split the pesos they had remaining sixteen thousand dollars worth sienna shoved some into the jeans she had put on in place of her shorts she stuffed most of it into her knapsack chase stuffed his half into the front pockets of a khaki fishermans jacket that he had worn on the days he had gone out with fernando on his boat any sign of him sienna asked not yet its three oclock isnt he usually back by now fernando says the early hours are best for fishing then where is he having a better day than we are relax it wont be long but three oclock became four then five as the sun began its descent sienna fidgeted ramirez will be back here soon or someone from my husband or maybe fernando had an accident if he doesnt hurry were going to have an accident she kept staring toward the northern shore expecting a military jeep to appear six oclock seven the sun hung lower smoke made her glance toward fernandos trailer where his wife prepared a meal in the charcoal pit afraid of the military she had remained inside for a long time after ramirez had left when she finally came out she had stopped her children from approaching the trailer and had cast suspicious glances toward it she thinks we brought trouble chase said were about to bring more i hear an engine a motorboat appeared getting larger fernando working the rudder thank god sienna said they ran to the beach as fernando steered into shore chase waded in to help him dragging the boat onto the sand by now sienna had learned enough spanish that she understood when chase told him we were worried about you but fernandos reply was too rapid and she needed chase to explain that fernando had been delayed because of a meeting in santa clara with the company to which he sold his fish as fernando set an anchor to keep the boat from floating away during high tide he frowned toward his somber wife who approached from the shelter whats wrong he asked in spanish fernando frowned harder when his wife described the visit from the military fernandos confusion became dismay when chase explained that he and sienna wanted to rent his boat take it down to puerto peñasco and leave it there for him to retrieve no fernandos wife held up her hands ill give you five hundred dollars chase said no seven hundred no the woman tugged fernando toward their trailer a thousand it was probably more money than fernando had ever seen at one time he blurted something before his wife hustled him inside he says hell try to talk to her chase told sienna hed better do more than try sienna stared again toward the northern shore although the sunset was less brilliant there was still enough light to see if any vehicles were coming if he doesnt want to rent it to us well take the damned thing i wont spend the night here ill tempt them with more cash malone said give it all to them just so we get out of here they crossed the sand to the trailer from outside they heard fernando and his wife arguing when chase knocked on the door the wife shouted go away but chase opened the door anyhow and stepped in noticing the frightened looks of the children translate for me sienna said she tried to explain how afraid she was that her husband would find her the wife put her hands over her ears to hell with her sienna said distract them while i get the knapsacks and put them in the boat she hurried outside clouds obscured the sunset as she ran to their trailer yanked open the screen door and reached for the knapsacks a hand shot from the shadows grabbing her arm good evening mrs perry ramirez dragged her into the gloom of the trailer as tight as his hand was on her arm she felt a greater tightness in her throat a sensation of being strangled or should i call you mrs bellasar what are you talking about she managed to say her voice hoarse facing her ramirez twisted her arm behind her back making her wince he drew her close to him you dont need to be afraid i havent told anybody about you he pressed her against him i did a computer search i learned your real names i learned that the cia is looking for you but dont worry i broke contact your secret is mine he put his other arm around her but what is the secret why is the cia looking for you what would you do to reward me for not reporting that id found you he brought his mouth toward hers she turned away and struggled he redirected his mouth trying to reach her lips when she pulled her head back he squeezed her tighter she stomped on his boot he hit her for a moment she saw blackness then he hit her again and suddenly she was on the floor through blurred vision she saw him reach back his boot to kick her and for a frenzied moment she thought he was derek that she was back in the hotel room in istanbul that derek was kicking her and something slammed a figure rushed past as her mind stopped spinning she realized that the noise was the trailers door that the figure was chase that he had collided with ramirez and knocked him onto the kitchen table when the table collapsed toppling them onto the floor sienna looked desperately around hoping to find something she could use to hit ramirez in the gloom chase and ramirez were indistinguishable rolling one way then another striking each other one of them groaned their breathing was forced they struggled to their feet and slammed against the kitchen counter a pot clattered into the sink a dish smashed onto the floor someone lurched back from a blow to the face and punched the other mans stomach the second man staggered back at once the man straightened his silhouette clear against the twilight at the kitchen window he raised his right hand something was in it a pistol ramirez sienna opened her mouth to shout a warning too late the gunshot was deafening ears ringing sienna could barely hear herself scream the bullet shattered a window chase struggled with ramirezs gun arm trying to wrench the weapon away as the pistol went off again its muzzle flash almost blinding in the gloom her ears in greater pain sienna felt the bullet pass her but all she cared about was squirming to the broken table and groping for one of its legs the wide end had splintered forming a spear tip she plunged it into ramirezs back he screamed the two men lost their balance the pistol went off a third time as they fell to the floor sienna grabbed another table leg raising it to bash it across ramirezs head but away from the twilight at the window she couldnt tell which man was ramirez chase where are you here she slammed the club against ramirezs head so hard that the weapon split in half she picked up another table leg and struck him again feeling something on his skull go soft but he showed no reaction remained motionless seemed not to have felt it for long seconds no one moved the only sound was malones labored breathing he couldnt stop his heart from racing is he dead sienna struggled to get the words out yes hot bile rose in her throat are you okay he asked i think she wiped blood from her mouth im all right outside thunder rumbled in the distance a storm coming up the gulf malone braced himself against the counter why didnt we hear his jeep it isnt outside he must have parked on the beach and snuck up the thunder rumbled louder they held each other he called me mrs bellasar jesus he said hed done a computer search her shoulders heaved he knew that the cia is looking for us if he put dale perrys name into the computer you can bet it set off alarms in the agency by now whoever told your husband we were at that virginia safe house has passed along the news your husband will be coming when thunder again rumbled malone stared toward the window we dont have much time but what about sickened she peered down at the body we cant just leave him the mexican police will connect him to us the next thing theyll be after us too malone strained to order his thoughts well tie something heavy to the body and dump it in the gulf his jeep weve got to find it ill drive it to santa clara while you follow in the explorer his mind raced well make it seem like he parked on the edge of town the storm and the tide will wipe out the tire tracks if were careful not to leave fingerprints the police wont be able to prove we had anything to do with this but the shots were too far from town for anybody to have heard yes fernando must have but hes too afraid of the authorities to tell what he knows ignoring how quickly ramirezs body was turning cold malone searched the pockets he found car keys but they werent enough he needed dale perrys drivers license where was it he had to find it there thank god he pulled the license from the corpses trouser pocket hurry help me carry him to the boat before that storm comes any closer he grabbed the corpses hands started to lift then realized that sienna hadnt moved spurred by a new burst of thunder she grabbed the corpses boots shuddered and lifted they lugged the body across the trailer malone was in the lead backing toward the screen door he nudged the door open with his hip then he got a better grip on the corpse and backed out startled by a flash of lightning that revealed a look of terror on siennas face but not because of ramirez something was behind him he turned a blaze of lightning revealed bellasar potter and three bodyguards you should have known id find you bellasar said sienna gasped taking out the garbage bellasar asked malone released the body and tried to straighten not fast enough potter slammed the barrel of a pistol across his forehead lets deal with this garbage first blood streaming down his face malone felt himself being lifted two men carrying him into the darkness of the trailer as if from a distance he heard bellasar demand something siennas answer was a murmur malone was too dazed to know what it was at the moment what he was most aware of was the force with which he was slammed onto a chair more indistinct voices something flickered at first malone thought it was the lightning outside his impaired vision barely registering it but a second flicker and a third spread across the trailer the darkness dissipating until he realized that what he was seeing were candles that bellasar had made sienna take from a drawer she lit a fourth and a fifth the trailer glowed more portraits bellasars features were twisted he rammed a fist through an image of siennas face ive lost my enthusiasm for your work cursing he threw the ruptured portrait into a corner the frame shattering as it bounced off the wall he went over to malone and punched his face so hard that the chair fell over sending him sprawling onto the floor do you remember i warned you never to touch my wife malone was in too much pain to speak thunder shook the trailer pick him up hands yanked malone to his feet hold him steady with painblurred vision malone saw bellasar put on leather gloves no sienna shouted the blow to malones stomach would have doubled him over if bellasars men hadnt been holding him so rigidly the next blow was aimed toward his nose the one after that to his stomach again his mouth his the last thing he heard passing out was sienna screaming youre killing him thats the point derek drew back his fist again sienna broke loose from the man holding her and grabbed dereks arm before he could launch the blow im begging you youll beg me a lot more when your turn comes i dont care what you do to me let him live if you ever had any feelings for me when derek shoved her across the room she banged against a small table knocking a candle onto the floor wind shook the trailer that storms too close potter said on the floor the candle continued to burn chases swollen face was covered with blood as derek punched him again a few drops of rain pelted the metal roof get the car where we left it when we followed the jeep potter ordered a guard the candles flame spread to the carpet hurry potter told the guard before the storm hits and you cant find the car i dont want to be stuck here the guard ran outside put out that fire potter told another guard no derek said let it burn let everything burn as smoke rose from the burning carpet derek hit chase one more time frowned at his bloodcovered glove and gestured for the men to let him go chase collapsed on the kitchen floor when sienna tried to run to him derek grabbed her lightning cracked more drops of rain pelted the trailer sounds like its going to be bad a guard said the flames spread across the carpet reaching the portraits take a last look at him derek said pulling her away sienna shrieked she couldnt stop shrieking she felt as if her vocal cords were going to burst and still she wailed as the flames rose higher and derek dragged her toward the door headlights glaring a large fourwheeldrive vehicle pulled up its windshield wipers flicking away the rain derek yanked her outside with a force that jerked her gaze from chase thrown into the vehicle she scrambled to look through the rear window toward flames bursting from the smoke as the vehicle sped away the trailer disappeared into the darkness and the rain only the flames remained then they too disappeared obscured by the blur of her tears nine a sharp noise from outside made fernando swing toward the door his wife tensed what was that she asked in spanish it sounded like a shot motioning for the children to stay back fernando cautiously opened the door in the deepening twilight he stared to his right toward dales trailer the shot had been in that direction but it didnt make sense dale and beatrice wouldnt be shooting at each other had the military officer returned hearing a second shot and a third fernando stiffened they need our help he told his wife but his legs didnt want to move thunder rumbled to the south dense black clouds approached but fernandos attention was fixed to the north where five men in suits walked swiftly through the gray light they were about fifty yards away rapidly narrowing the distance one was short and stocky three were tall and heavychested but the other the one in the lead although equally tall radiated far more strength scarily so he had dark hair and sharply defined features stark with emotion his angry march was relentless the thunder rumbled more loudly it isnt safe here fernando said we have to go but where fernando immediately thought of where theyd survived the previous summers hurricane to the cave quickly bring the children he grabbed his sons hand and urged him from the trailer hoping they wouldnt be seen as they darted around the side ignoring the lightning and the thunder they raced through the deepening shadows toward a sand dune if we can get around it without being seen fernando prayed he had never felt a more powerful premonition those men seemed enveloped by a greater darkness than the approaching storm chilled by more than the suddenly cold wind he ran harder rounding the cover of the dune he and his family rushed toward a rocky bluff and the small almost hidden mouth of a cave but even after they reached the echoing shelter of its blackness fernando didnt feel safe the cave was hard to see unless you knew where it was especially with twilight about to turn to dark but the footprints theyd left in the sand were another matter if the men had flashlights stop thinking like that fernando warned himself why should those men care about us its dale and beatrice theyre interested in we mean nothing to them thats just the point we mean nothing if they noticed us if theyre worried that well be witnesses we cant just wait here to be killed i have to hide our tracks rushing from the cave fernando reached where the footprints curved around the dune he yanked off his shirt and dragged it over the footprints stepping backward trying to smooth the sand but the force of the wind almost yanked his shirt away a few drops of rain struck his bare skin then more drops their cold force stinging him i dont need to cover the tracks he realized the rain will do it for me but what if the men come before it does lightning cracked temporarily blinding him making him feel exposed as thunder rumbled and darkness again cloaked him he hurried to the cover of the dune then the only sound was the shriek of the wind and a vehicle approaching headlights blazed past the dune fernando heard the vehicle stop the trailers door slammed beatrice shrieked there were sounds of a struggle then the doors on the vehicle slammed and the headlights veered away it sounded as if the men had taken beatrice but what about dale stung by colder rain fernando peered around the dune as the vehicles taillights disappeared into the darkness he was startled by flames in the trailers living room windows seeing a body outside the screen door he scrambled toward the trailer almost blown off balance by the winddriven sand the man was dale he was certain but when he got there he was surprised to find a man in a military uniform where was fernando frowned through the screen door the flames were on the right in the living room spreading to the left toward the kitchen and the bedroom raising an arm to shield his face from the heat he stepped closer able to see into the kitchen to see dale sprawled on the floor then the flames blocked the way he isnt moving his face is covered with blood hes probably dead id be foolish to before fernando realized what he was doing he raced to the left around to the bedroom side of the trailer when dale had repaired the damage from last summers hurricane he had used a tarpaulin to seal a gap in the back corner of the bedroom fernando reached it and tore it free the wind so fierce that it flipped the tarpaulin into the night drenched fernando forced himself into the narrow gap turning sideways scraping his bare stomach and back he squeezed into the bedroom smoke drifted toward him making him cough as he hurried around the bed the doorway was filled with rippling growing light he felt the heat before he reached it and almost lost his nerve at the sight of the flames entering the kitchen jesus mary and joseph he prayed then darted forward feeling the fire singe his hair he grabbed dales legs and pulled frantically toward the bedroom he dragged him over the wreckage of a table banged against a kitchen counter and suddenly lost his balance falling backward but continuing to keep his grip on dales legs he landed in the shadows of the bedroom and although the heat was accumulating in there he had never felt anything so welcomely cool in a rush he tugged dale to the gap and positioned his head toward it rain gusted in the wind shrieked heart racing he squeezed outside turned and blanched when he saw that the flames had entered the bedroom he grabbed dales shoulders and pulled dales head came through seeing the flames reach the bed fernando pulled harder the wind filled his mouth taking his breath away harder he told himself but dales chest was caught on something the pockets of his fishermans jacket so full they jammed him fernando shoved him back in unable to remove the jacket he yanked its bulging flaps through the gap then tugged again on dales shoulders exhaling in triumph when dale came toward him dales chest was through his stomach his hips with one last pull fernando fell backward dale landing next to him the wind and rain overwhelming them but fernando couldnt take the time to catch his breath as the flames reached the gap he lifted dale to his feet doubled him over his right shoulder and staggered toward the other trailer when he burst inside leaving the storm behind he set dale on the floor and groped through the darkness to find a candle and light it what he saw as the tiny flame grew made him moan in sympathy dales face was raw swollen with bruises not even the fierce rain had been able to wash the blood off fresh blood seeped from his nose and fernando shivered not because of his wet clothes but because of excitement as he realized corpses dont bleed my god youre alive pain roused him it stabbed it festered it ached his entire face was alive with it pulsing with agony about to burst and his scalp and his stomach oh jesus his stomach and the right side of his chest hurt so as his nerve ends came back to life the pain grew and dragged him from his delirium prodding him into consciousness his swollen eyelids struggled open sending the tortured area around them into spasms among shadows he saw a flickering light the fire he was lying in the trailer the flames were about to reach him sienna where was moaning he squirmed to get away from the flames hands grabbed him bellasars men a face appeared before him bellasar about to hit him again he thrashed harder to get away the effort intensifying his pain a distant voice said something he couldnt understand he struggled be still the voice said in spanish youre safe the voice said malone opened his eyes a little more seeing a face with gray beard stubble wizened from years of working in the sun youre safe fernando repeated movement made malone tense until he realized it was fernandos wife touching his forehead with a cloth other movement made him glance toward a corner where fernandos children huddled afraid having trouble getting air through his nose he opened his mouth his jaw hurting but when he expanded his chest to take a deep breath the pain in his upperright ribs was even worse outside wind shrieked rain lanced against the windows sienna he managed to say where fernando frowned as if malone had spoken gibberish which i did malone realized not only had he spoken in english but fernando had never heard siennas name before he knew her as beatrice beatrice malone said donde está qué pasa fernando and bonita exchanged troubled looks qué pasa he demanded fernando sighed and told him what he had heard malone closed his eyes his emotional pain greater than what his body suffered he imagined the terror sienna must have felt when she was forced into the car the terror would be worse now as bellasar prepared whatever hell he had in mind for her if she was still alive how long ago had they taken her straining to clear his thoughts malone checked his watch and saw that the time was almost bellasar and his men had arrived at dusk around he had no idea how long theyd remained after he was knocked unconscious but he doubted it had been long that meant they had about a ninetyminute head start by now theyre close to the border he thought sickly no im wrong the rain at the window made him realize the storm would have slowed them they might even have had to take shelter in santa clara there was still a chance help me stand he told fernando no you mustnt try to move please malone grimaced help me stand but malone shuddered sitting up nausea swept through him as he struggled for the further energy to get on his feet loco fernando lifted him holding him steady as malone wavered malone fumbled at the pockets of his jacket help me open these zippers confused fernando did his curiosity turning to amazement when he saw the wad of pesos malone pulled out half of this is yours malone said what im going to keep some in case i need it on the way to yuma otherwise malone waited for a swirl of dizziness to pass your shares about four thousand dollars fernandos wife gasped malone fumbled in his jeans pulling out the explorers keys youve been a good friend fernandos voice was tight from emotion de nada if youll just do one more thing for me fernando waited to hear what it was help me to my car there must have been something in the way malone said it or in the look he gave fernando didnt argue with a nod he put an arm around malones left side careful not to aggravate the pain on his right when malone pulled the door open rain shoved them back he braced himself and stepped into the raging darkness fernando going with him holding him up drenched they staggered toward the gutted trailer despite the storm a few flames struggled to flicker guiding the way toward the dark outline of the explorer next to the trailer if only the fire hasnt spread to it apprehension made malones heart pound faster despite the cold rain he sweated he smelled smoke lightning gave him a glimpse of the drivers side heat had blistered the cars paint he felt along the windows finding them intact fernando the tires he fought to say in the wind are they all right yes help me inside fernando eased him behind the steering wheel the effort increased the pain in malones ribs and made him see gray for a moment he fumbled to put the key in the ignition switch are you sure you can do this fernando asked i have to we will pray for you ill need it malone turned the key for a moment he was afraid water had gotten into the electrical system but after the briefest hesitation the engine started he switched on the headlights they barely pierced the storm when he turned on the windshield wipers he saw fernando running into the darkness toward his trailer then he pressed the accelerator and tore up wet sand heading toward santa clara the strength of the wind made the waves higher than usual thrusting them farther onto the beach malone had to steer close to the stormobscured dunes forced to reduce his speed so he wouldnt crash into them it made him furious just remember bellasar had to go through this too he had to face the same obstacles malone thought im not really losing time but theyre still ninety minutes ahead and the storm wasnt as bad as this when they left he had no doubt that bellasars destination was the nearest major airport which was in yuma the only way bellasar could have arrived so fast he must have been closer than his estate in france was by jet but he wont be flying anywhere in this storm malone thought bellasars ninetyminute head start doesnt mean anything as long as he cant take off a gully loomed water churning through it before malone could hit the brake pedal the explorer charged down and up through it splashing waves on each side and over the windshield driving blindly desperate to control his steering malone couldnt understand where the gully had come from hed driven along the beach many times and had never encountered the obstacle then he remembered there had been numerous wide shallow dips were they the equivalent of dry streambeds in major storms did water rage from the bluffs on the right and fill these dips with flash floods the wave drained from his windshield wind buffeted the car at once his headlights reflected off another gully this one wider reflexively he stamped the brakes instantly realizing it was the wrong decision as the cars tires dug into the wet sand he wouldnt be able to stop in time he would slide into the surging water and be trapped he needed to go as fast as possible to force the car through to the other side jerking his foot off the brake he applied gas he felt the car skid and then gain speed and more speed when the front end hit the water the impact jolted his teeth together waves sprayed but the car kept surging forward flying forward with a punishing jolt it landed on the opposite bank and started to climb the crest but the back end was in the water although the tires dug into sand they fought the strength of the current malone pressed harder on the gas pedal the car gained traction but not enough he felt the back end shifting sideways oh jesus the currents pulling me in as the explorer swirled in the raging water he tried to work the steering wheel it spun in his hands the current controlling him the water drowned the engine the electrical system shorted out the headlights darkened he felt the force of the water beneath the car then the explorer twisted sideways and walloped to a stop blocked by the edges of the gully the car was now a plug the current roaring against it rising above the windows on the drivers side and pouring over the roof water seeped past the windows im going to drown in here he thought he shifted to the passenger side and pressed the switch to lower the window belatedly remembering that with the electrical system dead the window wouldnt budge more water seeped in he pulled the latch on the passenger door and shoved wincing from the pain the effort caused him nothing happened he tried harder the door opened slightly he rammed his shoulder against it the force of the water spilling over the roof caught the door and thrust it fully open yanking him with it he barely had time to breathe before he was sucked under the currents turmoil shocked him he couldnt tell up from down right from left he struggled to swim but found it impossible about to inhale water he brushed against the side of the channel the current foamed around a curve and hurled him against a slope where he gasped for air clawing he kicked his feet to propel him kept clawing and broke free flopping onto the top of the sand a wave crashed into him almost dragging him back another wave followed this one rolling him onto higher ground he struggled upright and staggered onward but his legs didnt want to support him dazed he sank to his knees he gulped air and shivered despite the pain in his ribs his chest heaved santa clara was too far to walk to in the storm the roiling stream blocked him from going back to fernando the odds were he would get hypothermia and die out here it didnt matter what happened to him wasnt important getting to sienna was and now he would never be able to help her lights flashed from farther along the beach a car help he thought he managed to stand its someone who can help me squinting from the headlights he waved his arms an alarming thought made him wave his arms harder dear god the cars coming so fast the driver wont be able to see the stream in time to stop hell do what i did and crash into it stop he mentally shouted the headlights sped closer abruptly another alarming thought seized him nobody drives along this beach at night in a storm unless its the police someone saw the fire theyre hurrying out to investigate or its a friend of ramirez wondering where he is assaulted by stronger rain malone looked frantically around for a place to hide but the only place was a dune on his right his legs were numb with cold he seemed to take forever as the headlights got larger with a torturous effort he rounded the dune and collapsed cant go any farther from his vantage point he saw the headlights glint off the raging stream they seemed to be slowing had the driver seen the stream in time or did the driver see me malone wondered a car stopped just before the stream malone couldnt tell if it was the police he tensed waiting to see what the driver would do two men got out flashlights gleamed toward the dune shit malone thought what if they work for bellasar what if he sent them back to make sure im dead he struggled toward a farther dune but the flashlights kept coming they checked the first dune found where his footprints led to the next and followed malone didnt have the strength to do anything except crawl his hands and knees didnt seem to belong to him he felt skewered in place the flashlights centered on him hurting his swollen eyes as he squinted up he waited for the bullet that would blow his brains out jesus what happened to you a familiar voice asked malone frowned up at a burly man beyond one of the flashlights straining to identify him my god chase jeb said hurrying to lift him we have to get you to a hospital no not the hospital what i cant hear you driving as fast as he dared along the stormy beach jeb risked a glance toward malone in the backseat the airport malone murmured yumas airport the poor son of a bitch is delirious the man next to jeb said save your strength jeb said yumas airport malone shivered bellasars there hes got sienna with him what malone tried to explain about ramirez i know about him jeb said this morning ramirez used a computer at the mexican immigration office at the border to find out what he could about a couple named dale and beatrice perry dale perry was one of ours i took his wallet we eventually figured that out a half hour after his name surfaced i was on an agency jet to talk to the mexican immigration official whose computer ramirez used bellasar arrived ahead of you malone managed to say how dale perry was our man not his bellasar couldnt have known about him unless somebody in the agency is on his payroll malone forced out the words how else could bellasar have known we were at that safe house in virginia a rumble of thunder was followed by a heavy silence in the car hell jeb said malone hugged himself shivering worse weve got to get him out of those wet clothes jebs stocky companion crawled into the backseat and opened a travel bag on the floor he pulled out a shirt and a pair of jeans since were about to get intimate i might as well introduce myself names dillon ive got the heater turned as high as it goes jeb said well do everything we can to get you warm chase the weather was so bad no matter how fast jeb tried to drive it still took four hours twice as long as usual to reach the border dillon tried to use a cell phone to warn the yuma authorities not to let bellasars jet take off but the storm was so bad that the call wouldnt go through beyond the border the weather improved but it still took an hour to get to yuma the cell phone finally worked malone whod been drifting in and out of a feverish sleep barely heard dillon talking urgently to someone in yuma he fought toward consciousness his chest cramping as he tried to get a sense of what the person on the other end was saying here jeb swerved into the modest airport and skidded to a stop in front of the singlestory terminal police cars their roof lights flashing waited jeb rushed out of the car hurrying to a group of officers malone struggled to get out and join him but even before he took a step he saw the bleak look with which jeb turned to him im sorry chase i wish i bellasars jet took off fortyfive minutes ago malone sank your ribs are bruised but not broken the doctor said windows vibrated from the roar of jets taking off and landing at the marine corps air station at the edge of yuma your nose is broken youve got a concussion is the concussion going to kill me the tall thin doctor a captain peered over his spectacles not if you take it easy for a while hes talking about r and r jeb said i know what hes talking about what hes not talking about jeb said is trying to go after bellasar well handle it youre in no shape to do it how i dont how are you planning to go after him tell me how youll get sienna back jeb looked uncomfortable the doctor glanced from one man to the other excuse me gentlemen i dont think i should be hearing this the door swung shut behind him do you know where bellasar went malone asked south over mexican airspace and then by the time we alerted the mexican authorities he was off their radar the painkillers the doctor had given malone didnt stop his skull from throbbing so he probably flew over baja and reached the pacific thats the theory he could be going anywhere weve asked canada and the central american countries to alert us about unidentified civilian aircraft malone massaged his forehead we cant assume hell go back to his estate in france the most i can hope for is whatever bellasar plans to do to sienna hell wait until they get off the jet it gives us a little more time to do what a man that powerful im sorry chase i wont give up tell me what you learned about bellasar since we disappeared maybe theres something thatll help us the arms dealer bellasar planned to use to broker the weapon tariq ahmed jeb nodded he got word that bellasars wife had run away with another man he doesnt know the agencys involved bellasars trying to keep that a secret but the fact that sienna ran off jeopardized the negotiations ahmeds the kind who believes that if a man cant control his wife he cant be depended upon to control his business theres a chance bellasar might keep her alive to show ahmed that shes back and that hes the boss maybe youve got a look in your eyes what bellasar might prove what a man he is by inviting ahmed to watch him kill her another jet roared into the air thats just the sick sort of thing bellasar would do jeb said kill her in front of ahmed it would solve a lot of problems hed not only get the negotiations back on track hed also scare the hell out of anybody tempted to underestimate him if your people keep a closer watch on ahmed he might lead us to bellasar and sienna jeb pulled out his cell phone as the fuselage hummed from the gulfstream s powerful engines sienna barely looked out at the whitecapped ocean below she told herself she ought to this would be the last time shed see it but she didnt care staring at the back of the seat she kept remembering what derek had done to chase in her mind she saw chase lying on the floor the flames spreading toward him he was dead nothing else mattered someone stood in the aisle when she turned potters expression had never been more sullen the gaze behind his spectacles never more sour that business with the duffel bags in the plane he said cute im going to enjoy what happens to you she returned her mournful stare to the back of the seat in a moment potters presence was replaced by a darker one and she didnt need to look to know who took the seat next to her how much did you tell them derek asked everything i could which wasnt anything important you were never present for meetings i never engaged in pillow talk you know nothing about my business then you dont have anything to be afraid of did you live with me for so long and not learn even the most basic thing about me derek grasped her chin and turned it in his direction im not afraid of anything i didnt live with you derek what are you talking about you would never allow anyone to live with you i just happened to share the same building with you why did you betray me you expected me to wait around until you killed me it was all right for you to plan my murder but for me to leave was unforgivable you arrogant even if you hadnt been planning to kill me id have left you for the first time in my life i found a man who cared for me more than he did for himself i gave you the best of everything and treated me like one of those things its better than dying good jeb pushed the disconnect button on his cell phone and turned to let dillon know what hed learned malone interrupted emerging from a stack of battered furniture in an outdoor storage unit i dont know what were doing here jeb squinted from the morning sun i had to pick up this suitcase whats so important about it i already got you fresh clothes malone opened it jeb stared at the money no you come to me ahmed said into his scramblerequipped telephone outside the traffic sounds of istanbuls evening rush hour grew louder i dont see why i should put myself out for you youre the one whose affairs are out of order its your obligation to regain my confidence but you dont have the proper facilities bellasars voice crackling with static came from his own scramblerequipped telephone aboard his jet he had refueled at a clients airstrip in el salvador toward which hed been flying from miami when hed learned where sienna and malone were hiding my technicians cant guarantee the safety of the demonstration unless its conducted in a levelfour chamber if the weapon is so sensitive that doesnt fill me with confidence either i guarantee that when im finished ill definitely have your confidence itll take a great deal to convince me your personal affairs are back in order not after tomorrow i have a special demonstration planned believe me youve never seen anything like it as the agencys jet reached its maximum speed jeb came back from the cockpits radio we just got a report that ahmed ordered his pilot to be ready to fly to nice tomorrow then the meeting must be at bellasars estate malone said we can intercept bellasar at nices airport we can get sienna away from him no hes too far ahead of us well never get there in time but you can have the french authorities do it on what basis as far as the french are concerned he hasnt done anything wrong then damn it order a special ops team to take sienna away from him without permission from the french at a major airport bellasars bodyguards wouldnt just throw down their weapons and surrender thered be gunfire theres too great a risk civilians would be killed jesus youre telling me we know where and when hes going to kill her but we cant stop it if i had the power to make the decision i would but the guy dragging his feet is laster that son of a hey i dont like him any more than you do jeb said but hes got a point we cant cause an international incident over what looks like a family fight malone trembled from anger pain and exhaustion when was the last time you took your pain pills jeb asked they make me groggy good you need some rest they studied each other malone mentally resisted then nodded he swallowed two pills and tried to tell himself that things werent as hopeless as they seemed that there was something he could think of to save sienna but he had the terrible suspicion he was wrong isnt denial the first phase of grief he asked himself dont give up she isnt dead yet no one talked to her again no one even looked at her they behaved as if she werent present as far as theyre concerned im already a corpse sienna thought throughout the flight when meals were served she wasnt offered anything a further example of the contempt with which she was treated not that she was hungry chases death had so numbed her that she couldnt care less about food but that didnt matter if she was going to starve by god she wanted it to be her choice as everyone else ate she went to the galley at the rear of the jet when she brought back crackers and a cup of tea she got no reaction from anyone she was like a ghost passing among them she felt like hurling the steaming tea at derek and that was when she realized that despair had given way to fury she was determined to survive to get even how she was going to survive she had no idea but she had to think aggressively because survival wasnt enough she had to make derek pay that motivation fiercely possessing her she forced herself to pick up a cracker her emotions were so chaotic that the thought of eating made her nauseous but she marshaled her strength she bit into the cracker chewed tastelessly swallowed hard and got it down she took another bite then another still no one looked at her staring at the back of dereks head she thought you bastard im not a thing you cant just hang me on a wall her memory angrily transported her back to the room where she had seen the portraits of her and dereks other wives and the photographs of dereks sister whom she and the portraits so closely resembled and the clothes on the mannequin and the shoes neatly arranged and the scrapbook and the urn none of this would have happened if i hadnt resembled dereks sister dereks sister she chillingly realized was the only chance she had i need to wake you chase malone felt as if his eyelids had weights on them slowly jeb came into focus the same drill as before how many fingers am i holding up three seeing double no feeling sick to your stomach no malone rubbed his hand across his face regretting the gesture when his injuries protested he squinted toward the darkness outside the jets window where are we over the atlantic do you remember refueling at dulles malone thought a moment yes i think we can stop worrying about your concussion where are we headed southern france didnt laster object he doesnt know about this malones surprise increased when he noticed jebs partner dillon talking to five stocky men in the forward seats who i made some calls en route from yuma these are guys ive worked with from time to time theyre looking for work when they came aboard at dulles youd fallen back asleep but you said laster didnt sanction a mission affirmative this isnt official youre hiring them with whats in your suitcase an unsanctioned mission could cost you your job why are you sticking your neck out because you saved my life in panama you already paid that back no if not for me you wouldnt be in this mess if not for you id never have met sienna then lets see if we can get her back jeb said this is the latest information we have malone frowned at a dossier jeb handed him opening it he found an eightbyteninch photograph a picture of sienna then he felt a chill as he realized he was wrong the photograph showed a sensuous darkhaired woman sitting with bellasar drinking from a champagne glass on a terrace that overlooked a beach it was taken at puerto vallarta three months ago jeb said there were a lot of guards around bellasar so our photographer had to work from a distance the poor angle and the graininess make it seem this woman is sienna but the truth is shes the daughter of a french industrialist who manufactures some of the weapons bellasar sells bellasar met her at a cocktail party the father gave in paris six months ago about the time bellasar started rejecting sienna of course hed found her replacement malone concentrated on the photograph with slightly longer hair and some surgery to narrow her chin shell look even more like sienna and like bellasars sister until sienna told us about her we had no idea about the sisters importance jeb pointed toward the next photograph his skin prickling malone studied it the voluptuous darkhaired woman wasnt sienna and yet she had the same body type and facial structure the same smoldering quality in her eyes in shadows the two could have been confused for each other bellasar and his sister became lovers when he was fourteen and she was a year younger jeb said what by all accounts the sister her name was christina was remarkably selfindulgent and impetuous they went everywhere together did everything together but if it was so obvious the parents must have known didnt they object they didnt have a chance malone was puzzled the parents died in a fire at their summer home in switzerland the same summer bellasar and his sister became lovers jeb let the significance sink in oh shit malone murmured for the next three years bellasar and christina partied rome london rio meanwhile a trust ran the business but when bellasar turned eighteen he and his sister took control their tastes were so expensive that to generate more income they ran the business more ruthlessly than the trust had but thirteen years later the parties ended what do you mean when christina was thirty she died in a fall from a hotel balcony in rome it seems bellasar wasnt enough for her she had affairs with every man who came along one night in rome bellasar broke into her room found her with a woman and couldnt keep control any longer they fought it ended when she went over the balcony he murdered his sister malone tasted bile but according to this dossier he wasnt charged the only witness was the woman bellasar found her with bellasar paid her off the story was that christina had been doing drugs which was true and that shed toppled over the railing the bribed witness died in a hitandrun accident three months later and ever since hes been searching for someone to replace his sister she knew she had to try to sleep she couldnt risk fatigue dulling her thoughts more her plan depended on dereks knowing she had slept at first she pretended merely closing her eyes and tilting her seat back furious ideas buzzed through her mind interrupted by bursts of fear that she strained to repress she had to make rage her solitary emotion to steady herself she concentrated on the drone of the jets engines the darkness behind her closed eyes deepened a hand shook her roughly uh wake up potter shook her again groggy she blinked adjusting her eyes to the harsh lights in the cabin noting that outside it was dark get in the rest room what were about to land potter said get in the rest room stay there until i tell you to come out as the jet descended sienna saw lights below and recognized the glitter of the promenade des anglais along nices harbor damn it do what i tell you potter yanked her seat belt open and pulled her upright so hard her teeth snapped together he dragged her to the back and shoved her into the rest room as the door was slammed in her face sienna remembered a time when derek would have killed potter for treating her like that but now derek hadnt even bothered to glance at the commotion hearing the engines change pitch as the jet descended she braced her hands against the rest rooms walls moments later with the slightest of bumps the jet landed whatever derek had in mind it wouldnt be long now she prayed that he wouldnt keep demonstrating his contempt by staying away from her her plan depended on getting close enough to talk to him the harsh light in the rest room made her look as sick as she felt the bruise on her jaw from when ramirez had punched her was alarming if theres ever been a time when i need to look good she warned herself this is it a sink drawer contained basic cosmetics hearing voices in the main cabin probably immigration officials checking the plane she hurriedly tried to make herself presentable trembling she washed her face removing the specks of dried blood she did the best she could with her hair applied powder to the bruise on her jaw and used a little lipstick her lower lip stinging when she put pressure on it the door was yanked open potter glared move she didnt give him time to repeat the order veering past him she headed along the aisle she did her best to hide her nervousness to look as confident as if she were still in dereks good graces but her determination faltered when she saw only bodyguards and not derek waiting at the exit as she went down the steps toward the tarmac she paid little attention to the sweet smell of the sea even though she knew she should savor it she might never experience it again she couldnt let anything distract her the helicopter was already warming up she had a sense of events moving terribly fast with bodyguards on each side and in back of her she was herded toward the open hatch and in another sign of how much had changed no one offered to help her in she climbed up hoping to get derek to look at her she failed but she did manage to take the seat next to him before a bodyguard claimed it for a moment she was afraid that derek would change seats but the bodyguards took the others leaving only one in back which potter his expression more dour sat in she fastened her safety harness the hatch was closed aggravating the uneasy sinking feeling in her stomach the helicopter took off except for the muffled roar of the engines the compartment was silent i had a strange dream she said to derek not looking at him he stared ahead giving no indication that he had heard she waited a moment trying to seem confused i was falling again no response as the helicopter rose into the darkness of the hills she concentrated to remember everything as vividly as she could the locked room next to dereks bedroom the portraits of his other wives the photographs of dereks sister the details in them the scrapbook dereks sister had died on june a newspaper on the plane had been dated june it wasnt like the usual nightmare about falling she said where everythings dark and you dont know where youre falling this was almost like it was really happening the muffled rumble of the helicopters engines filled the silence her heart pounded so hard that she thought it would burst shed pushed what she needed to say as much as she dared if derek didnt respond falling dereks voice was so subdued it took her a moment to realize that hed spoken and to figure out the word onto a street she remembered the death certificate had said that christina died at am it was night but i saw streetlights and the headlights of a car and lights in some windows the reflection on the pavement rushed toward me then i hit and other kinds of lights exploded in my head and i woke up falling derek said the pain when i hit was she lapsed into silence thirty seconds a minute i failed she thought and where were you falling from she didnt answer was that not in the dream he asked a railing she paused as if trying to come to terms with the detail what she said next was full of puzzlement on a balcony and now at last derek turned and assessed her a balcony he said of a hotel she shuddered and looked at him searching his eyes trying to establish emotional contact i could feel my insides rush up it was like it was really happening a balcony lights glowed in a valley ahead the pilot identified himself to the compound he got permission to come in the chopper descended someone called me christina dereks gaze was more intense a man i dont understand why would i respond to someone calling me christina ive had enough of this derek said flatly what do you mean who told you about her i still dont the cia you know someone named christina sienna asked theres one way to end this describe the balcony i if the nightmare was so vivid you ought to have seen what you fell from youve made such a drama about this describe the balcony sienna hesitated she was going to have to guess but if she made the wrong choice she remembered the photographs she had seen on the wall of the locked room one of them had shown a teenaged christina on a balcony leaning against an ornate metal railing a view of st peters in the distance had the hotel been a favorite it was spacious there was a black metal railing very ornate st peters was in the distance the helicopter swooped lower the lights of dereks estate enlarging other lights coming on illuminating the landing pad youre playing a game with me he said game if you think im not going to kill you because of some trick youre trick i dont shut up dont say another word i dreamed i was on a pony what i was a little girl on a pony the alps were all around me but ive never been to switzerland and ive never owned a pony how could i have felt i was actually riding that pony i loved that pony jesus am i losing my mind how soon till we get to nice malone asked an hour malone peered from the agencys jet the sky was turning gray it would soon be dawn were going to need weapons and special equipment jeb nodded back in february when you agreed to work for us i made arrangements to have them ready in case we had to go in after we land and the jets refueled one of these men will have to fly to paris whats in paris bellasars new girlfriend and her father what are you thinking malone explained jeb raised his eyebrows when does bellasar expect ahmed malone asked two pm that gives us enough time malone said to do what when malone told him jeb raised his eyebrows higher risky have you got an alternative you know i dont then with or without your help i intend to try this hey who said i wouldnt help but it isnt going to work if i cant get into france i need a passport jeb reached into his jacket malone looked in amazement as jeb handed him a passport how it was with the documents i had delivered at dulles when we refueled malone examined his photograph and the name in the passport im thomas corrigan a pseudonym will come in handy if this doesnt work but it is going to work it has to maybe this will encourage you malone shook his head puzzled when he was handed another passport the photograph inside was siennas the name under it janice corrigan thank you malone said it gave him a reason to hope ten how do you know these things derek insisted sienna was sprawled in a chair in the library where derek had pushed her as soon as they entered what things i dont know what you mean all i did was tell you about a disturbing dream i had in which you fell from a balcony and you were also riding a pony no not in the same i woke and drifted off several dreams blurred together what color was the pony sienna strained to remember the photograph it was dark but it had a white mane in the alps you said yes sienna shook her head from side to side why are you doing this quit bullying me if youre going to punish me do it but stop this how old were you when you had the pony i didnt say i had a pony i said i dreamed about damn it how old were you there had been a handwritten date on the photograph the date on christinas birth certificate had been ten and who gave you the pony this is the end sienna thought if i guess wrong the obvious answer was my parents but something in dereks insistent gaze told her that the question had a trick that the ponys relevance was fiercely personal why should it matter who gave the pony unless my brother derek shuddered why am i having these dreams sienna demanded someone knocked on the door not now derek shouted do you want me to meet ahmed at the airport potters voice came from behind the door or do you want the guards to bring him meet him but how do you want me to act friendly or distant whatever you want just leave us the hell alone after a pause footsteps retreated along the outside corridor derek swung toward sienna who told you about the balcony and the pony nobody they were in my dream what else did you dream i was at a carnival what kind of a fiesta in a street people were in costumes where the crowd in the photographs background had looked latin sienna remembered another photograph in which a gigantic statue of christ his arms outstretched had loomed on a ridge behind christina the only statue like that she knew of was in rio the city was famous for its carnivals but derek didnt react god help me i guessed wrong sienna tensed rio derek glared hes going to kill me now how christina loved rio derek yanked her up from the chair who told you about my sister your sister i didnt know you have a had her name was christina sienna asked she died a long time ago are you trying to convince me youre dreaming about her im not trying to convince you of anything i never heard of her until you do you think i wont kill you because id feel it was like killing my sister killing your sister the look in dereks eyes was terrifying did christina fall from a balcony did i dream about how she died derek shook with anger as much as i adored her she had a way of making me furious just as youre making me furious with a chill sienna realized what had happened on the balcony that night in the dream i was pushed derek raised his hands please dont kill me again sienna whispered distraught potter watched nices airport enlarge below him as the helicopter descended he was intentionally early to meet ahmed anything to get away from derek to be shouted at to be treated no better than a servant when this is over im leaving potter thought the helicopter set down in its usual far corner of the airport after getting ahmed potter would return to the estate and by this time tomorrow he thought when the woman is taken care of when business is settled and i bring ahmed back to the airport ill keep going i saved my money i planned for when derek would turn against me now hell find out what its like to be on his own we have plenty of time refuel it potter told the pilot he turned to his two guards well go into the terminal but instead of moving they stared past him toward the open hatch where three men in mechanics coveralls leaned in aiming pistols one of the guards almost drew his weapon but after a further look at the sound suppressors on the pistols he remained still think one of the armed men said he was heavyset with short blond hair very slowly using the tips of your fingers remove your weapons and set them on the floor good if you do this right nobodys going to die who potter started to ask the man ignored him a van pulled up next to the helicopter everybody out youre taking a ride the guards looked apprehensively at each other hey if wed wanted to we could have killed you the man said play nice and youll get out of this alive he made a sharp gesture toward the van move the pilot and the guards reluctantly obeyed but as potter started to follow the man said not you if its money you want i sit down well soon be taking our own ride seeing the pilot get out of the helicopter and into the van potter said but whos going to fly the i am a voice said disturbed by its familiarity potter turned toward the pilots hatch where a man with a severely bruised face appeared but even with the bruises the face was instantly recognizable potters stomach contracted malone ahmeds pilot announced they would soon be landing but not soon enough ahmed thought the fourhour flight from istanbul had seemed interminable he didnt like bellasar he didnt like to travel being away from the sounds and smells of home always put him on edge whatever bellasars demonstration was it had better be worth the trouble of coming to see it if there was one more hint that bellasars affairs were out of control ahmeds jet set down bellasar had promised that passing through customs and immigration would be swift and encouragingly that was the case but when ahmed emerged from the processing area neither bellasar nor potter was in sight if this was an indication of how the meeting was going to mr ahmed a heavyset man with short blond hair emerged from the crowd he wore a suit and looked apologetic as he extended his hand im raymond baker im sorry for the slight delay mr bellasar sent me to get you he couldnt come himself unfortunately he was occupied he sends his apologies hes so determined to make your visit successful that hes personally taking care of the final details ive not met you before why wasnt alex potter sent to meet me im new on the staff mr potter had some security matters to take care of hell meet us at the helicopter if you and your escorts the man nodded toward the two guards ahmed had brought with him will accompany me its a short flight to mr bellasars estate ahmed hesitated annoyed that bellasar had sent an underling to greet him but gratified by the mans subservient manner the sooner this meeting is over the sooner ill be on my way back to istanbul in that case youll be pleased that mr bellasar has made arrangements to be certain there wont be any delays in your return flight if youll follow me approaching the helicopter ahmed couldnt help frowning when he saw potter waiting stiffly next to the open hatch ahmed had never liked the mans perpetual disapproving look his presence turned everything dark around him potter didnt even extend his hand as ahmed neared him typical ill rot before i extend my hand first ahmed thought as he started to get in ahmed blanched when two men in coveralls turned from the helicopter and put a gun in the small of the back of each guard a van pulled up five seconds later the guards were in the vehicle the men in coveralls had gotten in with them and the van was driving away the speed with which everything had happened was bewildering i couldnt warn you potter said he tilted his head toward the interior of the helicopter where two other men in coveralls pointed weapons at them inside the man who had met ahmed in the airport said his right hand was beneath his suit coat as if ready to draw a pistol at the slightest provocation who are you what do you shut up and get in the helicopter pushed inside ahmed was searched buckled roughly into a safety harness then handcuffed along with potter to a bar on the side of the fuselage but as dismaying as all this was nothing prepared him for what he felt when the pilot turned to look back at him revealing a face swollen and purple with bruises welcome to payback airlines potters and ahmeds bodyguards are handcuffed and having a nice morphine sleep in the back of the van jeb told malone as he hurried to fasten his copilots harness our local contact will drive them to a secluded campground and wait to hear from us and twentyfour hours from now if he still hasnt heard from us hell know everything went to hell and hell let them go but everything wont go to hell malones voice was hoarse with emotion except for bellasar he radioed the control tower getting clearance for takeoff then he flicked some switches the rotors started to turn when i was taken to bellasars estate and later when i stole the chopper to escape i was puzzled by an extra panel of switches i couldnt account for malone said the rotors spun faster ive been trying to figure out what theyre for malone said louder in order to be heard above the engines roar when the chopper crashed and the gas tank exploded the blast was greater than it should have been finally i think i understand what are you getting at its just what youd expect an arms dealer to do he went after me with fourwheeldrive cars that were actually assault vehicles equipped with machine guns why wouldnt he modify his helicopters the same way youre telling me this thing has retractable weapons its a gunship what else did you dream i cant concentrate anymore i need to lie down i derek slapped her she stumbled back what you need to do is what youre told what else did you dream i cant remember derek slapped her harder you promised youd never hurt me she shouted that was before you ran off with i meant christina you promised not to hurt her again tomorrow what she died tomorrow derek slapped her a third time tell me how you know so much about there was a yacht sienna strained to remember more of the photograph derek froze his hand drawn back to strike her again the photograph had shown christina as a voluptuous adult wearing a bikini sunbathing on the deck of a yacht behind her the yachts name had been stenciled on a life preserver the yacht was called christina there were parties and always parties christina couldnt get enough parties whenever my back was turned she betrayed me the same as you did it had nothing to do with betraying you i had to try to save my life dereks glare remained riveted on her then wavered as if her logic had made an impression on him why does it have to be this way sienna pleaded why cant we start over derek studied her why cant we forgive each other five years ago we loved each other why cant we go back she took a tentative step toward him holding out a hand to touch him what else did you dream what tell me how you know so much about my sister siennas spirit plummeted the balcony the pony the carnival the yacht the time and date of dereks eyes widened jesus you saw them what you saw them i dont know what youre derek grabbed the hand shed extended and yanked her viciously toward the doorway she struggled to resist but his strength was too powerful he flung the door open so hard it slammed against bookshelves derek no what are you he forced her along the corridor into the vestibule and up the curving staircase as she resisted his next tug made her lose her balance and drop to her knees he yanked even harder dragging her the first landing the second stop sienna pleaded he kept pulling her where are you taking me the top floor jerking her upright he reached the door next to his bedroom pulled a key from his pocket unlocked the door and shoved it open shadows beckoned no i dont want to he shoved her inside turned on the lights ignored the portraits on the wall and forced her toward the urn christina he murmured he spun her toward the wall of photographs you have no idea how much i loved her he stared at the numerous photos scanning them finding the ones he wanted there on the balcony on the pony at the carnival and on the yacht he flipped open the scrapbook turning to the final page the time and date when she died thats how you knew about my sister somehow youve been in here before no i swear i didnt know anything about five years ago we loved each other why cant we go back derek mocked i meant it oh of course what happened between us sienna asked why did you turn against me for a moment dereks eyes cleared as if he finally understood how wrong everything was christina happened he said his eyes again black with fury he dragged her out of the room ahmed will soon be here finally youre going to be of use to me the speeding chopper cleared the ridge and came into view of the valley bellasars estate was hunkered in the middle wed better be right about this jeb said back at the airport was risky but now malone adjusted the microphone on his helmet bellasars expecting the chopper to come back with ahmed here it is hell also expect a radio message some kind of identification before he lets this thing get closer you dont know what youre supposed to say malone nodded when he had flown here with bellasar a lifetime ago he had heard the pilot speak to the estate but the pilot had used french and malone had no idea what he had said he adjusted the radios frequency until he heard a male voice saying something in french even with the accent some of the words were close enough to english that malone understood he was being asked to identify himself he tapped the microphone a couple of times then brushed a piece of paper across it murmuring a few of the french words he had just heard trying to create the impression that radio problems were breaking up his signal he switched off the radio the helicopter flew closer to the estate this had better work jeb said an arms dealers likely to have missiles down there probably but he wont risk killing ahmed unless he has to so far weve done nothing to indicate were a threat malone looked back at jebs partner and the others who were helping him ready the tension on dillons face was all too familiar from when malone had prepared for missions in the military he switched his attention to ahmed and potter handcuffed to the side of the chopper their expressions were stark with fear buckled in nice and tight malone asked he jerked on the controls abruptly the chopper tilted and spun jesus jeb had known this was coming but he hadnt been prepared for how closely malones maneuvers would simulate a chopper that was out of control gas masks malone tilted the chopper dizzyingly in the opposite direction each man had one they slipped them over their heads might as well let potter and ahmed have one also malone said he took off his pilots helmet put on his gas mask then made the helicopter waver so alarmingly that anybody on the ground would assume it was close to crashing hatches dillon and the others opened them smoke grenades ready do it two grenades were dropped to the choppers floor muffled whumps were followed by sudden gray smoke that filled the chopper for a moment malone feared that he had miscalculated that the smoke swirling around him would get so thick he wouldnt be able to see to control the unstable maneuvers he was forcing the chopper to perform if the charade wasnt convincing to the guards on bellasars estate wind from the open hatches cleared the smoke allowing him to see the estate as the chopper wavered onward most of the smoke now billowed outside making it seem that an accident had happened on board malone imagined the frantic questions the radio controller was trying to send him he spun he tilted all the while he moved closer to the buildings and gardens of the estate he was near enough now to see guards down there on paths among trees and shrubs they stared up in confusion at a height of a thousand feet he wavered over the estate some of the guards ran for cover afraid the chopper was about to crash on them ready malone shouted to the back dillon opened a box from the corner of his vision malone saw him throw out a quartsized glass container of a type used in laboratories it tumbled through the air easily visible because of the white powder in it as guards hurried to avoid it the container shattered on a sidewalk malone imagined the noise it made and the consternation on the guards faces as the powder burst into the air and the days breeze carried it toward them a few whose curiosity was stronger than their apprehension came close to investigate malone knew that when they saw the sturdy label keeping some of the shattered pieces of glass together they would stumble back and panic even in english the message was unmistakable caution anthrax biological hazard the skull and crossbones symbol was equally unmistakable smoke spewing from the chopper malone tilted toward other areas of the estate as more glass containers plummeted he switched his attention toward the tennis court and the area of the first impact amid the drifting white powder guards raced away he imagined them holding their breath a few of them shouted warnings guards who werent near the impact zone put greater distance between them a container shattered among those guards who raced in a different direction while another container broke ahead of them five six seven as malone guided the choppers erratic path over the property more and more containers smashed on the grounds white powder spewing twelve thirteen fourteen the mansion the cloister the stable the swimming pool and the weaponstesting range had blotches of white on them seventeen eighteen more guards rushed to escape some jumped into vehicles and sped toward the gates until now malone had relied on the double distraction of the apparently abouttocrash chopper and the falling containers to keep the guards from firing at him believing they were under attack from a biological weapon few had overcome their primal fear enough to get off a few shots before they ran in panic but even a few were too many malone assumed that the chopper was armored but he knew from experience that it wasnt invulnerable when he and sienna had used the other chopper to escape a barrage of gunfire from the guards had managed to disable it now as bullets whacked against the fuselage he needed a reinforcement that the estate was under attack from biological and chemical weapons kick the smoke grenades out the men got rid of the ones on the floor as the air in the chopper cleared they pulled the pins on other grenades and hurled them to the ground but these were teargas grenades their dense haze blossoming across lawns and gardens forcing the guards to race even harder close the hatches malone sped from the estate then swung to face it he flicked four of the switches that had puzzled him earlier en route from nice he had experimented learning what did what ports opened on each side of the chopper machine guns swung out if they were anything like what malone had been familiar with in the military each was capable of firing six thousand mm rounds a minute above them launchers equipped with inch foldingfin rockets emerged perfect for the dictator who loves to surprise his enemies malone thought now it was time for bellasar to get a surprise the haze from the tear gas obscured the grounds itll also obscure the chopper malone thought firing both machine guns he swooped down unable to see the damage he was causing but knowing he was destroying everything in his path careful not to hit the château or the cloister where sienna or the biological weapon might be he launched a rocket another even with the roar of the chopper he heard the rockets explode among the guards when he turned to face the estate from the opposite direction he saw flames amid the smoke and the tear gas potter no answer damn it potter you know what youre supposed to do make the call malone attacked again as the machine guns thundered so many bullets streaked down at once they became moving columns of devastation behind each a line of dust and shredded wreckage flew into the air mixing with the smoke and the gas he must have hit a munitions area the shock wave from a huge explosion shook the chopper creating more smoke a fireball rising from it potter still no answer so help me god potter if you dont call him well throw you out muscles cramping with fury malone launched another rocket it streaked toward an antiaircraft bunker the fiery blast sent concrete and metal flying skirting smoke from the crater spraying guards who aimed toward the chopper he reached the far end of the estate swung and again faced his target hovering he glared back at potter whose cuffed hands held a cell phone awkwardly to his ear yes potter said into the phone six men plus malone and ahmed seeing the rage on malones bruised face potter flinched afraid of what malone would do to him for telling bellasar who was in the chopper malone wants to talk to you derek this couldnt be helped im sorry whatever bellasar said to him was so insulting that potter looked like a dog that had been beaten but humiliation wasnt all his expression communicated as dillon took the phone from him and gave it to malone potters anger was unmistakable his voice was strangled he shouldnt talk to me that way kill the son of a bitch malone sent another rocket into the smoke the explosion rumbling only then did he press the phone to his ear have i got your attention totally in the cloister bellasar stared through a window at the smokeobscured helicopter sienna too dazed to know what he said lay in a corner youre supposed to be dead he said into his cell phone sorry to disappoint you not at all it gives me the pleasure of killing you a second time i assume youve come for my wife shed better still be alive or through the haze outside bellasar saw the blur of a rocket spewing from the helicopter in a fiery roar it struck the châteaus terrace flagstones erupting ill have it rebuilt bellasar said into the phone im not over there by the way im at the cloister but think twice about launching another rocket the love of your life is in here with me shes alive in a manner of speaking as sienna struggled to her feet bellasar punched her knocking her down her groan was loud enough to be heard through the phone i want to talk to her malone said if she can bellasar peered down at her guess what my dear your boyfriends on the phone sienna blinked up dimly comprehending thats right your boyfriend the famous artist hes come calling isnt that thoughtful of him say a few words he lowered the phone frowning as if afraid she was losing her mind she took it hurry dont keep him waiting hes come quite a distance she blinked in confusion apprehensive that this was a trick she raised the phone to her ear chase are you all right my god is it really you i thought you were dead i thought bellasar yanked the phone from her hand i said a few words not a speech satisfied he asked into the phone let her go i cant think of a reason why i should i can do something for me call the following telephone number malone recited it the number was so familiar bellasar felt uneasy what are you just call that number in paris an associate of mine is with your next wife and her father what unless you do what i want my associate is going to show them a dossier about your three previous marriages and how you killed your wives hes going to tell them how you planned to kill your present wife hes going to tell them that you and your sister were lovers that you murdered her and that your wives all looked like her he has photographs outrage made bellasar speechless your fiancé wont be able to bear the sight of you let alone be married to you her father will be so furious about the danger you present to his daughter that hell stop supplying weapons to you of course hes only one of your manufacturers but a father whose daughters honor has been assaulted will spread the word youre fanatical about your privacy itll be destroyed im willing to bet other suppliers will stop doing business with you especially when they find out youve been compromised by the cia the cia if anything happens to sienna im going to spread the word that the cia knows everything youre doing that your business is out of control no one will trust you if you want to keep being an arms merchant youll have to sell cheap handguns to dope dealers on street corners bellasar glared once you lose your power malone said everybody you stomped on everybody who holds a grudge against you will pay you back you ruined my life now youre going to find out what it feels like on the other side and if i do what you want the conversations youre threatening me with will never happen bellasars voice was contemptuous thats right you expect me to believe you wont tell the woman in paris to protect her from me youll protect her yourself what do you mean youll break off the relationship i wont need to tell her anything and in exchange you get sienna but how can i trust the men with you to keep the agreement since when does the cia care about private arrangements this isnt a sanctioned operation these men work for me theyll do as i ask and thatll be the end of it not quite malone said youve got a biological weapon the pressure wont be off you until i make sure its destroyed bellasars fury reached a peak im bringing her out he broke the connection and swung toward sienna get up he dragged her to her feet and shoved her from the room but instead of heading toward the outside door he forced her downstairs toward the basement and the basement below that one watching the tear gas disperse seeing guards regroup malone fired a burst from the machine guns trees and shrubs blew apart bodies flew its been three minutes where is he strafing the grounds malone sped to the landing pad hovered turned in a circle and leveled everything around him the moment he set down the chopper jeb dillon and the others charged out firing although the choppers rotors dispersed the tear gas the men still wore gas masks hoping to intimidate their opponents by continuing to pretend that the powder theyd dropped was anthrax as malone hooked teargas grenades to his belt potter yelled what about us unlock these handcuffs malone didnt bother answering just grabbed an assault rifle jumped down and raced toward the cloister behind him he heard gunfire jeb and his men giving the guards another reason to run from the estate as a bullet zinged past malone ducked to a shattered tree and fired at a guard who showed himself a second too long malones volley hit him in the chest knocking him into the swimming pool he scanned the wreckage searching for other targets statues had been decapitated ruptured fountains gushed water there he fired at a guard who rose to aim from behind the rubble of a column as the man fell malone spun saw no other targets and raced nearer to the cloister only to dive behind another shattered tree as the main door swung open malone bellasar shouted from inside where is she have you still got your cell phone staying hidden bellasar shouted numbers whats he doing stomach cramping with apprehension malone sank lower behind the shattered tree he took the phone from his windbreaker and pressed the numbers hed been given chase sienna answered immediately frightened are you okay where are you in the cloisters basement locked in a room what room i dont know he blindfolded me once he brought me down here malone tried to keep his voice calm dont be afraid im coming to get you he pressed the disconnect button and shouted toward the cloisters open door bellasar no response bellasar silence except for gunshots in the distance malone pulled a teargas grenade from his belt freed its pin and hurled it through the open door vapor filled the opening he darted toward the side of the cloister used the butt of his rifle to smash a basement window and threw a teargas grenade into the opening as vapor filled the room below he raised his gas mask from where it dangled around his neck he put it on knocked the remaining shards from the window and climbed through at the bottom he aimed around the hazefilled room seeing no targets hearing no coughing he rushed to the side of an open doorway tossed his final grenade into a corridor and followed it stalking invisibly through the dense gas he still didnt hear any coughing bellasar couldnt have anticipated a teargas attack he wasnt likely to have had a gas mask in easy reach was bellasar using sienna as a decoy while he ducked out the back of the building bellasar doesnt matter i have to find sienna he moved along the corridor checking each room empty he reached stairs that rose toward the gasfilled entrance other stairs led down malone followed them the temperature cooled the rocks that formed the walls became larger the construction cruder older as if from a thousand years ago he came to the brightly lit bottom where a shiny metal door blocked his way silently praying that it wasnt locked he pulled exhaled when it budged and stepped carefully to the side as it swung open was bellasar hiding on the other side waiting to shoot him malone took off his gas mask held it at head level and inched it around the doorjamb as if peering beyond the door no bullet struck the mask from his hand he readied himself lunged through the doorway and dropped to a crouch aiming no target presented itself instead he saw the bright corridor of a laboratory along each side windows showed research rooms he hurried along not seeing anyone sienna she didnt shout back sienna he came to another steel door it too was unlocked but this time when he lunged through aiming he found the two russian bioweapons experts their faces ashen as he straightened they stared from him toward a window beyond which was another window sienna she didnt react past the first window a corridor and a second window she sat at a table looking dismally at her hands her face was battered sienna she cant hear you said the stoopshouldered russian whom malone had seen arrive by helicopter so long ago his english was thickly accented his tone heavy with discouragement she cant see you either the glass on her window works only one way malone rushed toward a door tugged but couldnt budge it he pulled with all his strength it wont do any good the russian said even if you had a key not for six hours six hours malone pounded the butt of his rifle against the glass the window trembled he pounded harder but the glass wouldnt yield youre wasting your time the russian said you cant get through that glass with a sledgehammer or a bullet to be doubly sure shes in a chamber within a chamber anything to prevent a leak leak malone felt dizzy i never believed hed do it the russian looked dazed bellasar said he was going to make an example to the man he was negotiating with but i never dreamed an example jesus what did he a phone rang in an office behind him malone stared at it as it rang again he suddenly knew whose voice he would hear rushing in he answered it you bastard how do i get her out of there you cant bellasar said not for six hours six hours again that time limit malone vaguely remembered having been told about its significance when who had told him whats so damned important about his skin turned cold when his memory cleared laster at the virginia safe house what makes the weapon so unique is that gribanov and bulganin genetically engineered the smallpox virus so it cant infect anyone unless it combines with another virus a benign but rare one laster had said you release the benign virus first as soon as the target population is infected the lethal virus is then released the benign virus had a sixhour life span laster had continued after that even if you had smallpox you couldnt spread it to anyone who hadnt come in contact with the benign virus within the previous six hours the time limit was a way of controlling the weapon and keeping it from spreading beyond the target area i promised id give her to you bellasar said but i didnt guarantee in what condition you released both viruses at once malones legs felt weak tell anyone anything you want about me it wont make a difference when my enemies understand what im capable of theyll be twice as afraid of me you exposed her to smallpox malone screamed raging he charged up the stairs ill catch him ill get my hands on his throat ill but as malone neared the top he heard gunfire not just the rattle of assault rifles but the roar of the choppers machine guns the whoosh of a rocket was followed by an explosion at the top the gas had dissipated rushing from the cloister malone stared to the left toward where he had last seen jeb and his men dust flames and smoke obscured his vision the chopper wasnt where he had left it a rumble cramped his muscles on his left the haze dissipated as whirling blades and the chopper appeared like malignant growths a new array of weapons emerged from its belly it stopped a hundred feet up and a hundred yards away even at a distance bellasars stark features were vivid behind the plexiglas from a loudspeaker beneath the fuselage his voice boomed i dont sell equipment i cant handle before malone could run back to the cloister a burst from a machine gun tore a crater behind him the force of it threw him to the ground as dirt stones and redirected bullets flew around him he rolled to get farther from the crater only to see the chopper alter its angle of fire a machine gun tearing up another crater this one to the right of him the chaos making his ears ring he could have killed me the son of a bitch is toying with me frantic malone pivoted as if to run to the left but the moment bellasar guided the chopper that way malone changed direction and raced to the right away from the cloister away from jeb and his men if they were still alive toward the weaponstesting range behind him he heard the choppers motors change pitch as bellasar pursued him even with the ringing in his ears he heard it come so close he had to dive to the ground the chopper speeding over him wind from it ruffling his hair before bellasar could turn and come after him again malone scrambled to his feet and raced onward this part of the estate hadnt been damaged by malones attack he charged closer to the weaponstesting range using hedges trees and bushes to provide cover the trees to his left disappeared the machine guns vaporizing them he dove to the ground an instant before the hedges between which hed been running burst into pieces specks of leaves and branches filling the air the chopper swooping over again before bellasar could turn malone sprang to his feet and ran beyond one last line of shrubs he rushed into the open reaching the wooden stalls of the testing area to his right was thecaliber machine gun bellasar had threatened him with but as malone tried to reach it bellasar fired dirt and grass flying a trough appearing between malone and the weapon malone tried again and again bellasars bullets cut off his route the bastards enjoying himself furious malone spun in another direction beyond the stalls was the mock village bellasar and his clients used for target practice it had been rebuilt since malone had last seen it he sprinted toward one of the stalls flicked the switch potter had used months earlier and charged toward the suddenly animated village realisticlooking soldiers civilians and vehicles now moving along the streets a volley from a machine gun tore up grass on his right veering to the left but continuing to race toward the village malone tensed in dread of the volley that would be aimed in that direction trying to time it he swung to the right an instant before the next volley devastated the grass to his left but now the bullets hit closer to him bellasar was tiring of the game the village loomed malone zigzagged across the final twenty yards dove over a stone wall landed hard gasped from the pain in his ribs then squirmed frantically toward the corner of a stone building where he pressed himself behind a pile of rubble both machine guns firing the helicopter attacked the village it blew a gap in the wall destroyed the corner of the house and heaved up the cobblestones in a street farther along the moment the chopper sped over the tops of the buildings malone raced along the street before bellasar could turn and see him he darted left into a courtyard and sprawled behind another wall his chest heaved sweat dripped from his face when he wiped it his hand came away bloody and he realized the concussion of the near hits from the machine guns had made his nose bleed bellasar skimmed the village searching dont think you can hide his voice boomed from the loudspeaker this chopper has nightvision and heatsensor equipment as soon as it gets dark ill have no trouble picking up your heat signature malone studied a military jeep filled with mannequins dressed as soldiers the jeep was on a track that moved the vehicle along a street other mannequins dressed as villagers were on similar tracks that made them appear to walk and dont think you can wait for me to run out of fuel bellasars voice thundered before that happens ill level this place a flatbed truck filled with mannequins dressed as workers was so realistic that malone had the start of an idea interrupted by an explosion as a rocket blew the truck apart it heaved chunks flying in all directions burning mannequins many without arms and heads flipped through the air a fireball soared as black smoke drifted over him malones nostrils contracted from the stench of cordite scorched metal and burning gasoline burning gasoline had bellasar made the village that realistic the chopper crisscrossed the village continuing to search as soon as bellasar faced the opposite direction malone rushed from cover and hurried toward another jeep wary of the chopper he grabbed a rifle from one of the mannequin soldiers and raced back to the cover of a wall breathing heavily he examined the weapon an m its magazine was fully loaded did that mean the grenades the mannequins carried were real also why would so the sound effects and the visuals will be accurate malone understood with a chill when bellasar and his clients shoot at this village it has to seem as realistic as possible an explosion has to detonate gasoline in vehicles it has to set off grenades and ammunition as it would when fire engulfed military corpses the chopper pivoted coming in malones direction hell fly right over me malone realized his heart beating faster hell see me behind this wall racing toward an alley malone heard the chopper increase speed he saw me entering the alley charging between houses he cursed when he saw the alley end at a doorway if that doors a fake if its jammed he didnt have an option he knew what bellasar would do next stretching his legs to their maximum he reached the dead end slamming against the door pawing at its latch he thrust it open his momentum carried him into a house but instead of stopping he kept running he saw an open window raced toward it dove through it and even as he flew through the air an explosion behind him thrust him farther the rocket bellasar had launched hitting the front of the house the force of the blast sent walls toppling rubble flying when malone landed in a stone courtyard the pain in his ribs almost made him pass out chunks of rock fell over him dust and smoke overwhelmed him smoke despite his pain a thought that had started forming earlier now insisted smoke the fires in the ruined buildings had created so much smoke that this section of the village was blanketed with it bellasar couldnt see where malone was sprawled wrong as the chopper approached its spinning blades dispersed the smoke allowing bellasar a glimpse of the wreckage the smoke will work though malone decided there just has to be enough of it wincing from the pain in his ribs he forced himself across the courtyard gaining speed he reached a street and saw another jeep approaching he took off his windbreaker and formed a sling with it he darted out jumped onto the jeep grabbed grenades from the equipment belts on the mannequins stuffed them into the sling heard the chopper approaching grabbed two more grenades and leapt off taking cover in a doorway as bellasar flew over straining to get enough air in his lungs he pulled the pin from a grenade heaved the grenade toward the receding jeep and raced the opposite way along the street a truck came around a corner he tossed a grenade into it as well and ran harder the blast from the first grenade gutted the jeep set off a secondary explosion in the gas tank and detonated the ammunition in the rifles pop pop pop he heard then winced from the louder explosion of the second grenade the truck bursting into flames continuing to run he hurled a third grenade at a pickup truck a fourth at a bus a fifth at a station wagon the chain of explosions behind him was accompanied by rising columns of dense black smoke from burning gasoline and tires bellasar shot into the smoke but malone was already in a different sector blowing up a halftrack another jeep and another pickup truck the secondary explosions added to the chaos more dense smoke billowing the stench was so acrid malone bent over coughing the flames spread to buildings mannequins dressed as civilians moved on their tracks continuing to walk even though they were burning the smoke drifted from the village spreading across the field around it malone used it for cover racing toward the weaponstesting stalls thecaliber machine gun he kept thinking bellasar had cut off his route to it earlier if malone had persisted he was certain bellasar would have decided the threat was sufficiently serious for him to quit toying with malone and stop the game right then a change in the sound of the choppers motors warned malone that bellasar had seen him running across the smokeobscured field no he raced as hard as he could the chopper sped toward him what if the machine gun doesnt have ammunition what if run bellasar fired narrowly missing him faster malones makeshift sling still held a few grenades his legs pumping his chest heaving he grabbed a grenade pulled its pin reached the machine gun then whirled and threw the grenade as far and as high as he could in the choppers direction he was too desperate to worry about shrapnel as he swung toward the machine gun on its tripod and shouted in triumph when he saw that an ammunition belt was attached to it the grenade exploded in front of the chopper its shock wave jolting the fuselage shrapnel whacking against the plexiglas the distraction enough to keep bellasar from firing again for an intense moment malone saw bellasars furycontorted features in the back desperate and frenzied potter and ahmed tugged at the bars to which they were handcuffed then malone yanked back the arming mechanism on the machine gun tilted the weapon upward and pulled the trigger the awesome rate of fire threatened to twist the weapon out of his control but although he had found the recoil daunting when bellasar had made him fire the weapon months earlier he now felt angrily at ease with it its repeated shudder reminiscent of the speed and power of a locomotive aggravated the pain in his body but his body transcended his pain in the next pure timeless moment he and the weapon were one as he steadied his aim and kept squeezing the trigger the rounds had extrapowerful loads the tips were explosive bellasar had been so proud of them now a steady spray of them struck the chopper blowing it along with bellasar potter and ahmed to hell the blast was so powerful it slammed malone to the ground and this time he did pass out but not before he saw the flaming wreckage cascade slamming onto the field how long he was unconscious a minute or five minutes he couldnt tell all he knew was that when he came to the wreckage was still burning across from him but he didnt have time to rejoice in his victory he had no thought of celebration he hadnt been victorious there was nothing to celebrate he was alive and he had gotten his revenge but he hadnt won wavering to his feet he stumbled past mutilated trees and hedges toward the cloister sienna he kept thinking and then as he broke from a stumble to a run he wailed it sienna time had deceived him what had seemed like fifteen minutes had taken an hour when he reached the cloister he found jeb passed out on its front steps a pool of blood around him a bullet hole in his arm now i owe you malone said a policeman and a doctor alarmed by the rumble of the distant explosions had arrived from the nearest village twenty kilometers away while the doctor worked on jeb the policeman and townspeople summoned by phone were searching the grounds trying to help the survivors three of jebs men including dillon had been wounded two were dead sickened malone rushed down the basement stairs to the corridor outside siennas chamber the russians had remained still devastated by the reality that bellasar had actually used the weapon pale they continued to stare through both windows toward sienna after having waited so long she was pacing her eyes panicky through the oneway glass malone watched her tug frantically at the door then study the ceiling trying to calculate a way out the bruises on her face were more pronounced it broke his heart to see them but they were the least thing that would mar her beauty how long does the disease take to develop he asked the stoopshouldered russian downcast the man replied normally seven to ten days normally we engineered it so the effects are accelerated but it was all a research experiment we never dreamed bellasar would actually use it how long three days does she know shes been exposed looking more dejected the russian shook his head from side to side malone swallowed bile his ordeal had left him so weak he could barely stand but how he felt didnt matter he went into an office behind him picked up its phone and pressed the numbers bellasar had earlier given him across from him through the oneway glass sienna spun toward the rooms table and the phone on it from malones point of view it rang silently as she picked it up chase right here sweetheart i got so worried you said you were coming and when you didnt something held me back you sound she straightened are you all right tired bangedup otherwise you want to hear some good news god yes its over hes dead you dont have to be afraid of him ever again for a moment she didnt react she seemed not to believe what she had heard then tears welled from her eyes streaming down her ravaged face with all his heart malone wanted to hold her he imagined how closed in she must feel not being able to see outside the room come get me she said please i cant malones voice didnt want to work not yet not for five hours five hours why i dont understand some kind of time lock i wont be able to open the door until then time lock five hours but you wont be alone you and i can still keep talking like this now that you dont have to fear him what would you like to do where would you like to go do thats easy i want to spend the rest of my life with you malones throat tightened youve got a deal and what about where youll think this is corny i doubt it give it a try id like to go where i told you my parents went on their honeymoon to siena in italy yes theres nothing corny about that at all when policemen streamed into the corridor malone refused to interrupt what he and sienna were talking about their dreams regrets and resolves he locked the door and motioned vigorously through the window for the policemen to leave him alone at first they tried to break in until the russians told them what had happened five hours passed a lifetime finally the time lock opened malone hung up the phone and stepped out of the office the policemen had long ago left the building afraid that the russians had miscalculated that the disease would still be contagious even the russians had left finally losing confidence in the safeguards they had taken only malone stood in the corridor it made no difference to him if he caught the disease without sienna he didnt want to live still not knowing how to tell her he entered the chamber they hugged as if it had been years since theyd been allowed to see each other they kissed as if it would be the last time they ever did epilogue siena sits on three hills in the rolling countryside of italys tuscany its famed cathedral has an intricately textured facade its white marble offset with greenand rosecolored stone the citys piazza sloped like half of a giant shell paved with fiery bricks in a herringbone pattern is rimmed by medieval palaces and civic buildings much of the old part of the city has survived its ancient gates its narrow winding upanddown streets its stone buildings and sloping rustcolored tile roofs have the effect of obscuring cars motorbikes and electrical lines and like the piazza taking one back in time that was the impression for jeb wainright as he made his way along a brown brick lane opened a gray wooden gate and entered a brightly colored flower garden its reds purples and greens in contrast with the smoldering earth tones for which the city is famous he wore sneakers jeans and a blue shortsleeved polo shirt he had a camera bag slung over his left shoulder periodically he rubbed that arm as if troubled by a persistent ache an elderly man came out of a doorway into the sunlight his straw hat and gardeners coveralls dusty may i help you he asked in italian jeb who had often worked in italy and knew the language answered im looking for someone im told is renting some rooms here an american signor malone jeb tried to appear subdued yes i havent seen him in a long time the mans troubled expression made jeb feel troubled he is where he always is the whitebearded man pointed toward an opposite gate beyond which shrubs blossomed grazie massaging his left arm again jeb walked along a path heard bees murmuring among the flowers opened the gate and entered a different kind of garden lush grass bordered by ornamental bushes trees providing shade to the left a man was so rapt in concentration an artists brush in his hand a canvas on an easel before him that he didnt hear the gate open the painting depicted the most beautiful woman jeb had ever seen its subject sat in a wicker chair a section of the fiery brown city spread out behind her jeb remembered a time when he had felt so awkward in the presence of the womans beauty that he had found it difficult to look at her as he approached he fought the urge to look away for her part seeing him she fidgeted then crossed the garden and disappeared through a doorway saddened by her departure malone turned to see who had interrupted the session jeb he blinked as if he thought his eyes were tricking him how are you doing old buddy you promised youd keep in touch when you didnt i got worried surprised by jebs arrival malone didnt answer right away seeming not to know what to say keep in touch yeah i meant to but things got busy something like that youre a hard man to find jeb said all i had to go on was the russian heard you promise sienna on the phone that the two of you would come here its a beautiful city so i found out the next time i have to go to ground this is where ill do it jeb glanced toward where sienna had disappeared through the doorway he returned his attention to malone so how have you been malone hesitated good he thought about it everything considered youre looking well so are you malone studied him for the first time he spoke directly what do you want jeb just to see my old friend and find out how hes doing maybe have a few beers together catch up on lost time malone glanced down at his hands i guess im being rude what gave you that idea the playful sarcasm made malone smile slightly then he sobered hows the arm that damned bullet nicked a nerve or something the muscle twitches sorry no big deal but it is you did a lot for me malone glanced toward the doorway for both of us what about your job laster was furious that i went behind his back he assigned me to a desk until he decided whether he could trust me back in the field i know how sitting at a desk would drive you crazy it had its advantages it gave me a chance to watch laster malone frowned i couldnt stop wondering who bellasars informant was in the agency jeb said from the start it bugged me that laster had been so ready to believe the body in the east river was yours as fast as he could he canceled the backup id arranged in case you managed to get sienna off bellasars estate and there were other things the way he brought you and sienna to that safe house in virginia and prolonged your debriefing even though it was obvious wed gotten all the information we were going to then bellasar suddenly knew you were at the safe house the same way bellasar suddenly found out you and sienna were in mexico after i told laster malones gaze hardened so i checked his background hes got a wife two kids in college manages to live within his means the first couple of times i followed him he seemed to have the most boring life in the world but one weekend he broke his routine didnt go home and drove up to baltimore instead it turns out hes got another life up there another identity another house and another woman this one twenty years younger under his other identity he also has a bank account in the bahamas that got deposits from one of bellasars corporations hes looking at twenty years in prison not long enough malones voice hardened but when he gets out he and i are going to have a talk talk to me i mean it chase are you all right sure and what about jeb pointed toward the doorway fine sunshine through a window revealed numerous paintings on a wall all of them depicted the same beautiful woman youve been busy the two things i dont lack are time to paint and inspiration when an artist finds his beatrice malone glanced at the portrait hed been working on lost in thought arent you going to offer me that beer sorry malone looked displeased with himself i guess im still being rude sit down ill be right back but malone didnt return for several minutes sitting on a bench jeb heard an indistinct conversation finally malone came out with the beers sienna wont be joining us jeb asked shes a little under the weather thats too bad i was looking forward to talking with her she sends her best give her mine it went on like that for an hour a strained conversation between friends whom circumstance had parted jeb told him about how the cia and its french equivalent had worked quickly to cover up what had happened at bellasars estate claiming thered been an industrial accident one thing malone and jeb didnt talk about was what it had been like during the three weeks malone had struggled to keep sienna alive because no one was certain that the failsafe feature incorporated into the weapon would prevent it from being contagious after six hours the cloister had been quarantined after teams in biohazard suits had removed the wounded and the dead a thousandmeter perimeter had been established no one had been allowed on or off the obliterated estate ghostlike among the rubble the only building still standing the cloister had been the makeshift hospital in which malone guided by telephone conversations with physicians worked to keep siennas fever down to adjust her intravenous lines give her sponge baths with cool water and will her to live one of the most feared plagues smallpox had been eradicated in because few presentday physicians had ever seen its devastating effects malone was asked to make detailed notes about its symptoms all the more necessary because this was a new form of the disease the viruss unpredictability was the main reason the authorities had decided not to risk taking sienna to a hospital medicines and food were dropped by parachute in theory the disease wasnt contagious these precautions were needless but if malone developed symptoms plans had been made to use a thermal bomb on the area and destroy every trace of the virus malone hadnt known about that contingency any more than jeb recovering from his wound had known what malone was going through in the cloister jeb could only imagine and ask doctors what malone had said and later read the notes malone had made while taking care of her first had come the fever degrees then vomiting diarrhea and delirium then a rash of scarlet hemorrhagic blotches beneath the skin the doctors had told jeb the risk of death was greatest at this point spots had appeared on siennas face and neck the spots grew into blisters the blisters became cloudy at last the eruptions dried into scabs throughout the urge to scratch had been almost uncontrollable despite her weakness siennas efforts to claw at her face had been so powerful that malone had lost strength holding her arms down and at last had been forced to tie them to her sides when it appeared that she was going to live and that the virus was not contagious without its companion the authorities had relented on the quarantine removing sienna to a sealed ward in a hospital keeping a close watch on malone in case belated symptoms appeared meanwhile jeb had continued to recuperate when visitors were finally allowed into the ward jeb his arm in a sling had been the first to arrive but malone and sienna had been gone as the conversation drifted to a halt jeb finished his beer a breeze rustled leaves a distant drone of traffic blended with the sound of bees in the flowers malone didnt make an offer of a second beer how soon are you expected back in washington its kind of openended jeb said are you up for dinner tonight we really dont go out much just the two of us maybe i dont like to leave sienna alone sure jeb said should i drop around tomorrow malone didnt say anything well this is the name of the hotel where im staying jeb handed him a card he had taken from the lobby if you change your mind right malone put the card in his shirt pocket so jeb shook his hand say goodbye to sienna for me make sure you give her my best feeling awkward he turned toward the easel its a masterpiece youve never done better work yes and those other paintings jeb pointed toward the ones he had seen through the window theyre masterpieces too ive never been this inspired before take care of yourself jeb said and of her believe me thats the most natural thing in the world as jeb opened the gate malone went into the house ahead in the flower garden the whitebearded man asked jeb did you enjoy your visit with your friend its complicated his wife the elderly man said in wonder hes so devoted to her they never go out theyre totally content to be with each other theyve lived here six months and youre the first visitor theyve had they have each other what more could they want have you seen the paintings jeb nodded they all show his wife the elderly man said he doesnt paint anything else with work that exceptional he doesnt need to paint anything else but i dont understand the old man hesitated have you seen her briefly when i entered the garden she went into the house she always does that she avoids being seen what happened a disease and yet in the paintings shes so beautiful she is beautiful the old man looked puzzled whats on the canvas is what he sees jeb walked past the bright flowers and paused at the gray wooden gate he loves her so much jeb thought shell always be the most beautiful woman in the world about the author david morrell is one of america s most popular and
