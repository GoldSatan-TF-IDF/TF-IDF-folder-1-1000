ian slater south china sea prologue north carolina at the emergency response force training area at fort bragg one of the recruits was puzzled when told in no uncertain terms that he had to take his dog tags off put one around his neck the other in his boot why my boot because the sergeant said if we ever go into combat you might get decapitated then we wouldnt know who you are correction were thats nice thank god we aint at war sonny the sergeant said in his southern drawl shaking his head we could be at war anytime the new world order is disorder since the berlin wall came down since russias shakeup we got more flashpoints poppin up than you can shake a stick at thousands of miles to the east in the pacific west of the marianas the uss enterprise was in its prelaunch mode high up in the carriers island in primary flight control the yellowjerseyed air boss issued the command for all hands on deck for an fod or foreign object damage walkdown a dropped pencil or in the case of the female sailors aboard something as outwardly insignificant as a bobby pin could be sucked in and destroy a jet engine or take out the eye of a deck or air crew member the fod walkdown usually a tedious business with a string of sailors stretched from side to side on the flight deck heads all down was fast becoming a more popular duty with females to walk with and bump into the air boss didnt like the new pentagon order assigning women aboard all naval vessels except submarines quite frankly he was afraid a male sailors downward gaze would soon shift from a deck to a bosom and miss something what are you doing tonight a gunners mate stevens a head down asked ablebodied sailor elizabeth franks who was a grape a purple jacket a refueler they couldnt help but brush up against one another the line was so tight i think ill watch a movie she replied you ah said stevens a man shed never seen before think ill watch a movie too you know whats on dont care whats on he said shooting her a knowing glance how come she asked oh he said i come pretty much the same as any other guy only better sheesh cant you guys ever get your mind out of your shorts nope youre married she said seeing his wedding band so hey you two hollered a bosun less talk more walk stevens complained under his breath this is gonna be one hell of a cruise see you later stevens would see her later in the south china sea and it would be one hell of a cruise but for reasons none of the five thousand aboard the mighty carrier could possibly imagine amid the white and gold elegance of the white houses east room the president of the united states sat in the center front row listening to a string quartet playing vivaldis four seasons the music of fall passed into the bleakness of winter and in that moment he felt the full weight of his office politically the change from the cold war to the new world order had ironically meant more disorder than ever before and with the collapse of the soviet union america alone was the superpower but superpower or not it could not be the worlds policeman it could not be everywhere at the same time hard decisions had to be made involvement in the balkans and what used to be yugoslavia no somalia yes haiti yes and every time the president made such a decision it involved american lives the world now so volatile in the absence of the sovietus balance that trouble could and did start anywhere sometimes a place the president had never heard of before suddenly erupted in violence and was emblazoned across the worlds headlines via the vast electronic net of cnn in the music there were the stirrings of spring but winter still held sway and while the president of the united states listened to promises of spring thousands of miles west of the east room danny mellin was still deep in an american winter chapter one oklahoma one glance southward and danny mellin knew he was in trouble the advance winds of the twister coming his way having already dropped the temperature to minus thirty but he wouldnt stop drilling couldnt stop besides theyd reached feet and at a foot and already in the hole with the bank mellin figured he didnt have much choice his sturdy fivefootnineinch frame stood out against the oil rig as he watched the derrick hand fifty feet up the hundredfoothigh rig swing out and help bully a new sixtyfoot stand of pipe into position over a massive block snowdusted and black around its eye looking like some enormous predatory head bent on battering the rig to pieces beyond everywhere mellin looked the scene was an endless expanse of snow danny fortyfive but looking older was stamping his feet by the lazy bench the relief crew warming up in the tin doghouse whose loose roof panel kept flapping in the wind the bit was going through the oklahoma rock beneath the barren snowflat landscape at just over three feet a minute and danny started arguing with himself the logical reasonable half of him telling him to pull er out and wrap it up not to tempt the storm before they got to the fourthousandfoot level the seismic maps told him hed probably have another two hundred feet to go before he could hope for a good enough layer that might yield productionif there was any oil there at all everyone who wasnt a roughneck even some of the wormsthe apprentice roughnecks thought that all an independent like danny did was stand around the doghouse worrying the hole and that when he wasnt at the hole he must be wheeling and dealing in the taverns that it was all booze and pussy talk but danny had spent most of the week on the phone calming down a landowner who said that the mud and drainage pit danny had drilled last summer hadnt dried properly before being dozed over then there was the lease on the equipment with the mideast situation as dicey as ever everyone who had a truck and rusty pipe was trying to make a buck stateside sending the rentals cost skyhigh price of crude had shot right through the roof and it meant drilling for wells in country that would have been ignored a year before because of cheaper oil and it had brought out cowboys along with the roughnecks guys who were dreaming of a repeat of the big boom of the early eighties and who didnt think about the bust that could follow already half a dozen guys all of them over fifty most repatriated from the clinton cutbacks in the armed services after the iraqi war had lost a hand or a finger in the quick chain wrap as theyd tried to put on another thirtyfoot pipe this hole was rummer number rummer being the name of the landowner the first five holes had been dusters as dry as an oakies throat so the crew had dubbed this one bummer number six whats the mud doctor say the foreman shouted in the rising wind same dose as yesterday danny answered the truth was he hadnt had the rock fragments from yesterday analyzed by a geologist for the best cooling mud figuring from his own observation that the rock layer they were going through was the same as yesterdays he could be wrong but the geologist had been held up by the snow and danny wasnt going to wait every hour with a payroll of fourteen put him further in the damn hole besides you never knew when the next sucker could be your opener for a millionbarrel well then itd be hawaii and cold cans of coors from daylight to dark the shit it would be his foreman said youd start drilling waikiki danny yeah i reckon danny admitted he cupped his hands and shouted across the icecrusted platform what are we now thirtysix twenty the foreman shouted back when we get to fifty better start doing a drill stem glancing at his watch then at the vast bruised sky danny added wiley said hed be here round ten the foreman raised his thumb to show hed heard wiley was a kiosk geologist with a folddown foldup portable lab but analysts aside danny believed it was as much a matter of sheer luck you had to be in the right place a few feet either way and you could miss the pocket rock reservoirs of oil formed in the waves of sedimentary layers danny wasnt looking for hundredfoot jets of black gold shooting up in the air that was all clark gable and gary cooper crap all he wanted was enough pressure to tap the sucker and rummer was no dummy dirt farmer with his computer he knew the market almost as quickly as the hustlers on wall street and had insisted on one in six barrels before hed signed to give danny drilling rights everybody was upping the ante and some of the cowboys the johnnycomelatelies were rushing in to make their fortune urged by the government with new tax breaks to drill fast and deep in kansas they were even unzipping some of the stripper holes marginal wells of barrels a day that theyd previously plugged danny had been in the game for twenty years after nam and claimed he could smell oilimpregnated rock even before it was separated from the coolant anyway the cowboysd be sorted out in the first month or so when they didnt hear anyone yelling eureka theyd fold with the overdraft thats when you had to have balls danny told himself in hard times you dig deeper all the easy oil was gone didnt mean there wasnt a millionbarrel field around but you had to hang tough there was a hoarsethroated roar from the diesel engine coughing dirty coalbrown smoke into the virginal white of winddriven snow and everything started to rattle and shake tiny ice splinters falling down and hitting his hard hat like rock candy as the crew began hauling up pipe for the drillstem test danny put another stick of gum in his mouth the gum so stiff with the cold it broke like a board it would be hours before the test results came in for cryin out loud he said rolling the gums silver foil wrapper between his greasestained gloves his eyes squinting in the direction of a battered cherokee pickup snow blowing off the back of it like icing sugar it was rummer the farmer who owned the land he had every right to visit under the terms of the contract but in dannys twenty years a well had never come in whenever the landowner showed up they were plain bad luck danny the foreman called out yeah mud bags are frozen up danny was already holding rummer responsible for the lack of oil well unfreeze the fuckers he yelled back at the foreman adding that if rummer didnt come in today hed pack it in the whole shebang listen the foreman said encouragingly maybe old rummers different from the rest maybe hell bring us luck danny danny walked down from the platform smacked his boots together knocking off sticky mudcolored snow and asked the drill tester whats it look like the tester made a face like his mother had just died shit danny mumbled then seeing rummer walking over from the pickup the wind and freezing rain sounding stronger by the minute he put out his hand smiling broadly hi mr rummer how ya doin fine yourself terrific danny lied we could need hulls here any time he meant the sacks of cotton wool used to soak up the oil if it came up and slopped out over the derricks deck one of the roughnecks warming his hands in the doghouse shook his head looking over at one of the two worms on the crew we could have fuckall here thats what we could have danny had lost a worm once when a tornado screaming out of missouri had hit one of the derricks sucking the sixtyfoot pipe stands up high as if they were straw hed told the kids parents their boyd been killed while changing pipe danny had found that when you told parents that their son had died on a rig they didnt feel as bad if they heard he was actually working at the time rather than just standing around having been a special forces type in nam danny knew how he his parents and his wife maureen had felt when the army told him that angela one of his two sisters in nam a nurse was missing the other sister had been killed off duty in a medevac unit by socalled friendly fire danny wished theyd lied and said the viet cong had killed both missing meant a ninetynine percent certainty that angela was dead but there was always that one percent that made some nights hell for him and his family there was nothing unusual about the hurricane it came in as most do off cuba northwest up through the gulf laden with evaporated seawater slamming into the texas coast then pivoting halfway between corpus christi and galveston gusting at over two hundred miles per hour it immediately lost some speed and heat energy enough to generate houstons electric supply for years and though it hit the mainland there was still enough fury left for the midwest as the hurricane tore into the southeastern corner of oklahoma gusting to plus miles per hour long bruised spirals of tornadoes peeled off from the hurricanes eye wall a darker vortex already swirling purplishblack with rain and dust and debris about the calm core the spiral heading toward the rig was one of a dozen stalks of tornadoes formed in the same way howling with the bloodcurdling wail that mixed with the thunder and the rattle of an express train roaring out of control swirling tunnels of wind and rain preceded it smashing into the tinroofed doghouse tearing it apart sending the roof spinning high into the vortex and casting it down again a section of roof whirling faster now slicing off one of the roughnecks arms the bloodied limb sucked up and lost in the maelstrom into which several sixtyfoothigh barrels from the pipe stand had also vanished to come down a quarter hour later strewn over southwestern arkansas the roughneck bled to death most of the other dead the tornado left in its wake fourteen died when the hurricanes surge a towering wall of water over twentyone feet in height slammed into the texas coast east of corpus christi danny mellin and the rest of his remaining fiveman rig crew barely escaped with their lives it was the closest hed come to losing his life since his days in vietnam where he was taken prisoner and spent a year in the hanoi hilton so right then and there throwing up as he saw the mangled body of what had been one of his workers writhing in the snow danny mellin decided hed had enough of oklahoma hed work for someone else for a change somewhere hed be paid a lot for his experience somewhere someone else had the responsibility for the crew somewhere he wouldnt have to worry about a crew or making payroll or freezing in the bonechilling winds of a midwestern winter he decided hed work for one of the joint uschinese oil exploration companies operating in the spratly islands big pay and warmth his wife wasnt happy but he promised her hed stick with it for only a year and so it was that like the american in the s who had decided to escape a depressionracked america for a more simple peaceful life on a south sea island called guadalcanal danny mellin chose to work in the tropics on a drill ship in the south china sea no heavy gear to wear over there hell he told friends all youd need is your hard hat a pair of swim shorts and suntan lotion paradise chapter two south china sea beneath a tropical copper sky day was ending a current of heavy swells coming down south from palawan island in the southern philippines curving westward through the spratly islands and on over kilometers across the south china sea toward the lush green coast of vietnam the drill ship a halfchinese halfcalifornian oil venture the mv chical known to its crew as simply chical rose and fell with the swells her antiroll tanks minimized the pitch and yaw of the ship so that her drill rig would remain as perpendicular to the seas surface as possible the drill column going straight down through the moon pool where the chicals interior midships was open to the sea like a huge bright floodlit swimming pool down below there was the mystery of the coral reef and sedimentary layers as yet unexplored by the drill they might hold treasure if the profile gained by seismic shots was promising explosions of sound sent down to penetrate the subsurface layers reverberated back from folds or fault lines along which oil may have pooled or natural gas been enclosed if the drill ship as opposed to a drill platform didnt find oil over one reef it could sail on to the next site amid the archipelagos more than two hundred reefs cays and tiny islands what the chical lost in the stability of a fixed platform it gained in more seabed covered it was purely by chance that one of the chinese roughnecks working on the weather deck amid the forward portquarter pipe rack saw the junk the ling chow in the fading copper sea but he couldnt claim credit for seeing its flag vietnamese a yellow star on a bloodred background which was flying upside down the universal distress signal which meant its radio must be down or perhaps it had none the man who first recognized that the flag was upside down two of the stars five points on the bottom instead of at the top was danny mellin working a hundred feet high from a monkey board and safety harness up by the derrick mans console and upper racking arm and carriage danny pulled out his walkietalkie its aerial snagged for a moment in a strap of his mae west and told the pilothouse where chicals chinese captain could get a fix on the damaged junk the chicals captain seeing the junks minisail shredded ordered several chinese and american roustabouts to go starboard amidship to lend a hand bringing the junk alongside of course there was always a risk involved in the south china sea infested by modernday pirates who among other outrages had preyed so mercilessly on the vietnamese boat people trying to escape while the chical helped the ling chow drilling would have to be suspended for a while as the extra pitch and roll of the disabled junk its bamboo sail battens or stiffeners creaking in the wind would only add to the swells sloshing against chicals starboard side the sick man they brought aboard the mv chical was strapped down but nevertheless thrashing about in great pain his face drenched in sweat he jabbered incomprehensibly in a vietnamesechinese border dialect and the first aid man aboard the drill ship a roughneck called perowitz from new jersey was sent to have a looksee to calm him down apart from possible fever perowitz pressed the automatic thermometers green button and stuck it in the crewmans mouth there seemed to be no serious internal problems perowitz asked the man what hed eaten and his fellow seaman said some rice and fish had the rest of the junks crew eaten the same yes a man who seemed to understand a bit of english replied and had they all had something to drink i mean drinking the same stuff perowitz pressed one of the men who set the stretcher on the drill ships deck nodded urgently yes yes tsing tao it was the chinese beer that everyone drank on the chical as well so the best perowitz could suggest seeing how much pain the man was in the man indicating a lot of gas his hands arcing over his belly in the shape of a huge balloon was perhaps a good shot of peptobismol a couple of minutes after he had given the man the dose it looked as if it was working ah youve got a bellyful of gas thats all unknowing brown faces looked at him in the twilight you know perowitz said now in a pantomime mode gas you drill for one of the junk crew said what perowitz laughed no no not gas like we drill for you know uh fart they were still looking blankly at him when he bent forward and made a fart noise with his mouth their immediate recognition was hailed with raucous laughter and a splash off the stem mellin could hear the splash from high up near the derrick mans console since they had stopped drilling he radioed down to the well deck foreman hey randy yeah somebody threw something over you tell those junk boys not to dump any of their garbage could get caught up in our gear under the moon pool you got it the deckhand said and made his way over to the chicals starboard side only one or two of the dim figures he called out to understood what he meant and the captain of the junk said it wouldnt happen again sorry and that impressed several of the caucasian crew aboard chical because theyd always believed asians usually couldnt handle the r sound at that moment oil began rushing up spilling out like a fine spray as if it was a signal when in fact it was pure coincidence the rickety bamboo gangway leading to the chical was suddenly covered in crew from the junk and perowitz fell shot through the head the crew from the junk running past his body the twilight spiked by the barrels of their aks the first stutter heard by mellin came from the radio shack just aft of the wheelhouse the operator another american was dead even before his bulletriddled body hit the deck his blood made the decking slippery for those who quickly ran to the pilothouse spraying its glass then he finished off the three men on watch once inside one of the junk mens aks jammed as the chicals captain revolver in hand emerged from his cabin aft of the port side of the wheelhouse he got one shot away hitting an attacker who fell while another brought a short broadsword down hard and fast in a sweep disemboweling the captain even with all the noise going on the engine room crew of the chical didnt hear a thing the chief engineer checking the generating room gauges and making sure the tension on the stabilizer anchor chains wasnt excessive the chains helping to hold the ship as near one spot as possible the first engine room man to know anything was wrong was a virginian gary sales having just emerged from a forward hatch onto the well deck he was struck on the head by a short broadsword as the captain had been it split his skull his grayish brain oozing out beneath the bright deck lights as his body slumped and fell back down to the generating room with a sickening thud danny mellin was already on his twoway radio yelling a warning hearing it several men working on the aft well deck around the pipe rack dropped what theyd been doing and retreated toward the galley but they were slaughtered en masse by a dozen of the junks crew who had climbed up the stern ladder and then taking over the heliport raced down the gangway to the living quarters to butcher over twenty more americans and chinese asleep or resting off watch now in the darkness mellin understood the splash hed heard one of the junks crewmen had probably jumped off into the water prior to boarding the chical aft of the living quarters and galley but then why hadnt he heard more splashes and it suddenly occurred to him as he heard the zing and whack of mm rounds spitting up from the deck that they were climbing up the rig toward him he had only one way to go not up higher into the rig theyd keep climbing or firing until they got him and he couldnt go down hed have to jump the hundred feet into the sea instead but it had to be timed right when the chical rose and shifted from port to starboard on a long swell otherwise if he didnt get enough angle he wouldnt clear the ships deck he heard another burst of ak a sound which along with that of the older aks hed never forgotten from his days in nam and he heard the perspex in the derrick mans console splitting apart as it was raked by automatic fire then the deck lights went out red tongues of fire spat up into the derrick ricocheting zinging and whining about as the chical rolled to port danny clicked the safety harness release button and as hard as he could pushed himself off jumping out into the darkness that smelled now of cordite and salt air he hit feet first but at an angle his lower back slapping the water like hard rubber on concrete he thought hed broken his spine sighting the spray of phosphorescence as he splashed into the water the junk crew members fired into the general area a hail of hot sizzling mm and mm splattering about him mellin began a slow breaststroke away from the ship refusing the temptation to pull the c cartridge on his mae west an inflated vest would keep him afloat but would prevent him from swimming leaving him totally at the mercy of the current which was flowing away from the coast of brunei beyond the rig back farther west toward more of the spratlys hed wait and dogpaddle as long as he could until the junk had cast off then maybe he could swim against the current and back toward the drill ship it was hopeless and he knew it the current was too strong to swim against and he was swept slowly but inexorably out to sea away from chical his only hope now was to be picked up by one of the chicals weatherproof life rafts which could hold up to sixteen men this too was a vain hope for back aboard the chical the junks crew was systematically destroying every beaufort life raft canister and lifeboat on the drill ship mainly with grenades out of the sixtyfour men from geologists to cooks and drillers roughnecks and roustabouts crane operators and mud loggers welders and motormen fiftythree were dead leaving only eleven including mellin who had made it off the drill ship before the junk crew could get to them and now only six of these were still alive the other five already taken by sharks the predators attracted by the turbulence of ship bumping against ship and the smell of blood in the water killed the five all americans in a feeding frenzy around chicals stern now almost a quarter mile away mellin could hear the heavythroated chugging of the junk under way and nearer him he could dimly make out the jagged outline of oilsmeared planks in the north sea he would have been dead already from hypothermia but in the warmer waters of the south china sea his death would be a lingering one dying of dehydration in a world of water unless he were taken by sharks then he saw a high cone of roiling fire its orange tongue curling hundreds of feet high immediately followed by the thunderclap of an explosion the wellhead had been blown just as saddam insane had blown the wells in the middle east it didnt make sense what did they want now he heard popping sounds the junk crew using the madly dancing reflections of the wellhead fire on the water to take potshots at the chinese and american bodies floating about the chical the junk men making sure mat all were dead and in the strange penumbra of firelight mellin could see the black scimitars of shark fins cruising just below the surface danny thought of his wife maureen and promised god that if he were saved hed go back home and never leave the united states again he hadnt been this scared since nam and he began to pray again our father for if nothing else that would keep him awake something in his gut telling him that if his fatigue passed into sleep it would be the sleep of the dead now the mae west light went on the salt having activated it doing what it was supposed to immediately danny cupped his hand over the bulb cutting himself somehow on a nail in the loose raft of planks leaving blood in the water he jerked the c cord and the mae west inflated but he kept his right hand over the bulb lest the junk crew spot the pinpoint of light in the vastness of the sea and come to kill him he remembered a prayer hed always said with his two daughters when they were children tender shepherd hear me through the darkness be thou near me keep me safe till mornings light beneath his hand held over the light as if he was taking the oath of allegiance he could feel me pulsing of his heart it was so faint that for a moment he thought it had stopped the sound of the wellhead explosion traveling at least four times faster in water than in air raced up east of the palawan trough over the two thousand fathoms on the eastern edge of the south china basin through luzon strait past taiwan and west of the ryukyu islands trench where it was heard by a sound surveillance system listening post on taiwans east coast and another on the southernmost tip of japans southern island of kyushu from the sosus listening post on kyushu the message passed through the chain of command from the seventh fleets command ship blue ridge the message marked immediate to cincpaccommander in chief pacific copy to pentagon secretary of navy secretary of defense and on to the president as commanderinchief hours received substantial sonar blip stop estimate source spratly islands stop latitude approximately degrees north longitude degrees io minutes east stop sonar trace indicates manmade explosion not volcanic stop message ends chapter three the white house the message had merely mentioned an explosion and theyd have to wait till morning brunei time to find out exactly what was involved but the mention of the spratlys had admiral reese chief of naval operations already off and running the suspected explosion if it was manmade could be sabotage on one of the oil rigs or drill ships if so it opened a hornets nest of geopolitical significance mr president cno reese said there are two consequences that directly resulted from the earlier administrations defense cuts and lack of strategic overview in east asia number one they cut the budget first as usual then tried to figure out strategy back to front stern to bow admiral the president joshed reese allowed himself a brief smile in return but his mood was too braced for relaxing this day the second point mr president is that because of our cutbacks and our loss of subic bay and clark field in the philippines we are perceived by the east and southeast asian countries no longer as stayers i mean by this that our loss of a solid base from which to move into the south china sea despite the seventh fleets berthing facilities in singapore creates the perception in these third world countries and not only in them that this is not a united states determined to stay for the long haul and in that mode of uncertainty we have individual countries starting an arms race in the region they figure if the us doesnt have a firm foreign policy or rather a policy determined primarily by strategic responsibilities instead of budget deficit considerations then they have to look after themselves cant say i blame em the admiral turned to a wall chart on naval growth in the pacific china makes no bones about the fact that she wants blue water capability shes been hankering for it for a long time she hasnt got it yet but in our perceived absence she means to have it as quickly as possible sigint tells us that the chinese plan to be ready with carriers the new luhu guided missile destroyers and the new russian kilo derivative submarines by thats not far away mr president we had hoped we might continue to cut the us deficit by selling them some of our used carriers and other warships problem is russia is offering bargainbasement prices in china and southeast asia most importantly potential buyers know the russians can establish throughlife support and maintenance because the russians ironically keep building them while were cutting back and are unable to promise any kind of throughlife warranty the admirals assistant flicked over the china chart to one of japan a further measure of these asian countries independence is the fact that the japanese defense force for example now has the best shipcarrying air defense system in southeast asia the president interjected no sir the cno replied maybe he was getting through at last he thought the best in the world could i cut in here asked david noyer director of the cia please the president invited mr president in addition to what the admiral says the agency is convinced that japan has a three to fourmonth capability to develop nuclear bombs the president tried not to show any surprise but his assistant bruce ellman spotted the telltale push of the leatherbound blotter atop the desk where he was glancing at the cable from the sosus posts in twelve to sixteen weeks the president said youre telling me japan could field nuclear bombs yes noyer replied in november ninetythree they began importing over twenty tons of plutonium for their fast breeder reactors at least thats what they told us it was for they already had over five hundred pounds of the stuff by the late eighties that shipment from france admiral reese put in correct noyer confirmed reese shook his head disgustedly those damn frenchmend sell arsenic to their mothers if they could the president ignored george reeses wellknown francophobia which stemmed from frances refusal to let the us air force fly through french airspace en route to bomb khadafy in libya years before and reese added more to the point ill warrant that our intelligence agency isnt the only one that knows of the japanese capabilities he looked at noyer no offense to the cia david none taken admiral noyer assured him youve hit the proverbial nail on the head ever since shinseito the conservative new life party in japan gained power over the socialists theyve helped push the liberal democratic party majority in support of a more active role for the japanese defense force the japanese offense force the president posited well whatever they want to call it mr president i dont think you can fault them with that maniac north korean within nuclear and scudhitting distance of tokyo no the president agreed you cant but if i get your drift gentlemen youre telling me that because of our lack of a firm foreign policy compliments of the previous administration japan as well as the southeast asian countries weve mentioned in the area feel more vulnerable because of our withdrawal from the philippine bases so theyre seeking the capacity to defend themselves should north korea or anyone else start a war they also see japan rearming in the face of increased russian presence in the east china sea and know north korea probably has nuclear weapons in any case i seriously doubt that their southeast asian neighbors intelligence agencies dont know about japans nuclear ability too and that alone would frighten the bejaysus out of any of japans neighbors noyer and reese nodded in unison with reese turning to the next info chart exactly malaysia indonesia philippines vietnam china were all attacked by japan in world war two when her oil and raw materials ran out after fdrs embargo and if this spratly islands issue blows up and theres a shooting gallery in and around the trade routes from the middle east that pass through there then japan couldnt last very long without acquiring new oil and raw materials that come through to her via the south china sea so now the president said we have north korea south korea japan taiwan thailand malaysia singapore and indonesia all rearming as fast as they can yes sir even the aussies and new zealanders are upgrading why theyve got a defense pact with malaysia singapore and brunei but indonesias presence in west irian or what used to be called west new guinea is the australians big worry you think we have human rights problems with china visàvis our trade and mostfavorednation clause you should look at australias joint intelligence bureau report on what the indonesians are up to in west irian and timor its take the villagers out and shoot them on the spot besides indonesias population is million australias is barely fifteen and its only a halfhour hop from new guinea to australia all the aussies have up there in the north are crocodiles and darwin most australians are crammed into the far southeast comer weve got some damned important defense radar and communications sites up there reese concluded they wouldnt last long noyer said if the indonesians really wanted to get them but im not concerned about the aussies for the moment its all this strutting in the southeast asian states over the spratlys thats got me worried yes the president said cutting in weve got to run this spratly incident to ground if youll pardon the mixed metaphor before the accusations start flying giving every one of those countries the national justification for rearming nothing like a nice little war gentlemen to boost the ruling parties fortunes at home good point noyer conceded weve got our finger on the pulse with regards to that one our military attaches et cetera but its difficult to see the whole picture at any one time too many players too many or not the president continued weve got to get on top of this thing and i want the american public informed because if god forbid i have to send american boys over there i dont want it done on some damned flimsy bit of evidence noyer sighed itll be difficult i mean the american public isnt used to thinking about southeast asia now if it was europe well theyd better start the president said unequivocally because we all know gentlemen were on the threshold of the pacific century europes only going to constitute six and a half percent of the worlds population and in any case its going to have to fix its own business but if were to look after our business and i dont want to put this thing just in terms of dollars and cents but the dollars and cents are there nevertheless we need those asian trade routes more than most and we need them open all the time agreed noyer said i think we had better start some position papers for selected congressmen not for selected congressmen david for all congressmen thats another thing i dont want going on around here if it leaks out that were only giving the information to certain congressmen itll look like what it is selective feeding i dont want any part of that not in this situation i agree youre right the foreign policy of this countrys been a basket case due to the previous administration but nows the time and i hope to god it isnt too late that we can send out the message that we do not want nor will we tolerate another yugoslavia in asia mr president noyer said i wouldnt be honest with you if i didnt tell you that thats exactly what we might end up with initially the president conceded we may not be able to prevent that but my point is that if it starts were not going to have a grannies conference here and take six months to decide what were going to do i want the information about whats going on down there confirmed and reconfirmed and i want a usled un multilateral strategic and tactical plan on my desk within seventytwo hours that will tell me what we are in a position to undertake and perhaps more importantly what we are not in a position to do at the moment well do the best we can mr president another thing david the president warned noyer i dont want any cnn reporter scooping me on the larry king show got that yes sir how did they do that in iraq i mean cnn getting all that stuff out of baghdad used what we call a four phone mr president noyer explained you take a small umbrellalike antenna beam it up to the satellite and bounce it off right to home base very expensive well i dont want any four phones popping up with anything were not ready for understand i understand sir but theyre a determined lot then you be more determined very good mr president and notify the uns secretary general about this spratly situation as soon as you have details the president turned his attention to admiral reese george i assume the navys already on to this trying to find out just what happened to that drill ship yes mr president ive contacted comsubpac in hawaii and we have an ssn sub the uss santa fe west of borneo and the spratlys in the sulu sea its part of the enterprise battle group and is being dispatched via balabac strait between the philippines and the malaysian part of borneo surface or submerged surface through the shallow straits and submerged once we get into the spratly area but we cant get too close to the drill ship position because the bottom is relatively shallow around those coral reefs et cetera then how are you going to get anybody in there at least without advertising the fact the sub mr president it wasnt the closest but its one with an sdv aboard sdv swimmer delivery vehicle can carry up to half a dozen divers and they can exit the vehicle quickly its a separate container behind the sail of the sub so were sending in frogmen reese couldnt hide a smile of amusement i havent heard that term in thirty years mr president the swimmers will fan out and gather what evidence they can you think theyll find any theyre the best we have mr president and comsubpac has notified our british liaison officers with the royal brunei army british petroleum naturally wants to know whats going on as well apparently the rigs and drill ships are equipped with safety video units in cradles high above the deck its designed the video unit i mean to be easily scooped up from a chopper all right let me know as soon as you have something yes sir chapter four the reflections of flames danced madly in the blistershaped cockpit of the brunei armys bo helicopter as it sped out like a dragonfly across a flickering orange sea in response to the us seventh fleets request it sped toward the enormous flame shooting high above the drill ships rig one man in the chopper safely harnessed and ready to extend his reach down after steadying himself on the starboard strut to extract the videocassette from the high stanchion above the well deck mast by lifting a bamboo hoop attached to the camera unit while maintaining forward flight the pilot lowered his lever using the stick and pressing his rudder pedal to hover over a spot hed selected below on the well decks forward hatch the fuselage rotating slowly about the main hubs axis the bamboo hoop video camera and cassette in their allweather plastic sheath had sensibly been painted phosphorescent red and showed up clearly in the frenetic shadows cast by the fire whose roar was now so loud that the pilot and his observer in the harness could hear it above the neardeafening sound of the fourbladed rotor engine now the cockpit bucked violently and the pilot could feel the increasing torque as he fought to keep the helo steady in the waves of superheated air which above the seas cooler denser air created savage and shortlived convection currents and wind shears that buffeted the helo the bruneian pilot wrestled for control five times the helo rose and fell abreast of the stanchion each time getting a little closer until the bruneian in harness could reach out and grab the hula hoop and yank the attached video camera assembly out of its weatherprotected cradle a sudden gust blew the helo toward the stanchion and the pilot immediately moved to counteract it but he was a split second too late one of the rotors striking the stanchion the helo dropping like a stone toward an enormous shadow of itself on the ships deck sliding the full length of the stanchion and crashing into the well deck one of the rotors spars cartwheeled and sparked across the well deck and then into the derrick that was red hot from the roaring flame the spilled gasoline from the helo instantly became a river of fire that quickly raced back to the helos fuselage engulfing the shattered cockpit and the two men there was an explosion which sounded like no more than a pop beneath the steady roar of the gas fire still flaming unabated hundreds of feet up into the night sky though at a state dinner for the british ambassador his royal highness the sultan of brunei was informed immediately of the situation he was the richest man in the world and every bruneian citizen had one of the highest living standards in the world all because of bruneis oil from offshore as well as onshore his royal highness immediately put his tiny but superbly equipped man armed forces on high alert ordering bruneis three waspadaclass fast patrol boats to sea with two surfacetosurface exocet missiles per boat but with express orders from the sultan to search rescue where possible and identify but not to engage unless attacked within ten minutes the three bruneian patrol boats had six radar blips on their screens indicating anything from four junks to other commercial shipping including what looked like an empty supertanker off the coast of the brunei coastline heading south from the malay state of sabah in northern borneo and past the stricken drill ships position no survivors were found in the surrounding waters but the patrol boat nearest the drill ship was close enough to see in the spill of light created by the fire of escaping oil and gas bodies some of them blackened strewn about the well deck and the stern near the galley aboard the patrol boat a british army observer captain owen from one of the thousandman gurkha infantry battalions one of three british battalions stationed in brunei to help protect british petroleum interests volunteered to go aboard the drill ship he and two of the patrol boats crew were shortly on the well deck but the heat was so intense that they could feel it through their vibram soles paint on the well deck already blistering and flaking well have to go back owen shouted hose it down first for the next ten minutes while the two other boats headed farther out to sea the patrol vessel with owen aboard used its fire hose to drench that part of the well deck immediately beyond the drill ships ladder the paint blisters now washing off like great gobs of wet newspaper revealing spots of the red antirust primer below why do you wish to go aboard asked the boats skipper a spruce young bruneian in his late twenties theres not much to see i mean nothing more than you can see from here id still like a closer look owen said five minutes is all i ask very good the boats captain said in impeccable english well keep the hose spraying the well deck right you are owen responded once on the deck however he could still feel the heat through his boots he looked about quickly but could see no weaponry only the casings of expended mm and mm rounds owen also saw that to get near the bodies of the dead americans and others let alone remove them was impractical at the moment many of them so badly burned their flesh had melted into the deck so he left the drill ship none the wiser until that cools down we cant do much here he told the patrol boat captain whos going to shut it down owen shrugged one of the companies who stopped the fires in kuwait i expect but they werent at sea no owen agreed no they werent his expression in the raging firelight was one of mounting anxiety even if the fire was extinguished if they couldnt cap it it would be the biggest oil spill the world had ever seen a spill that would make that of the exxon valdez and penchara river look tiny a spill that would spread out and surround all the joint ventures spread over the south china sea and beyond in the cylindrical drydeck housing riding piggyback on the ssn santa fe the swimmer delivery vehicle mark xv was being checked over by two navy seals the combat swimmers were making sure that all systems were go aboard the flat sdv which measured twenty feet long by seven wide with its horizontal stern stabilizer and two vertical control fins the mark xv resembled a big formula one racing car shell minus the wheels mat had been squashed into a long rectangular shape in its nose a blunted triangular housing was a stateoftheart obstacle avoidance sonar the sdv was also equipped with a computerized doppler inertial navigation subsystem which would take it to the chical via its silentrunning nickelcadmiumbatterypowered motor its normal external component of two fourteenhundredpound torpedoes a pound warhead on each that once launched from the sdv could run at twenty knots plus was removed so as to raise the normal fiveknot speed to ten knots the two seals chosen for the looksee mission were ready to flood the piggyback housing to equalize the inside and outside pressure in preparation for launching their craft they could have disengaged from santa fe a half hour before but they were waiting to take advantage of promised bad weather via infrared cameras satellites had picked up a bank of anvilshaped thunderhead clouds stretching from sabah past brunei to sarawak a sure sign of thunderstorms building on the west coast of borneo and so the seals who would man the mark xv waited the santa fe meanwhile trailing her long vlf or very low frequency aerial receiving burst message updates on the weather in the santa fes combat information center the captain ordered silent running among other measures sandwiches would be prepared in the galley so as not to run the risk of any noise from the big food mixers that might send out telltale vibrations no matter how small even so unlike a diesel electric boat a nuclear sub like the santa fe could not be absolutely silent as the pump needed to keep the reactor cool could not be stopped but the santa fes captain was confident that the sound of his boat would not be detected by any potential hostile given the noises of other south china sea mercantile traffic also once the weather worsened and thunderstorms began the surface hiss of the torrential downpour would help hide the sound of santa fes water pump and the heavy cooling rain would also allow the seals to more comfortably board the hot drill ship when the torrential rain began the sdv was only a half mile from the chical and within fortyfive minutes the two seals had left the sdv and were climbing up the ladder aft of the drill ships galley housing the flames still roared high but the downpour was now so heavy that the decks if not cool were only moderately warm the derricks steel still hot was turning the rain instantly to steam in their rubber suits and frontmounted draeger rebreather systems the two seals moved cautiously through the hot fog as if through a giant sauna which covered the ship in a ghostly pink light one seal carefully and mostly by feel made his way down the aft galley ladder to the engine room there with the help of his waterproof flashlight which cut the steam in a sharply defined roiling beam he saw the first body the dead mans white boiler suit had blended so well in the hot steam now pervading the ship that the seal didnt see it until he was almost upon it he found a halfdozen more bodies strewn about in the engine room and as he had with the first carefully searched the dead mens clothing wrists ears mouths and chest areas up on the forward well deck the other seal also found bodies difficult to locate in the shroud that now covered the ship though the flame from the fire was still vomiting skyward as he got closer to the well decks forward hatch he found over twenty corpses in and around the paint locker and like his colleague searched every one as carefully as time would allow the heavy rainpeppered swells looked like great ominous walls closing in until they passed beneath the anchored drill ship the strain on the four anchors obvious from the crack and splitting sounds of chain and cable once back aboard their sdv docked aft of the drill ship the seals compared notes in all they had searched fortyone bodies the remainder of the drill ship crew either shot while in the water or like the two bodies found wedged and floating by the prop most likely killed from concussion after jumping overboard in panic and striking their heads on some part of the ship during midroll the two seals immediately sent their findings to the santa fe via their vlf transmitter brood one to mother stop drill ships wellhead afire stop all bodies except those in water devoid of valuables stop am returning stop message ends this transmission was quickly relayed through the chain of command up from the seventh fleets blue ridge to cincpac to the pentagon and finally to pennsylvania avenue the implication of the message was clear everyone aboard chical had been robbed only those wedged near the prop which was difficult to get to had retained wedding bands wallets necklaces watches and the like as with the boat people years before anyone with gold fillings or gold bridges had had them ruthlessly removed by pliers or whatever else would do the job so you were right the president told his assistant ellman it was nothing more than a damn pirate raid ellman nodded set the wellhead aflame to occupy us to cover their real intent vicious bastards the president said the thought of having gold fillings ripped from your mouth even if a body was dead was so barbaric it made his gut turn still better a gang of pirates than a clash of nations one countrys sovereignty breached by another ellmans press assistant suggested it could have been both but ellman shook his head no i think its clear that this is the act of a bunch of cutthroats plain and simple that possibility was to become a certainty on chical another joint chineseus venture platform already in production in the paracel islands five hundred miles southeast of chinas big island of hainan the paracels lying east of the gulf of tonkin were claimed by both china and vietnam the rig was afire and deserted except for the dead bodies picked out by a carrier planes reconnaissance infraredsensitive cameras again the message originated from the seventh fleet the overflight made by fs aboard the us carrier enterprise and was relayed through blue ridge up the chain of command to the white house jesus christ the president blurted would someone tell me what in hell is going on his angry surprise became outright alarm when he was told that while chical was southeast of hainan it was also effectively in the gulf of tonkin two hundred miles off vietnam vietnam and tonkin gulf were the two places in the world that no us president wanted to hear about ever again but by now over sixtyfive americans working in the paracels and spratlys had been murdered and cnn nobody knew how theyd found out so quickly wanted to know why and what the president was going to do about it already the white house phones were jammed with calls this was a leak the president thundered his clenched fist banging the desk a goddamned leak somewhere along the chain of command and i want to know who he was interrupted by ellman who seemed in shock mr president yes sir weve just heard via cias hong kong station that chinas moving an additional three pla divisions over forty thousand men to the chinavietnam border where on the border ah ellman looked quickly at his notes within striking distance of a vietnamese place called lang son has beijing made any statement yes sir apparently the move is to signal beijings displeasure toward and i quote the warmongering vietnamese imperialists who are blatantly attacking chinese possessions in the south china sea call the joint chiefs and whoever has the china desk at state yes sir ellman gave the task to his junior while he himself called the secretary of the navy mr secretary bruce ellman white house sir were in damagecontrol mode re this business in the spratlys and paracels and the media are clamoring are you up for the larry king show no it has to be this week sir otherwise itll look like we dont know whats going on do we no but were trying to no ellman knew he was on his own chapter five in ho chi minh city once called saigon the night was filled with the sounds and smells of scooters and vendor stalls for even with galloping inflation enough of the million vietnamese in the city had been able to buy the threethousanddollar twostrokepowered motorbikes no doubt sacrificing much along the way to own a scooter in vietnam was like owning a car anywhere else despite familiar odors of gasoline fumes mixed in with the pungent smell of cooking and spices it was still nothing like saigon used to be it lacked the excitement and zest of the old asian paris nightlife still even though it was more than twenty years since vietnams defeat of the americans in the socialist republic of vietnam had failed to kill the entrepreneurial wiles of beggars and ladies of the night it was simply more organized many of the beggars in good health had been sent to reconstructive labor battalions a move that us army captain ray baker assigned to the us legation office endorsed as he walked through the dimly lit city with a mixture of nostalgia and anger it had been difficult enough to accept the defeat every american alive at the time and not only those who had fought in nam had that picture frozen in their memory the sight of a lone chopper poised atop the american embassy a string of frantic people falling from it trying to board those already aboard shoving them off everyone for himself americans and south vietnamese in panic and then there was the sight of huey choppers heading out from the delta over the south china sea like so many angry gnats dotting the sky fleeing again in panic landing atop a seventh fleet carrier and once the human cargo had been disgorged not going back again but being pushed overboard three million dollars a pop and when the carriers couldnt provide any more deck space the helo pilots cut off the engines coming down in a semicontrolled crash pancaking on the sea with about thirty seconds to escape before the doomed chopper began its slow then sudden dive to the bottom bodies floating up and swimming soundlessly beneath the noise from the sixthousandman carrier as many on deck as possible against orders just standing there witnessing the historic humiliation and debacle of me awesome american defeat this evening ray baker wanted to evict that image from memory but the more he tried the more persistent and nagging it became and for a moment he was glad it was nighttime as if the darkness could somehow hide his private sense of humiliation but on second thought what the hell did he have to be ashamed of anyway hed done his bit hadnt he or was he unconsciously harboring the secret torment that if hed done that little bit extra during the war if enough of them had done more gone that extra mile it might have been enough to turn the tide for some vets who had fought in the iraqi war a full measure of selfrespect had been reclaimed but baker had not been with schwarzkopfs winning team while many of his buddies had been racing over the desert destroying saddam insanes armor and closing on the republican guard when the most terrifying phrase for the iraqi combat pilots was permission to take offray baker was sweating in the shirtclinging tropical climate of the mekong delta still trying to find out after twenty years what had happened to all those unaccountedfor mias and pows who some believed were still held prisoner deep in the jungles of the north tonight he was going out to meet yet another lead the followup to yet another informants phone call about yet another powmia tip another new dong ten us dollars just for the meet another ten for whatever his informant told him even if it was bullshit otherwise the informant might not come back if he did find something more concrete at a later date at the us legation office they told baker he was wasting his time and he knew they were probably right but if after all these years he could bring even one american out bring one american home it would be worth something for himself yes for the mans family it would be everything it was worth doing he lit another cigarette and made his way toward the heart of cholon the big market district largely populated by chinese once a thriving capitalist community but now much less so after the antichinese purges of the late s now and then amid the gasoline fumes of the scooters baker could smell the freshly made french bread croissants and coffee from the sidewalk kiosks there were dozens of them the people of old saigon refusing to give up the habits and civilities that had once made this vital part of the old city one of the busiest capitalist enclaves in all asia the communists had realized their mistake in ostracizing so many chinese and were now letting many of them back to revitalize the ancient city of french indochina but many had already escaped through hong kong or been killed by pirates who boarded the boat peoples sailboats to steal rape and murder baker walked down an alley lit by chinese lanterns heading for hung vuong boulevard he passed the electronics market with radios blaring turned onto ngo gia tu boulevard and passed the nha sau church although he was over a quarter mile from the kinh tau hu canal to the south he could smell its garbage mixed with gasoline and dust and the odor of more baking in the hot sticky air still he would rather meet whoever had made the phone call here than at vo van tan in the war crimes museum where the last vietnamese who supposedly had a hot tip had insisted on meeting him baker had been compelled then to see the black and white photographs of atrocities by american imperialists specifically the american photo of the my lai massacre and lieutenant calley and some fuzzy shots of chinas imperialist aggression against some of the vietnamese islands in the paracels and the spratlys chao it was a softly spoken hello filled more with apprehension than warmth chao baker replied toi the chinese urged leading the way he was a man in his late thirties baker guessed no more than five feet two at the outside and looking furtively around as they passed one of the sidewalk stalls its wooden plank shelves bent with glass jars full of pickled cobras the old woman in the stall busy cooking rice the chinese man told baker that it wasnt far what isnt far baker asked not bothering to hide the irritation in his voice where are we going not far the other man said and baker realized that he was probably just a gobetween and would cost him another dong if this turns out to be nothing he told the man as he walked more quickly now passing stalls smelling of fried rice and spices you get nothing understand zero zilch co phai the man assured him co phai yes yes i understand good baker said they made a sharp right turn onto nguyen tri phuong boulevard heading toward the canal down by the waterway the chinese pointed to a sampan with an old man aboard among dozens of others then held out his hand not so fast baker told him in english lets hear what grandpa has to say i go now the man said urgently his hand outthrust well off you go buddy baker told him but you dont get one dong until i hear from uncle ho here the elderly chinbearded chinese on the sampan gave no indication that he knew what was going on he merely stared out from the boat at the black water baker touched his cap as a sign of respect for the elder and said chao the old man nodded the white taper of his beard barely visible for a second as he turned to watch a police boat chugging by its searchlight darting here and there momentarily illuminating the scores of sampans and other houseboats parlezvous français the old man asked no baker replied getting more irritated by the second why in the hell was he wasting his time by the fetid canal when he could be enjoying a good drip coffee and croissant back at his office the old man raised his head in the direction of a younger chinese nearby perhaps his son indicating that he should go away the young one didnt like it and said something sharp to the old man who in turn barked a quick rejoinder and waved him off the young man walked sullenly along by the canal and in the habit of the chinese paused for a long spit standing there letting it dribble down his chin before he moved on casting a faint shadow on the lanterns silken reflections as they undulated over the wake of the passing police boat i know a secret the old man said baker said nothing a bad thing has been done the old man continued in no hurry to explain himself baker took out a gitane and lit it its pungent odor floating about the sampan shrouding the old man momentarily in a dark fog how many times had he waited like this for information baker asked himself for the merest suggestion of some of the mias who were either buried by now or had been kept as prisoners until they were of no more use to the black pajamas as the viet cong had been known to the americans how many times had he waited for one decent lead the gangsters in beijing are in charge the old man said li pengs gang theyve always been in charge baker said impatiently he remembered the words of the historian bo yang with each new dynasty and each new reign throughout chinese history the throne has never changed only the ass that is on it but not so much when chairman deng was alive deng baker answered was as bad as the rest of them who called in the tanks at tiananmen square but deng understood how far to go did he i wouldnt know you should ask the students who were run over still the old man said there must be order baker had had enough do you know anything about americans still being held pows mias yes what do you know that li pengs gang have done a bad thing you mean some mias have been taken across the border into china possibly but i mean this giving money to the pirates look baker said exasperatedly do you have something to tell me about our mias or not with that the american straightened up ready to leave adding there have always been pirates they made a fortune smuggling cigarettes liquor plundering the boat people thats not news but this the old man said insistently making the point with his left forefinger bent crooked down like a fishing hook the shape of vietnam this is to make vietnam look like the aggressor what are you talking about what aggression against the disputed islands baker didnt know too much about any disputed islands china and vietnam were always arguing about some offshore reef or such especially now with the promise of big oil and gas deposits beneath the south china sea and with oil accounting for more than a third of all vietnams exports but though bakers concern was mias he now sensed there was something bigger at hand it wasnt the old mans chin wagging about li pengs gang but rather his tone it was the voice of a man who was too burdened who had heard something in the sampans or the stalls and had to share it at first baker wondered why the old man a chinese would be badmouthing china but if there was something china was doing or about to do that might bring down the wrath of the vietnamese on the chinese vietnam community like the pogrom of here in ho chi minh city from which so many chinese fled some taking to the open sea he could appreciate the old mans concern how will beijing make vietnam look like the aggressor baker asked the pirates are to use the vietnamese flag for what for attacking disputed islands the flag is to be upside down distress signal yes it is to get in close the old man looked at baker with a face the color of ancient parchment how long have you been here in vietnam five going on six then baker fully understood it was like looking through a microscope suddenly seeing a blurred slide jump into focus you mean the chinese pay pirates to use the vietnamese flag so everyonell think its vietnamese attacking but why was the old man telling him this because baker continued answering his own question it would cause trouble between china and vietnam again and when theres that kind of trouble the vietnamese take it out on you he meant not only the chinese in cholon but all over vietnam the old man nodded we are the jews of vietnam but all we want is to live here in peace and harmony you want me to tell someone in washington that vietnamese chinese arent involved that its beijing behind the attack on the islands yes beijing will deny it of course let me get this straight you say beijing is doing this attacking the oil rigs yes the old man said to give beijing an excuse to seize all the islands in the south china sea you think beijings so corrupt baker went on that it would use pirates to attack two of its own rigs kill its own baker stopped it was a foolish question these were the men who had run over hundreds of their own students a few dozen oilrig workers wouldnt faze them but wouldnt this put off american investors as well he asked not if beijing and some american investors know the truth of it but that would mean an american company would have to go along with the old man smiled it wasnt a smile of joy but rather one of wry amusement at the americans naïvetéto think a us company would not secretly side with beijing and to think beijing would be concerned about a few chinese workers was to be in a kind of kindergarten of politics what were a few lives to beijing if they could use the attacks to bring the world against vietnam in beijings push to claim all the islands as theirs all baker could respond with was to say that americans would never do such a thing stage an incident kill their own to frighten away the competition in this case vietnam you americans the old man said confidently you hold the individual so sacred here we are but grains of sand in the ocean but wont the vietnamese twig i mean wont the vietnamese suspect the raids were to blame them of course the old man replied but for the vietnamese to retaliate against china would be an act of war it would be to risk international sanctions against vietnam and it has taken hanoi over twenty years since the vietnam war since the american defeat to build relations up with the us again its only a few years since the us embargo on trade with vietnam has been lifted then china is free to keep hitting whatever claim they like baker asked be their own agents provocateurs frighten everyone off the islands then say theyll have to garrison them with troops for selfprotection yes baker shook his head worriedly but without proof i cant go anywhere with this wed have to have proof that the old man was astonished but you are an american officer he said as if that explained everything if you tell your government what i have told you surely they wont believe it or rather they might believe it but they wont do anything unless theres proof positive but you are an officer a i am a grain of sand baker said besides why should i believe you with respect this could be a vietnamese ploy to attack their own islands in the paracels to make it look as if the chinese but i have told you the truth the old man said his head rising in indignation and where did you get it baker asked from people of my blood who were offered gold to sail with the pirate junks baker could see hed deeply offended the old man im sorry but i mean id need proof otherwise its just another story in a sea of stories that one hears dalat the old man said near dalat dalat was a temperate city in the central highlands and during the vietnam war there had been an unwritten mutual agreement that it was a nofire zone both sides had used it for rr in one of the stranger aspects of that longago conflict the weather in dalat was always good at the coldest it would rarely fall below degrees fahrenheit and at its hottest wouldnt rise to much more than degrees a place of gardens of tranquility it would be pleasant to visit if for no other reason what about dalat baker pressed to show you i am a man of the truth baker nonplussed waited impatiently it had become cooler a waisthigh mist covering the canal creeping toward the congestion of sampans and other river craft in dalat there is an mia baker felt his heart thumping where in dalat i will tell you if you will tell your government what i have told you yes baker said ill send in a report the mia is in a village near lang bian mountain the old man said north of dalat the people of lat village will help if you give them this he took a small scrimshawed sharks tooth pendant from around his neck when will you leave baker gave the old man twenty dollars to be shared with the gobetween in the morning afterward baker sent a message to the pentagon about what the old man had told him concerning the attacks on the oil rigs but he cautioned that it was only one old mans story amid so many when morning came baker did nothing about the mia there was nothing he could do until he got special permission from the vietnamese lam dong province in which dalat was situated in the central highlands over kilometers north of ho chi minh city had been closed again to united states citizens who were still being charged by the vietnamese with covertly supporting the fulro front unifié de lutte des races opprimés united front for the struggle of the oppressed races guerrillas in the highlands the cia had long denied any continuation of funneling arms but now and then fulro rebels would stage another ambush or shoot up one of the supposedly secret vietnamese reeducation camps which rumor had it were still run for some us pows and mias in the evening baker went down to the canal to talk again to the old man to get more details but he was gone baker found him near midnight in a sampan that was bumping among the bridge pilings his throat cut he guessed the old man had been killed for what hed known either about dalat or about the pirates attacks in the paracels and spratlys what baker hadnt banked on was the vietnamese response to the very first attack in the spratlys but then again the vietnamese had had dealings for a thousand years with the chinese and they decided to react immediately rather than let their traditional enemy think hed gotten a toehold in vietnamese waters hanoi headquarters ordered the haiphong base to attack and within the hour with an efficiency that after the vietnam war or what the vietnamese had called the second indochina war was among the best response times of any asian coastal navy two sovietmade osaclass missile craft armed with four surfacetosurface n missiles raced out into the gulf of tonkin ready to attack anything chinese the flag behind each of the missile boats that of vietnam fluttered furiously as the osas bows lifted and the brown water boiled in urgency the vietnam missile boats picking up speed heading southeast to the chineseoccupied islands in the paracels the boats crews however were under no illusion for they knew that they were heading toward the peoples liberation armys new navy which beijing had boasted was nothing less than a great wall of iron ten miles from the nearest chineseclaimed island in the paracels one of the vietnamese boats radar picked up two blips advancing from the east at thirty knots plus two chinese huchuanclass fastattack hydrofoil boats a vietnamese osa fired its starboard forward ssn missile the chinese hydrofoil immediately going into a defensive weave pattern closer now the vietnamese osa fired a second missile its backblast on the stern immediately raising the osas sharp bow so that she gained a knot or two the vietnamese captain saw one of the huchuanclass hydrofoils leap into the air and crash down again its portside foil shattered along with the midships and cockpit now a crushed pile of smoking metal the chinese hydrofoil had turned hard astarboard as the orders were given by its skipper to abandon ship the second chinese hydrofoil fired its starboard twentyoneinchdiameter torpedo from its large corrugated housing and now its mm machinegun stations opened up against the fastturning vietnamese boats which suddenly slowing near the site of the injured and sinking huchuan hydrofoil machinegunned all those chinese in the water great wall of iron snorted one of the vietnamese skippers motioning toward the detritus of wreckage and bodies the second chinese hydrofoil had already fired its torpedoes but they were easily avoided by simply opening the throttle allowing the vietnamese osas to skid in wide thirtyfiveplusknot semicircles there was some stray machinegun fire from the chinesemm tracer playing about the osas hitting the monkey island or clearweather bridge on one of the vietnamese boats but doing no more damage than that hanoi now broadcast to the world via an accommodating cnn that vietnam had punished chinese aggressors in vietnamese waters in reply the chinese vehemently denied that they had violated vietnamese waters but stated that the peaceloving peoples liberation navy had been patrolling as was its right within two hundred miles of its coastline which included the big island of hainan and from hainan it had every right to patrol another two hundred miles as hainan was indisputably chinese territory beijing immediately requested a meeting of the un security council to impose sanctions and other disciplinary measures against the imperialist aggressions of the republic of vietnam bandits vietnam followed suit and asked for un sanctions against china the fear on both sides of the dispute and wellfounded fear was that the issue would be ponderously delayed while no action would be taken in the meantime both beijing and hanoi were accusing each other of violating the others zone of ownership it was a very capitalist argument as seen by the wall street journal in new york today a un meeting of southeast asian and east asian nations called to decide who owns what in the oilrich archipelagos of the south china sea ended in uproar as the chinese and vietnamese representatives came to blows over ownership of the disputed islands as well as being rich in oil and natural gas deposits the islands the paracels to the northwest and the spratlys in the southeast are also strategically vital to naval and mercantile routes to and from japan and the united states the us state department is closely monitoring the talks which it hopes will resume on monday moscow and tokyo are also watching the talks closely as the outcome could have serious and wideranging geopolitical implications for all island disputes particularly the socalled northern territories islands in contention between russia and japan chapter six japan it was pm hours on the clock at the japanese intelligence headquarters in tokyo and henry wray of the us central intelligence agency sat quietly enjoying a cigarette something he couldnt do in langley virginia because of the strict nosmoking laws his two japanese hosts lit up as well at he watched his japanese counterpart turn up the volume of the sanyo shortwave receiver at two officers of the jdf japanese defense force entered the corklined room bowed to the civilians four in all from japanese intelligence and took their seats the red light of the tape machine signaling it had already begun at precisely twelve midnight the transmission from somewhere in north korea began fourdigit numbers until when the code abruptly finished all we need now wray said is their onetime pad if thats what they are using his japanese host replied hmm its what id use wray told them you people are so far ahead in computers i wouldnt run a network on computer digitization id be afraid youd descramble it in a couple of weeks weve been trying for months mr wray call me henry he turned to the two officers from the jdf how about infiltration of the chongryun it was a large expatriate pronorth korean organization in japan that raised millions of yen for pyongyang nearly ten percent of all north koreas urgently needed foreign exchange was from korean workers remittances abroad it and others the japanese said problem is we have no idea how many north koreans they are broadcasting to whatever the number of agents listening the cia and japanese intelligence knew that by now there must be a large organization of illegals as well as those who had immigrant or visitor worker status in the pay of pyongyang should hostilities ever break out either domestically in japan or between japan and north korea the chongryuns association of north koreans and deep cover agents would come out en masse like ants from a nest to sow confusion aimed particularly at japanese transport and communication networks chapter seven the chinese invasion of vietnam began at hours the first crossings made on a fourmile front through a marshy area ten miles north of the vietnamese town of lang son and on the left flank at the border town of dong dang all three divisions used in the attack about pla chicom regulars had already traveled from nanning in the chengdu military region by rail to pingxiang near the chinesevietnamese border in the vietnam war it had been a favorite staging area for nva regulars to take possession of chineseshipped arms and munitions now in this latest chapter of the long border battle between the two countries pingxiang once again became the jumpoff point for one countrys invasion of the other the chinese forces were intent on overrunning the junglecovered hills before lang son and the plains beyond which ran down to the red river delta and the gulf of tonkin seaport of haiphong the chinese were asked by the secretary general of the un to disengage and withdraw immediately from the border areas but china citing the pirate actions of the vietnamese imperialists against a chineseowned oil rig and drill site in the south china sea insisted that vietnams actions amounted to nothing less than an act of war the un secretary generals office pointed out to beijing that in fact both chineseus venture sites were not within the twohundredmile economic zone of china china disputed this replying angrily that several joint chineseus ventures in the paracels were within two hundred miles of the coastline of the big chinese island of hainan and that mv chical while beyond the twohundredmile zone was historically owned by china as chinese fishermen a century ago had been there first to fish and to use the islands and reefs in the south china sea for repairs and the like furthermore a statement from beijing added if the imperialist vietnamese did not remove their equipment and men from all the islands in the south china sea these would be seized by the pla as they historically belong to the peaceloving chinese people hanoi retorted that this is typical of the warmongering imperialists in beijing who arrogantly aggrandize the territories by intimidation and threatand that if china did not recall its three divisions back to chengdu the republic of vietnam would have no alternative but to repulse the chinese with all available forces suddenly the president of the united states and his advisers with help from the state departments china and vietnam desks realized an uncomfortable truth the island dispute was centuries old like a fight between neighbors the hatfields and mccoys the president realized who had actually attacked whom was in the final analysis irrelevant what was relevant was that the chinese claim to own all the islands in the south china sea was preposterous by any measure and with the chinese and vietnamese on the brink of allout war the only consideration was how to stop it before it became general war in the asian region because of this clear and present danger and the catastrophic effect it would have on the us tradedriven economy the us might have to intervene albeit under the auspices of the un the chinese attack south on dong dang with two divisions was led by general wei the other prong an attack of one division thirteen thousand men on lang son was led by general wang the assault on dong dang was made up almost exclusively of infantry brigades with one armored division leading the thrust south down the pingxiangdong dang road and railway the road ran more or less parallel with the rail tracks allowing wei to move twice as many troops as would have been the norm on the road alone once dong dang fell it was hoped by wei that wangs forces on his left flank coming down east of him from zhilang in china to lang son in vietnam a distance of about thirty miles would be able to quickly sever the rail line running south from lang son to hanoi eighty miles away thus cutting off the rail line the vietnamese army would need to rush reinforcements to the north but the vietnamese army already having explosive charges set at ban re seventythree miles north of hanoi blew both the rail line and the road at ban re this prevented the chicoms from capitalizing on their sudden attack south of the border and halted general wangs troops before they could press the attack farther south toward hanoi to the north of ban re at dong dang general wei had better luck being able to reach the na ann junction thirteen miles west from dong dang there weis infantry and armored battalion equipped with ts upgunned ts managed to sever two roads the one leading northwest from na ann junction to quinh son and na nien the other running south to phu lang thuong thirty miles northeast of hanoi the chinesevietnamese border itself barely a hundred miles from hanoi the two prongs of this strong chinese pincer attack however were not so much strategic as tactical in design the chinese did not intend to stay but merely to shell and destroy as much of lang son and dong dang as they could as they had in and then withdraw it was in short meant to be a military punishment for what the chinese were calling blatant unprecedented vietnamese attacks against the chical drill ships in the paracels and spratlys in any event neither general wei nor wang wanted to penetrate much farther south as it was they lost over four hundred casualties to minefields the vietnamese had laid down after chinas incursions vietnamese forces despite the fast chinese attack reacted swiftly from the vietnamese garrison at na sam seven miles northwest of dong dang and from loc binh twelve miles southeast of lang son a twopronged counterattack was launched by four regular infantry divisions well seeded with viet cong veterans who as young men had fought in the south against the americans during the vietnam war weis and wangs forces in danger of encirclement began to withdraw but by day four after the initial chinese invasion the vietnamese troops had cut off the chinese retreat from na ann and lang son only those chicoms from dong dang were able to withdraw with only light casualties beijing had only two options now to give up those infantry battalions of wei and wang that had been surrounded and thus trapped by the vietnamese regulars or to send in more chinese troops to release them beijing realizing that the defeat of their incursion would be a singular loss of face in a part of the world where face and therefore the nations standing in southeast asia indeed throughout all asia was at stake accordingly beijing ordered an allout invasion not merely to rescue their embattled infantry divisions but to widen the war and gain a buffer zone of territory militarily shortening the distance between hanoi and the old border from a hundred miles to something much closer if this was achieved then in the future any vietnamese hostility aimed at china could be quickly punished by massive retaliation against what was hoped would be a much closer target namely hanoi which might in turn be ringed by chineseplanted minefields and surfacetosurface missile batteries meanwhile the vietnamese raced to reinforce the border zone between and around dong dang and lang son chapter eight ellman told everyone in the oval office that the last thing they needed was indecision based on a lack of coherent foreign policy which we inherited from the previous administration we have to avoid giving mixed signals a foreign policy thats cut from the cloth of the moment an ad hoc way of proceeding which will make the us look indecisive and weak visionless this would have adverse effects for us all over the world trade deals suddenly put on hold et cetera and an overseas lack of confidence would have a direct effect on the dollar and so on so that pretty soon wed see a domestic downturn in the economy the direct result of those overseas having lost confidence in a firm american position you can bet your life that all the major oil companies and the subsidiaries which form their infrastructure et cetera are watching what we do over these attacks in the south china sea noyer cut in ellman is absolutely correct whoever started this row wouldnt have dared to stir up trouble were it not for our hitherto wishywashy foreign policy the chinese saw what we didnt do in yugoslavia not what little we did in haiti and why shouldnt they risk it they can always pull back though i dont think they will unless forced to loss of face you see yet the president said can you imagine the response if i were to go on tv and announce that we are unilaterally going in to support the vietnamese the communist vietnamese you could limit the support mr president ellman charged by providing what the vietnamese need most air support limit our action to sending in a carrier battle group to operate from the south china sea and the chinese air force the president asked minimum threat to our battle group reese said im not saying itd be plain sailing and the chinese do have some squadrons of fulcrums migs wed lose some of our aircraft but wed beat them no question the president was looking intently at the cno as if he wanted more what about their submarines a bit dicey reese replied they dont have anything like our capacity but some of their seventyfour diesels whose props are superanticavitationtreated due to that bastard walker selling us out could sit still and itd be hard to find them yes but theyd have to come up sooner or later admiral yes sir but almost certainly at night the admiral could see the lines of consternation on the presidents face i dont think thered be any problem in the end mr president he added i just want you to know that the opposition might have a trick or two up their sleeve that we dont know about thats all so the president said leaning forward over the blotter doodling and summarizing you all agree our policy should be as coherent in the south china sea as it is in the mideast if you invade a neighbor youll risk having the eagle swoop especially ellman added if you risk fouling up the sea routes and oil supply in this case through the south china sea trust me the president assured them i wont dodge the oil issue and dress it up as anything else ill say unequivocally that the western democracies need it especially japan and the us and if the flow turns to a trickle the eagle will more than swoop at the same time however our intervention cant be purely economic we are as the leading and most powerful democracy going to put it on record that we are against the communist invasion of one country by another weve got to stabilize the region goddamn it we want a new world order not more disorder ironic isnt it ellman commented that since the berlin wall came down we end up having more wars around the world than ever before im not saying we should go back to the bad old days of the cold war but at least you knew the rules this is our side thats your side and dont walk on the grass can you imagine that butchery in rwanda in ninetyfour and ninetyfive happening if the soviet union had still been strong enough to exert its influence ellman paused still if we put ourselves on record now as opposing the invasion of one country by another well be accused of assuming the role of the worlds policeman so be it the president said besides as you suggested we dont have to commit troops air and naval interdiction cruise missiles included would pack a sufficiently large wallop to disincline any wouldbe bullies on the block well be called the bully admiral reese commented nevertheless the president said tonight i go on record by saying that we will not stand for any more yugoslavias or rwandas and we can set up air and naval blockades in any case we wont be impotent in the face of challenges to world peace a pax americana noyer said he like reese wanted to know how far the president would be prepared to go if you want to call it that yes the president conceded well we sure as hell cant leave it up to the russians and i dont mean to exclude anyone who wishes to help lord knows canadian peacekeepers british troops from brunei australians perhaps because of their interest in southeast asia i agree the more the better noyer said and the president said if we cant beat chinas veto on the security council we could still rally a force of friends in the general assembly so were not seen as acting just on our own convictions where will taiwan stand in this admiral reese asked its tended to favor a beijingtaipei fiftyone fortynine percent split on any oil and gas find in the south china sea taiwans a wild card in my view ellman said it could go with us but god help us if it goes with beijing the president was noticeably struck by the danger of this possibility good god weve equipped the taiwanese we have reese confirmed ever since truman and cash my check suddenly it seemed as if all the steam had gone out of the presidents stance of no exceptions to his idea of the rule of geopolitical stability that is if the taiwanese joined china in the island dispute it might very well bring the united states in against one of its oldest and staunchest allies the presidents hands were clasped tightly his skin blotching this is a decision gentlemen that taipeill have to make is its potential oil split of fiftyone fortynine with mainland china worth wiping out all its good relations with the us but mr president ellman began thats a risk i wonder yes yes i know bruce it is something you would like to have an idea about first all right well sound out the taipei representative here right now but the point im making is that my job and my intention is to lead this country not to prevaricate trying to court every single congressman over to our side i want their support ill ask for it but in general terms ill not plod through this one hoof at a time if you do that you end up with a mishmash of conflicting policy statements he paused look over sixtyfive american citizens have been murdered murdered if we sit back and talk this one to death how safe will any american feel anywhere around the world no ill go on tv tonight and tell the country im moving the seventh fleet into the south china sea for possible interdiction pending the withdrawal of chinese troops noyer waited till everyone else but he and the president had left the oval office then he said mr president wouldnt it be much easier for your juststated policy if china didnt come to the security council meeting youll be calling for in the speech i mean theyre sure to veto any criticism of themselves let alone any action that might be taken against them of course it would be better not having them there but thats highly unlikely noyer nodded yes it is youve asked the secretary general to call a meeting for nine am tomorrow yes what are you suggesting i change it yes mr president the president sat back surprised earlier or later later around four oclock in the afternoon what on earth will that do to help us probably nothing the cia director conceded why four the president asked intrigued four is a very unlucky number in chinese nine is a very lucky one besides four tomorrow afternoon instead of nine am will give us more time noyer paused to prepare the president eyed noyer for a few moments before he spoke ah i dont think you and i should say any more do you noyer agreed and made for the door good luck with your speech mr president chapter nine coughing relentlessly on his raft or rather the jaggededged wood planking that had been part of the oil rigs crews quarters danny mellin was thanking god for the temperate water of the south china sea perhaps if the plan of attack from the junk had a weak point he thought it was that the attackers had chosen dusk to make their move which meant that if anyone else had survived the attack and the blast then darkness might have prevented them from being picked off by the junks crew then again darkness provided the junk with cover also which was probably why they had decided on a dusk attack in the first place he had no doubt that the explosion would have been picked up by one of the microphones in the us underwater sonar system hopefully us ships andor subs of the seventh pacific fleet had already been dispatched as fast as possible to investigate the massive explosion mellin could still see the smoky column that was or rather had been the joint chical venture but now it appeared to him not as a roaring inferno shooting hundreds of feet into the air like the kuwaiti oil fires but the size of a candle flame the currents having moved him away from the coast and any immediate assistance after a while in a wash of moonlight danny mellin saw something in the water that he hoped hed mistaken for the dorsal fin of a dolphin its ominous circling of his everweakening raft however suggested otherwise soon he saw a wave breaking on something that didnt seem to move and he guessed he was near a reef or one of the lonely islands that rose only a few feet out of the water and began to paddle toward it the fin keeping up the rock was louisa reef known in chinese as nantong jiao it was all of three feet above the sea he felt the raft being taken away by the current and once more paddled hard until he thought his arms would break he remembered as if it was a dream reading in the story of san michele by dr alex munthe how guy de maupassant pressed munthe to tell him what was the most terrible form of death at sea and munthe had replied to be at sea with a life belt to keep you alive during the hell of dehydration the next morning de maupassant threw all his life belts overboard his hands bleeding from the coral and barnacles clinging to the rock mellin hauled himself and his small broken plank raft up on the reef and hoped it was already high tide exhausted he could do nothing but pray that by morning someone would find him it began to rain he lay on his back his legs dangling over the edge of the rock opening his mouth to let the rainwater revive him he looked around for the fin suddenly lifting his foot as he did so but now he could see nothing but the turbulent gray sea all about him chapter ten the president of the united states began his address to the nation about the situation in the south china sea by calling for a meeting of the un security council at four pm he pointed out that regardless of claims over ownership of ocean resources the united states of america would tolerate neither attacks against americans nor any closure of or other interference with the vital sea lanes through which mideast oil traveled to the united states and japan and for this reason he had ordered the us seventh fleet into the south china sea the violence of the long dispute he pointed out had spilled over into border clashes before the current invasion of vietnam by china china must recover her troops he said failure to do this within seventysix hours would leave the united states no alternative but to support the position of the peoples republic of vietnam which had once again without warning and here he referred to the and chinese incursions been invaded by its neighbor to the north it is not only in our own economic interest to take this action the president added but in the interest of world peace it was time to extinguish the spark before fanned by the winds of old hatreds and intolerance it ended up with a brushfire which could engulf all of southeast and northeast asia by northeast asia he meant a possible clash between north korea south korea japan and china and the japaneserussian dispute over the northern territories islands after the speech taking off his throat mike he confided to his wife i liked that bit about the winds of excuse me mr president yes it was an aide very tense armed with a fax just in from the national security agency nsa had sigint signal intelligence of transmissions along the kampuchean border that showed incursions by khmer rouge communists on vietnams western flank the president handed the fax to ellman bastards ellman said then apologized in front of the first lady adding beijing is obviously behind this theyve supported the khmer rouge for years whether or not beijings behind them the president commented an air strike or two over the area should cause them to think again the khmer rouge he paused you know ellman if someone has to test the mettle of our foreign policy it might as well be the khmer rouge theyre as bad as the nazis the genocide theyve committed is unspeakable ive never forgotten those shots of the pyramids of skulls they made and to start the world over dating their calendar the year one theyre psychopaths suck up to the chinese because of beijings support beijing sees it as an extra army on the vietnamese flank i cant think of a better target than the khmer rouge and remember what the khmer rouge and vietnamese fought about after the vietnam war with us what islands islands in the gulf of thailand i tell you these damned offshore islands have caused no end of trouble it would have to be a carrier strike mr presidentagainst the khmer rouge why not bs too big given our lack of runways and because of our allies like japan who fear upsetting the chinese no onell give us landing or refueling rights in southeast asia theyre all scared stiff of the chinese not only in china proper but within their own populations singapore has seventysix percent chinese brunei is too small to take the heat malaysia has thirty percent chinese indonesia wont help us so without airfields wed have to use shorterrange fighterbombers off a carrier how about the airstrips at okinawa no essentially itd be the same as launching from the japanese mainland tokyo wont give us the goahead theyre probably right strategically speaking beijing would go ape and like north korea beijing can scud japan ellman paused i suppose we could launch tomahawk cruise missiles from one of our subs yes the president responded but id favor the carrier aircraft option over that and i dont mean an attack by stealth id want this on cnn if were going to stop a fullscale war started by the khmer rouge or china before it gets out of hand i want the world to see american foreign policy straight and simple in action no hideandseek on this one and like i said if it comes to kicking ass i cant think of a better target than those khmer sons of bitches if air strikes dont do it admiral reese asked ellman interjected we could alert second armys emergency response force at fort bragg mr president do you want me to write up the christ no the president cut in for gods sake dont anyone notify that the name escaped the president for the moment douglas freeman ellman put in hes a good man sir in my opinion our best for i agree the present said but damn it if he gets the bit between his teeth before were ready to move it could be a media relations disaster havent met the man but state tells me you put a microphone anywhere near him it explodes into controversy i dont doubt hes one of the most brilliant commanders we have possibly the most brilliant but they say hes another patton cant keep his mouth shut yes reese said he even looks like george c scott anyway the president continued we want to try to contain this with naval and naval air action alone at the urging of the united states the un secretary general called the special meeting of the security council problem was as ellman reminded everyone the chinese like the other four permanent members britain the us the russianled commonwealth of independent states and france had the power of veto over any security council resolution we didnt have it in the case of korea ellman pointed out then how did you manage to get a usled un force in there ellmans aide asked the aide ellman realized would not have been born when the korean war of the early fifties broke out well ellman explained the soviet representative at the time had stormed out in protest over the failure of the un to grant communist china a seat and left town in a huff so when north korea invaded the south and the emergency meeting of the security council was called the soviet rep was unable to make the meeting and the remainder of the security council voted unanimously to send in a usled police action thats how we got to get our troops in to throw back the communists if china started this the president noted as the pentagon and this captain baker in saigon i mean in ho chi minh city suspect then its another gleiwitz i dont get the analogy reese said gleiwitz ellman explained was a german radio station on the germanpolish border it was attacked in thirtynine by german political prisoners dressed in polish uniforms so the poles would be seen as the aggressors so that hitlers invasion of poland the president added could be seen as a response to polish aggression yes ellman put in the analogy now is china having used the vietnamese flag in distress to get close to the rigs pity china wouldnt walk out of the un now like the russians did in fifty admiral reeses aide commented unknowingly speaking for all present from ellman and the cno to cia director david noyer yes the president concurred but thats highly unlikely unless we said something offensive enough to make him leave the chamber we could call him a turtle noyer said knowing that turtle was an extraordinarily rude thing to call any chinese the president nodded perhaps we could switch place names at the round table instead of peoples republic of china we could put up prot peoples republic of turtles it was a joke that eased the tension but only temporarily the stakes and the danger of general war in the area all around the south china sea rim were too pressing for the rim touched not only china and vietnam but malaysia singapore brunei sabah and sarawak the philippines indonesia and taiwan and had enormous implications for japan now the last us stronghold in asia the joke however had given the cias noyer an added incentive one he could not present to the president with or without the others present but he immediately made a note to pull the peoples republic of china embassy personnel file when he returned to langley chapter eleven fort bragg north carolina mason general douglas freeman said to his senior meteorological officer looking down at the map of the mysterious mv chical incident as reported by the new york times whats the weather like in the south china sea this time of year right now mason assured him its calm general well mason i have a hunch the political climate around there is not going to stay damn calm i smell a big fat commissar in beijing pulling the strings on this one we dont know that for sure yet sir no but ill bet my boots on it who the hell would send in an identifiable ship to blow a drill ship sky high obvious as the nose on your face that its the chinese trying to do the dirty on the vietnamese sir thatd mean killing their own mason youre a damned good meteorological officer but in matters of what the individual means to the communist state you dont know squat from a hill of beans one of our generals in the vietnam war told us that individual life isnt as highly prized in asia as in the west of course every fairy and dogooder liberal from florida to montana started squawking about how human life is as valuable to an asian as it is to us i tell you it isnt theyd have a nineyearold walk into some village with a grenade use their women too so you say the chinese wouldve easily sacrificed some of their own to to make it look like the vietnamese did it yes and when im proven right he turned to his chief aide colonel robert cline were gonna have to kick ass and second armys emergency response force is just what we need hell we could be in and out of there and drop a few eggs on nanning before the bastards knew what hit em so gentlemen he addressed his headquarters staff or rather those of his headquarters staff who had been hastily assembled in his office i want contingency plans for a full emref ground attack against selected targets in southeastern china chengdu province attack plans from both sides of the border in china against guangzhous fifteenth army and chengdus fourteenth and i want recs religious ethnic and cultural profiles of all countries laying claim to the spratlys and paracels he paused the excitement in his eyes was as clear as his next message and anybody in this outfit who talks to the press ill have his guts for garters that clear there was silence in the tensioncharged air very well dismissed mason yes general the meteorological officer said south china seas calm now but its about to enter the monsoon season correct yes general all right i want you to give me the worst possible weather scenario for that area maximum typhoon wind strength wave height et cetera you got that yes sir then send it to me as mason left the generals office douglas freeman steered robert cline over to the map table to show him what he thought would be the order of battle and strategic and tactical maps of guangzhou and chengdu provinces and the vietnamesechinese border area yes sir cline said but what if it was pirates could be vietnamese or chinese or bob you have to take the long view its only old ladies and fairies in state who worry about who threw the first punch the long view the overview what happens is the main thing we have to worry about we dont see israel getting all uptight about who was the first to throw a rock in a damn street brawl they assume its the arabs because the arabs have been their enemy for centuries and for us the question is who is the biggest danger and thats china his arms swept across the map of the south china sea and all the countries around its rim look at the chinese claim its not just the paracel islands it claims but everything in the damn south china sea hundreds of miles beyond any legal economic zones and right in the path of our sea routes cant put up with that bullshit doesnt matter if we find out it was a damn gorilla started it the point is were the major power in the world and weve got to contain this brawl before it gets out of hand for our own sakes if not for anyone elses with no call from the pentagon and boiling with impatience douglas freeman called his old colleague general william lynch of the joint chiefs bill freeman explained youve got to let me go in with the emref sorry douglas the white house is handling it theyre not handling anything whats the matter with those jokers they scared of letting you loose douglas yes lynch replied theyre apprehensive ellman suggested you to the president apparently but quite frankly douglas there are those here who think youre far too belligerent too what belligerent for chrissake general what you need now is the most belligerent son of a bitch in america and no offense to the late george steinbrenner but thats me we need something bigger than the emref lynch replied quickly estimating the chinese strength but basing it on the strength of us divisions were talking here about three million strong and tried chicom army troops a hundred and fifty divisions two hundred and fifty freeman corrected him chicom divisions are only twelve to thirteen thousand tops but theyre all teeth and i agree with you bill we need something bigger than emref but right now you need a seasoned siegebuster like me to plug the hole to push the bastards back north where they belong and off those islands and to hold the line while our second army boys mobilize in japan the emref can leave within douglas youre not listening the white house is sure that the mere disembarkation of a japaneseled un team this afternoon and the urging of the general assembly in the un might be enough to settle the dispute on the islands and general freeman cut in the un can do fuckall unless they agree to go in to fight as they did with schwarzkopf in iraq and youre telling me all theyll do is send in observers congress suggested it after hearing the presidents speech goddamn it bill observers are no good now what we need are douglas its no good reaming me out its the white houses call and thats that it wasnt my idea to send in observers at least i would have sent them in by air to hanoi but the president feels that a unflagged ship to haiphong will give the chinese time to ponder and save face thats important to orientals how bout us we could lose face there was a pause at the other end of the line and lynch waited for the explosion it never came well thanks for taking my call bill freeman finally said i guess all we can do now is hope that the white house sees reason and can douse this thing before it gets out of control amen to that lynch said but amens and seeing reason were to have no effect for as in all wars chance and misunderstanding were at large two hundred miles southwest of the japanese island of kyushu and three hundred miles south of tsushima strait between korea and japan its government outraged at the idea of a japaneseled force a north korean russianmade conventional dieselelectric sub lay quietly waiting in the relatively shallow seas about tokararetto one of the ryukyu chain of islands that threaded their way in a gradual southnorth crescent between taiwan and japan the subs silence was absolute its fivebladed screws still the sub on a sandbar off a reef in water deep enough to hide the threehundredfoot ton tango but not too deep for its search periscope allowing its captain commander kim yee to survey the seas surface for miles about him as captain yee made it abundantly clear that anyone who broke the silence would be severely punished lieutenant commander jeon maintained his position just beyond the periscope column as officer of the deck further safety for the sub lay in the fact that the tango was such a ubiquitous class with eighteen having been made and four sold to swell the coffers of a foreignexchangehungry cis in short a tango could belong to any country david noyers meeting with chinas representative to the un lee chow took place at a suitably subdued but crowded reception for the new ambassador from thailand here a polite nod and a few words to one another on embassy row would not have to be accounted for in the way they would have been had noyer albeit unofficially suggested they meet noyer waited until lee had finished consuming his fourth hors doeuvre mr lee noyer said smiling extending his hand lee accepting it while still chewing we have a few photos of you yes lee said so youre in various compromising positions noyer said still smiling with a beautiful redhead lee swallowed the last of the shrimp and ritz cracker boy or girl it caught noyer by complete surprise i didnt know you were bisexual im not lee replied in impeccable english but you americans can do anything with photography i particularly enjoyed that forrest grump movie gump noyer corrected vying for time it was forrest gump yes well whatever the scene of him meeting john f kennedy and lyndon johnson though we know both men were dead many years before the film was made correct is that what you think noyer responded in an incredulous tone we faked the photos why not if you can do it with a movie the opportunity of monkeying lee paused considering whether he had used the correct word yes monkeying with stills must be what you americans call a cinch why dont we let beijing decide noyer offered what is all this in aid of lee chow asked we were hoping youd be too busy to attend the un this afternoon noyer said in return for the photographs yes including the negatives im not interested in your photographs lee chow said we could still release them the redheads no fake release them lee chow challenged to what purpose youd be recalled possibly definitely lee chow turned his back on noyer noyer felt dirty and cheap the chinese ambassador had called his bluff but would chow back down at the last moment and not turn up at the un security council noyer doubted it but it was possible that the chinese ambassador might retreat given a night to think about it and of the effect public knowledge of his extramarital affair would have if noyer released the photographs not only on himself but on his family and the utter disgrace of a recall to beijing protecting the unflagged us ship the nearest available for carrying the un team having been a us tagos a stalwartclass ocean surveillance ship were two of japans ten feet long by thirty feet wide yushioclass diesel electric submarines each was capable of short horsepower their engines able to drive the subs at a submerged speed of knots one yushio on each flank the knot convoy preceded by two us asw armed sonar dipping sea king helos but now all their sonar mikes were picking up was the thundering noise of the us tagos and the quieter engines of the two escorting japanese yushio subs aboard the waiting north korean tangoclass sub four torpedoes were warmready each tube flooded outer doors opened the navigation officer plotted the vectors and captain yee gave the order to fire the torpedoes streaked out in a fan pattern toward the american ship just moments after the hiss of air and tubes flooding the passive sonars of both japanese yushioclass submarines had the range and position of the attacking submarine but aside from the two yushios knowing one anothers position for safety reasons neither japanese sub could be sure of the nationality of the enemy sub even if the sonar operators aboard the yushio subs could have ascertained by the noise of the hostile that it was a tango class which they could not they still would not have known whether the sub was chinese taiwanese korean or russian their hesitation to fire was not so much a failure of naval discipline but a result of an official jdf policy of extreme caution and a lack of combat experience dating back over fifty years to august when the second world war had ended for japan a long policy of appeasement followed including japans refusal to be involved in any military action with the usled coalition against saddam insane the yushios hesitation allowed the tango to leave its point of attack and on quiet battery power to move a half mile then settle where it once again fell silent the yushios could have switched from passive to active sonar sending probing sound waves out in the hope of rebound from the hostile after it had fired on the unflagged ship but this would have immediately betrayed their own position an invitation for a hostile to fire torpedoes at them the fact that the tagos was an ocean surveillance ship didnt help for it was well known at least among the intelligence community that the partly civilianmanned twelve ships in the class with their surtass or surveillancetowed array sensor and their superstructure bristling with communications gear were in effect spy ships the fact was that whether the white house had known this or not the tagos normally operated by the military sealift command was clearly sailing under a un and not a us flag for the first time in many years an old and hitherto firmly held assumption that the us would at all times know precisely where all nonus submarines were and would know what countries the subs belonged to was proven to be wrong hit amidships the tagos never stood a chance the enormous implosion of water sending her down in minutes with only three of her complement one japanese observer and two american seamen surviving presidential adviser ellman the white houses point man on damage control was now on the larry king show trying to explain why if the president knew that a tagos was a spy ship it was used in the first place or was the civilianmanned ship used because its maximum speedfrom eleven to thirteen knots was relatively so slow that the president hoped that by the time it reached hanois port of haiphong the chinavietnam clash would be over in short king wanted to know was it a cynical votegetting political move on the part of the administration for the white house to look decisive while hoping time would cool vietnamese and chinese tempers no certainly not ellman replied it was a us ship that had the kind of sophisticated communications gear the un would need to monitor the situation and report back to its headquarters also in view of japans reluctance to become too involved with the situation it was the best available vessel you know what i think the first phonein caller began no king said you have a question for mr ellman well i think you people at the white house knew what the hell it was you just told the president what the pentagon told you and the pentagon am i still on yes king said hurry it up maam i am hurrying it up i think the pentagon didnt tell the president it was a spy ship because the hawks over there want to get us in another fight reminds me of the gulf of tonkin sorry maam king said cutting her off times up he turned to ellman well how about it bruce did the pentagon come clean do the hawks want a fight ellman was either shocked or good at affecting it i dont know of anyone hawk or dove who wants a fight as the lady put it but you knew it was a spy ship right it was ellmans face turning a salmonpink that gave him away we ah we were informed that an american communications ship was er ah available king and millions of viewers were on to it you didnt know it was a spy ship not at the time well when did you know ah i cant recall exactly but after or before the ship was sunk viewers could see ellman exhale almost in relief after the president certainly didnt the president didnt i mean it was the pentagon to be more exact it was i believe the job of the msc whats that king cut in the ah military sealift command so you didnt know not until later after it was sunk ah yes thats right the second caller was irate ive been waiting half an hour your waits over sir king told him whats the question you guys in the media make me sick youre tryin to make it look like the presidents fault how about who started it first we lose what twelve americans on that oil drill ship and now we lose a whole crew how many i dont know what we should be asking is what are we gonna do about it sit on our fannies while some korean egomaniac we dont know it was a korean sub that hit it king turned to ellman there was some talk of the possibility of a mine ah mine shine the caller said whats the difference we got americans dead all over the place and you guys in washington are doing nothing but talking weve got to let these tinpot dictators out of time sir have to move on good question though bruce whats the us response going to be now well the joint chiefsll be meeting with the president this evening uhhuh but you know bruce weve had a couple of good questions here tonight isnt there a larger picture here i mean lets see king picked up a news clipping new york times asks what kind of message is our apparent inaction sending worldwide and you know the times was one of the papers to advise caution in the first instance in the uh chical business ellman was visibly relieved and thats exactly what the administration is doing yeah but that was in the first instance now it and well you just heard from the callers a lot of people i should say a lot of americansare asking what are we going to do now that the tagos has been sunk well still move with caution this administration isnt about to commit the lives of young americans without duly scuse me bruce but isnt the point this that you are now being criticized for precisely the kind of thing you people criticized the previous administration for no i dont think we sorry king cut in but we didnt clear one point up how many americans have now died in this sinking and the attack by whoever it was on the chicalwasnt it chical yes yeah and on the chical drill ship fortyone i believe but larry let me just say something here weve already ordered the seventh fleet into the general area but we still dont know who it was that attacked the drill ship or and i must emphasize this or the tagos i understand but isnt it a bit late for who started what i mean china has invaded vietnam and everyone and by that i mean mainly the other countries is disputing these oilrich islands who are the others by the way besides china and vietnam indonesia the philippines malaysia brunei ellman replied well king continued isnt the danger here that if we the united states dont make up our minds quickly on that that all these countries could be at war the south china seas trade route to japan and the us could be a war zone i ah possibly thats why i think its prudent to be careful nobodys denying prudence bruce but isnt it true that the longer we wait the more the danger of it spreading i mean this war between vietnam and china i think its more likely that the other countries will want to see which way the wind blows you mean go with whoever wins the war possibly all right last caller from oklahoma it was a womans voice strangled by sobs my husband is one of those missing in the chical attack i mean the attack on the chical there was a long pause take your time maam hes one of those missing he fought in vietnam his sisters served they were lost he was decorated twice i just want to know is washington doing anything to she couldnt finish bruce kings tone was more solemn now what do we tell this lady is there a possibility that americans may have to fight again in vietnam only this time with vietnamese to repel china yes if thats the way we have to go to stabilize the region as you suggested we should wait a minute i didnt suggest that i merely asked what the administration is prepared to do king then returned to the caller you still there maam yes maam and i know this is an awfully hard question but youve seen your two sistersinlaw were they in combat support roles or yes they were nurses uhhuh now you said they were killed one was the others been listed as mia uhhuh maam if we if the united states had to send troops again into vietnam this time to fight with vietnamese both north and south against communist china what would be your response after the pain and the suffering youve i oh im sorry no take your time maam i think a bully has to be stopped you mean china right yes youre one brave lady thanks for calling whew king said some lady bruce thanks for coming at such short notice king turned to his worldwide audience which among dozens of other capitals included beijing and hanoi dont go away next the mongrels talk about their new album struttin stuff chapter twelve tokyo jae ghong carrying a brown shopping basket emerged from shinjuku station in westcentral tokyo he walked a mile south past the meiji shrine in yoyogi park then caught a cab to go a mile east to the national stadium where he was part of the huge crowd watching osakas hanshin tigers beating tokyos seibu lions after the game he caught the subway to the ginza district where he walked down past ritzy stores and viewed the westernstyle mannequins with a mixture of envy and contempt he wished that he could afford the clothing he saw to buy something for his wife mia back in pyongyang he could work for a year and still be unable to afford anything in the ginza all the money he earned less what it cost him to live in the far outskirts of tokyo went back as a remittance for his wife and two children they all had to make sacrifices if north korea was to become a great nation without many products to export to earn vital foreign exchange the remittances of chong and all other north koreans living in japan were vital to north koreas economy but the great leaders first kim il sung and now kim jong il were correct everyone had to make sacrifices if north korea was to take its rightful position as communist leader of asia the new decadence of japan was everywhere the young japanese particularly were a spoiled race while their parents the postworld war ii generation subscribed to yamato damashii the japanese determination to succeed against all odds the young japanese despite their commitment to the shiken jigoku or hell of examinations upon graduation from the universities became part of the moyashiko the bean sprout generation because like sprouts they grew up fast but were in the dark they had no staying power more and more they wanted more leisure time and soon with such weaklings in power the great japanese giant must falter and stumble and then north korea would be ready to strike of course there were those who said the japanese were too powerful a nation to falter let alone fall but chong believed the great leader kim il sungs prediction that capitalisms decadence its immorality would undermine its industrial achievements and his chongs job was to help expedite this historical process by whatever he could do as a member of the north korean expatriate organization the chongryun what made it easier for chong to believe in kim jong ils prediction was the way in which the japanese treated the koreans as secondrate citizens the koreans did all the low menial dirty jobs but were not accepted into japanese society how to redress such a situation how to deal with the humiliation that assailed you like the death of a thousand cuts one slight at a time the only way chong knew was to strike back and not on their terms but your own to shatter their japanese spirit their sacred and exalted yamato damashii chong stood in front of a store window that sold expensive electronics and gazed at the mirrorlike reflection to check those who were passing him and anyone who paused at the window two schoolgirls in uniform stopped to look at the range of portable compact disc and tape players and to watch one of sonys latest hdvs highdefinition video screens which instead of having the normal us standard of just over five hundred horizontal or scanner lines had more than a thousand and made for a dramatically sharper picture chong also watched the tv screen for its camera was outside the store taking pictures of passersby he knew what the american agent looked like fivefootsix pounds brown hair blue eyes smaller than the general run of american agents the cia presumably had started recruiting smaller men in asia they would blend much more quickly in a large crowd like that at the ball game but chong could see no caucasian nearby and if anyone was tracking him he had not been aware of it in the taxi on his way from national stadium and a taxi would have been sure to flush the agent out unless the american had radioed the taxis number ahead and a tail had been taken over by some japanese agent from the jdf chong feeling fairly confident that he was not being followed moved on down the ginza back toward hibiya park nearing the chiyodaku district and the imperial palace he walked down by the moat looked up at the eyepleasing greenery that nestled the palace and then made his way across to tokyo station he could smell himself having walked so far about two miles in all in an lshaped route that he broke out of by going into tokyo station and catching the subway now full of raucous revelers from the lions and tigers game north a few miles to ueno station here he bought an iced tea doing it without putting down his brown paper shopping bag and made his way by foot another mile eastward to asakusa park his destination the buddhist asakusa kannon temple he was looking forward to its serenity though he did not believe in buddhism another religion of the weak he made his way up to one of the incense stalls bought two sticks and placed them in the holders by the shrine it was now pm dark and in twentyfour minutes at ten oclock or as near to it as he could get depending on the line for a phone booth he would ring one of his friends in the chongryun he walked around to the other entrance to the shrine and head bowed quickly scanned the entrance hed just been in he was sure no one had followed him a small child jostled him to get a better look banging into the bag the woman began to bow in apology until she saw he was a korean chapter thirteen the uss enterprise at its center the carrier battle group of the us seventh fleet proceeding west from guam in the philippine sea was well protected there were twelve ships about it two aegissystemequipped antimissile cruisers flanking it within the twentymilediameter circular zone two more cruisers three destroyers five frigates for antiship protection within a twohundredmilediameter zone and an ssn nuclear attack submarine at a mile forward position from the carrier in addition the battle group was preceded by an ec hawkeye early warning plane and a viking antisub plane in the outer zone with two caps or combat air patrols of two fs each in the outer defense perimeter the defense ceiling of the caps extended to sixty thousand feet plus above the battle group admiral rawlings c in c of the battle group was sure that nothing would get through the formidable protective screen of ships and aircraft tazuko komura was a beautiful twentysixyearold korean woman with an hourglass figure who worked in tokyo and hated it ever since she could remember shed been aware of the subordination of women in her country and her childhood resentment of the fact had passed into teenage anger that had culminated in an adult rage she found almost impossible to contain she loved modern american movies for in them there was comparatively little of the utter subservience of women of course she knew not all american women were like the ones shed seen in the films but for all they might have to put up with in american men the american women were free birds compared to their japanese counterparts tazuko had two brothers and all her parents attention seemed to be taken up by them she knew her parents loved her too but in education especially she had seen the two worlds one for men the other for women and at twentysix unmarried she was called a christmas cake something whose value plummets after december her schooling had stopped after her high school graduation and all the money the family had was devoted to the education of her two brothers she worked for a time in one of japans largest clothing stores along the ginza where only the very rich shopped she was one of thirty girls who dressed exactly alike every morning received instructions for the day eyes straight ahead like so many robots and who then spent the day bowing fifteen degrees and saying irasshaimasewelcometo thousands of shoppers a thirtydegree bow would be necessary for introductions and a fortyfivedegree bow for an apology unlike her coworkers every time she bowed she resented it and could only get through the day by cursing inwardly she had made the mistake of confiding once to one of the girls a paato or parttimer about how much she loathed bowing and scraping to everyone who passed through the department stores doors why dont you quit had been her coworkers response because jobs arent easy to come by thats why her coworker had called her wagamamaselfish yes tazuko had replied shocking her coworker even more i want more than a husband two children and a lifetime of drudgery you should not talk like that no i shouldnt tazuko agreed with an overtone of sarcasm after that incident she had not complained anymore she had decided to act in time she became an agent for north korean intelligence whatever else the communists might be tazuko had become obsessed with their promise of equality for women at times her inner voice told her that the communist world was no utopia but whatever its faults tazuko believed that at least its women were treated differently more like men pyongyang told her to keep her job as a greeter it was perfect cover who on earth would suspect someone so subservient bowing low to the holy customers who passed her as if she were a stick of furniture aboard the nimitzclass carrier uss enterprise two fa hornets were readying to take off to relieve the two fs now on combat air patrol over two hundred miles in advance of the battle group the fighters were armed with four heatseeking sidewinder airtoair missiles two radarguided sparrow airtoair missiles on the wingtips and a sixthousandroundperminute mm cannon in addition each plane capable of acceleration from to kmh in less than two minutes carried extra gallons of fuel the flight deck at first sight seemed a confusion of terrible noise astringent fuel smells steam bleeding from the starboard catapult and groups of men in different colored jackets red for firefighters and ordnance green for maintenance red crosses on white for the medics white for safety supervisors blue for aircraft handlers brown for each planes deck captain green for catapult and arrestor gear crews grapevested for refuelers and yellow for aircraft directors in front of the watercooled blast deflectors a hawkeye early warning aircraft roared to full power its twin turboprops twin blurs as it took off the fs moved into position in primary flight control high in the carriers island anticollision teams worked diligently under pressure their job was to know and account for the position of every plane coming in taking off or parked the handler closely watching his ouija board on which there were tiny models of the ships planes the deck was clear the landing light red the captain pushing the button for the harshsounding warning horn while a quarter mile out to sea the orange rescue sea king chopper hovered through the blur of rising steam sea spray and backwash of exhaust heat the pilot of the first hornet prepared to take off and watched the yellowjacketed catapult officer his hand up and open signaling him to go to afterburner the pilot saluted then the catapult officers left hand dropped behind him his left leg fully extended at an acute angle to the deck his right leg bent and his right hand thrust forward wind speed and temperature and weight already in the belowdeck computer the deck edge operator pressed the button and a deck below the catapult controller let her go hurling the plane aloft in a cloud of steam from zero to miles an hour in less than three seconds as each of the hornets climbed one of the pilots saw a glint of reflected sunlight amid the carrier islands cluster of air surface and target acquisition radar masts the pilot took it as a good omen and the next second both hornets climbing disappeared into the base of a huge cumulonimbus cloud its icecream whiteness already bruising with rain chapter fourteen the vietnamese divisions fought hard but wang and weis pla infantry and artillery outnumbered the vietnam regulars as the pincer closed about lang son the vietnamese began a tactical retreat the air full of the whirling and shuffling noise of artillery rounds overhead and the massed stuttering of heavy machine guns and ts the chinese version of the aks as the chinese pressed their advantage in washington the unexpectedly rapid chinese breakthrough sent shock waves through the pentagon it wasnt supposed to happen this way and it created a new sense of urgency in the white house bypassing the security council stalemated as it was by a chinese veto the president through his ambassador to the un appealed to the general assembly for assistance in forming a un coalition he made it clear however that if such assistance was not forthcoming then the united states would act unilaterally and send in troops to assist the vietnamese in the interests of preventing a general war in asia it was a sensation more so because the american offer was carried by cnn to an audience of over million topping the million who had watched the o j simpson story and the oklahoma bombing in the midnineties chapter fifteen whitehall london the american offer to send in troops came as no great surprise to the british foreign office the minister of defense richard tylerjones had been told by the white house to expect some sort of declaration from the president pertaining to the chinesevietnamese clash tylerjones looking out the window down whitehall spoke to his deputy minister ronald nash without looking at him what to do nash well i expect we should say something positive washington is clearly however reluctantly prepared to do battle with the chinese because they realize that if the chinese succeed theyll not only occupy the border areas between the two countries but theyll claim all the oil islands the paracels as well as the spratlys not to mention what all the chinese in vietnam and malaysia might do we could have another communist insurgency in malaya and who would stop it apart from that it would turn the whole of the south china sea into an asian yugoslavia ironic nash commented wryly the americans are prepared to send in troops to help a communist power not at all tylerjones said tartly they helped stalin worst communist of all a thoroughly nasty piece of work we helped him too remember besides without uncle joe as well as uncle sam we could have been in a rather sticky situation he meant england would have lost the second world war tylerjones sat down and took up his letter opener a cassowary bone dagger from an old patrol officer who had once journeyed up new guineas fly river the weapon made him think of another dagger the famed curved kukri knife of britains legendary gurkha troops they were fierce fighters especially renowned for jungle warfare late in the s during a recruitment replenishment drive for just over sixty men more than sixty thousand men applied the gurkhas took only the best of the very best how about we offer them a gurkha battalion and a squadron or two of sas the special air service commandos had carried out the lightning raid in london against the terrorists in the iranian embassy in to rescue british hostages and had performed sterling service behind the lines in iraq nash though deputy minister of defense couldnt recall how many men were in a squadron of sas varies tylerjones told him around seventytwo i suggest we send two or three squadrons and have a battalion of our gurkhas in brunei on standby ready for deployment not many as far as numbers go i agree but top drawer all the same and we should offer them without strings attached nash asked not visible ones anyhow tylerjones replied cagily im seeing the prime minister at number ten this evening dont do anything until i give the green light nash looked surprised you dont think the pmll raise any objection do you i shouldnt think so tylerjones answered you know england and america allies in two world wars korea et cetera iraq our special relationship and so forth some of the opposition dont think theres a special relationship anymore they may be right to some extent but there are the ties of blood winston spoke about despite the fact that we are separated by a common language nash forced a smile it was a very old chestnut but one that the minister still thought amusing quite he said i wont draw up the offer beyond a rough draft tylerjones glanced at his watch ten minutes if so i can take it around to the pm myself itll be ready sir good tuesday isnt it ah yes sir oh god the pm and his onemaincourse dinner an example to the nation in hard economic times tuesdays nash are corned beef cabbage and white onion sauce none of which i can abide nashs eyebrows rose surely minister the menu isnt as predictable as that alas it is our beloved leader nash has not one of the more discerning palates in government its rumored no it has been confirmedthat he likes those awful american hot dogs perhaps therell be a change in the menu in your honor minister perhaps tylerjones replied though his tone was not one of conviction one could simply order the soup nash proffered with a smile yes tylerjones answered wryly and one could end up on the back benches no nash i shall do my duty and you do yours yes sir as nash reached the door tylerjones looking over his reading glasses at the deputy minister said you see how much i trust you nash nash glanced at the very rough draft of great britains offer one england could just afford but one he was sure the americans would like however if it were to get out before the pm had seen it tylerjones his hands forming a cathedral was shaking his head no no not the offer of troops old man the bloody cabbage oh yes minister nash said smiling you mention a word of that and im for the high jump he meant for hanging dont worry sir mums the word the minister his hands still in the prayer position beneath his closely shaved chin merely nodded mr tylerjones prime minister announced the secretary at downing street and then withdrawing in utter silence deftly closed the door to the pms study richard the pm said smiling taking off his reading glasses and extending his hand in greeting prime minister tylerjones acknowledged sit down richard ive been going over these budget figures again and your department is one that well have to trim weve trimmed to the bone prime minister you may have noticed that weve reduced the number of our gurkha battalions significantly weve gone from eight thousand men to two and a half thousand yes the prime minister interjected i realize that its not a criticism of you richard but ive been wondering do we really need them at all tylerjones was flabbergasted and fought against his natural urge to respond sarcastically i think we do need them prime minister their fighting ability is legendary perhaps sir not being an avid student of the military you might not realize the extent of their reputation i realize full well richard they are very very good soldiers my father used to regale us as children with tales of their unquestioning loyalty and ferocity that knife they carry the kukri yes the pm smiled sounds like something one would use in the kitchen dont you think perhaps prime minister tylerjones said the gurkhas use it to hack their way through jungle and to cut off their enemies heads yes father did mention that but cant they be replaced by british troops i mean by that of course homebased troops hardly economically viable prime minister all in all theyre a bargain and their morale well what can one say in the falklands war when the argentinian units heard the gurkhas were on their way it caused mass panic a withdrawal in force i think the argentinians called it mass desertion the pm proffered just so tylerjones responded adding of course during maos cultural revolution they also proved invaluable really how difficult to know where to begin in any event when the red guards let loose by mao spilled over into hong kong and caused massive riots we sent in the gurkhas had em draw their kukris once they draw the big knife you see theres an imperative to use it before they can return it to the scabbard oh the pm said that i didnt know tylerjones saw his opportunity and the moment the pm finished speaking he added and i thought that if beijing wants to foment more trouble on the vietnamesechinese border we might be able to assist our american cousins with gurkhas very good richard the pm responded unwinding both arms outstretched for isometric exercise pushing hard against the edge of the desk very good indeed and of course the gurkhas black chaps and but asian in appearance they come from nepal quite thats what i meant asianlooking and in asia asian troops on our side would look much better than good the pm was plainly pleased with himself as if it had all been his idea from the first excellent a light on his console blinked silently not bothering to lift the scrambler phone the pm spoke into the small intercom very good well be out in a moment he turned to tylerjones dinner he announced youll stay to partake richard thank you sir any meal with the pm was a feather in ones cap particularly when one had been instrumental in putting the pm in such a good mood corned beef cabbage and white onion sauce richard hows that sound to you delightful prime minister chapter sixteen the dot in the distance looked like all the others seabirds of one kind or other some lazily gliding about a crinkle of white as turquoise swells broke upon a barely submerged reef like the one mellin had drifted onto though his legs had been lacerated by the reef he owed his life to the rocky outcrop mellin knew he could have lasted days without food floating in his mae west but could not have survived without water and in the higher depressions of the rocks those not flooded by seawater at high tide he found a few pools of rainwater from the downpour that had followed the attack on the drill ship it wasnt much water but it was enough to prevent what would have been a fatal dehydration as for food hed forced himself to eat and swallow a slimy sea urchin from one of the tidal pools and had almost thrown up soon mellin could discern another ship close to the dot and then he saw that the two seemed to cohere and were now one several seconds later he could see it was a speedboat most probably a patrol boat passing the almost completely submerged reef in the distance and coming toward him now after the days and nights of hoping and waiting he was suddenly afraid would it be a rescue or a killing he guessed the vessel whoevers it was would reach him in about twenty minutes then it occurred to him that maybe the boat wasnt chinese or vietnamese perhaps it was a speedboat coming westward from brunei it also occurred to him that although the reef wasnt large only thirty to forty yards long and ten to twenty wide he could if he wanted to hold on to the edge of it as one would grasp the edge of a swimming pool all but his head submerged to somehow hide and see them before they could see him hanging behind a piece of coral that jutted out from the reef like a small peninsula mellin now realized how absurd it was to think that it mattered whether they saw him first or he saw them the reality was that unless he wanted to die on the reef he would have to go with them whoever they were he saw the flag of the red chinese its five stars representing china proper manchuria mongolia sinkiang and tibet fluttering from the stern of the ship not a gunboat but a frigate its bow a quarter mile from mellin slicing through the light swells with an effortless grace that belied her purpose on the frigates bridge an officer walked out to the port wing and binoculars in his hands began to peer more intently at the reef mellin knew they had to spot him after thirty seconds or so it struck him that the ship might in fact be on a routine patrol of the spratly islands and reefs to check that no foreign structures or markers had been placed there the chinese and vietnamese having had confrontations about such claims and on several occasions firing upon one another in one incident several years ago in the early nineties over fifty vietnamese had been killed by the chinese in a way mellin was relieved to see the chinese flag signifying that it was a pla naval warship rather than a fast patrol boat of the kind some pirates used in drug runs across the south china sea to the countries that lay on its rim now the ship leaned hard astarboard turning away from the island suddenly mellin was yelling out as loudly as he could raising his voice above the slap and smash of the swells along the hundred feet of rock and coral the officer of the watch however had seen him and the ship was merely coming about to better launch its rubber boat it was with a mixture of gratitude and apprehension that mellin saw this taking place he could hear an outboard motor coughing spluttering and dying chinese maintenance he thought and grew more anxious now not because of the temperamental outboard he knew they would get him somehow but because of what appeared to be spikes rifles sticking up from two of the four men aboard the outboard now sounded like an angry wasp as the zodiacs bow rose slapping the crest of a wave then disappearing for a second or two before reappearing again the blueandwhitestriped shirts of the sailors standing out against the sea now a gunmetal gray beneath a big cumulus that had obscured the sun the first thing that struck mellin after they took him aboard was the stiff attitude of the four pla navy types every face was solemn the petty officer at the control console pointed to the middle of the boat and said in chinese sit there mellin didnt know much chinese only what hed learned as a pow in vietnam where he had been guarded by vietnamese chinese xie xie ni thank you no one answered him two of the four using their rifle butts to push the rubber boat away from the reef where it could easily capsize should a sudden swell rise high above the reefs edge then just as suddenly drop precipitously onto the coral below steadying himself in the middle of the zodiac he thanked them again the unsmiling bosun a rather sorry sailor said something to him gruffly and pointed to the rest the bosun waited till the water lifted the rubber boat high then turning the wheel sharply to starboard he gave full throttle and they were heading back at about eight knots toward the frigate the bosun pointed impassively toward the reef and again said something just as grumpily as before mellin couldnt understand the tone as far as he knew the chinese and us had cordial relations due to joint chineseus ventures it then occurred to him that even if they could have understood what he said they might not know about the attack on chicalor had they been part of it there had been reports before particularly in about pirates in pl a uniforms telling foreign vessels to stop whereupon the pirates had proceeded to ransack the ships cargo they were nearing the ship now and mellin made one more attempt at conversation shipwrecked he lied maybe it would be better for him to stick to a shipwreck story and say nothing about the chical none of them responded as they reached the netting ladder just forward of the bridge well youre uncommunicative bastards mellin said smiling but thanks for picking me up anyway get up the ladder the bosun ordered in clipped but perfectly understandable english mellin had a distinct sinking feeling chapter seventeen fort bragg general douglas freeman was in his tiny kitchen emptying the last of his coffee around his aspidistra plant an aspidistra was able to take anything and thrive when the phone purred it was the pentagon telling him that the emergency response force was to be activated for immediate deployment freeman knew it was for vietnam and a shiver of excitement rather than apprehension passed through him yes sir he answered crisply the irony of americans returning to the country where they had suffered their first and most humiliating defeat in the twentieth century was on his mind and he knew it would be at large among the emrefs troops if not the british sas contingent then certainly among the rest of the force but he welcomed the pentagons decision for whatever the american troops apprehension freeman saw it as an opportunity to exorcise once and for all the stigma that had been the legacy of americas vietnam vets the pentagons view however was quite different its hope was that the very announcement of the americanled emref being activated via hawaii would send a timely and clear message to beijing to stop the fighting and to withdraw its troops from vietnam within the closely guarded and vivid redlacquered gates of beijings zhongnanhai the governments vip compound reaction was swift with a message to generals wei and wang to hold their positions at all costs that decisive reinforcements were en route from nanjing military district to the border in fact the vietnamese supply line from hanoi eighty miles to the south had been cut again this time by pla mig fulcrums so that hanois ability to resupply its troops south of lang son and dong dang was even further impaired inviting a fresh chinese attack with generals wei and wang eager to seize the moment and press farther south chapter eighteen the advance party of the emergency response force a mixture of marines and three squadrons of british special air service and delta commandoes left britain and the united states by air ahead of second army meanwhile general george scott douglas freeman was busy in the cavernous interior of the lead l super hercules in addition to the other combat troops in the first hercules another twenty of the aircraft would fly into hanoi with the remainder of the advance party which would chopper eightyfive miles north into the area around lang son the advance units of freemans second army and all its material were already on their way from japan aboard the fast knot vessels of the military sealift command including amphibious assault ships helo and harriercarrying ships from the ton wasp class a ton tarawa and an ton helocarrying iwo jima class they were escorted by knot burkeclass and spruanceclass destroyers two ticonderogaclass aegis cruisers and two combination ssbn ssn sea wolf submarines with cruise missiles and torpedoes tokyo at chong moved away from the temple of asakusa kannon to the phone booth nearby and dialed tazuko komuras contact number when she answered he knew she would be wearing white gloves he asked for a mrs yoshi tazuko komura told him he must have the wrong number there was no yoshi living there he rang off before chong had made his phone call six jdf intelligence officers had been milling in the crowd around the asakusa kannon the minimum needed to follow anyone all of them had seen jae go into the phone booth and dial immediately two of the closest agents made their way to the phone booth one of them rudely stepping in front of a woman waiting her turn to enter the booth excuse me she said but i am going to use the phone the agent said nothing i am going to use the phone the woman repeated no youre not mother i beg your pardon be quiet he said or ill arrest you arrest me she said surprised and who are you please the agent was losing it amid the murmur of the crowd around the shrine their voices couldnt be heard but if the old woman kept on nagging at him he would have to get the rare one he thought a woman who thought herself equal to men the man they were watching still in the booth might hear them arguing as he came out and who are you please the woman repeated the agent had seen jae dial four of the six numbers but not the last two it was something but not enough theyd have to feed it into the computer and have it print all the possible combinations of numbers and who are you please she said once again be quiet the agent hissed he couldnt hear what jae was saying the agent walked away as jae hung up i thought you were in such a big hurry the woman called after him did you hear him the elderly woman challenged the person lining up behind her jae came out of the booth and who is he hes a lout thats what he is a shrimp brain the person she was addressing another woman but much younger and prettier smiled weakly but obviously didnt want to get into it moyashiko bean sprout the old woman said as she made her way into the phone booth the agent joined his companion and both of them sought out the american agent henry wray who was waiting in one of the surveillance cabs the japanese agent lowered his eyes in a sort of obeisance i only got four of the numbers he confessed did you wray said but the americans tone was more a hearty declaration than a question well we got the whole six the agents mouth was agape the truth the same wray said jdf boys had a bead on him the moment you saw him waiting its a number in the north of the city in kitaku do we pick him up the agent asked eagerly no wray said hes just a messenger we can get him anytime what we want are the soldiers who he calls the action boys besides we pick him up now his friends soon know the cell disbands and then were back to square one but we still tail him your boss and i think thats the best way to proceed the agent nodded whether or not he agreed it was impossible to tell will we pick up the contact well do that wray replied indicating the other four agents in the car tazuko komura after walking away from the public phone made her way back to her apartment block and in her tiny boxlike kitchen which smelled of pickled cabbage and fish she sat down and turned on the news the yen had risen again worrying japanese business about the resultant high price of her exports relevant to other countries tazuko was struck by the irony that the japanese yen because it was one of the strongest currencies in the world was now giving tokyo a headache with millions at stake in exports she handled the tntbased compound carefully but confidently each malleable plastique piece of grayishwhite c looking like a rectangular bar of putty except for its invertedvshaped bottom next tazuko pushed in two aluminum blasting cap tubes out of which came the detonating cord that would be started via a small tubular batteryoperated electronic timer its top resembling the rotary dial of a telephone except that instead of each hole moving ten spaces from operator to the tenholed rotary dial of the electronic timer was marked from onequarter minute to fortyeight minutes she would of course use the setting giving her ample time to walk away now on the news the cnn feed was showing the massive sea lift of the us second army from japan each of the two corps making up the army of men but for every man at the front several were needed in support functions so the actual number in combat would be no more than tazuko turned up the tv volume and heard that the american general in charge was someone called freeman but whether or not he was with the task force they didnt say an hour after jae had made his call us cia agent henry wray and his japanese colleagues arrived at the phone hed rung it was another public booth clever wray said i thought itd be a residence should have known better yes one of the japanese agents said but he quickly made it clear that this was not a slight against wray just an admission that they had all thought it would be residential wray looked about him up at the forest of apartment blocks and exhaled heavily where he asked of no one in particular if they couldnt find the person who answered and it didnt look as if they would then they were as wray had said back to square one the most senior of the japanese agents spoke to the others and just in case wrays japanese was a little rusty he explained in english well dust the phone booth for prints you never know henry wray nodded his tone more one of resignation than expectation might as well next morning tazuko made herself a picnic lunch of sushi and also packed a small bottle of mineral water normally she preferred to eat from one of the sidestreet stalls in tokyo but this day she didnt want to go into any shop because afterward they would be looking for anyone who had been carrying a shoulder bag large enough to transport the explosive it was highly unlikely they would find her she thought but it was best to avoid any contact with anyone it was a bright sunny day and tazuko took this as a good omen and from a purely practical point of view it meant she could wear her sunglasses which of course gave her more cover chapter nineteen here the peoples liberation army bosun ordered pointing brusquely to the portside entrance to the jianghu frigate on the bridge mellin saw an officer immaculately dressed in white uniform and dark bluebanded white cap a captains gold insignia on his collar tabs and shoulder boards the red star in the middle of his cap he was a small man but carried a quiet authority about him why are you on this reef he asked mellin mellin was astounded by the question his earlier moments of reverie when he knew he would be rescued now supplanted by a perplexed mood why are you on this reef surely a child could see hed been cast upon the reef what did the chinese think that he was just passing by on a ship and suddenly decided oh ill go and sit on a reef anyway who in hell were they did they think they owned the damn reef as he was to find out thats precisely what they did think that they owned it and many more like it in the south china sea among both the spratly and paracel islands and it was not at all uncommon to have them station two pla soldiers on a reef next to a lone fourtosixfoothigh marker claiming this or that particular reef was chinese territory if the published photographs of two haplesslooking pla soldiers on duty atop a reef unable to keep their feet dry seemed humorous to others they were deadly serious to the pla the two soldiers armed with aks were ready to shoot anyone who tried to land where is the marker the officer asked mellin looked from the officer to the bosun and back again what marker there was a marker on the island proclaiming it to be the property of the peoples republic of china mellins throat was so dry he found his tongue sticking to his palate and his first attempt to answer was garbled the chinese officer still looking disapprovingly at the american said something to the bosun who disappeared and reappeared with a worn enamel mug of water mellin nodded gulped it down handed the mug back to the bosun with a nod of thanks and told the officer i dont know anything about a marker there was a marker there the officer said angrily look im grateful for you picking me up but i never saw any marker want to search me do not silly man snapped the officer unaware of his grammatical mistake mellin however knew better than to show even the slightest amusement this officer was not one for joking the security of the marker amid competing claims for oil and minerals obviously his responsibility now mellin understood what the chinese who had taken him off the rock had so assiduously been looking for where had the marker gone there is no sign of it the officer said did you use explosives listen captain i am not the captain i am second officer lieutenant mung all right lieutenant mung look i dont know anything about a marker and if its explosions you want to talk about i have a few questions of my own first of all you speak too much in haste mellin slowed down i was on mellin stopped whoever had attacked the chical hadnt wanted to leave any witnesses alive i was on a fishing boat and it sank a few miles from your reef this is chinese territory mung interrupted all the spratlys are chinese but its hundreds of miles beyond your twohundredmile limit mellin said like your hawaii mung said the bosun thought that this was very smart and a smug smile took him captive hawaii mellin began has been us territory for more than so too with the spratlys chinese were there long before anyone else i dont believe that mellin said simply lieutenant mung spoke rapidly to the bosun who then told mellin come with me a guard joined them as the bosun quickly led mellin down below and forward to the paint locker and told him he would be given food shortly then the bosun slammed the door and left suddenly mellin was in utter darkness he began to hyperventilate in sheer terror his claustrophobia so intense that he thought he would go mad his panic heightened by the overwhelming cloying smell of paint which caused his sinuses to all but close down making it difficult for him to breathe within minutes he was drenched in perspiration his clothes sticking to him like saran wrap and all the while his anxiety heightened by the unknown what were they going to do with him the brusque way they had treated him it was as if china and the us were at war the fingerprints they got from the public phone in the kitaku district were not helpful the prints were smudged and it was the forensic technicians guess that whoever had held the phone in response to the call from the asakusa kannon temple had probably worn gloves besides it had taken them an hour to get to the booth many people could have used it by then and so forensics was at a loss as to why they had been asked to take prints at all the best they could do now wray thought was to stake out the phone booth and run a security check on everyone who used it in lieu of this long tedious surveillance wray and his japanese colleagues were tempted to bring in jae but they held off for fear of making an arrest that would not stick a crime had to happen before they could act on their suspicions that the chongryun were up to no good meantime there had been no letup in the coded radio messages from north korea and it was generally agreed among western intelligence agencies that in pyongyang the great new leader kim jong il like his father the great leader kim il sung was about to turn up the heat they were wrong pyongyang had already sent its instructions for her mission to tazuko komura via jae weeks before the communication from jae had been the final transmit chapter twenty for most of the men with george c scott douglas freeman the first sighting of vietnam from the lead hercules a line of deep green broken here and there by palmshaded beaches was not particularly memorable only freeman and a few others were old enough to really remember the vietnam war let alone to have fought in it for most it was one of many wars america had fought and americas defeat had not marked them as it had freeman and others who could still recall walter cronkite entering their living rooms every evening to tell them the state of the war and always like a football score the body count in any case the predominant emotion in the plane was fear fear of the enemy and fear of showing it these were not conscripts but welltrained professionals some who had seen action in the iraqi war and some in the invasion of haiti and so knowledge of both desert and jungle warfare traveled with them but most of the in the emref spearhead had never been in battle and they feared that unknown already in the vast interior of the plane the smell of perspiration was heavy in the air there was a flash what the hell freeman began seeing it was one of the two reporters hed allowed to accompany the emref spearhead into action hed chosen a cnn reporter because he knew that way hed get a story out if he needed it for strategic reasons the other was a photojournalism a woman marte price from the littleknown midwestern des moines register he disliked seeing all the big networks get all the scoops im sorry she began blushing i didnt but freeman cut her short maam last thing we expect in an aircraft is a flash popping off looks like a damn flashbang grenade lucky someone didnt shoot you i promise i wont do it again general freeman nodded and mumbled something about how there were going to be enough surprises to contend with once the emref had reached hanoi then headed north to do business with the red dragon as he collectively called the chinese huh grunted martinez a marine formerly an auto mechanic who hailed from los angeles that flash sure as hell frightened me damn near shit myself you and fifty others mate a brit said nodding his cockney accent reminding martinez of mr doolittle elizas father in my fair lady the short stocky englishmans accent was a bit hard for martinez to understand but the mans eyes and gestures told most of the story martinez felt comforted by doolittles frank admission of fear especially since the britisher wore the simple but coveted beret of the special air service among the toughest of the tough to be sas was to be as handy with a parachute as with the heckler koch mm submachine gun to run miles with a heavy pack to be able to live off the land from grass shoots to rats raw uncooked for fear of the smell alerting the enemy and then you had to pass the hostage exam the sas were so tough that the us delta force based their training on the english elite who had worldwide and enduring fame not from the wars theyd stopped and communist infiltrators theyd killed from aden to malaysia but because of the stunning raid they had mounted in full view of the tv cameras on the iranian embassy in london in they had all worn black including balaclavas to protect their identity and then theyd melted back incognito some of them to the regular units they were assigned to their absence usually covered by compassionate leave or some other such conventional excuse the delta force and the green berets didnt hop into a phone booth and do a clark kent both the us and british phrase special forces covered all three delta force green berets and sas in this operation as freeman thought equally highly of all of them hed fought with all of them before at different times and had admired all three but as the hercules crossed the coast heading for hanoi the eta less than ten minutes he had something else to tell them not because of the common bond they shared with one another but because they would soon be fighting against a common enemy chinas peoples liberation army an army which freemans and his mens forebears had fought back in the korean and vietnam wars what i want you boys and ladies he smiled at marte price to remember is that it isnt so strange to be asked to fight on the same side as the vietnamese a lot of your grandfathers fought with the south vietnamese and besides two hundred years or so ago your ancestors and mine were fighting one another in the war of independence and we the united states lost more men in the fight between the union and the confederacy than we did in both world wars so you see as times change old enemies become comrades in arms it is the position of the united states of america and great britain that this chinese attack on vietnam threatens a hell of a lot more than vietnam it threatens if it goes unchecked the whole of asia and weve learned from history if weve learned anything that if you dont stand up to bullies in the first instances you only encourage the sons of bitches to take more and more eta hanoi was another five minutes douglas freeman saw marte price tucking strands of her shortcropped red hair into her helmet but not even her camouflage fatigues could totally hide her figure freeman told her that once the plane landed in hanoi the only pictures allowed would be sans flash im not that stupid general marte said didnt say you were maam its just that along with the truth i dont want you to be our first casualty in that case thanks she paused this is my big chance to she left the sentence hanging in the air freeman finished it for her to break free from the pack be your own he paused person yes general eta seven minutes bob cline told him it was eta five minutes three minutes ago yes sir but weve had to swing south before turning north captains afraid the hanoi triple a might let fly mistaking us on radar for chinese swinging west after hitting haiphong harbor very well freeman said then turning to marte said ms price call me marte general i prefer price she looked surprised he hadnt struck her as the formal type ms price he began again dont take any photos till you establish where you are visàvis headquarters where will that be she asked nonplussed me he said stick with me and whatever story you write dont put anything about anybody saying over and out cause thats a contradiction in terms only those movie jokers in la who rarely get out of bed write that guff eta four minutes came the pilots voice in the cavernous interior the sound of the hercules more thunderous than before shaking more but everything seemed to be going all right as soon as they landed they would be met by the french charge daffaires whose staff would direct them to camouflaged trucks already painted with the outline of a black triangle signifying a un truck likewise all the mens uniforms both british and american also sported the un symbol on helmets and both shoulder patches man martinezs friend johnny dlupo confided i hope those fuckers see it balls martinez said you dont want em to see it if they can see it they can shoot it bloody right enjoined doolittle whom the others had dubbed doctor i hope they dont see me but i see them sir martinez called out to the general his élan with a superior officer easy not only because he was american but because he was one of the elite whose forebears battle honors went back to the halls of montezuma sir how long you think well be goin in the trucks twentyfive miles from hanoi to thuong freeman said he meant phu lang thuong roads are pretty bad and were coming in on the leading edge of the rainy season i guess about fortyfive minutes to an hour no time to dip your he fell silent and this was greeted with an assortment of catcalls whistles and cheers what were you going to say general marte inquired youll have to excuse me he said mumbling something about conferring with the captain marte asked martinez what the general was about to say its kinda crude miss cmon she pressed her notebook out camera slung over her shoulder and her moving awkwardly in the seat belt h harness no time to dip your wick dlupo put in no leave oh she said and smiled farther down the row dlupo turned to dr doolittle his voice hardly audible above the roar of the engines im in love with her doc you and everybody else mate doolittle responded ive had a hardon ever since we left the states yes dlupo said well dont worry old son sooner we clean this lot up at thuong sooner well ave time to spend wiv young marte they both knew it was bull martinez like everybody else aboard except maybe freeman scared about going in only a few had seen sustained combat in iraq and hell that was in the desert in any kind of jungle they knew you couldnt see an arms length in front of you well hell dlupo said we wont be going in till the rest of the emref arrive doolittle didnt know whether this was supposed to mean theyd have more time to ogle marte price or have more time to collectively steel their nerves but then doolittle and every other man aboard the hercules was discovering once again that the company of your fellows could only go so far in comforting you ultimately you were alone in the us battle group with the carrier uss enterprise at center steaming into the south china sea an echo was picked up by one of the sea kings dipping sonar and relayed to the sub santa fe by advanced warning aircraft the commander of the santa fe prepared to dive the boat officer of the deck last man down hatch secured came the seamans report the executive officer moved to his position as officer of the deck and in turn reported to the captain last man down hatch secured aye captain the ship is rigged for dive current depth one two fathoms checks with the chart request permission to submerge the ship very well officer of the deck the captain responded submerge the ship submerge the ship aye sir dive two blasts on the dive alarm dive dive the alarm wheezed twice sufficiently loud that every crewman aboard could hear but not so loud as to resonate through the hull a seaman saw to the vents and reported all vents shut vents shut aye for any visitor to a sub the obsessive litany of the dive seemed to be unnecessarily repetitive almost comical but there would be nothing comical about it if a single order was botched and the ship were to dive too deep too fast within seconds it could be below its crush depth around three thousand feet and the next minute would be hurtling down unable to reverse its course the quickly mounting pressure of thousands of tons per square inch driving it in excess of a hundred miles per hour to hit the bottom like a bomb imploding its giant frame no more than flatpressed metal scrap a seaman was reading off the depth sixtytwo sixtyfour and a chief of the boat reported officer of the deck conditions normal on the dive very well diving officer acknowledged the ood who in turn reported captain at one forty feet trim satisfactory very well the captain said steer five hundred feet ahead standard the ood instructed the helmsman helm all ahead standard diving officer make the depth for five hundred feet the captain glanced over at the ethereal blue of the sonar room and its halfdozen green video screens of yellow lines each line in the waterfall a sound source from the ocean a world not of silence but a cacophony of noise from the frying sound of schools of shrimp to the steady deep beat of a submarines cooling pump anything interesting sonar negative maybe its a diesel they heard no pump could be sir the captain knew he could go active but then his own position would be betrayed well wait aye aye sir the chinese frigate was now in rough water and mellin alone in the fumeladen darkness was violently ill he had experienced seasickness twice before once in a friends sailboat off the california coast near big sur the other time during a ride up from the mekong delta aboard one of the us riverine patrol boats it was the most terrible sickness he could imagine and hed seen hardened combat troops humbled by the ordeal and whereas normally the eyes became adjusted to darkness the darkness of the paint locker was so absolute that he could not make out anything but the hard bulkhead as once more the ships bow rose hard astarboard shook as if it were coming apart then fell through a gutemptying space colliding with the sea he heard a noise and prayed it was someone coming to let him out chapter twentyone high up in the hong kong tower that he owned by special agreement with the peoples administrative committee of hong kong jonas breem of caloil surveyed victoria harbor and the clustering of highrise apartments and business offices and imagined what it might be like ten years hence breem gesturing with his large scotch and ice to his concubine mi yin said beijing will make a mint maybe not proffered mi yin a diminutive five feet the sheen of her black hair catching a reflection from breems opulent bar breem didnt turn his head but kept looking out the enormous tinted plateglass window swirling the ice in his drink and what the shit would you know about it he said youre paid to fuck not forecast she shrugged apparently not bothered by his vulgar outburst i was just thinking she said matteroffactly well dont he cautioned get your ass over here she got up from the couch the midnight blue qi pao she was wearing amply split at the thigh revealing a brown slash of flesh that breem always found enticing his drink in his right hand he steered her in front of him with his left unzipped the qi pao and slid his hand around following the line of her bra cupping her breasts squeezing them tightly you like that he asked yes she lied and wondered how it was that such a man had risen to the top of the heap in his cutthroat business yet was so stupid about women as to think a woman liked having her breasts squeezed tightly maybe he knew very well they didnt like it but he kept doing it anyhow control of any situation being his nirvana breem called her just one of his hong kong fringe benefits though he knew she was highly intelligent as well as beautiful her sense of irony as subtle as her perfume her timing deft as a lover of long experience he was also sure mi yin was an operative of the gong an bu the chinese secret police sent to keep tabs on him her accidental meeting with him no doubt carefully arranged by beijing well hed screw her on behalf of the people he resolved and she wouldnt get any more out of him than he wanted to give he was convinced that after shed taken off the sexy thighsplit qi pao and made love and he lay back snoring shed be quickly checking his briefcase for the seismic and drill reports he received daily by fax from the various drill sites scattered throughout the countries of southeast asia in one of those quirky war situations not known to the general public the chinese had taken over all the drill sites moving all the american experts to a concentration camp yet the daily drill reports from the skeletonstaffed chinese drill site crews were still faxed to breem in hong kong as the head of chical enterprises and caloil why i wonder mi yin had asked i mean with america and china fighting for chrissake you cant he began unclipping her bra and peeling sliding the qi pao down over her shoulders and buttocks be that stupid what dyou mean she asked like a petulant schoolgirl chinas one of the biggest goddamn investors on the hong kong exchange thats one reason why they dont want this war to drag on theyre looking for a knockout punch early in the game to show the vietnamese who owns what he slid his hand down inside her magenta pink panties its one reason they dont want to upset the agreement between caloil and beijing cmon lets get into the sack how about all the americans from the drill ships she asked the ones taken prisoner hey what the fuck is this an interrogation since when do you give a shit whos taken prisoner anyway the guys that came out to work the caloil sites knew what the fuck they were doing they got extra money you dont care about them much as i care about you sweetheart which mi yin knew was not at all cmon he commanded take off your drawers close the drapes she said why i want the whole of hong kong to see us fuck he was bluffing and she knew it as chief executive officer of caloil he had to obey at least publicly the social mores of hong kong he had to toe the line a bit more regarding sex but even that didnt faze him because in the end when the partys political purists the cadres had their say about good socialistic behavior it would be the same old story all a question of money in this case hong kong dollars cmon he said go down on me she sat on the huge water bed its surface undulating like a small sea as she pulled her hair back and reached across his hairy body for a condom on the bedside table her breasts brushing his face he bit at her nipple ow cmon you beauty you love it right or would you like to be having it off with all these saps she cocked her head prettily like some rare and beautiful bird of paradise saps what does it mean you serious yes she said unapologetically i dont know what saps means losers he said all the losers the chinese are putting in that camp you really dont care about them she said again looking puzzled or was she just putting on a miss goody twoshoes act he wondered no i dont care he answered why should i theyre all over twentyone sugar they dont know what makes the world go around by now its tough tit for them right she shrugged noncommittally what do you think of that he asked looking down at his erection thats what makes my world go round that and money right you dont do it for free do you mi yin didnt answer you love me he asked his laugh was hard and scornful youre a hooker mi yin an expensive one but youre a hooker right but listen he said propping himself up on an elbow grabbing her wrist just remember youre my hooker bought and paid for right she nodded he fell back on the water bed causing a wild wave in the water bed which shivered before it started settling down but man are you built he grabbed her ponytail down over the front of her head and pulled her down on him her mouth was too dry he reached out and poured from his drink now he laughed struck by what he thought was a terrific pun have a scotch on the cock the things she did for beijing the safety of her parents in the balance so let her go through his briefcase he thought checking the seismic and drill reports he received daily by fax from the drill ships making sure that he wasnt pulling a fast one drilling finding gas or oil but giving beijing a different seismic profile from somewhere else in the south china sea where there was little if any promise of gas or oil the trick was to give them a seismic profile made in the same depth as where youd found good promise of oil and to return to the true position of the find later on until ownership of all claims in the south china sea islands had been settled either by the international court in the hague or by what busy law professors were calling a prevailing military presencewhich meant ceo breem had told his eos which army in the area has the biggest fucking guns those that might be involved besides the vietnamese and the peoples liberation army were taiwan indonesia malaysia and the philippines all of whom claimed part of the islands and reefs scattered over the millionsquarekilometer south china sea nearly four times bigger than the united states including alaska breem dismissed malaysia and the philippines the malaysians didnt have the balls to start anything with beijing not with thirtysix percent of malaysias population being chinese then there were the philippines but breem thought they had enough trouble at home trying to handle their terminally ill economy besides theyd kicked out the americans from the big base at subic bay and the american jets from clark field stupid breem had told his executives no the fight if there was to be any would be between the big military muscle in the region china and such traditional rivals and enemies as the vietnamese and the taiwanese with north korea always a wild card then again it wasnt clear whether taiwan and beijing might not subsume enough of their differences to team up making a joint claim for the islands so rumor had it along a proposed fiftyone fortynine percent chinataiwan split and now the exsoviet republics were having a basement sale of everything from the upgraded migs to submarines the pla was modernizing and part of the exsoviets sales ploy was throwing in pilot training for the migs to sweeten the deal smart move breem told his executives noting that the vietnamese navy was strictly brown water coastal patrol but since china had started purchasing more submarines from russia to go blue water so had vietnam with the forced withdrawal of us naval forces from the philippines breem said the whole region is a goddamn powder keg but he was sure hed backed the right horse china would win chapter twentytwo stand up it was said with the same bullying tone as the first time mellin had heard it years ago in the hanoi hilton the pow camp during the time some chinesespeaking vietnamese had helped staff the jail mellin could hardly stand his legs shaky from both dehydration and the continuing violence of the ships peculiar corkscrew motion in the heavy seas the chinese sailor stepped back sharply almost tripping over a hawser the smell of the paint locker combined with that of old rope sweat and vomit hit him with the force of a physical blow the sailor yelled something at mellin to which mellin wheyfaced and unsteady nevertheless answered well how the hell dyou think i like it you bastard the man struck him sideways with a closed fist sending mellin crashing through the doorway onto the deck momentarily concussed blood running from a scrape on his cheek suddenly the foredeck and gun housing seemed to come alive with amplified sound as the officer on watch in the ships bridge harshly reprimanded the crewman who had just hit mellin telling the crewman to help the american up the man made a motion to help mellin but the american pushed the offered hand aside i can get up myself you bastard he saw the chinese face flush with anger and mellin knew if it hadnt been for the intervention of whoever it was up on the bridge he most probably would have been sprawled out again on the deck the man grunted and motioning roughly for mellin to follow him walked off his legs perfectly balancing against the yaw and crashing of the ship mellin barely able to stand his legs still feeling rubbery the next minute he was left staggering like a drunk against the remainder of a huge wave that had hit the ship hard amidships heavy and billowing spray draining off the superstructure and running down the scuppers like a flash flood but unexpectedly mellin felt much better for the bracing drenching water the combination of cold water and fresh salty air partially revived him and though he still felt woozy he could feel his whole body benefiting for the first time in hours the sinusstuffing stench of paint and associated odors left him along with the rush of fresh air he felt more confident his determination returning whereas in the stinking forward locker his seasickness had been so acute that all thoughts of the future let alone hope for it had vanished he wasnt proud of the fact but then hed never felt that ill before either and it was a matter of conditioning when hed been a young man in vietnam as part of the us special forces member of an elite team whose élan was the best possible he was in top physical condition and as the rigorous training had toughened his body it also toughened his confidence no matter how hard life had been in the oil business from the deep freeze of an oklahoma winter to the sweltering days high atop a deck in the south china sea life in the special forces had been tougher and it was this that mellin was harkening back to imagining if only momentarily he was with his old team in the delta and that they were watching him now inside the ship he was taken to a small cabin aft of the mess the cabin was crammed with supplies cardboard boxes of cans leaving room for only four men one wooden stool and two plastic chairs the first thing mellin noticed was how much better the ship was riding amidships than in the gutwrenching paint locker forward though the chairs and the two men in them both junior officers threatened to tilt every time the ship rose to meet a new onslaught the two officers remained all but motionless letting their feet and legs adapt to the roll and pitch of the ship the fourth man stood at the door legs well apart arms folded his face larger than most fat lips tight together eyes staring his whole demeanor was a threat all but daring mellin to make a try at getting out though where he could go if he did break out mellin didnt know why began the older of the two junior officers were you on our reef your reef mellin countered all reefs are ours said the younger officer a thin short intense man probably in his midtwenties all the reefs in the world mellin said in the south china sea said the older midfortyish and stouter man whose tone was not nearly as excited but nevertheless more menacing in its carefully measured cadences doing battle with the scream of the wind and crashing seas we have traditional rights to all the reefs chinese fishermen here long before anyone else is that right yes how do you know its the truth could have been any of a dozen nationalities chinese were here first the older man said so you believe so we know so youve been told the older man without turning said something in chinese but mellin could tell it wasnt meant for him he understood the word nowthey were always telling you now in the pow camp when the older man finished speaking the heavier man guarding the doorway came quickly to attention and left the cabin the stout man took a packet of cigarettes and offered one to mellin no thanks mellin said the younger thinner one eyed the pack of cigarettes camels and when he saw his fellow officer take one then put the pack back in his jacket he took out his own a red packet of fight for the people cigarettes and sullenly lit one who the older man asked discovered america christopher columbus mellin said nonplussed huh the older man said blowing out the smoke at mellin so you believe it could have been any of a dozen nationalities mellin said nothing yes yes the younger officer cut in full of enthusiasm and victory red indians yes ahha yes red indians the door opened and the guard reappeared with a coil of rope and stood behind mellin the older officer took another long drag on his cigarette and asked what were you doing on the reef it looked a nice day for a swim i was shipwrecked as if you didnt know what ship they seemed so intent on knowing the details mellin intuitively felt that his refusal to give them answers might be his only chance of survival remembering how easily the lives of those on the rig had been snuffed out am i under some kind of arrest if i am youd better you the old man said suddenly were aboard the drill ship chical was i yes the younger one chimed in on the drill ship chical had there been no other survivors mellin wondered the drill ship for chical the older officer repeated you were working on her yes mellin said nothing and the older officer sighed nodding at the guard standing behind the american who now tied mellin securely to the chair the guards right hand bunched into a fist and he backhanded mellin so hard the leftside legs of the chair came off the floor the whack echoing in the small cabin were you on the chical the older officer pressed his creased forehead making it evident that his impatience was mounting the guard struck again the blow leaving mellin with a ringing in his ears so loud that it smothered every other sound in that moment the point of information as to whether or not mellin had been on the chical became academic the quest for information now becoming a test of wills the older officer looked tired the guard watching him attentively waiting for the order to hit the american again but instead the older man rose the younger one following suit the guard bitterly disappointed take him back the older man ordered in a tone of finality with the younger officer in tow he left the cabin the guard untied mellin as roughly as he could but left the americans hands bound behind him and jabbed the prisoner up off the chair follow me the guard ordered and made his way forward out the door onto the well deck his lean compensating for the sharp pitching of the ship the fact that he allowed his prisoner to walk behind instead of in front emphasizing his contempt the very thought of being taken back to the paint locker churned mellins stomach his anticipation of the heavy fumeladen locker enough to worsen the pounding of the headache he had from the guards blows to his head at the door of the paint locker mellin stopped and turned waiting for the guard to untie him the guard merely grinned and shoved mellin forward the sill tripping him causing him to fall headlong into the semidarkness among halfused cans of paint dirty cleaning rags and vomit the noseplugging smell rising all about him making it difficult for him to breathe the dampness above his right eye blood from a cut now began to sting and his body convulsed as he threw up from the nausea brought on by the overwhelming stench of the oilbased paint and urine he was sure the guard was leaving him tied up contrary to the older officers intent but he could do nothing about it or at least everything that had happened to him conspired to convince him nothing could be done he had never felt so low not even in nam there at least he could fight back but here in the rolling pitching darkness of the tiny paint locker he felt absolutely abandoned mellin thought of his sister angela who had been posted all these years as mia wondering if her final moments had been like this utterly alone or had she had it worse than he was she perhaps still alive a prisoner or was she dead he clung to the idea she was still alive as if somehow he had unfinished business her unknown fate something to be settled something to concentrate upon in his own abandonment something to hold on to why he asked himself as he lay sick on the cold metal floor why were the chinese so bent on finding out whether or not hed been on the chical had they been behind the attack what made the chinese authorities so interested in him the truth was they werent interested in danny mellin the ships officers neanderthal interrogation of him was merely the result of them carrying out beijings orders orders which in the seething bureaucratic maze of the chinese capital had now been forgotten in the sudden avalanche of paperwork occasioned by the war the activation of chinas twenty main force divisions men nine hundred planes over a thousand t tanks and fourteen hundred pieces of artillery much of it selfpropelled required a massive bureaucratic effort an army of clerks in the great hall of the people and beyond who from the ministerial level of arranging finance through beijings holdings on the hong kong stock exchange to the more than twenty clerks required for each soldier at the front complained that there were not enough computers to help reduce the task in fact even schwarzkopfs hq with all its computerization still required no less than thirty million phone calls for the bombing offensive against iraq alone and still needed three hundred americans behind the lines for every american soldier at the front chapter twentythree the moment the massive tires of the hercules touched and screeched on the runway at the gia lam airfield southeast of hanois center the plane came under sniper fire several rounds penetrating the fuselage a ricochet striking and zinging off an emref troopers helmet how rude doolittle said jesus christ dlupo said ducking thought this friggin place was supposed to be secure settle down freeman intoned coolly over the pa system not showing his own surprise bound to be a few chinese insurgents take a potshot in hopes of shaking us up then trot off home to bed right fucking shakes me up dlupo told martinez the latter agreeing gripping his rifle tightly doolittle meanwhile watched the photojournalism marte price quickly jotting down notes stopping for a moment to push away a wisp of hair beneath her helmet general she asked freeman how about a shot of the emref spearhead just before they deplane freeman nodded all right boys ms price wants a photo of you heroes smile and thats an order marte price was annoyed what she didnt want was a photograph of troops grinning from ear to ear the flash seemed to illuminate the whole plane one soldier asleep the tension having already drained him suddenly sat up what the it was good for a laugh and marte price was satisfied a startled soldier was a good pic for the next edition of the des moines register but already even as the huge plane was coming to a standstill she was feeling dishonest somehow corrupted knowing full well that the registers editor unless told otherwise would run the picture as one of a soldier in a moment of high combat stress as such it would be taken off the wire by most major papers in america particularly given the fact that apart from cnn freeman had excluded any major media network two of the aircrafts crew stood by as the massive rear doorramp was lowered and two humvee scouts each armed with a tow missile launcher and caliber machine gun rolled off onto the tarmac they were followed by the two lines of troops none of whom were below the level of e sergeant first class when they volunteered for emref duty the sniping had stopped you figure this is worth fiftyfive bucks a month dlupo said referring to the airbornes hazardous duty pay no way martinez responded freeman saw two vietnamese one a cadre a political officer coming toward him dressed in traditional black pajamas and liontamer hat the other a senior military officer dressed in the camouflage green khaki of the new vietnam uniform general freeman the cadre said smiling we welcome you and your troops to vietnam cam on freeman said extending his hand first though he didnt like it to the political officer and then to general vinh whatd he say dlupo whispered cmon no you fucking wop martinez said its gook for thank you you speak it too a surprised dlupo pressed yeah me and the general do our homework see oh yeah dlupo challenged all right then whats fuck off in vietnamese easy martinez said chuc ngu ngon all right smartass so you know gook in the penumbra of light about the ramp dlupo saw a woman in vietnamese uniform then another carrying baskets toward the plane dlupo couldnt take his eyes off the woman it seemed as if her whole leg was showing she was walking toward freeman who was politely but firmly telling his vietnamese host through an interpreter now that he was given ample assurances by hanoi via the pentagon that the hanoi airfields were secure and that if there were sniping around gia lam field why the hell didnt hanoi tower divert the american hercules thirteen miles north of the city proper to noi bai airport through his interpreter the cadre assured the general that the gia lam airport was secure there had been only one sniper an exnva regular who the cadre explained was mentally unstable so that when he saw an american plane and a huge one at that as big as one of the b bombers that had attacked hanoi in the vietnam war he had had a false memory the cadre meant flashbackand shot at the big plane i believe the cadre added that you have similar problems with veterans in the united states yes freeman replied tempted to say that as he understood it marxistleninism would make a balanced personality impossible but realizing the cadres explanation was an olive branch being extended freeman accepted it yes we shot up one another quite a bit didnt we after the interpreter had finished the cadre smiled shaking freemans hand again by now almost every one of freemans man spearhead had been given a lei of welcome by one of the female va regulars cnn already bouncing it off a satellite beaming it back to the states and marte price busily taking shots of the cadre and the two generals meeting each handshake a polite but not overly warm gesture of willing cooperation once he realized the cnn camera was rolling freeman the first note of anxiety present in his voice since hed left hawaii called his aide over bob for gods sake make sure cnn gets a shot of the british sas boys emphasize that this is a usled un i repeat un action and that other countries will be making their contributions to the un force within a matter of days and make sure those he stopped unable to think of the right word for a second gurkhas cline said exactly freeman said slapping him on the shoulder and mention the aussies new zealanders south koreans he steered cline away from the vietnamese general and cadre and toward his heavily loaded troops his voice subdued but bob for chrissake dont say anything about the japanese support not even logistical support these jokers in hanoi like much of asia hate the japanese figure the japs still havent made amends for atrocities how about our my lai cline asked reminding freeman of the massacre of a whole vietnamese village by us troops bad as it was bob it doesnt start to compare with the widespread rape and pillage perpetrated by the sons of nippon sons of bitches traumatized the whole of southeast asia and bob sir freemans voice was friendly enough as he smiled back at the vietnamese general and cadre before saying quietly to his aide bob coming down the ramp i heard some joker use the word gook now freeman was smiling broadly you tell em if i hear any disparaging remarks about our un allies i will personally cut the offenders prick off you got that yes general general vinh asked in heavily accented english how long freeman wanted to rest his troops before moving up to the snake the name given by the vietnamese army to the winding front line that snaked its way up down and at times around the base of the hills north of hanoi rest freeman responded general we didnt come here to rest vietnamese people are being attacked by china the un sent us to help and that means now we can move out the moment my boys finish relieving themselves main body of second army in he almost said japan is already assembling for airlift first planeloadll be here in a matter of days general vinh understood most of it except for the part about relieving themselves gia ve sinh the interpreter explained yes freeman cut in gia ve sinh adding thunder box when this was explained to general vinh he uttered an ah of recognition smiling broadly toicome he said motioning to a line of ten threeton trucks all american made looking the worse for wear their engines spitting and coughing in two lines beyond four portable toilets that had been rolled into the apron of light about the hercules as the trucks their blackout headlights mere slits of light in the enormous darkness rolled north from the gia lam airfield freemans spearhead troops whose main function now was to carry out a recon in force for the benefit of second army heard the sound of clapping in the darkness through their infrared goggles against a soupy green background they could see lines of vietnamese civilians clapping here and there and waving tiny us and un flags aint that somethin dlupo said taking his infrareds off as he like others was prone to severe headache from the goggles if he left them on too long gooks welcoming us soldiers im gonna tell my grandchildren bout this one youll tell nobody dlupo a delta first lieutenant said if you keep callin em gooks remember what the general said hell cut your prick off all right dlupo riposted ill call em charlie shit martinez cut in you tryin to sound like a vet listen dick brain i figure in a coupla hours well start being vets if you last that long martinez said thanks a lot marty dlupo charged youre all laughs you know that dave rhin a black man from chicago flicked up his ir goggles man there are thousands of em lined up see em plain as day yeah dlupo said in the rough camaraderie of soldiers well theyre gonna find it hard to see you rhin i told you martinez chimed in to use that fuckin sunscreen rhin hey dick brain rhin retorted they gonna see you honkies all right they dont need no irs to see you man oh doolittle said to his fellow sas troopers in the truck isnt this nice were on our way to a punchup wiv charlie an these blokes start a fuckin race riot lovely init cant understand a fuckin word you say limey rhin said no matter martinez joshed flicking up his irs brits are full of shit anyway youll get yours mite all right the first lieutenant said on the cellular pipe down well be in enemy country before you know it general wants you all quiet as of now the silence was deafening freeman had permitted them to let off steam on the way in from the gia lam field but now that they were past the ho tay west lake approaching the song hong or red river and thang long bridge a prime target for us bombers during the vietnam war every one of the men including freeman was alone with his fear marte price had wanted to stay in hanoi to cover the war but the cnn crew of three had decided to go to the front and being the only woman reporter she felt she would lose face not only for herself but for all the women in the armed services if she didnt go with freemans spearhead recon group someone had joked shed decided to go all the way but there were no laughs sitting in the second armed humvee behind the vehicle carrying freeman cline and the two vietnamese marte price was sick with fear she found to her astonishment that ones teeth really do chatter in the face of a danger so overwhelming that she felt a shortness of breath a rapidly rising surge of panic that momentarily convinced her she was having a heart attack southwest of hanoi in the vietnamese peoples army indoctrination center at xuan mai vietnamese militia and reservists were being told once again that it was not the american people in the sixties and early seventies who had declared war on the freedomloving peoples of vietnam but the imperialist criminals kennedy johnson and mcnamara the fact that the us had never actually declared war attested to by the pentagons insistence on still writing about the war with a lowercase w was not mentioned the american people continued the cadre had had their own civil war and a war of independence against the british imperialists very few of those listening were paying much attention to the cadres harangue all they cared about was that in vietnams neverending struggle the first indochina war the second indochina war and the wars against the chinese war had been the way of life peace was the abnormal condition this time it was again china which had had its eyes on the lush red river delta since two hundred years before christ the vietnamese soldiers didnt need a cadre to tell them the obvious their country was again under attack by the chinese no one bothered raising the theoretical contradiction of one communist state waging war on another communist state for everyone understood that this was a war not of ideology but for territory the rich deposits of oil beneath the hundreds of offshore islands from the gulf of tonkin to borneo in any case the americans had helped the vietnamese once before giving them arms and money to fight the japanese in vietnam war was the way of life the militia and reservists were told that should it become necessary they might have to fight side by side with the americans to plug any gaps the chinese attack might open most of the subdued talk among the young militia and reservists many of them women was of how anxious they were to fight with the americans most of them were too young to have fought in americas undeclared war against north vietnam and the same would be true for many though not all of the americans besides it was a wellknown fact that americans had everything and there was a collective craving among the vietnamese militia and reservists for american cigarettes not only were they the best cigarettes in the world but in many transactions throughout southeast asia they had become the currency of exchange a prime cargo for the south china sea pirates the indoctrination session ended with several militiamen dozing off the general belief being that there would be no further chinese breakthrough that their vietnamese regular army would soon counterattack and with the help of american bombers force the chinese back from the lang son line across the border the arrival of the emref recon spearhead was known to beijing within half an hour of the hercules landing cnn having beaten the transmissions of chinese vietnamese agents who radioed the news to the chinese capital but cnn as part of its deal with freeman hadnt disclosed it was only one hercules and had it not been for the agents transmissions beijing would have been under the impression that the total emref force of several thousand had already arrived in hanoi in any event the news jolted beijing and within minutes the hqs of the chengdu and guangzhou military regions had been notified that the gains made so far by generals wei and wang must be consolidated as soon as possible on both flanks of the lang son frontbefore the american genius for logistical buildup could be exercised it is like general weis cadres explained to his troops attacking a loaded bullock cart kill the bullock driver first before he can unload his weapons and ammunition in this instance wei explained to his hq personnel the carts the us air supply line might not be stopped by the chinese air force but the lead driver freeman was already here and could be killed the chinese general announced that any pla unit wiping out freemans advance spearhead would receive a thousand commendations from the people this phrase was officialese for the fact that any unit that wiped out freemans spearhead force would receive a monetary reward one thousand dollars us it was a small fortune and on the black market it would buy many american cigarettes some senior cadres objected that this was unworthy of the peoples army ideology and was a capitalist corruption of the troops to which generals wei and wang responded that they were responsible for the military tactics and that the cadres with all due respect should keep out of it it was a military not a political matter a senior cadre continued to object and wei told him in very unpolitical terms to perform a sexual act on himself with a pointed stick chapter twentyfour a thousand feet below the surface of the south china sea aboard santa fe a sonar analysis confirmed the earlier sea kings contact as a sierra four or probable enemy surface vessel possible hostile by nature of sound bearing one four six range eighteen miles very well the captain said calmly already at the control rooms attack island man battle stations man battle stations aye sir a

the captain quickly quietly took the pa mike from its cradle this is the captain i have the con commander rogers retains the deck up search scope ahead twothirds scopes breaking reported one of the watchmen scopes clear the captain and the search scopes column became one moving about looking for a dot on the flat metalliccolored sea now the subs sonar had picked up the cavitation or sound of water bubbles caused by the turning propeller of the unknown ship at first it was suspected that it might be one of the destroyers of the carrier battle group but within seconds the noise having passed through the acoustic spectrum analyzer suggested the craft was either a fast knot ludaclass destroyer or a jianghuclass frigate in any case her speed was now knots the details on the computer screen quickly giving the two classes dimensions and armament both equipped with antisubmarine depth charges surfacetosurface hy missiles and mines the ship was now on a heading not for the santa fe

parameters of the subs mission orders to protect the cvbg make the tube ready in all respects the captain ordered make the tube ready in all respects aye sir the luda class had now increased her speed

tube on the port side range asked the captain seventeen miles decreasing every man on the boat went about his business with a deft quiet approach to everything including the placing of the compacted

one aye solution ready weapon ready ship ready match bearings and shoot the mark s ram jet shot the torpedo into the sea at knots given the varying salinity of the water and the relative speed of the two ships it would take the torpedo plus or minus fifteen minutes to reach the target now in the predawn darkness the vietnamese welcome seemed as if it had never happened gone were the lines of villagers whether sent out by the hanoi government or not and in their stead there were only the flitting images of the night a constant stream of misbegotten shapes that with a little fear and imagination could be anything and everything from a chinese t tank to a squad of pla moving up ready to fire but except for the noises of the aging trucks it was a quiet ride for the emref spearhead for whom the only indication of battle was the occasional thump of distant artillery from the direction of lang son this is far enough vinhs interpreter told freeman who quickly alighted from his humvee the first two vehicles in the following tentruck convoy also slowing to a stop tail boards were lowered rather than dropped as quietly as possible and now what was called the great humping began as each soldier prepared to saddle up for the reconnaissance patrol to probe the lang son line general vinhs intelligence reports as good as they might be hadnt provided freeman with enough information for any confident and immediate deployment of second army once it arrived and as freeman told robert cline he couldnt afford a mistake because of something lost in what the interpreter might or might not say he had to find out for himself and so eighteen miles northeast of hanoi just before the town of ba ninh the member spearhead of the emref task force company split into four platoons of thirty men each freemans intention was to proceed toward the lang son front in cloverleaf pattern sevenman patrols from each company constantly moving out on the flanks circling to prevent ambush as the whole company of four platoons one behind the other moved forward a fiveman radio and rifle squad remained with the trucks already helping the vietnamese drivers and guards to camouflage the vehicles mainly against the possibility of chinese recon planes from the border area seventyeight miles away beyond lang son vinh introduced freeman to a group of five vietnamese guides before he shook hands with freeman and stepped into a long march staff car to take him back to hanoi from whence hed rejoin the battle on the western front in one of the strangest verbal exchanges in his career general freeman was engaged in a whispered shouting match with marte price of the des moines register general give me one good reason for me not going a reason you can give that cnn cameraman and that cnn reporter ms price i dont have to give reasons to the press you stay with the trucks you should have gone back with vinh goddamn it ill have you disbarred from the press pool there is no pool general goddamn it you could get shot i know the risks you certainly do not general when you said stay by the headquarters group i assumed that was all the way up to the front well you assumed wrong goddamn it give me one good reason general and ill stay behind youre a woman goddamn it youve used women chopper pilots before and i wish you wouldnt keep saying that well you are a woman arent you i mean saying damn it all the time all right freeman said major robert cline thought the general was about to give in but freeman took a breath and said you smell i what the vietnamese guides he said nodding in their direction have complained that youre a hazard to the operation and i agree they told me they could smell your perfume before the first truck rounded that curve a hundred yards back chinese regularsd sniff us coming from a hundred yards away for a moment marte price was lost for words but then suddenly she knew she had a counterattack general i can smell cigarette smoke and none of your troops are smoking now ever walk into a motel room where theres been a smoker you can smell it right away im not in the habit of going to motels he replied grumpily but she had him and he knew it despite all their instructions in training special forces like the delta force and sas about not using deodorant and so on a smoker carried the stale smell of cigarette or cigar smoke wherever he went all right freeman said more fiercely than before and in an uncharacteristic non sequitur that would become part of second army lore he added dont blame me if you get killed goddamn it i wont she said quietly smiling her features more distinct now as the predawn light stole upon the clearing in the black jungle by the road ill rub mud in my armpits she said as freeman turned to walk over to the vietnamese guides he confided to major cline by god i hope the chinese arent as tough as her well get our clock stopped pla use women in combat general were not the pla were americans with some brits and aussies to come plus the british gurkhas yes yes i know were a united nations force according to lore it was similar to what george patton had said cline thought when he complained about eisenhower being an ally and not an american the general liked everything his own way and after freemans spirited exchange with marte price cline had a sneaking suspicion that his intent to carry out a recon in force and return within four days was being done not just to better deploy second army now arriving in hanoi but for some other reason which no one including the pentagon knew about letting her come along with us general will win you a lot of kudos back home and round the world via cnn im not interested in kudos from the femisphere major far as im concerned those rampant feminists i meant from the pentagon general theres been a big push for equal rights damn it bob the armys not a democracy even the chinese know that after years of that comrade crap theyve now reinstituted rankdifferent pay scales maybe so general but my guess is having a woman reporter at the frontll do you more good than harm back home freeman turned to cline you make it sound like im running for office general eisenhower did im not a political animal maybe not general but i still say your decision to have marte price will raise your profile promotionwise i didnt decide she did even if she did i dont think youll regret it its politically correct i dont give a dogs turd about political correctness and you know it cline knew it but the general had an ego as big as an m tank and it enjoyed being refueled every now and then with a headline or a tv sound bite that would keep the legend alive the general pulled down his ir goggles to take another look at the topographic map between bac ninh and lang son near the vietnamesechinese border about thirty miles of it across part of the lush red river delta and then into the hilly jungle country of the border range first hed send out one patrol along the sides of the road for five miles there was no point hoofing it as he put it if he could use the trucks for another few miles or so he was confirmed in this tactical decision after one of the vietnamese guides got off the radio with hanoi to say it had been reported that chinese units were pulling back from the delta ten miles or so up the road toward kep only nine miles from lang son freemans smile was a wry one the kind he used when a colleague played chess with him and thought hed baited a trap besides part of the freeman legend was speed well ill tell you one thing bob were going slowly up that road in cloverleaf if the chinese have pulled back that quickly then its for one of two reasons its because their attack into vietnam has been so successful that theyve outrun their supply line or its a trap think we should stay put awhile general no you dont win wars by sitting on your butt either way well have to find out whats going on the thing is to be ready for whatever happens but before we do send out a patrol i want our flyboys in that enterprise battle group to be ready for some tacair if we need it were not going to get arty he meant artillery for a few days until the selfpropelled guns can get up here from hanoi general cline said in amazement what whats wrong nothing that marte price woman undid her blouse and stuck some dirt under her arm for chrissake freeman said chapter twentyfive aboard the chinese frigate there was a rising sense of panic the lookout had seen the wake of the american torpedo through his binoculars and given the captain a threeminute warning with the torpedo coming midships the frigate quickly began a standard shake off procedure turning hard astarboard to run parallel with the torpedos wake and then as the latter changed direction hard astarboard again next the captain ordered a fan pattern of depth charges off the sterns starboard side the turbulence of the resulting semicircle of explosions bothered the torpedos advanced seeker heads computer but only for a second or two and then like a hound suddenly recovering the scent the mark locked onto its prey as the frigate made its last attempt to run parallel its helicopter lifted off from the stem pad only seconds before the santa fes torpedo exploded starboard midships lifting the bow high and dumping it the ships back broken fire already raging about the stern orangeblack flames leaping wildly the sea about the stricken ship literally boiling white from the intense heat of the explosions and fires abandon ship the chinese captain called and within seconds a good quarter of the man crew were jumping overboard some of them accompanied by the white plastic drums of the beaufort selfinflating rafts as the paint lockers door opened two crew were almost stuck in the opening such was their rush to reach the life jackets stowed in the locker neither one nor the crew members who followed snatching life vests and running out again gave a thought to danny mellin stunned by the concussion of the explosion he wandered around bumping into and pushed aside by the panicky sailors eventually blinded by the daylight mellin felt his way to the forward starboard railing by letting his hands follow the line of the bulkhead his vision cleared enough for him to see the sea afire off the starboard side he turned made his way over to the port side and jumped hearing the screams of several men who either in their haste or panic had dived into the boiling caldron the portside water was hot but as mellin used his hands to paddle himself away from the sinking ship the water cooled rapidly he kept pushing himself to get farther away from the frigate so as not to be dragged under when she plunged all around he could hear men shouting frantically as an oil fire having spilled through the gaping hole that had been the midships began to spread the moment hed taken off from its stern the frigates helicopter pilot knew his landing pad on the jianghu was gone he now had one of two choices he had fuel enough to go east and make the pla navys base at yulin on the southern coastof the big island of hainan or he could head south following what was now a pale but nevertheless quite clear wake left by the superfast american torpedo he turned south along the wake only meters above the sea with two of the latest homing yenchow asw depth charges their shadows skimmed over the water like two dragonflies the torpedos wake broken here and there by different salinity patches racing up at the pilot in an endless blur on the wider blur of the cobaltcolored sea now four hundred feet below the surface the watch crew of the santa fe could hear the chinese ship going down her bulkheads popping as she sank farther and farther down to her sunless grave there had been a second or two of celebration the santa fe having done her job but now all was silent in the control room save the sounds of the dying ship crackling and moaning over the subs pa the captain turned it off he could only imagine what was happening to the chinese crew he had taken his boat down fast after the explosion fifteen miles away because some of the chinese ships like all surface navies sometimes carried a reconasw helo depth alone wouldnt help him but speed might and now santa fe without any discernible noise or tremor had gone from to knots in an evasive zigzag and sshaped pattern when the helo neared the end of the wake or where the wake had been dissipated by the motion of the sea the pilot didnt drop magnetic homing mines for he was aware that the hunterkiller sub would now be well away from its firing position normally following such a wake was risky business for it was believed that the american and british ssn sensors now had the capability to pick up chopper noises if they were near the surface where sound would travel up to five times faster in water than air and that in this case the enemy could launch a surfacetoair missile either by torpedo tube or vertical launch tubes forward of the sail but the pilot dismissed this from his thoughts for he knew that the subs sensors no matter how sensitive would be overwhelmed and smothered by the sounds of the frigate breaking up the chopper pilot was now radioing his position to zhanjiang the headquarters of chinas southern fleet and at the same time while hovering a hundred feet above the seas surface feeding out his dual magnetometer to sense any magnetic anomaly such as that caused by a ships metal andor microphones all he got on the dipping mike was the hissing of the sunken frigates oil fire still raging amid a slurry of flotsam and debris the magnetometer showed a fairly consistent reading of seabed magnetics for the area he reeled in the dual magnetometermike unit which looked like a threefoot piece of pipe suspended from the end of the cable as the helo darted forward to continue its dipping it looked for all the world like a dragonfly hovering one minute then skimming hovering over another spot the pilot receiving radio confirmation that two pla air force ilyushinh light asw torpedo bombers with an intensive torpedobomb load of pounds were approaching the area escorted by two shenyang js versions of the mach mig upgraded by the purchase of us avionics the shenyangs were armed with three nr mm cannon and airtoair missiles on wing hard points they would not save the helo as for every new dip the helo pilot made trying to locate the hunterkiller the lower he was getting on fuel the best he might hope for would be to ditch after giving his last position and maybe get picked up by a pla navy patrol ship but unlike the extraordinary lengths that the americans and british would go to to save a downed pilot the pla navy air force or army would do so only if it constituted no more than a minor alteration in course the enterprises forward air combat patrol was notified by the enterprise group e hawkeye advanced warning aircraft of all radio traffic between chinas southern fleet hq at zhanjiang and of the dot on the awacs radar screen which could only be a helo computer translation took fifteen seconds longer than usual but it was quite clear that the chinese asw bombers were coming out from yulin to search for the santa fe and the enterprises team of two fs were now put on an intercept vector to first meet the two shenyang fighters the sharks of the south china sea were no different from any other of their breed they would not attack unless they were hungry but blood in the water was an attraction they could not ignore and mellin exhausted from hauling himself onto one of the rubber rafts saw that the predators were now among the survivors of the chinese frigate ripping and gulping turning the roiling waters crimson mellin and the two oilers in the raft with him lay exhausted one of the mens breathing was so strained from his lungs being covered in oil mellin could hear the rasping sound he made above the cries of terror as crewman after crewman thrashed in sheer panic in frantic efforts to reach a raft anything that would hold them mellin could see dozens of dorsal fins cruising about amid the material and human flotsam now and then a dorsal fin would suddenly move much faster as another shark in the school made its sudden attack not far from the raft he was on mellin could see one of the chinese crewmen in a mae west his right arm unable to move because of burns trying to make for the raft mellin reached out to him but the current and turbulence of the water kept widening the distance between them oars mellin yelled to the two others in the raft where are the damn oars the two chinese looked at him in bewilderment there were no paddles cmon mellin yelled using his right hand to paddle his head indicating the man in the water paddle paddle with your hands cmon one of the chinese unenthusiastically joined mellin the other covered with oil and still wheezing did nothing the man in the water the sailor who had beaten mellin aboard the ship kept drifting away toward the frenzied screamfilled cauldron that was the shark attack mellin took off his life jacket and slipped over the oilgreased side of the raft striking out in a breaststroke toward the badly burned crewman he grabbed the collar of the mans mae west and turning about struck out for the raft when he reached the raft he told the two crewmen aboard it to help him they didnt understand english but they knew what he wanted the one covered in oil did nothing the other man started to panic yelling and shaking his head it was clear that he thought if mellin tried to drag the burned crewman aboard the raft would capsize grab his arms mellin yelled near exhaustion himself now the man aboard the raft was terrified shaking his head no no in utter exasperation mellin heaved the burned man up against the rafts gunwale the mans weight already tipping the raft as he slid back into the water out of the corner of his eye mellin could see several fins coming his way with a last herculean effort he pushed the burned crewman up against the raft the ablebodied crewman in the raft out of sheer fright that if he didnt help the raft would capsize hauled the burned crewman as mellin still in the water pushed next mellin tried to haul himself aboard but he was out of breath his strength momentarily drained until he felt something pass him and touch a leg the next thing he knew he was aboard the raft water pouring off him the rescued man flat on the bottom of the small craft his reluctant corescuer screaming hysterically at mellin at the near capsize mellin couldnt have cared less all he cared about was the next breath when he recovered a few moments later he looked at the guard who was stretched out beside him and moaning in pain shouldve let you sink you bastard the man covered in oil was dead the remaining chinese talking excitedly pointing skyward where he could see two h ilyushin bombers and high above them the glint of two fighters the jabbering crewman in a reverie of anticipation for now they were sure to be rescued several men in other rafts floating among the limbless dead were also cheering the frigates helo had skimmed a few miles west and dipped the magnetometersonar registering a magnetic anomaly it could be unusually strong metallic deposits on the seabed or it could be a submarine the pilot dropped two depth charges went higher waited for the sea to erupt into two mushroomed columns of greenishbrown water didnt see any signs of a hit and so dropped two floating orange marker flares for the ilyushin bombers to see he then headed off toward yulin the plas naval base in southern hainan dropping a purple parachute flare over the thirty or so crewmen from the sunken ship some of them waving to him as he glanced anxiously at his fuel gauge sitting up now in the raft mellin could see the thin spirals of orange smoke marking the spot where the helo pilot had dropped the depth charges and he said a prayer for the sub that the chinese were now searching for despite the sub nearly having killed him it had told mellin that there was war with china and now at least he knew where he stood the dogfight between the two shenyangs and the two fs of enterprises air combat patrol was short and stunningly unequal tally two tally two afterburners came the first american pilots voice indicating he could see both shenyang fighters five miles select fox two four miles three miles lock im up lock him shoot fox two fox two the sidewinder missile took off from the american plane streaking out toward one of the enemy the other american plane also firing a sidewinder within seconds of one another each missile found its target there were two orange flashes one many times the size of the other as the second shenyangs fuel tanks went up splash one came the excited voice of the first american pilot splash two following only seconds later aboard the carriers combat information center there were shouts of jubilation good kill good kill the air boss said echoing one of the pilots exultations outstanding the pilot of the lead f acknowledged the congratulations from the carrier the other pilot said nothing part of him exhilarated by the kill the other half feeling sorry for the downed chinese pilots only one having a chance to eject in a way attacking the two shenyangs whose maximum speed was mph with two fs at mph was a little like mario andrettis formula one chasing a pickup unless the chinese fighters happened upon fs with complete surprise highly unlikely given the fs multimode airtoair and airtosurface tracking radar the shenyangs didnt stand a chance despite their having jettisoned hot spotsmagnesium flares to decoy the us missiles but if the two american pilots from the enterprise had good reason to be supremely confident of their aircrafts ability they gave the chinese pilots top marks for courage neither shenyang pilot had run from the fight but had kept coming headtohead to do battle both american pilots and those back in the enterprises cic knew how different the outcome might have been had the chinese sent out their migs the fulcrums now being purchased at bargain basement prices by china from russia and other republics within the cis the fulcrum with a maximum speed of mph was faster than the fs by miles per hour and was considered by many particularly by the modern german luftwaffe pilots as the worlds preeminent fighter without the shenyangs as cover the two h bombers were embarrassingly easy for the two fs to shoot down one exploding in air the other afire and in an uncontrollable spin one crewman ejecting his white chute blossoming against the blue expanse of sea and sky for some reason the spiraling hs two mm nose cannons kept firing their aimless bullets striking the sea like errant pebbles scattered over the water all right danny mellin said as the h smashed into sunglinting pieces as it struck the sea in excess of miles per hour the chinese crewman who had refused to help mellin rescue the guard who was only now coming around looked at mellin with an expression of sheer hatred for the american he said something to mellin but despite mellins basic knowledge of chinese from his pow days in nam he couldnt understand though he guessed it was some kind of insult the chinese crewman repeated himself this time jabbing his finger at mellin danny his eyes squinting in the harsh glare of the sun on water nodded as if he understood yeah well fuck you too sheng sheng the first thing that came into mellins head means one liter and the chinese crewman was utterly perplexed sheng oh sheng fuck mellin said not feeling as cavalier as his tone suggested he knew for sure that once he fell asleep the crewman would push him off the raft he had to stay awake and so a deadly waiting game began the guard alternately coughing and moaning still lay in the fetal position on the undulating floor of the raft sheng the crewman said thats right mellin replied both men watching each other as intently as two cats with territory in dispute the raft should have had several liters of water as part of its supplies but the only thing attached to the gunwales was an ancient packet of hard crackers and salt tablets mellin looked about for other rafts to hail but the half dozen or so he could see were too dispersed several bodies or rather what was left of them floating up and over the swells which were growing in intensity and height a chinese container ship the wang chow from shanghai en route to san francisco via honolulu when hostilities broke out had been turned back by a us navy destroyer northeast of maui the destroyer escorted the wang chow back to honolulu where its cargo mainly cheaply made cotton clothing destined for the american market was impounded and its crew of thirtytwo interned that evening produced one of the hawaiian islands legendary sunsets an incandescent orange turning to a crimson the streaked high cirrus clouds giving the promise of another splendid day in paradise as the uss madison a combination hunterkillerballistic submarine of the sea wolf iii series egressed out of pearl harbor past degaussing ships the magnetic signature of the ship wiped lest an enemy pick up the signature and file it in its threat library had the madison been in any foreign port no matter how urgently she was wanted elsewhere her departure would have been delayed until four divers it used to be three had swept her acoustictiled hull and declared her clean but given it was in comsubpacs home port and the urgency of the situation in the south china sea the uss madison set off promptly once having cleared the safety nets in pearl she headed up the channel her sleek shape more like a cigar than a teardrop slicing through the water as easily as any behemoth of the deep the explosion took place at hours as she was preparing to dive shattering the hull underneath and forward of the fairweather or sail ripping out the torpedo room water tank forward trim tank and tomahawk vertical launch system it also ruptured two of the three forward starboardside ballast tanks whose implosion doused some of the forward subs fires but not all of them within a minute firefighting teams had donned their white asbestoshooded nomex fire suits some strapping on the emergency air breathing apparatus hose others the more portable obx oxygen breathing apparatus temperatures were already degrees celsius and climbing fire control crewmen trying desperately to make their way through choking dense smoke with their infrared thermal imagers had it not been for the quick action of a charles f adamclass destroyer nearby with her fire hoses and her bravery in coming alongside despite the acute danger of the torpedoes in the madison blowing the whole sub and its crew might have been lost instead of the sub being badly damaged with thirtythree of her crewmen reported killed it had been a torpedo attack right off the mouth of pearl harbor or more precisely it had been a mine a us acoustic mark captor mine in effect a long tubular sheath housing a mark torpedo its computer control programmed to lie in wait for certain classes of sub with their telltale cavitation upon sensing this the torpedo would be let loose from its housing from now on as directed by the cno all us submarines including all deepdiving submergence rescue vehicles had to be swept along with egress lanes whether in a home or foreign port the extent of madisons damage would keep the boat in dry dock for at least three months as well as necessitating an undersea and an evaluation center test the chinese ship wang chow was soon swarmed by seals and other underwater demolition teams and theyd found brackets for a halfdozen mark captor mines underneath set into her hull thank god they didnt sink it altogether a petty officer said he meant the madison might as well have an ensign said its going to slow down one hell of a lot egressing out of pearl sub or surface vessel damn chinese might just as well have sunk her two of his best buddies had died during the mines attack comsubpacs naval intelligence confirmed from serial numbers on remaining usmade mark captor mines that they had been among those purchased and then resold in east asia prior to hostilities by a south asia industries owned and operated by a mr jonas e breem chapter twentysix while tazuko komura was packing some food and juice in her kitchen she thought about a man in the phone booth shed seen the night before below for what seemed an unusually long time through the small telescope in her tiny threeroom apartment shed been able to see that the man wasnt using the phone but was dusting it with a small brush it both frightened and reassured her frightened her because it meant police or jdf agents were closing in altogether too close but reassured her because they were dusting for prints obviously they didnt know who had used the public phone and what would they have heard when they tapped it a mans voice asking for a mrs yoshio and a womans voice hers answering that there was no yoshio living here and anyway the police who were following up the call couldnt possibly know it was the signal for her to act to do what her cell of three had spent months planning even so tazuko knew she would be in grave danger the moment she stepped out on the street if anyone searched her shopping bag they might find the explosive or would the way she had camouflaged it fool them as she finished her coffee she noticed her right hand was trembling half from fear half in excitement she knew she must control it and in order to do that she first had to lose control she was wound up tighter than a spring tazuko lay down on the carpeted floor placed a pillow beneath her head with her left hand and slid her right hand under her skirt and taut white nylon panties very soon she was moaning softly moving ever so slowly at first but then increasing the pressure until she was rolling back and forth in her mounting ecstasy suddenly her back arched and it was as if she was suspended in time her free hand clutching the air when she woke fifteen minutes later she felt drained of all tension her nerves calmed for the task ahead in the south china sea approximately halfway between the spratly and paracel island groups the helo from the now sunken chinese frigate ran out of gas and dropped like a stone into the sea naked in his recliner belching after draining another scotch on the rocks breem farted told mi yin to get the fuck outta the way of the tv and switched from the local hong kong station to cnn where they were showing more shots of the pla herding prisoners theyd taken from various liberated oil and gas rigs into a makeshift pow camp somewhere in china more fucking losers breem proclaimed taking a handful of beer nuts trying to pop them in his mouth one at a time and missing now and then some of them rolling down into his crotch fetch them baby go on fetch this was followed by laughter that rippled through his belly hey hey hey he said abruptly sitting up an abc scoop window was superimposed on the lower right corner of cnn pictures of the chinese destroyer picking up victims of a warmongering attack in the south china sea by what was believed to be an american submarine breem zoomed in on the superimposed abc window the new york anchor reporting that a sea wolf ssnsbn had been sunk off the hawaiian island of oahu by what naval sources were unofficially describing as an americanmade captor mine or mines it was suspected that the mine or mines that had gutted the us sub had apparently been laid by a chinese merchantman the wang chow en route to the us west coast when hostilities broke out between china and the united states now abcs nightline was reporting over forty crew aboard the man submarine had been killed due largely to a subsequent firecreated explosion in the forward torpedo room more fucking losers breem proclaimed his mouth half full of beer nuts oh well more yuan for bi he was talking about breem industrials listed on the hong kong exchange as one of the south asia industries group how come mi yin asked come any way you like breem thought this bon mot hilarious and laughed so hard scotch and beer nuts sprayed the carpet he tossed mi yin the empty glass ice my little juicy fruit more yuan for me my lovely because who is the biggest seller of marine munitions among other things in the near east you are mi yin said handing him a glass of crushed ice turned golden with johnnie walker course he added manufacturers of captors et cetera dont know ive cornered the market they only sell through legitimate firms saps breem knew he was drunk and that he was talking too much but hey juicy fruit what fuckin good is success if you cant share it right he meant flaunt it yes right he bellowed right chapter twentyseven danny mellin couldnt walk properly conditions on the pla navy destroyer that had picked him sheng and the guard from the raft along with other survivors of the torpedo attack against the jianghu frigate had been so crowded that his right leg had gone to sleep as he walked or rather limped down the gangplank toward the waiting pow trucks he had little sensation in his right leg he didnt know where he was except that it was a chinese naval port given the number of destroyer frigates and fastattack patrol boats moored there as they parted company sheng said something to him laughing at him dismissing him with the contempt of a man who had been down a little while before but who was now clearly on the winning side you prick mellin said shouldve let the sharks the next instant he was down on the dockside his head numbed by the blow blood oozing from the left side of his face a pla soldier clubbed him again with the aks stock this time in the stomach somebody an australian by his accent helped danny up easy does it mate these jokers ave no bloody sense of humor at all the same guard pushed the australian in the small of the back both danny and the australian kept quiet half climbing half pushed up the tailgate of one of the threeton trucks loaded with an assortment of captured rig workers two pla navy guards including the one whod just struck him rode at the end of the two benches of about ten pows each the aks unslung ready to fire as the truck took off with a jerk that jarred everybody aboard the australian held up his hand hey thumper he called out to the guard whod just clubbed mellin you got any water me mate here he indicated mellin looks pretty badly dehydrated up shut yelled the other guard you up shut all right the aussie said piss on you too mellin could see the guard starting to move toward the australian but the ride was so rough the guard stayed where he was glaring at them holding on to one of the trucks two high roll bars the australian waited till the truck was climbing a hill its engine in a high scream the guards glancing at some peasant women walking along the roadside names mike murphy whats yours mellin danny you a rigger murphy asked yeah you i tease chinese yeah well be careful not to worry you been mellins mouth was so dry he could barely talk interrogated yet no murphy said and for the first time a shadow of alarm crossed the aussies face chapter twentyeight tokyo cia langleys fax to its tokyo field agent henry wray was to the point expedite songbird immediate stop message ends wray asked his jdf colleagues to bring in the korean prisoner jae chong and put him in the paper box it was three feet square two feet high and made of slotted cardboard that could be dismantled and reassembled in seconds the suspect or prisoner had to squat in the middle of the square and god help him if he moved we may have to wait a long time till he talks one of the jdf agents said we cant wait too long wray countered he thought of the danger that one person one mishap could have on the complicated and vital logistics tail of second army that would stretch from japan to hanoi give him an hour on his haunches wray suggested if he hasnt talked by then beat the shit out of him no bruises hai agreed the youngest of the two jdf agents he didnt like gaijinforeigners including americans but he especially disliked koreans particularly those from the north that afternoon at a quarter to three they picked up chong from his job as a janitor for an apartment complex not far from the ginza strip the timing was important for chong who knew that sooner or later they would get him but had they arrested him an hour earlier he probably would not have withstood the beating until the departure of the joetsu shinkansen bullet train from tokyos ueno station to niigata on honshus west coast over two hundred miles away as it was by the time the beating started the to niigata was well on its way across the kanto plain north of tokyo speeding toward the fourteenmile daishimizu tunnel which would take tazuko komura from japans front or the omote nihon to ura nihon the inner japan beyond the alps before she had moved to the frenetic glitter of japans east coast the west coast around niigata had been tazukos home in its own way niigata was as flashy and as fast as tokyo but not far from niigata you were in the small villages of japan hundreds of years old it was a japan in which having a life of yutakasaof great value was not measured in yen or worldly possessions but in the spirit of harmony one experienced with the rhythm of the seasons and the wisdom of traditions passed down from one craftsman to another for tazuko it had still been a land in which she was one of the gaijin but its affinity for things rural and old captivated her her nostalgia however was a fantasy at odds with the often harsh reality of modern industrial japan with the kind of industrial wealth pyongyang wanted to emulate but tazuko felt no such contradiction and knew if she was to give her life to help thrust north korea onto the stage of major world powers then she would give that life and should anyone doubt her courage then they would soon doubt no longer at first she hadnt planned anything even remotely heroic but heroism if it meant selfsacrifice had more or less been forced upon her by the stringent security carried out by the automatic rail scout machines that constantly monitored the tracks of the bullet trains had anyone wanted to put the sausageshaped explosive on the rail tracks or supporting structures they would have had to do it in darkness for the moment they used a light their position would have been immediately identified by the infrared track cameras besides the way to inflict the most damage on the japanese psyche was not to blow up part of the track but to stop the train itself to puncture their much vaunted and worldwide reputation for speed safety and quality also if they expected an attack it would be on the southward tokyohakata line where us and jdf troops would most likely travel as part of the buildup of force in vietnam tell him wray said lighting another cigarette that if he doesnt tell us the name and whereabouts of his contact hes going to have an accident a fatal one ive already told him the jdf agent replied maybe he thinks were bluffing no the jdf agent assured wray he knows the other jdf agent indicated to the american that they should go outside in the hallway they talked about how far they really wanted to go wray said he didnt want to kill the son of a bitch but with the segmented airsea second army supply line stretching from japan to hanoi over miles away any sabotage would be disastrous for what the un hoped would be freemans counterattack against the chinese the jdf agent said he didnt mind beating the crap out of the north korean it would be a message to the gong an bu chinese intelligence that if they insisted on using gaijin to do their dirty work in japan this is what would happen to their agents wray now that his bluff was being called wasnt so tough he said the trouble with killing the little bastard was all the fucking paperwork involved but what he really meant was killing the little bastard was a contradiction of what they were supposedly fighting for inconvenient stuff like habeas corpus without wanting to sound weak wray wanted to convey this to the jdf agent chinesed just take him out and shoot him in the neck if he was one of ours we dont have to shoot him the jdf agent said there wouldnt even be a bruise yeah yeah wray said but like i said too much friggin paperwork its up to you his japanese colleague said amicably well stick a barrel against his head and tell him to tell you who he contacted and why i mean their specific target the jdf man made a face it was a question what happens if he still doesnt answer youve lost all credibility right try it wray said ive got a hunch the little bastardll sing like a bird do you want to try it the jdf agent asked what he meant was you lose face if you want to wraysan but not me all right wray said ill do it give him another fifteen minutes to think about it then call me chapter twentynine on the point of freemans recon patrol dlupos squad of seven men from the first platoon had moved out to the flanks and back again in cloverleaf pattern a rifle platoon between them and the hq section behind them the warm jungle dampness causing their shirts to cling to them like saran wrap under the kevlar bulletproof vest each man wearing a patrol harness pistol belt two ammo pouches one smoke and two fragmentation grenades and a kbar knife in addition to bandoleers of machinegun bullets a poncho crations for the ninetysixhour probe of chinese positions a claymore mine and a collapsible shovel but all this mountain of gear except for his m was ready for instant jettisoning if necessary by a quick ruck release strap leaving the grunt as free as possible to fight behind the hq squad of general freeman major robert cline marte price the radio operator pfc rhin and the two cnn crew was a weapons platoon led by martinez made up of sas and delta veterans they were a rear guard but moving as cautiously as the men on the point lest they get caught in an ambush should the enemy try to sucker them in by allowing the point the hq and rifle platoon to pass before springing a trap the haunting night sounds thousands of birds and some of the millions of bats from caves like those around lang son filled the darkness with such a flood of noise that was both unnerving and reassuring since neither side would hear the other in the middle of such a racket unless the chinese tried to move tanks or selfpropelled heavy artillery units down the road the noise of the bats and the general confusion theyd caused in the undergrowth amid a variety of animals from wild pig to small deer serow goats and flying squirrels seemed to cease almost as quickly as it had started then it began to rain a deluge dumped on the jungle immediately washing off much of the insect repellent on exposed flesh in ten minutes the downpour too had ceased and now masses of insects mainly mosquitoes buzzed and rain could be heard plopping from the trees into pools and onto the canopies of broadleafed plants as the soldiers unavoidably brushed against them there was a dull thump followed by another then another mor but the mortar rounds had already landed splitting the air their explosions throwing up earth in huge dark convulsions of undergrowth and fire men screaming all around the frenetic chattering of machine guns opening up another scream and the purplish veined explosions of grenades the crash of more grenades mortars the air hot coming in bursts whose concussion stunned and whose shrapnel lacerated the thick vegetation like hail though the farthest ahead dlupos squad was only now coming under attack the trap being sprung men yelling on the perimeter two oclock five five and another explosion the air acrid with the stink of cordite and muddy earth hunkered down freeman was calling back to the trucks for a relay message to hanoi for tacair from wherever he could get it it came but not quickly enough by the time four tomcats roared in from enterprise as dawn broke their ordnance bristling on hard points their vapor trails sculpted golden by the early sun the fighting was over the enemy had withdrawn and freemans recon force was left with nine dead and about an equal number wounded medevac choppers now appeared like black bugs descending as freeman stomped about marte price badly shaken by the attack moved behind him from corpse to corpse she could see his eyes moisten but whether it was from suppressed rage compassion or both she couldnt tell goddamn it he said to no one in particular for second army to get mauled like that first time out in nam excuse me general robert cline interjected its hardly second army i mean this recon force is only numbers arent the point bob goddamn it i was led to understand that our approach to the snake as our vietnamese colleagues call the front line would be he heard a soldier moan but couldnt see him one of the delta contingent had given the soldier or what was left of him a shot of morphine but it couldnt hold the pain he was lying in the cool morning shade of a hardwood tree his head hidden in a triangle of leaves when freeman neared the man and saw what was left of his face he clamped his jaw muscles so tightly marte price could see them bulge freeman took another couple of paces toward the man and knelt beside him gently pulling away one of the broad leaves that had acted as a curtain the mans face was gone from the bright bloody pulp that had been his nose to the deep purplish red of where his eyes had been the miracle to freeman was that the body was still alive its lips lacerated moving like some obscene puppetry freeman put his right ear near the mans mouth and he could smell the rusty metallic odor of blood and a vile stench of excrement he nodded looking to marte like a priest listening to the confession of a bedridden believer freeman took the mans limp right hand in his and squeezed it slightly nodding his head yes he said to the soldier and with that unclipped his side holster and pulled out his medevacs marte said in a few hours the woundedll be i know freeman said without looking up would you go away now please and he let the slide back into his holster go away he told her still watching the mash of bone and raw flesh now he heard a click a camera and bob cline took her by the arm my god she told cline reluctantly following him away from the tree for a moment there i thought the general was going to shoot him he was cline said matteroffactly but it wouldve panicked everyone and given our position away to any they heard a scuffle behind them dont look the major said but she already had and clicked her camera again oh my god freeman had cut the grunts throat the blood bubbling out the mans legs kicking about with such force they were splashing the mud up and about what was now the corpse it wasnt that uncommon in combat and seasoned correspondents had seen more than one mercy killing but it was something marte price hadnt seen before and it was always terrible to see grimfaced freeman walked over to her you use that and youll end my career now reports were coming in from dlupos men on the front of what had been the cloverleaf formation and from the second and third platoons of the number of enemy killed fourteen and five wounded prisoners the terrible shock of that morning however didnt fully occur until one of the four medics in the emref having done all he could for his wounded buddies moved on to help the enemy prisoners the first was bleeding badly from shrapnelcaused lacerations to the arms and chest the medic bandaged the wounds and gave the soldier a shot of morphine it was only when he saw the second prisoner the mans upper right leg hit by an m round that the medic realized he wasnt treating chinese freeman was called and arrived just as cline was having a look at the wounded man whats up freeman asked curtly his face still creased by the strain of having put one of his own men out of his misery general cline replied looking up from the wounded prisoner youre not going to like this like what damn it marte prices camera clicked and whirred as it advanced the film freeman turned on her goddamn it lady cant you use a quieter gadget than that you can hear it whirring from thirty feet away marte price said nothing she was watching cline exchanging a worried glance with the medic cline straightened up sir i think we ought to get one of our vietnamese guides over here freeman looked down at the corpse grimly adding so he doesnt look chinese probably from one of the hill tribes near the border chinese have vietnamese sympathizers from the border regions i he stopped as if hed just run out of breath a lot of pla sympathizers were probably wearing those goddamned pajamas peasant garb could even be from the laosvietnam border the hq phone crackled and a hushed voice from the third platoon told freeman and his force that there was movement in the heavy underbrush at eleven oclock four hundred yards off on the left flank behind them and coming from the direction of the hanoilang son road a creaking metallic noise tanks cline asked freeman general freeman it was a highpitched womans voice piercing the heavy jungle growth but there was no reply the emrefs reconnaissance force having gone to ground the instant theyd known of an approaching force it was an old vietnamese ruse to learn someones name on the opposing force particularly that of the commanding officer and to call out the name giving the impression they knew a lot about you even among battlehardened veterans it was a nerveracking experience for no matter how many times you might be reassured by your own commander the fact was that somehow they had discovered your name somehow they were getting inside information and had found out exactly where you were general freeman the voice was coming from about a hundred yards back general vinh is here yeah right dlupo whispered and im fucking queen of the may general freeman do you hear me in the hq platoon freeman via radio ordered his first platoon to swing around hard left in a cloverleaf patrol while the remaining three of the four platoons settled in defensive posture okay said first platoons sergeant quietly turning to dlupo you take the point queenie and the patrol moved out general freeman the womans voice on the left flank of the hq platoon seemed closer now and seven and a half tense minutes later the hq radio crackled to life a report coming not from the left flank but from dlupos platoon up ahead alpha one to mother hen weve got a white flag fifty feet in front of us alpha one freeman ordered do the same fly a white flag dlupo was watching the woman she looked chinese at first sight she appeared to be alone but now that his eyes had been fixed on her for several minutes dlupo and others in the squad left and right of him also saw the two men materializing on either side of her one of the aks looking for all the world like a stubby branch of a tree slowly dlupo wondering why freeman had been so ready to answer a white flag with a white flag reached up to the elastic khaki band about his helmet and felt for the field dressing package the only ready white material in his kit cover me he whispered hoping that the two of his men nearest him on the flanks about thirty feet away from each other and either side of him had heard him they didnt but they saw dlupo rise slowly the white bandage wrapped loosely around the end of his m the woman her hands held high in surrender advanced slowly toward dlupo and now the two vietnamese guides moved forward stopping by the four dead vietnamese men in the black pajamas there was a short rapid exchange between the guides its tone more revealing than any translation telling freeman that his worst fear any commanding officers worst fear had been realized it had been a blue on blue the innocuoussounding phrase the army used whenever there had been a clash between friendlies or allies the wounded men in the black pajamas were now talking rapidly at the guides confirming that they were part of vinhs men not part of the chinese army the americans had fired upon their allies or had it been the other way around whatever the failure of one side or both to properly identify the other had led to the disaster of twentynine americans and vietnamese killed and fourteen wounded to make matters even worse vinhs force on the americans left flank which the americans had thought was the creaking noise of pla tanks was in fact a vietnamese relief column moving along the hanoilang son road riding their bicycles some with tires punctured riding on the rim malaya freeman said his tone terse malaya cline asked nonplussed after the japs hit pearl harbor freeman answered they drove south on the jungle roads through malaya get a flat tire theyd just keep going on the rims sounded like armor on the move to the aussies and the brits scared the hell out of em it was a throwaway comment but it reminded captain boyd freemans press officer just how encompassing and particular freemans knowledge of military history was marte price was having a war of conscience about whether or not to file her fax report on freemans mercy killing and his use of japs instead of japanese when she saw the two vietnamese guides talking fast and gesticulating wildly looking down at and up from the dead men in the blackpajamascumuniforms she knew then she had a really big story two legendary old foes the united states and vietnam represented by freeman and vinh both commanding specialist forces had screwed up marte prices story about friendly fire would be avidly picked off the wire service by hundreds of newspapers in the us but it was cnn with its four phone and umbrella antenna that almost instantly sped the pictures of the american dead to its billions of viewers all over the world via satellite both freeman and vinh refused to be photographed for what they both freeman vociferously vinh less so but just as firmly referred to as propaganda for beijing and they were right the blue on blue or friendly fire episode that had killed the four vietnamese gave way to charges by gis that yet another army situation was definitely fubar fucked up beyond all recognition other mild pejoratives courtesy of cnn rained down from us soldiers and chinese alike and for the first time since the terrible tank battles at skovorodino in another unsanctioned intervention general douglas freeman though still not knowing who had fired the first shot took full fronton responsibility for the debacle in private he was fuming knowing that his overall command of the us forces in vietnam was in jeopardy the only good news he received that day was the ringing endorsements of his corps commanders of second army now en route to vietnam from japan many of them had been with him at skovorodino in siberia where his armor was lured into a trap by false tanks that us aerial reconnaissance had spotted and those in second army who remembered the humiliation also remembered freemans audacious comeback in some of the largest tank battles since kursk in washington there were congressional calls for his freemans removal as c in c of the un force but the president and joint chiefs held firm all of them knew the pitfalls of command particularly the huge psychological bridge that had to be crossed by old foes such as vinh and freeman suddenly having to form a coalition vinh was hardly criticized at all by the american left the latters venom directed almost solely on freeman whom the left saw as a warmonger who must surely harbor old antagonistic feelings toward the vietnamese people general vinh immediately came to freemans defense saying that mistakes had no doubt been made by both sides adding that the fault lay with the aggressive imperialist policies of beijing whose determination to steal vietnamese territory in the spratly and paracel islands and whose claim of ownership of the whole of the south china sea started the conflict in the first place and in one of the strange paradoxes of modern politics general vinh who had fought so hard as a young man against the americans in particular the american division in the vietnamese war was now welcomed aboard by rush limbaugh and others on the political right of the media and within days vinhs defense of freeman was used to batter the democratic left into virtual silence but greenpeace complained that the us transport ships carrying second army toward vietnam were flushing out their bilges at sea and thereby endangering the delicate sea life ecosystem in the waters off the china coast freeman who was clearly meant to be cowed by this second public salvo against him responded via marte price that greenpeaces complaint sounded like a lot of bilge to him and that greenpeace might better occupy itself with concerns about the delicate ecosystem of human beings in and around lang son who lay dead and dying as a direct result of the worst pollution of all invasion by what was now over ten divisions over chinese shock troops how do we know they were shock troops general press officer boyd asked afterward because freeman replied they gave us a hell of a shock thats why yes sir said boyd another thing captain boyd sir i want you to find a few good stories about the flagrant chinese violation of the environment laws in particular the violation of the law prohibiting the killing and or transport of wild animals you know the sort of thing i mean believe eating crushedup tigers ballsll give em a dick big as a tigers boyd blinked ah i mean sir you sure about that course im sure anyway you can flesh out the details make sure it gets on cnn get the bastards

arent you get that story out hear me i want those animal rights people raising shit with greenpeace moaning about the damn fish our supply line ships are supposedly traumatizing take the heat off us he winked at boyd can you handle them i think so sir the general smiled do so captain or ill fire you and boyd sir i want that report in an hour yes sir chapter thirty tokyo henry wray wouldnt have beaten the north korean prisoner at least not as badly but the man had said migookamerican and spat at him with his overtime robbing him of sleep and contrary to all the rules and practices for selfcontrol hed learned at langley wray snapped and punched the korean off his haunches the man falling over crashing into the twofoothigh wall of cardboard that had formed the disciplinary square about him at this the japanese interrogator went wild kicking the man in the head twice before wray his hands trembling with the strain of the war between the anger and common sense raging inside of him yelled thats enough at his jdf colleague but the north korean spat again and wray lost it besides what was it that detective used to say on nypd blue he thought afterward at some point in the interrogation room you take off your belt and leave the constitution outside wray and the jdf agent had gotten each other going and once or twice their blows coincided they were so frantic to give it to him little bastard was probably holding the key to an attack on the second army convoy which was now out over the macclesfield bank miles eastsoutheast of the plas yulin naval base on hainan island who did you contact wray yelled who did you call the north korean either couldnt or wouldnt talk that night wray signed out and faxed langley that he was ill and would have to be relieved from in effect taken off songbird he went home and opened a bottle of johnnie walker black label an expensive escape in japan and drank long into the night occasionally flipping channels but mostly watching cnn for uptodate news of the war he saw a raging argument going on among demonstrators of various political stripes in the front of the white house then a zoom shot showing the state of play between a greenpeacer and an animal rights advocate the animal rights lady who looked remarkably like a cat where did cnn get this stuff he wondered from some casting agent was complaining loudly about the barbaric practices of the chinese their crimes against animals and the greenpeacer was arguing just as loudly about how greenpeace was for animal rights too but that the animal rights issue was a red herring put out by the fascist administration in washington to divert all attention away from the real war against the environment if this was a fascist administration said the woman it is the greenpeacer charged if it was the woman replied the police would be dragging you away right now theyll be here you wait another demonstrator an unkempt redhead shoving her way into the fray proclaimed its not the chinese who started this its the vietnamese theyre the real aggressors bullshit someone called out yeah piss off lady wray didnt know which lady was being referred to the animal rights one or the redhead now there was a special news bulletin reporting that there had apparently been some naval activity in the south china sea wray grunted in drunken disgust it was about as helpful as saying there was a weather disturbance somewhere in texas the nonspecific nature of this newscast upset wray much more than it normally would have he was a perfectionist and vagueness about anything irritated and at times disturbed him especially when hed been drinking heavily on top of this there had been the days dismal failure of not getting anything out of the korean and on top of that of losing his cool and the unspoken maniacal encouragement hed given the jdf man which made him henry wray of the cia no better than the north koreans he told himself worse he finished his scotch and walked over to a map of southern japan surprised there had not yet been any kind of attack on us and japanese shipping by north korea maybe the korean had made contact about something else but not knowing what it was even what it might be filled wray with a despair despite all his years with the firm made infinitely worse by the booze a plunging feeling deep in his gut his conscience telling him that he had stood far too long at the edge of the abyss and now it was staring back at him that he was out of control he reached inside his jacket took out the mm beretta automatic and fingered it like a blind man for a few minutes as if it was something hed lost touch with as if he was reacquainting himself with an old friend then he put it atop the tv chapter thirtyone dalat central highlands it was near dusk when a policeman pulled up to the american visitor by an alley off duy tan street and asked for identification and the special permit to be in lam dong province though the american lifting of an embargo against trading with vietnam had meant better relations for several years old habits died hard among some of the highlanders who as young men had fought the americans in the vietnam war the american captain raymond baker from the us legation in ho chi minh city was dressed in civilian clothes he presented his passport with three tenthousanddong notes about three us dollars sandwiched in the middle the policeman moved back a few paces into the alley said nothing took the money handed back the passport and began walking eastward down duy tan street baker slipped the passport into the waistband money belt he wore and called out to the policeman which way to lang bian mountain they tell me the views are bac the policeman answered north his thumb jerked back over his shoulder twelve kilometers you must hire a guide baker didnt know whether this was official policy or simply wellmeant advice in any event he decided he would hire a guide the policeman had already seen that he was a cultural attaché at the us legation and might therefore already suspect him of spying around dalat though now with the us and vietnamese allies against the chinese it was difficult for baker to imagine what military mission the vietnamese policeman might think he was on unless the policeman had guessed that he was up here possibly searching for mias the discovery of an mia would be highly embarrassing at the moment not only for the vietnamese but for their american allies as well a hitherto mia suddenly turning up would prove extraordinarily damaging to the us publics support for us assistance against the chinese invasion rekindling memories of the interrogation and treatment of us pows during the vietnam war it was too dark now to start out on the twelvekilometer journey to the five volcanic peaks of lang bian mountain that rose to over six thousand feet above lush countryside and baker went instead to the nearest midrange hotel booked a room for the night and asked if he could hire a guide from there to go to his ultimate destination of lat village near lang bian co phaiyes the desk clerk replied but first you must buy permit who from dalat police baker wondered why the policeman who had stopped him hadnt told him about the permit how much he asked one hundred thousand dong ten dollars us baker nodded and started up to his room when the clerk called after him telling him that he had to leave his passport at the desk for security baker brought out an expired but unpunched passport that he kept specifically for such purposes it wasnt his first time looking for an mia he knew they wouldnt bother looking at the date so long as it had a lot of the rightlooking stamps tiredly it was unusually warm for the central highlands baker made his way up to the second floor of the peoples palace and spread out a local tourist map of dalat on the mattress atop the old creaky frenchcolonial style wroughtiron bedstead the map was poor in quality and seemed to have no scale but he did discover that lat village was in fact not a single entity but consisted of a half dozen or so hamlets which hamlet had the old man on the sampan meant perhaps lat village had been the only description the old man had been given most of the villages were inhabited by the laks the others by kohos mas and chills and so now he saw more sense in the hotel clerks advice about a guide and given what were bound to be the different dialects of the villagers he might need more than one guide already his mission to ask about any possible mias in the village was becoming complex and there was no early bus from dalat to lat so he would be obliged to hire a car he suddenly wished hed stayed in ho chi minh city his colleagues at the legation there were probably right the mia tip was probably a waste of time and baker knew he wouldnt get any encouragement from washington now that the americans and vietnamese were allies against china a live mia still being kept as a pow would be embarrassing all around on the other hand washington had enough on its mind with the war that mia search policy had more or less been forgotten about baker estimated hed need at least a week to visit the hamlets alone for though he spoke vietnamese he wasnt familiar with the dialects of the central highlands he reflected momentarily on the only hard evidence hed ever unearthed about an mia two sets of dog tags and a pile of bones which the us army forensic lab had determined were human but he still remembered the phone calls then the letters of the two gis parents and while more and more the question of mias of them from the old vietnam war was receding and being shunted aside baker knew that if a young soldier of about twenty had been taken and was still being held he would now be in his late forties or early fifties and that the pain of his loved ones like that of the parents of any missing child would still be there he unpacked his suitcase took out a glass jar of boric acid and like someone marking a tennis court tapped out a line of the white powder until the rectangle he made about the bed was complete around midnight he thought he heard someone outside his door or was it someone in one of the next rooms he sat up and listened the noise ceased and all he could hear in the background was the faint tinkle of a radio probably from one of the rice stalls in the street below chapter thirtytwo susan d basehart was an american who had tired of having most of her money invested in smallyield blue chip stocks diagnosed as having inoperable cancer of the bowels her life expectancy at most a year she had decided along with other american and asian investors to gamble most of her money on a new stock in asam industries a firm sold on the promising research carried out on the feasibility of highspeed maglev magnetically levitated train travel on commuter routes with tests of banked speeds up to mph and mph on straightways the commuter run from penn station in new york to union station in washington dc averaging mph would take less time than it took to take a limo from manhattan to la guardia and you could move hundreds of passengers at a time no matter what the weather asam shares jumped from ten dollars to within a month of being issued at a hundred dollars fourteen percent of the shareholders sold but susan basehart held on sure it would very soon climb to over a hundred dollars as the tokyoniigata express raced through the countryside at over a hundred miles per hour tazuko komura took care not to look in the foreground that was receding in a dizzying green blur of fields and supporting trestles of the fastline track instead she looked beyond at the steadier scene of long variegated rectangular sheets of newly dyed kimono linen stretched out on the green fields to dry they looked like strips of exotic flags the train was now on the flats going in excess of mph she pressed the button the flash of the explosion could be seen for miles the sound of it now rolling thunderously across the countryside like thunder the forward section of the train split in half as if struck by some enormous cleaver bodies incinerated the rear sections of the bullet train telescoping into one another in excess of mph then shooting off the elevated rail ten meters above a field into mangled tubular heaps of smoking metal and upholstery that were giving off columns of toxic smoke there were no survivors body parts strewn across the field and among the trees of a small wood outside sanjo nhk japans national network got to the story first then cnn within fortyfive minutes of the crash susan baseharts stock in asam industries tumbled she lost over and was effectively wiped out subsequent media investigations pointed out that sabotage had almost certainly been the cause of the catastrophe in which all passengers and crew were killed and that bullettrain railway technology was markedly different from that used in maglev vehicles but these reports had little or no effect on the stock markets of the world confidence in supertrains had crashed with the tokyoniigata express as susan baseharts health grew worse exacerbated by the shock of her near financial rain she was told that due to medical bills only some of which were covered by her health plan she would spend her last days in a public ward at bellevue the effect of the bullet train disaster in japan was to produce a chilling recognition among the japanese public and in particular in the japanese defense force of just how vulnerable rapid transit movement of supplies and people was to terrorism in the interrogation room of tokyos jdf offices the north korean agent jae chong was shown a video of the train wreck and given a single sheet of paper by one of the jdf agents who told him that if he didnt start writing down contact names and numbers he would be beaten again its no good protecting the bastard that blew it up the jdf agent told jae chong acting on a hunch that because of stringent security on the bullet trains and with no package being allowed to stand unattended it had probably been a suicide bomber jae chong sat there immobile only the muscles in his face and the blinking of his eyes giving any indication of his nervousness he slowly took up the ballpoint pen and then just as slowly put it down bastard the jdf agent yelled and punched him in the temple knocking him off the stool a call came through for the jdf agent from cia agent henry wray whats the story wray asked he sounded drunk nothing yet i just saw the shinkansen wreck on the tv the jdf agent waited was he supposed to say something well wray said has our songbird started to sing no ill come down i will send a car for you the jdf man said no ill be all right grab the chikatetsu the jdf man thought quickly thats all he needed the american half pissed on the subway turning up downtown reporters had already staked out tokyo police hq pressing for news about the shinkansen wreck please let me send a car wraysan all right wray said youre paying for it wray took the beretta off the top of the tv now that so many people had been killed on the bullet train he felt justified in having told the jdf to smack the north korean around hell he said talking to himself in the tiny hallways mirror and grabbing his hat from the rack on the second tray shouldve beaten the prick earlier fuck the cardboard box it only gave a suspect more time to think to weasel their way out of it well henry wray was going to put the mms barrel right against the son of a bitchs head and hed better start talking over three hundred people wray said hands in his pockets almost four hundred men women and kids were killed on that shinkansen you little prick so youd better start writing chong understand the jdf agent could see that wray had the beretta in his shoulder holster so that chong would get the message understand wray repeated hai chong answered nodding good chong bent over the small table in front of the stool his shoulders slumped then with a sigh of defeat he began writing down a phone number i dont know the name he said i just call the number somebody answers and i leave a message if you dont have a name wray said what happens if you misdial get a wrong number the jdf agent was impressed for someone half hungover the cia man was on the ball whoever answers chong said using his sleeve to wipe off a trickle of blood running down his chin says the number then i leave my message huh wray grunted leaning forward to pick up the paper chongs left hand hit him in the face chongs right hand pulling out the beretta he fired once before it cleared the holster the shot hitting wrays heart at pointblank range the second shot lodging in the jdf agents stomach again at pointblank range throwing the agent back against the wall streaking it with blood the japaneses legs buckling he slid down to the floor blood spurting out from the gut wound the interrogation door swung open and chong fired again dropping another jdf agent others scattering in all directions chong ran out firing two shots at random clerks and other agents diving for cover behind desks as chong reached the elevator it wasnt open immediately he ran for the stairwell where taking a terrorized woman hostage pressing the guns barrel against her neck he made his way out into the street it was now dark and raining the ginza strips neons coming to life as he walked down the street suddenly releasing her he made a dash down an alley and disappeared into the nighttime crowds of shoppers the wail of police and ambulance klaxons filling the air chongs escape and the three men he left dead in the jdf building provided a field day for the press and a nightmare scenario for those officials responsible for the japanese end of the logistical supply trains that were to provide the american second army in vietnam with vitally needed supplies the jdf now knew that as a hunted man jae chong had nothing to lose there was no doubt that he would be recaptured but the question was where he andor other north korean agents would strike next chapter thirtythree north of hanoi along the road to lang son general george c scott freeman to his acute embarrassment found it necessary to halt his advance recon cloverleaf patrol because of lack of information about where general vinhs forces were to make matters worse the chinese fourth division had penetrated the vietnamese army positions along the fifteenmile lang sonloc binh front pushing vinhs regulars back along the lang sonban re railway creating the possibility of widespread confusion between the emrefs advancing reconnaissance patrol and the retreating vietnamese for now freeman and vinh decided to have the emref recon force withdraw sixty miles south to phu lang thuong along the hundred mile lang sonhanoi road so as to avoid any further blue on blue incidents one of the deciding factors in the usun vietnamese decision to have the american and unled force pull back was the lack of good radio communication between dispersed vietnamese positions creating the everpresent danger of a unit of withdrawing vietnamese running into allied or their own units in the thick jungle freeman could have easily rationalized his forces pullback as press officer boyd advised by pointing out the inferior vietnamese communications ability which posed the greatest danger of a blue on blue instead freeman in a cnn interview that night explained the pullback as a joint tactical decision made by him and general vinh it was a facesaving gesture for the vietnamese which general vinh would not forget freemans pullback of his emref spearhead however received less than fair treatment in most of the world press it became an opportunity for all those who either disliked andor were jealous of freemans reputation as one of the most if not the most aggressive us field commanders since george patton will you be withdrawing any farther south general a british news pool reporter asked with vinh looking on freeman hedged his bets we may find it necessary to regroup to bac ninh ten miles farther south but he turned to general vinh i dont expect anything more than that general vinh nodded his agreement immediately which told freeman the vietnamese general knew more english than his interpreters had led the usun team to believe freeman held up his right hand to signal that the press conference was over cam on rat nhieu press officer boyd surprised looked at major cline i didnt know the old man could speak vietnamese cline smiled theres a lot you dont know about the old man he does his homework well do you know what he said some form of thankyou i think but he sure didnt like that limeys question about maybe pulling back farther apart from skovorodino its the only time ive seen him pull back its against his religion which is his creed is frederick the greats laudace laudace toujours laudace audacity audacity always audacity maybe boyd said but he didnt get off to much of a start stick around cline advised hell surprise you for instance boyd challenged robert cline thought for a moment freeman was in a winter battle once leading usun forces one of the many wars thatve erupted since the berlin wall came down and we got the new world order anyway freeman gave the order to withdraw his armored corps of m tanks retreating from russianmade ts everybody thought he was nuts cracking up major cline paused to light a cigarette and boyd pressed and cline continued as the temperature kept dropping minus fifty degrees minus sixty freeman kept pulling the ms back until it got minus seventy with windchill factor then he suddenly orders all the ms to stop and attack the ts cline took a deep drag on the cigarette he liked this part wanted to tease it out a little show how the freeman legend had grown that it wasnt all bullshit like some of the johnnycomelatelies thought it was so boyd said anxiously awaiting the outcome what happened ms slaughtered the ts knocked out over ninety percent of them i dont understand boyd said by now marte price had come in on the fringe of the conversation i remember she said the oil in the russian tanks froze at minus sixtynine degrees right and the waxes separated out in the hydraulic oil lines clogged the lines like lumps of fat in an artery russian tanks couldnt move seized up and freemans tanks knocked them out major cline blew out a long stream of smoke thanks for ruining my story ms price call me marte all right thanks for ruining my story marte youre welcome major she answered impishly youre not the only one who knows freemans a stickler for detail chapter thirtyfour the truck carrying danny mellin the australian murphy and a dozen or so other pows including several vietnamese and caucasian women abruptly stopped the prisoners told to get out by the two aktoting guards once down on the crushed coral road the prisoners despite some of them limping and showing other signs of wear and tear were ordered to start marching down the whitish road toward a clump of trees from which the noise of construction issued forth along with chinese shouts the stubby trees were more like tall brush and soon through gaps in the trees the prisoners most of them vietnamese with two australians and three americans could see a long line of men in black pajamas about fifty or so passing what looked like variegated stones on a firedousing line as mellin and murphy got closer to the gaps in the scrub they could see that cement powder was being passed as well and was being used to build hut walls about ten feet high up to this point mellin like most of the other pows thought he was somewhere on the southern coast of china but then rounding a bend in the road mellin murphy and the others were astonished to see an endless expanse of ocean jesus murphy said were on a friggin island up shut shouted one of the pla guards jabbing the australian in the ribs with the kalashnikov okay mate the australian said with a conciliatory smile dont get your balls in an uproar the guard smashed him in the back with the rifle butt sprawling the australian on the crushed coral road his arms lacerated and bleeding mellin bent down and despite the fierce headache he was suffering from his earlier altercation with the same guard helped the australian back to his feet be quiet he whispered to murphy theyll kill you the next second there was what sounded like an enormous underground explosion the crushed coral road beneath them trembling momentarily and now the sound of the detonation hit them in a series of gutpunching waves the guard who had hit them and who would soon be known to the pows as upshut was laughing calling out to the other guard at the head of the line and pointing to the stunned disarray of the prisoners mellin and murphy like the rest of the pows who had been landed by the destroyer would find out the next day after spending a very uncomfortable night in the open that the explosions which were underwater and offshore were part of the plas plan to use the blownup coral to add height to what was essentially a reef island one of the many in the nansha or spratly islands which at high tide was covered with several inches of water large parts of it becoming visible only at ebb tide but building up the island reef and maintaining it with a company of over a hundred pla marines was only part of the plas plan to occupy all islands in the spratly and paracel islands a more pressing purpose was at hand but it was one neither danny mellin nor mike murphy would discover until the sun rose on another perfect tropical day it would be a day that would turn into a nightmare for all those taken prisoner by the plas invasion and occupation of rigs and islands scattered throughout the two strategic groups of south china sea islands cays and atolls for mellin it was like being back in nam and as he lay there beneath a bloodred moon caused by the pollution of rig fires he became disgusted with himself for his hands were trembling and he feared that the guards brutality had not yet reached its peak it was the only thing he was sure of everything else why they were here for instance was an open question and laden with anxiety hed given up smoking years ago but right now he craved a cigarette the stronger the better to calm his nerves incredibly next to him mike murphy was fast asleep and snoring to beat the band as the aussie would have said but then the australian hadnt been in a war before and as yet hadnt suffered the soulbreaking loneliness of the pow in solitary perhaps the pla wouldnt separate them and perhaps when youd finished doing whatever they wanted you to do theyd shoot you in the neck he heard a prisoner urinating and the neverending crashing of the sea on the reef after jae chongs escape during which he had killed two jdf agents and wray of the cia the ambulances raced through the city to help those injured by flying glass during the melee in the jdfs hq there was special consternation among the staff how was it that the american wray was permitted into the room while he was still armed a direct contravention of internal jdf regulations someone was going to get it in the neck for that violation and never mind about the possibility of the families of the deceased suing even though the jdf officially had no office of intelligence in all the confusion of how to word the official report of the shootings that would have to go to the minister it was a junior clerk who found what looked like a phone number written on a piece of paper that had been lying bloodsoaked in the interrogation room he gave it to his section chief who immediately punched out the number on his computer waiting for the numberaddress correlation listings it came up on the screen as a local number for kentucky fried chicken very amusing the section chief said decidedly unamused the headquarters staff got the distinct impression that the chief was more interested in recapturing chong for ridiculing him than for killing the two agents and the american to be on the safe side the chief ordered a stakeout of the kentucky fried chicken outlet it wasnt beyond the range of possibility he told his staff that the gaijin chong had written down an actual contact number that some other gaijin working for the kfc outlet was in fact a spy for a few days however the chiefs loss of face could be measured in the number of chicken and cockadoodledoo jokes doing the rounds of the japanese defense forces hq that is until the funeral of the two agents and the return of wrays body to the united states reminding everyone that jae chong the uncooperative comedian was also a killer and a killer who now had nothing to lose as one of the biggest manhunts in japanese history got under way chapter thirtyfive taipei you turd youve been looking in your mirror you asshole this edifying exchange was not unusual it merely signified that yet another day of debate had begun in the democratic life of the lifa yuan taiwans legislature between the nationalist and democratic progressive parties the subject of discussion was whether or not taipei would contribute any of its wellequipped and superbly trained armed services to the un force under the command of general douglas freeman taiwan as the congressman shen from kaohsiung in the south put it was caught between a rock and a hard place about what to do in the conflict between the un in effect the united states and china if taiwan did not contribute to the joint un force congressman shen pointed out then washington would be angry but if taiwan did furnish troops and materiel to the un force then beijing would be furious indeed beijing had already cautioned taiwan about getting involved on the american side remember the communist chinese had warned them after the war youll still be there and well still be here only a hundred and sixty kilometers away we can wait fenshensueikuwe will break your bones a member of the nationalist opposition party rose and suggested that if the government was too gutless to throw taiwans hand in with the americans who during the hard times of the fifties had contributed enormous amounts of aid as well as putting the us seventh fleet between taiwan and mainland china to thwart a communist invasion then the very least taiwan could do was contribute money to the un cause like japan a nationalist party member charged springing to his feet as gutless as japan in the iraqi war war by checkbook you talk of war by checkbook you the ardent followers of chiang kaishek the joke was a pun on the english phrase cash my check the name harry truman had given to chiang kaishek that such an aside could be made in the lifa yuan no matter that several legislators wanted to punch mr shen in the nose for making it was a measure of just how far or for the nationalists just how low taiwan had come in its surge to a multiparty democratic system well break your bones shouted another legislator in warning that there was a dire risk of war with the mainland should taiwan assist the us or the un in any case another warned the americans wouldnt want a war on two fronts vietnam and taiwan on three fronts another legislator said dont forget the spratlys beijing certainly hasnt in addition to risking war with the mainland taipei had another serious matter on its mind namely the fact that because taipei had prohibited direct offshore investment in the mainland economy which would constitute a de facto recognition of beijing the only way in which taipei businessmen could do business with the burgeoning entrepreneurs of the mainland was to either become petty smugglers or if they were big investors to funnel their money through middlemen in hong kong such as jonas breem within his south asia industries group when the taiwanese noninterventionist decision reached the white house there was disappointment on the part of the president but not surprise americans had not had to live under the guns of the pla for almost half a century however among the joint chiefs of staff there was resentment in view of the fact that us forces and billions in foreign aid had helped taiwan develop into one of the powerhouses of asia with one of the highest levels if not the highest level of personal income per year cia chief david noyer helped put the situation in perspective when he advised those present at the morning intelligence briefing that despite taiwans official refusal to become involved in the un stand against the peoples republic of china the republic of china could still be helpful in maintaining and where possible activating its covert network on the mainland and in the south china sea submarines the president inquired they only have four and none of them are nuclear the chief of naval operations admiral reese was impressed by the presidents recall of taiwans status in the military balance of power no not subs noyer said though ive no doubt they could prove useful in helping us with guarding our japanvietnam convoys and beijingd have no physical proof of their intervention but what i mean mr president is their clandestine operations on the mainland saboteurs if they could help sabotage the ningminglang son railway in the south we could sever the head of their logistics line for how long ellman asked depends on what kind of job the taiwanese agents can do however long it is itll help freemans force fine the president said but what if the taiwanese are captured and talk noyer shrugged beijings hardly going to go to war with taiwan over that besides which taiwans agents on the mainland are mostly mainland chinese for most of them its not a matter of ideology its just another way of making money like the smuggling the president said that goes on between fujian province on the mainland and taiwan ellman suppressed a grin the president was showing off fair enough it wasnt a bad idea now and then to let the joint chiefs and noyer know that he knew more than he told them in his briefing papers and besides the president continued theres already a tremendous amount of jealousy in china between the north and the more prosperous south the northerners are seen as snobs in power while the south is prone to much more capitalistictype economic drives and theres one hell of a lot of resentment by the minority groups and the nonmandarinspeaking groups against the north all right ellman thought thats enough we read the state department memos too even so noyer appreciated the president making the point it was surprising how few congressmen fully appreciated the fact that there were serious divisions within china which if handled adroitly by agencies such as the cia could help the fight against the pla the president turned to noyer have we enough operatives of our own in china no sir thats why it would be good to have some liaison with taipei on this we already have liaison with them cno reese cut in unofficially of course yes admiral noyer replied but i mean at the highest levels such as the president inquired noyer decided to press a little in the firm it was called coveringyour ass i mean sir that if we had the chief executives authorization to negotiate a deal with taipei the president was doodling on his desks leatherbordered blotter all right he replied you have the chief executives goahead dave but i caution you that if its screwed up in any way no one in this roomll remember anything about authorization he looked at ellman and the joint chiefs is that understood they nodded their assent well be discreet noyer put in i have just the person in no the president cut in i dont want to know whether its animal vegetable or mineral nothing nada they all smiled in agreement they were the presidents men of course the president added his tone much lighter now that the serious decision had been made to help foment trouble in south china or anywhere else along general weis and general wangs supply lineknowing you dave youll probably have one of their goddamn pirates representing us there was hearty laughter except ellman noticed from david noyer who merely smiled politely the main thing the president said grasping noyer affectionately on the shoulder is that we help freeman until he gets up to proper strength over there with men and materiel hell need all the assistance we can give him it was the understatement of the year chapter thirtysix the chinese were pushing south all along the fifteenmile dong danglang son front with followup divisions from the chengdu military regions fourteenth group army pouring through the hole punched out by artillery at lang son troops spilled down into the patchwork quilt fertile valley southwest of loc binh eleven miles southeast of lang son here they were joined by forward elements of several divisions men from guangzhous fifteenth group army of men the remaining troops were split between an infantry division of and an airborne division of officers and enlisted men and kept in reserve in and around lang son to help repulse any breakthroughs in what the pla commanders knew would be the inevitable americanled un and vietnamese counterattack the two commissars the political officers of general weis and general wangs armies had joined forces and convinced wei of their argument to keep pushing south to hanoi wang however was arguing that both group armies while still north of hanoi should pivot eastward near phu lang thuong and instead of worrying about hanoi should head for the vital port of haiphong thirtyfive miles to the east one of the political officers interjected comrade your plan to turn east toward haiphong is most commendable militarily commendable wang cut in it is in my view essential his fingers jabbed at the map of northern vietnam haiphong is the tail of the american supply line if we capture haiphong we can prevent supplies from japan from ever reaching freemans troops i have already said comrade that militarily this is sound as far as it goes but hanoi is the capital and is only twentyfive miles from phu lang thuong the capture of the vietnamese capital would be of major psychological significance once the capital falls morale collapses that wang replied is a hypothesis comrade haiphong is a fact only another twentyfive miles south comrade wang pointed to the map twentyfive miles comrade can be a lifes journey yes we have done well so far because we have had the element of surprise but now that is gone and the americans will soon launch an attack if we keep striking south general we will overrun hanoi and then the americans will withdraw as they did once before when saigon fell they will flee like rabbits and vinhs vietnamese will withdraw ever southward will they wang asked his skeptical tone indicating quite clearly what he thought of the political officers conclusion yes the political officer answered his confidence as evident as wangs skepticism the americans comrade have no more stomach for another long war in vietnam wang shook his head the americans have no stomach for another defeat in vietnam or anywhere else comrade iraq revived their confidence and haiti haiti the other political officer responded was nothing our young communist pioneers could have taken haiti i disagree comrade i am not interested in haiti the political officer said but im interested comrade wang replied about your wang thought carefully your preoccupation with hanoi is this truly your view or is this beijing speaking i am with the party on this the political officer said there was a long tense silence no one wanted to lose face wang lit a cigarette offering the packet around the other three accepting graciously i will go this far wang proposed i will keep attacking south with general weis army group on my right flank if we meet strong resistance at phu lang thuong i will turn east toward haiphong calling on our reserves of the fifteenth group army to reinforce my spearhead i will use armor to race for the port and destroy the americans before they can organize a fullscale counterattack we will move at night and rest during the day as general giap did and the north koreans in their civil war to avoid american air attacks the political officers conferred a compromise was reached the generals would have ten days to take hanoi if they did not succeed they would accede to general wangs strategy and support him in a drive east to haiphong wang was not satisfied but it was two against one with general wei ready to follow whatever would be best for his career prospects all right agreed wang but i wish to draw your attention to the americans industrial capability i was a very young man when my grandfather told me stories about the american devils in korea they were all but driven into the sea and for their marines trapped at chosin reservoir it was the longest retreat in their history but they counterattacked comrades and drove us back across the yalu their industrial capacity is he thought for a moment something which has to be seen to be believed they had this capacity in the vietnam war general and they were driven out the american public was not with them then it was the political officers turn to be skeptical you think it is with them in this war general the un lackeys are with them wang replied perhaps the political officer said but that can evaporate overnight is the american public with them general wang conceded the possibility that the american peoples support might be only transitory at best that it might vanish overnight if he could inflict unacceptable casualties on the americans kill as many of them as possible in the shortest time that was an aim both political officers and both generals could agree on wang was heartened by this thought the fact that while the pla had sustained casualties in the three weeks of the war with vietnam the american public would simply not tolerate such losses finally in the matter of numbers china would always win every day in china another sixty thousand babies are born chapter thirtyseven pulling back from where the blue on blue had occurred dlupos sevenman point squad the first rifle platoon hq and three other platoons behind them including martinezs special forces group and the retreating troops of general vinh ran into some isolated sniping but managed to establish a halfmoonshaped defense perimeter it was about three hundred yards in diameter its edge just beyond a vshaped gully formed by a creek bed which the pla would have to cross before climbing fifteen feet at a fortyfivedegree incline if they were to attack the allied force behind the halfmoonshaped perimeter there were the burial mounds of a deserted village the villagers terrified of the pla had left heading south for phu lang thuong well before the retreating advance patrol of the emref and vinhs troops had arrived on the lip of the gully emrefs special forces had planted antipersonnel pucksized disk mines using kbar knives theyd gently lifted patches of grass not cutting out the patches but lifting them up carefully from one side as one would gently prise up a scab then scratching out a twoinch hole beneath the grassy trapdoor placing the disk mines and covering them with the patch farther back from the gullys lip members of the two rifle platoons placed claymores just as cautiously laying the trip wire johnny dlupo ordered some claymores on the flanks and in the rear you think theyre gonna get behind us dave rhin asked what dyou think man martinez from the special forces platoon replied rhin was on the field phone to hq platoon reporting that everything was set up and confirming that in their capacity as the advance patrol for the emref they were now in contact with vinhs forces who had joined the defensive line above the southern side of the gully after further consultation with vinhs englishspeaking operator the hq squad ordered the flank mines to be dug up lest either of vinhs flanks gave way under a pla attack and were forced into the american perimeter instead the mines were to be placed on the vietnamese flanks several hundred yards away from both emref flanks shit one of dlupos sevenman squad complained nothing i like better man than to dig up mines we just laid right dlupo agreed some fucker oughta thought of this fore we started laying the fucking things stop your whinin man rhin advised go take the fuckers to the vietnamese flanks theyll love yer for there was a high whistling sound followed by the crash of an explosion then another and another men screaming scrambling for cover as more explosions of red earth and undergrowth vomited skyward the soil fell like rain for several seconds after the first mortar salvo the smell of cordite and freshly uprooted vegetation pungent in the hostile air some of the emrefs who had been digging slit trenches lay unmoving dead now one beheaded another sitting quite still the victim of the tremendous force of the concussion and perhaps shrapnel as well dlupo dived behind one of the loamy burial mounds an mm chinese mortar round landing close to the lip of the gully sending shrubs and sticks into the air immediately he moved to a mound in front of him that had been hit dead center dlupo noting that there was an advancing pattern of small mortarmade craters in front of him he now dived into a burial mound the peak of its cone blown off the incoming round hed just fled landing ten yards behind him to his amazement as he came up for air he noticed his arm covered in blood he had no recollection of being hit despite the explosions of incoming and the steady bomp bomp bomp of outgoing mm rounds from the special forces platoon dlupo pulled his bleeding arm quickly from the protective burial mound he was staring at a completely emaciated skull a sandywhite loam spilling over it like sand in an hourglass the skulls teeth red where dlupos arm had scraped them as hed dived for cover as suddenly as it started the heavy mortar barrage ceased only to be replaced by the tearing tarpaper sound of light and medium machine guns using not only the heavier mm ammunition of the old type assault weapon but also that of the newer mm cq automatic rifle following the blare of a chinese bugle someone on the west usvietnamese side of the gully shouted theyre coming rhin cussed like the trooper he was disgustedly releasing his radio pack which was now so much junk the only thing intact being the handpiece which he now tossed away through the undergrowth they could see chinese regulars whose pisspot helmets were covered in camouflage netting branches of leaves draped from them and whose blackgreenbrown combat uniforms were so difficult to see against the background of the gullys bushlipped opposite bank even knowing that his platoon was cut off from hq theyd have to use runners if necessary rhin was impressed by the chinese assault no sooner had half of them fifty or so been chopped down by the american and vietnamese fire than the remaining fifty having rushed across the shallow streambed were out of sight now at the base of the fortyfivedegreeangle dirt cliff the ochercolored dirt cascaded down like a waterfall as the chinese without stopping immediately began scaling the steep incline of loose soil by running up as far as they could go with supporting machinegun fire from the bank behind them from which theyd descended at the apogee of their climb unable to make it alone up an almost vertical dirt face of ten to twelve feet they took hold of long armthick pieces of bamboo stilts shoved up to them as an assist from the men below up and down the creek a hundred yards in either direction more and more chinese began scaling the cliff those first up to the edge were machinegunned immediately and fell down amid their comrades at the base of the cliff but without a pause others took their place on the cliff and held ground helped by a rain of stick grenades being flung up and over the cliffs edge lobbed amid the forward american and vietnamese un troops the explosions and concussions of earlier mortars had set off many of the antipersonnel mines one chinese at the middle of a tenmanline charge tripped a claymore and all ten were killed either outright or fatally felled by the ball bearings that had exploded toward them in a steel curtain at supersonic speed but the chinese kept coming and dying dlupo and martinezs special forces knew that unless the chinese resupply of troops could be cut numbers alone would soon overwhelm them some of the usvun machine guns were so hot rounds were cooking off dlupo and special forces platoon were firing flares down into the gully knowing that some of the units behind them must have gotten through to usvietnamun troops headquarters at kep or phu lang thuong and they hoped that despite the poor visibility in the low ceiling of stratus tacair would be on the way dlupo by prior agreement with tacairs forward air controller had an understanding that should radio contact be lost the enemy position would be indicated by a whiteredwhite flare combination early in the vietnam war such arrangements were often made on the spot via radio contact between pilots and the men in trouble on the ground but charlie as the enemy was then known had often listened in on the us radio messages with englishspeaking radio interpreters and would quickly fire the flare sequence onto american and arvn positions creating a blue on blue now dlupos forward squad fired a whiteredwhite sequence into the gullys eastern sector to the right of them tacair if it was on its way should make visible contact in plus or minus two minutes coming in beneath the blankets of the gray stratus down in the gully the chinese immediately began a barrage of smallarms fire shredding the flares chutes so they fell faster giving the chinese more time to pick up the unburned section of the smoke flares and having cut their chute straps lob them into the brush beyond the western side of the gully nothing like this had happened in iraq where not surprisingly there was no bush some of the chinese already ensconced in dugouts along the lip kept up a sustained fire into the american positions making it impossible for the americans to rush forward and secure the flares now burning furiously supposedly marking the enemy position to be bombed as a result two intruders sent in from the enterprise dropped their ordnance including two freefall pods of napalmjellied gasoline within fortythree seconds killing sixteen americans in the emrefs advance recon force nine of them were burned to death running torches of fire in the brush setting it afire before they collapsed or throwing themselves onto the earth in futile attempts to smother the fire with soil friends used their cupped hands digging with spades whatever to save two men who were so horribly burned they now wished they were dead at least three of the stricken men had made a rush toward the gully to try to extinguish themselves in the water holes of the gully bed they were cut to pieces by chinese smallarms fire before they got beyond the lip falling rolling down the steep red dirt slope chinese troops immediately stripping them of what weapons they could some of the americans flesh sticking to their ms like melted cheese the remainder of the usvun were also hit by napalm and seconds after the terrible beauty of an enormous orange flame rolling through a backdrop of green fields and brush five vietnamese had been burned black with five un soldiers including two from the british sas contingent only their badges who dares wins were recognizable after their own ammunition packs exploded by now the forward air controller had seen the chinese rush the gully realized about the flare ballsup and redirected the intruders this cleared the gully nicely an even more devastating attack than upon the usvun line since the sharpangled sides of the gully made it a natural conduit for the flame that raced like a flood of molten hot steel from a furnace down the gully floor over two hundred chinese assault infantry were incinerated and the presence of the american planes ready to bomb again had dissuaded the pla from any further rushes the air filled with a stench of burned chicken to further dissuade the pla the planes on another run dropped napalm pods a hundred yards in from the gully on the pla side the screams of those caught in the swath of burning gasoline attested to the pilots having guessed right that the next wave of pla assault troops had been assembling not far from the gullys edge the hesitation this caused the chinese along with the fact that much of the underbrush had been set aflame thus denying troops cover close to the gully saved the usvun force which had pulled back after several units found themselves badly mauled and their positions untenable though in numbers lost the chinese had suffered considerably more than the usvun for douglas freeman the retreat was a decision he abhorred his intuitive reaction was to hold ground and take the gully while tacair kept the chinese pinned down with napalm and rocket fire but he was too good a soldier to pretend he could hold the gully against the pla if he had no backup andor no support from the flanks hed trusted the vietnamese to fight if they were ordered by general vinh to hold but it was systematically built into the communist cadre as it had been in the pla by mao zedong in his little red book to attack only when one had overwhelming strength to withdraw when the odds of winning dropped you struck where you thought the enemy was weakest but withdrew once the maximum amount of damage had been achieved and before the enemy could rally in force against you though he knew this tactic well enough freeman hoped that vinhs troops would stay and assist his own men in securing and holding the gully while more usvun troops could be brought up on the lang rolang son road vinh disagreed no he explained through the interpreter the chinese main force would come south down the lang sonlang ro road so it would be unwise to withdraw usvun troops from there to come here it is vital he continued for the chinese to take the road if they wish to move supplies quickly to feed the head of their snake major cline asked whether he might not have a word with general freeman what is it major sir with all due respect well get nowhere if you argue with vinh particularly in front of his political commissars hell lose face and then he wont agree to anything of course freeman said nodding beaming at vinh and his advisers i have full confidence in the fighting ability of the republic of vietnams armies he deliberately left out the socialist before republic theyve proved themselves in battle against us many times he paused then smiled politely all i want to be sure of is that if we commit ourselves to an overall strategy we stick with it till we have a touchdown vinh and the others were unsure about this term and the translator had to spend some time imitating the huddle et cetera ah vinh finally said nodding and smiling football right freeman said no good agreeing in the huddle then having some joker suddenly decide its not for him ruin the whole goddamn play right there was a huddle of vietnamese advisers while freeman explained softly to cline point is weve got to have the will to stand ground and use it as a launch pad from which to direct our heavy stuff arty and tacair for that i need those around me to hold the goddamn perimeter and not suddenly decide to retreat cause were taking heavy fire i meant what i said major these vietnamese troops are firstrate but this constant hitandrun business could suddenly leave me with a flank in name only we agree general vinh said in heavily accented english but here the interpreter took over the general he told freeman agrees but wishes to point out that what the americans might think is a good strategic move the vietnamese might see as a simple tactical move in a local battle and therefore wish to break off if casualties are too high freeman could have spit wood chips please tell the general that he and i must first agree on the overall strategic plan my strategy is simply this to pulverize the border area around lang son and dong dang by bombing and then to roll forward along the road with arty until we clear the area once and for all and reestablish the correct political line between the two countries christ freeman said in an aside to cline im sounding like one of their damn commissars the interpreter begged the generals pardon but what was the meaning of this word arty artillery freeman replied pound the area flat reestablish a cordon sanitaire hopefully secure a dmz vinh nodded agreement but asked whether the other usvun forces would agree to it or not given what in time would have to be their countries postwar relationships with china freeman was getting annoyed with what he perceived to be the vietnamese preoccupation with minor players and he told the translator straight you tell general vinh that there are really only three players on this field his forces mine and the pla you have no respect for your allies vinh asked i have respect freeman replied honestly but i wont always have time to consult with my south korean allies or the japanese for example i know what i can expect from the british and australian troops besides their numbers arent high and theyre integrated with my command vinh understood freemans underlying concern and brought the conversation to an end by saying i am not against nonconsensual decisions or massed fixed battles if they strategically make sense freeman smiled you mean the battle for khe sanh the americans had dug in in and around the airstrip ringed as it was by vietnamese artillery and aided and abetted by us airpower had won by breaking the siege no vinh said without a smile i meant dien bien phu vinh extended his hand and freeman a sardonic look on his face as if to say you old fox took it in the spirit it was offered vinh bowed and said we will try to agree in the huddle a consensus yes right freeman said thinking that vinh would make a hell of an adversary press aide boyd looked puzzled at major cline boyd had noticed that this general agreement to work together on one plan rather than two had somehow been sealed by the mention of this dien bien phu whos this phu anyway boyd asked cline you dork cline said goodnaturedly dont you know any history its a placea valley bout miles west of us near the border of laos during the frenchindochina war in fiftyfour french were always bitching about the viet minhs hitandrun tactics never being able to fight a oneplace pitched battle with them well the viet minh decided on just such a battle and general giap ringed twelve french battalions with more than thirty of his own viet minh had brought in artillery and im talking mm and triple a a lot of it piece by piece on their backs through the jungle french commander called for reinforcements and six battalions of paratroops were flown in the french were dug in and the viet minh dug miles of tunnels around the french firebase often they came right up to the wire fired a burst then disappeared before the french could get a bead on them french were finally overrun over twelve thousand frenchmen were killed or taken pow absolute disaster put an end to all the crap about the vietnamese not being able to win a setpiece battle whatd it cost the vietnamese boyd asked well over twenty thousand some on both sides were never found blown to bits by the artillery cline paused glanced at vinh and freeman and explained to boyd thats why old vinh mentioned dien bien phu he was telling freeman that he can play it either way hitandrun or dig in hes flexible well boyd said adopting an air of authority beyond his years theyd better agree on something pretty soon all weve been doing so far is falling back chapter thirtyeight it was difficult for reporter marte price to know who was more surprised by the chinese breakthrough south of lang son general vinh or freeman both commanders were well practiced in their ability to keep their innermost thoughts to themselves and while freeman was less inhibited about acknowledging defeat to a press conference than was the vietnamese general he like vinh was not about to cause a plummeting morale in the usled un forces vinh a veteran of the chinese vietnam border clash in february of during which the pla suffered more than casualties in just three weeks of fighting did say however that the pla advance was somewhat unexpected by hanoi given what he described as the corruption beyond that he had nothing to say to either marte price the cnn reporter or to any of the other news correspondents who under pressure from the un to allow a larger press pool were now flocking into hanoi given general vinhs reluctance to elaborate any further several reporters turned to freeman to explain the vietnamese generals terse charge of corruption several years ago in to be exact freeman answered the republic of vietnam defeated the pla in a border war the chinese premier and thus the commander in chief of the pla which includes by the way the chinese navy and air force told the pla that it had better get leaner and meaner he reduced the force size by almost a million that still left him with plenty and he told the pla chiefs of staff that if they wanted to upgrade their capability theyd have to find the extra money themselves you mean an obviously surprised british reporter asked that the chinese generals were told to go into business thats exactly what i mean freeman answered its long been practice for many of the pla armies to grow most of their food but now they were being told to get busy making whatever would bring in hard cash freeman paused and it wasnt only growing and selling excess vegetables on the open market that they got involved in freeman had anticipated a knowing chuckle or at least a nod from some of the more senior correspondents but none came and he realized from the frantic scribbling in his audience that for many in the press pool this background information he was giving was something new for a fleeting second or two freeman had an uncharacteristic moment of anxiety as he wondered whether he was revealing information hed gotten from classified intelligence sources it was a professional hazard then just as quickly he realized that the information he was giving out was the result of his own homework and that he wasnt revealing anything the pentagon had on its secret list problem was he continued that many of the pla armies particularly those who with the governments blessing got involved with the making and selling of arms to make money also got involved with a lot of kickbacks and the like from privates who were making ten times as much money as an ordinary privates pay to officers who were getting brown envelopes under the table from middlemen in the arms sale business there was one hell of a lot of corruption the cnn reporter had his hand up general you mean that because of this socalled corruption you underestimated the plas ability in this war thought theyd gone soft soft freemans tone could barely conceal his anger this son of a bitch was trying to ambush him if he said no he hadnt thought the pla had gone soft his spiel about corruption wouldnt be believed but if he said yes the pla had gone soft then the next question from the monkey gallery would be well if the pla has lost its combat readiness general what are your troops doing retreating south from lang son i never said the pla was soft nor did general vinh why the plas one of the toughest outfits in the world their training is hard their morale is high and they keep coming at you ask anybody who fought in korea no theyre sure as hell not soft what i think my distinguished colleague had in mind in referring to corruption was that the pla soldier has been corrupted politically by a lot of propaganda about his neighbors to the south that their political leadership is corrupt freeman pulled out his retractable pensized pointer and moved it in a huge semicircle starting from the spratly islands in the south china sea going west north up to russia and then east to the siberian republic in the spratlys vietnam burma india tibet russia all the way to he almost said black dragon river the northern border between siberia and china but black dragon was the chinese name and instead he used the siberian name all the way to the amur river and to vladivostok the chinese have been fighting neighbors for years now weve had enough and we wont put up with it anymore whos we general the cnn reporter asked in his followup question we are the united nations cunning bastard freeman thought but at least hed got them off their damn fixation with vinhs remark about corruption press officer boyd and major cline were likewise impressed and after the press conference congratulated the general on his adroit handling of what could have been a loss of face for vinh general sir boyd inquired why did the chinese manage to push us back down the lang son road freeman telescoped the long pointer back into its pens sheath simultaneously looking about him to make sure no reporters were within hearing range because captain he answered we got the shit kicked out of us because general vinhs boys tough as they are like our boys havent been in a major battle for years for them its been since not counting the naval battle they had over one of the spratlys in eightyeight and again in ninetytwo meanwhile the chinese have been keeping in practice in tibet and all their other border disputes but dont worry second armyll be up to combat strength very soon and then my boysll kick those chinese asses back across the border beyond dong dang where they belong one of the reporters a frenchman pierre lasalle now well back in the room couldnt suppress a smile for a few american dollars in manila on a stopover en route to hanoi hed bought a pickup mike one of those that advertisers boast can capture a whisper from thirty feet away and he had freemans answer to boyd on tape the frenchman who had always resented american presence in indochina after the french had lost it all at dien bien phu in didnt want a french paper to have the tape they could easily trace it back to him no he thought the north american market would be best the only problem for lasalle was how long he should wait it would be nice to get ahold of that photo the american woman price was said to have taken of freeman no one could tell him exactly what the photo was but it was rumored to be pretty embarrassing for the american general the next explosion that mellin murphy and the other prisoners heard on the island was followed at dawn by the agonized howl of a mobile claw crane its tracks in several inches of water its long neck stretched out beyond the edge of the partially submerged reef its claw brought up huge lumps of coral that had been blasted out by underwater dynamite charges then swung inland and deposited the coral and sea bottom mud on a pile on part of the reef that was now submerged beneath a few inches of water in the high tide dozens of variegated fish grouper and red snapper among them some stunned some dead a few sharks and hawksbill turtles as well lay floating on the seas surface several pla soldiers who apart from thongs on their feet were stripped naked despite the presence of three women among the thirty pows were wading out to gather up the fish one soldier carrying an ak over his head to make sure of the sharks quietly mellin his temples still pounding from the headache hed suffered as a result of a pla guard hitting him with the rifle butt the day before nudged the australian see all the heaps of coral theyve dredged up murphy was looking to the west no mellin told him other way east of us when murphy saw them he could also see a line of what he thought might be prisoners all clad in peasantstyle black pajamas passing baskets of coral from one of the heaps along the line several of the black pajamas emptying the broken coral on a part of the reef covered in a few inches of water the mud or rather sea bottom ooze was being carted away by another line of black pajamas to one main heap a few hundred yards inland amid the scrubby and stunted bushes how big dyou reckon mellin asked the island mike murphy shrugged and a guard saw it bout half a mile long maybe less five hundred yards wide up shut shouted the soldier murphy saluted the guard sorry shithead jesus mellin murmured looking away from the guards for chrissake shut up mike but upshut seemed impressed by murphys elaborate show of obedience and the snappy salute now mellin could see several pairs of the black pajama figures leaning straining forward like beasts of burden pulling cement rollers behind them over the coral that had been spread out over the tidal pools upshut and his cohort were looking away from mellin murphy and the dozen or so other prisoners in their charge when mellin heard a soft and distinctly british womans voice one of the other rig prisoners whispering to them to be careful that upshut understood more english than the american or australian realized mellin checked out the guards they were talking to one another at about a hundred decibels pointing at the fish dinner provided by the latest explosion it was the englishwoman doing the translating you know a lot of chinese mellin asked the woman i speak mandarin a little cantonese she said i was radio operator on chical mellin nodded as far as he could remember chical was a rig or at least what had been a rig off livock reef about a hundred miles northeast of the island they were now on one of the more than island reefs cays and shoals that made up the spratly or as the chinese called them the nanshan island group whats your name murphy asked in a low tone looking not at her but rather at the two guards shed warned them about fortescue she answered shirley fortescue well shirl murphy responded thanks for the tip danny mellin could see the woman in her midthirties didnt like the australians easy familiarity with her name shirley she corrected murphy righto luv murphy said smiling no problem mellin watched the australian eyeing her more closely now taking note of an hourglass figure which even the drab black pow pajamas couldnt hide things could be worse he told danny with a wink there was a growling sound nearby one of the other prisoners stomachs complaining of hunger hey shirl murphy whispered how bout using a bit of the old mandarin and asking upshut when we get a feed were all bloody starving no danny said quickly dont let them know weve got someone who can understand their lingo we might find out what upshut swung about who talks he shouted no one said anything and for a moment there was silence between the sounds of the dredge claw bringing up more dislodged coral water and kelp streaming from it and dumping it one of the prisoners a vietnamese got up and holding his hand up like a child in class asked in what shirley fortescue could tell was a border dialect of cantonese the chinese spoken in the south when they would be getting some food and drink upshuts cohort gave a long loud answer after which the vietnamese who had asked the question sat down desultorily shrugging his shoulders whatd he say murphy asked i think shirley fortescue said softly that the guard said well get some water but no food until we finish our work work murphy said what fucking work ah sorry shirl but im not working for these assholes upshut was coming straight at him clicking the foldout butt of the kalashnikov to use the ak as a club sorry murphy said quickly raising his hands sorry the australians raised arms stopped upshut who made a show of folding the butt shortening the weapon and grunting pleased by the australians surrender nodding his head as if to say thats better now you know whos boss chapter thirtynine generals wei and wang were pleased by their armies southward offensive but were by no means complacent the vietnamese army had given them a bloody nose in no matter what beijing told the chinese people and neither general wanted a repeat of that performance when the supply line had simply not been able to keep up with their own advance units so entire battalions went without water for several days and were as much in danger from dehydration as from the vietnamese another factor that the pla generals had to take into consideration was that what had begun with a fourmilewide front spearheaded by the fourth division of the nanning army had now spread out to a tenmile front the two pla generals were concerned that if vinhs vietnamese divisions managed to launch a concerted counterattack they would be able to punch a gap in the pla line and do a breaststroke that is the vietnamese spearhead would first punch a hole in the pla front then divide into two arms both swinging back southward like the arms of a swimmer doing the breaststroke first cutting off elements of the plas fourth division then encircling segments of the advance chinese troops in a scissors handle maneuver they would isolate the pla troops for piecemeal destruction and rush more vietnamese north from the hanoi military region despite this risk elements of weis army heading south on the eastern flank of the tenmile front knew they must push forward down the valley beyond lang ro to capture andor render the airstrip at kep inoperable then swing eastward to haiphong the port for hanoi in the red river delta but here lay another possible bone of contention between the plas military commander and their political officers generals wei and wang had their political officers equal in rank to the generals and both political and military officers had to come to an agreement about strategy right down to the tactical level before the troops could be given specific orders the vietnamese army under vinh as freeman had discovered was run in much the same way at first sight westerners were unimpressed by the system so cumbersome so different from their own or was it freeman asked his staff as they prepared the plans for the deployment of second army whose supplies were now being unloaded at haiphong freeman to the consternation of his aide major cline answered his own question about the similarity of the pla command structure and that of the west typically he overstated the position by pointing out how general later president eisenhower had ordered general george patton to halt what freeman called pattons magnificent end run into eastern europe in and how dee had not wanted the americans british and canadians to beat the russians to berlin so that the goddamned russians noses wouldnt be out of joint that gentlemen freeman said was nothing less than a political decision by ike another thing it was harry truman who tied doug macarthurs hands behind his back when the general wanted to cross the yalu in korea and hit the red bases inside china another political decision dont look so stunned gentlemen i just want you to know that we have our own commissars in the west we just put em in the state department and call em experts cline and boyd had been equally startled by the generals analogy jesus cline told boyd if a reporter ever heard him say that the shitd really hit the fan it hit the fan anyway but for a different reason someone somehow had gotten hold of what the general had said to cline and boyd immediately after the press conference a highly profitable and thoroughly disreputable tabloid in the united states used its morning edition to scream via a fourinch block headline in capital letters usvun force in disarray we got the st kicked out of usgen freeman soon the generals remark had been carried via cable network news to every country in the world antiamerican sentiment was buoyed by the us embarrassment which caused red faces from the pentagon to the white house whose spokespersons were pressed by a media frenzy to explain why the advance elements of the over two and a half thousand usled un emergency response team had bungled their first engagement in vietnam were they exhibiting the same deficiencies that had afflicted an earlier generation of americans in vietnam it was like a spark to a powder keg of emotion as american veterans of vietnam and others from as far away as the korean and australian contingents that had fought alongside the americans in vietnam rallied to the defense of their younger compatriots most of whom outside freemans emergency response team had just arrived in vietnam and had not yet engaged the great wall of iron alias the pla freeman was furious with both boyd and cline reminding them that they were the only ones to whom he had made the remark that was now drawing fire from every son of a bitch liberal in the country both men assured the general theyd had nothing to do with it hadnt said a word cline was brave enough to draw the generals attention to the unpalatable fact that the cries back home for firing the general were not confined to every son of a bitch liberal but in many instances were coming from the right wing because of his admission that the usled force had met with failure the first time at bat and that he had already before this remark personally taken responsibility for the action in which americans were killed by socalled friendly fire also several large evangelical groups loudly objected to the generals use of scatological references in his speeches within twenty minutes of the political storm breaking about him on cnn and the us networks and their affiliates around the world a phone call came into the unemref hq now at phu lang thuong twentyeight miles north of hanoi on the hanoilang son road captain boyds face looked pale as he said yes sir yes sir mr president and handed the receiver to freeman general mr president you know why im calling i cant have my military commander making public comments of this kind now i dont want to tell you how to do your job in the field but i must remind you that i cant very well support you being c in c of the usvun forces when you go around albeit unintentionally undermining the american publics confidence in the american army nothing had hurt freeman in years as much as the presidents last comment mr president i apologize id never willingly badmouth my men thats not what i meant sir i was merely giving an offthecuff assessment a military mans assessment of the chinese breakthrough at lang son smatter of fact i was referring to general vinhs forces more than i was ours why our men havent really closed with the enemy to any freeman stopped what was it the french said lui qui sexcuse saccuse he that excuses himself accuses himself im sorry mr president well im going to accept that general but i have to tell you that im under one hell of a lot of pressure here to fire you there was silence i wouldnt want to do that general but i might have to you must understand my position i do sir the president tried to end it on a note of levity trouble is general youre one heck of a good field commander but i have people here from defense as well as state telling me youre another georgie patton just great when it comes to getting the job done in the field but youre a bit ah bullish in a china shop when it comes to political nuances am i being fair im bullish on america mr president it wasnt meant to be a joke but the president liked it anyway the next morning under increasing political pressure the president fired freeman from his position as c in c vietnam usvun forces relegating him to command us second army on the ground but putting the un task force under the command of us general dean jorgensen en route from washington to hanoi by god freeman said in conference with general vinh when he received the news theyre sending me a commissar general vinh with barely any emotion said welcome to the club major robert cline knew if he didnt say what was on his mind to douglas freeman right now hed never have the guts to say it again the major begged general vinhs pardon and asked freeman if he could speak to him privately for a moment freeman frowning which almost destroyed clines resolution excused himself from vinh and his party yes what is it bob sir can i be utterly frank with you yes cline inhaled deeply and said general youve got to be more i dont know politically sensitive politically correct you mean freeman responded glowering at the major the general telling cline that goddamn it he had been the first us general in history to use women as chopper pilots no sir i dont mean politically correct i mean politically sensitive general that crack you just made about washington sending you a commissar and yesterday your remarks to the staff about there being commissars in the state department and we dont know how that remark you made to boyd about the chinese kicking the shit out of us first time to bat got out but if your comments about commissars in the state department leaked to the press cline paused for breath his shoulders tight with tension youd be ruined sir theyd fire you as field commander as well freeman was still glowering his cheek muscles bunched up his jaw set in a look of ferocious determination are you finished major yes sir for what seemed like an eternity to cline the general stood there in the tent freemans head was nodding the rest of him immobile all right bob youve made your point oh hell i agree im not politicallysensitivethat the word you used yes sir well youre right damn it ill try to be more he exhaled heavily sensitive cline smiled with relief boyd entered the hq clutching a sheaf of faxes freeman turned to him whatve you got there captain more bad news and some good news boyd replied give me the bad first beijing radio is using your ah demot ah demotion yes sir theyre using it as a sign that americans will fail against the pla the same as we did in vietnam earlier in the vietnam war boyd hesitated go on freeman ordered sir they said well be crushed like beetles did they freeman said raising an eyebrow yes sir well freeman said turning to cline theyre being very insensitive about beetles major you think we should make a protest on behalf of the beetles of the world cline shrugged and smiled theyve probably got a beetle lobby on capitol hill general by god freeman riposted youre probably right he turned to boyd so what else are they going to do to us american beetles i dont know general freeman pointed at the pile of faxes boyd was holding well what else do you have for me son messages sir from various veterans associations all around the country basically theyre all saying he looked down at one it says tell it like it is general give em hell huh freeman laughed who the pla or wash the word died on his lips his right hand giving the stop signal he smiled at cline then turned to boyd thank them on my behalf captain much appreciated yes sir freeman glanced over at cline is this century crazy or what ive just been demoted for being politically insensitive for telling the truth and now vietnam vets from our most unpopular war in history are telling me to hang tough and help the vietnamese its the new world order general huh in some ways i prefer the old least you knew what was what freeman made his way back to the operations table where vinhs staff were obviously impressed with the d computer graphics of the terrain up north from the red river valley and the high country about lang son showing the last known disposition of vinhs army but freeman observed the graphics with a jaded edge he knew how pretty it all looked but he also knew that the computers were only as good as the information going into them and right now the information had to be highly suspect as vinhs forces and the advance elements of the usled un force were fighting desperately to form a defensive line to somehow stop or at the very least slow down the plas advance and tactical air support from the carrier group was not yet possible because of heavy overcast curdling in from the tonkin gulf even if the weather changed immediately tac support would have to be guided in to bomb pinpoint positions at night via infrared sighting and at the moment all vinh and freeman knew was that their respective forces were in retreat until the situation stabilized his airborne infantry and artillery now being deployed from haiphong to hanoi couldnt be used effectively most of freemans staff including major cline and captain boyd were amazed by the generals stoicism in view of what they like many others saw as a humiliating demotion overall command being given to jorgensen but if freeman appeared sanguine about his fate it was in large part because he believed in destiny and knew that now he would be freer to do what he knew he was best at fighting directing and leading his men at the front for douglas freeman his demotion was to be seized upon as opportunity and he thanked god for it chapter forty ello it was said with a distinct french accent followed by an offer of french champagne and two tulipshaped glasses marte price had just finished using a gravity shower that a helpful marine had erected outside her tent and she was now drying off as the french reporter lasalle poked his head farther into her tent anyone ome startled not yet having dried herself marte stood draped in army khaki towels what do you want some company yes no get out lasalle gave a shrug worthy of maurice chevalier but i cannot the champagne she is opened how do you say ah yes opened for business well im not marte retorted the frenchman was handsome no question about that the archetype of the kind that women fell for tall lean very physical in his movements but with eyes sensitive to the slightest nuance and he could see that she had seen the outline of his erection as he gazed at her sleek long thighs before they got lost in towels very well he said accommodatingly i will leave the champagne for you and no offense okay he reminded her of hawkeye in the mash tv show look she said im sorry i didnt mean to be rude maybe another time it struck her that lasalle could give her some general background for her stories after all it had been french indochina till lasalle shrugged smiling ow about in ten minutes the champagne will ave lost some of its bubbles perhaps but all right she said but lets keep it strictly business lasalle spread his hands as if asking what other possible motive he could be thinking of certainement business sure but he wagged a finger at her no monkey business i promise oui oui she responded adopting his friendly tone as he left she was still thinking about what shed thought was his erection or was it simply the way the crotch of his pants had bunched up it was something that even as a young girl used to fascinate her to think that women had the power to make it stand up like that she toweled herself vigorously throwing her hair back in abandon and feeling herself getting moist when pierre lasalle returned she was much more hospitable and her khaki uniform meant to hide any feminine aspects had failed miserably by making the size of her bust a tantalizing guessing game the champagne was poured the stream of tiny bubbles ascending like chains of golden pearls winking at the brim cheers she said raising the glass to peace he responded neither of them meaning it and each knowing the other had said it merely as a social nicety they liked war not being in it but watching it being close to it being in less danger than the frontline fighter but close enough to smell it to be scared and exhilarated by the rumble of the heavy guns by the threat of it the way it had of putting everything else into perspective of showing just how thin the thread of life could be of how you might as well enjoy yourself wherever and whenever you could that was a good piece you did lasalle said complimenting her which piece was that had he read any or was this just bullshit too the one about the difficulties of commanding a un force its hard to do i know no pretty pictures and the editor always want to show the viewers eh not tell them explanation is much arder isnt that the truth marte said appreciatively she was weighing it up considering the possibilities no way was she going to let him in her even with a condom hed have one of course with his looks he probably ordered them by the gross but even a rubber which most men hated anyway wasnt any guarantee against catching something like aids hepatitis b syphilis gonorrhea or any of a legion of subtropical and tropical sexually transmitted diseases what do you think of freemans demotion lasalle asked marte took another sip i think it was a blessing in disguise for the un oh you think this jorgensen will be much better then marte shrugged she wasnt going to let the frenchman slobber all over her either you could catch stuff that way too i think she said it doesnt matter a shit whether jorgensen is here or not hell be washingtons man a figurehead press conferences freemanll do the actual work only now hell be able to do it without washington and hanoi breathing down his neck now freeman she thought was a man you could get laid with and not worry she didnt know why but she intuitively felt hed be safe with young pierre here however what was the expression the emref boys on the plane had used dipping your wick well young or maybe not so young he had probably dipped his at every stopover between here and paree he was filling up her glass again and saying something now about some sensational photograph hed heard shed taken of what she wanted to know figuring that as shed been drinking her champagne hed been only sipping his she could read him like a book didnt want to get too pissed then the old wiener would just lie there some picture of freeman i heard about somewhere near the lang son road during the the frenchman sneered the socalled friendly fire incident huh she said affecting puzzlement i took some shots of him giving orders that kind of stuff he lifted the bottle again uhuh she said shaking her head youll get me drunk not at all he said pouring more champagne anyway so he went on as if that piece of business was over you do all your own developing no she answered just as easily i send all my film to hanoi kodak that way anyone who wants to see what ive taken can have a peek you know sort of supermarket take what you like pierre lasalle laughed was it a response to a joke or the truth you want to embarrass freeman that it oh he said with a gallic shrug dont be silly its nothing personal youre a good journalist you know ow it is we get what we can this time she put her hand over the tulip glass ah he said you think im up to no good yes yes suddenly his whole tone comportment changed i want you marte that is what i want so why didnt you say so he moved closer to her we french are more subtle than that so i noticed she said when you first came in the tent looked like you had a bazooka in your pants marte he sat up genuinely shocked well didnt you or did you just want to dance no i mean yes i was aroused there was a pause as she let her hand trail along his thigh so was i she said oh marte he had his hand under her shirt exploring gently squeezing her breasts oh marte you cant go in me she said i have a con doesnt matter ill let you lie on me if you like but no all right all right he murmured almost incoherently unzipping her slacks pulling them down mon dieu she was wearing skintight scarlet lace panties mon dieu still gazing at the panties he took off her bra as they began to move together his weight between her legs his elbows propped to keep his weight moving on her there and nowhere else she could feel him sliding against her with more and more ease she joined him in the rhythm of it there was an idiotic smile on lasalles face as if he was genuinely surprised enjoying it more than he thought possible soon her hair began to whip from side to side as the excitement in her mounted and he could feel her growing abandonment beneath him his fingers started to pull down her panties no she gasped no pushing his hand away all right all right he said quickly sensing mat if he tried the same move again shed stop all right he said oh marte he heard her whimper felt himself going and her back arching suddenly they climaxed together now as one now as two separate beings each enjoying the fishtail arching of their bodies each in its own orgasm my god he gasped that was wonderful i never believed his mouth was too dry to speak he watched her eyes closed her body still moving against him until finally she gasped utterly exhausted utterly spent her eyes closed in a sleep of reverie chapter fortyone in dalat ray baker had been awakened by yet another noise again outside his door he quietly got out of bed to check his feet crunching the dead cockroaches that had fallen victim to the protective line of boric acid hed put around the bed and opened his door a small fleeting shadow was going down the exit stairwell at the far end of the hall a huge gray rat one of the hundreds that staked out the moderate to lowincome hotels it wasnt till baker stepped back into the room that he saw the piece of paper some kind of note written on the back of a can label even those who could afford it couldnt easily get their hands on writing paper one of the casualties of the vietnam war and agent orange having created enormous deforestation of parts of the country the note said mia come market it told baker that the evervigilant dalat police force must still be at work regarding mias that someone dare contact him only in this way that despite all the officialese about more mutual understanding and more economic aid since the us had lifted the postwar blockade there was still reluctance among the lower regions of the communist bureaucracy to aid americans or at least a reluctance to be seen aiding americans seeking mias and those who some americans thought might still be pows hidden in the jungles of nam no one who wanted to help it seemed for a price of course would be seen lingering around hotels to make contact it had probably been considered a great risk by the note writer just to try to get the message to bakers room baker slapped himself on the forehead stupid he wasnt properly awake it wouldnt have been the man who made contact who left the note but a runner a kid one of those thousands left homeless by the war with those who had been their enemies and were now their allies baker collected his expired passport from the front desk and went out in search of a good coffee and pastry one of the better legacies of the french colonial era he found what he wanted at a sidewalk café he sat first enjoying his trai quit juice he had no intention of squandering the us taxpayers money but damned if he was going to hurry hed been chasing shadows for years and hadnt found one of the more than two thousand mias or pows at the same time because of his lack of success his search to find at least one mia or less likely a pow to justify all his efforts had now become an obsession he ate the pastry which was filled with fruit and lingered over the remains of his coffee watching the new vietnam roll by at a glance nothing much had changed the everpresent fish sauce smell more scooters more noise only now the sound instead of coming from jukeboxes came from a jungle of video games emitting horrible screams of victory or defeat so absorbed was he by the hustle and bustle of dalat that it took baker a couple of minutes to realize he was being watched intently by a boy of about twelve in dirty tshirt and ragged blue shorts who even at this age appeared to be addicted to betelnut now and then spitting out arcs of bloodred saliva on the sidewalk whether it was the good weather the pastry or the rich dark coffee he had lingered over baker was in no mood for a complicated day he made a writing gesture to the waiter and at the same time with a dollar note he signaled the boy to come over to his table you speak english he asked the boy sure who are you watching me for the boy either didnt understand or didnt want to answer instead he looked covertly at the dollar bill baker was holding like a lure who sent you a man really baker said listen boyo tell me or no money two dollars okay the boy interjected baker nodded a man in the the boy couldnt think of the word in english cho market baker said there are a thousand people in the market i want you to point him out to me okay the boy said holding out his hand khong baker replied no not until you show me who one dollar now the boy said spitting out another jet of saliva and betel juice his smile a brownish gash his teeth already stained by his addiction okay baker said and gave him a dollar for any vietnamese it was good money for a boy a small fortune as they walked past the red tulip restaurant toward the mai building baker wondered if they were being followed by either the police andor the person who had hired the boy who perhaps wanted to make sure that he baker wasnt being followed by someone else as baker followed the betelspitting boy toward the market he had no chance to double back or stop to see whether or not someone was following him just before they reached the market the boy glanced back at baker made eye contact spat and walked toward one of the stalls selling every kind of fruit from green dragon fruit lychee jujubes and chinese dates to water apple the boy leaned across the counter and said something to the woman serving the customer her hands full of cherries she was dumping on the scales she said something quickly to the boy and he made his way back to baker you go now the boy said ask her for chanhlemon you understand she will tell you she has none but to come back tomorrow she will have some other dollar what oh yeah here he gave the boy the dollar am i to come see her tomorrow baker asked the boy shrugged with an insolence that had broken out once hed secured the second dollar his shrug saying how the hell do i know you go see her he said spat once more perilously close to bakers shoe and melted into the crowd baker asked the old woman for a lemon she promptly gave him one and held out her hand for payment it had happened so fast so unexpectedly that he barely had time to think but he immediately looked about for the boy the woman repeated the price impatiently the boy was gone damn baker said counting out the money and giving it to the woman damn ive been had eh what he turned on the old woman realized he was childishly taking it out on her cam onthanking you he said and walked back to his hotel every youth he saw raising his ire chia khoa phong he all but shouted at the desk clerk who despite the americans bad temper took his time getting the room key and sliding it across to baker the room was a shambles every drawer of the small chest pulled out what few clothes he had strewn about the room white streaks of boric acid all over the floor the mattress upended and slashed open its stuffing oozing out also strewn about the floor was the distinctively sweet smell not at all stale of an american cigarette in itself signifying that whoever had hired the kid must not have been long gone had he or they left satisfied did they suspect him of having information on pows or mias or whatever it was that they could sell for a high price to more parents of an mia or were they looking for something else or was all this mayhem among the dead roaches and boric acid simply for effect a warning to quit his trip to the hamlets of lat village below lang bian mountain as he looked out the window that framed the warm gold of morning light baker felt clammy and cold lasalle none the worse from the champagne hed consumed wanted to make love again marte price didnt once a night she figured was quite sufficient for any nice girl besides no matter what all the sex manuals said the second time more often than not proved to be a huffing puffing affair more a measure of fitness than passion and plain wore you out but not in that wonderful satisfying spent way besides she was still languorous in a warm safe cave mood and wanted it to last and she told pierre to leave her alone she wanted to sleep the frenchman was happy to oblige and rolling away from her surveyed the tent with a more discerning eye namely to see where she might hide her most prized photos almost asleep himself lasalle had to concentrate hard to stay awake his eyes searching the small tent looking for something that would withstand the rigors of war his gaze settled on a gray metal box about a foot square and a foot high hed seen that kind of box before usually they were asbestoslinedand waterproof problem was there was no key in the lock the more he thought about it the more certain he became that the photos he wanted to see were in the gray box or did she play the fox and keep the photos in some very ordinary place her armyissue passport side pouch that he could see hanging from a suction hook on the tents center pole easing himself off the bed looking back to make sure she was still asleep he took down the pouch and quietly unzipped the rear passport section apart from the passport army press pass and a sheaf of two thousand dollars worth of american express travelers checks in hundreds and fifties there was nothing the second smaller section of the pouch contained chap stick lipstick a twopack container of tampons a card of midol capsules bandaids and assorted hairpins the front section which lasalle left till last it being no larger than a change purse contained a hodgepodge of american quarters and tight bundles of red tenthousanddong bills each bearing a flattering portrait of ho chi minh the man lasalle was reminded by the picture who had started life as a waiter in paris and ended up as the president of the republic then lasalle saw a small safetydeposittype key taped to the inside of the change pouch in his eagerness to undo the tape several quarters dropped out clanging against the tent pole merde he hissed as he heard her moan and roll over toward him he replaced the pouch pierre she called he was pulling on his pants oui her eyes looked over at him dreamily i she yawned and stretched i thought youd gone no chérie i fell asleep hmm she murmured happy that it had been good for both of them what time is it she yawned again eight oclock or twenty hundred hours if youre military christ she said flinging the sheet off what in lasalle began freemans giving a press conference in half an hour i know so so mon cher it takes us gals a little longer to get ready especially after being violated violated just a joke honey i have to be ready for hookup in fifteen minutes im doing a spot for cnn whats wrong with their reporter down with the runs too much tit what she was dashing into the shower stall i wish youd stop saying what every time i say something too much tit he still didnt get it or at least if he did he wasnt saying anything banh bao she called out pastry stuffed with veggies and meat looks like a boob nipple and all you must have had it yes there was a pause as if he was thinking about it probably he was trying the key in the gray box bien it fit and he dropped it in his pocket probably what she called out above the noise of the gravity rinse that came in a torrent over her body probably i have eaten it yes she was out of the shower and her nakedness aroused him again oh no you dont she said throwing his shirt at him his gallic shrug told her there would be another time probably she shrugged playfully in return maybe he forced a smile chapter fortytwo nuoc waterwas the first word some of the more than a hundred caucasian pows learned the water was tepid and tasted metallic but at least it was liquid and the pows on what they were by now grimly calling upshuts island drank it gratefully yet resentfully realizing as they did so that their dependence on him meant that upshuts power over them had been tightened another notch even murphy the outspoken and garrulous australian was wary of the pla guards displeasure though they were now a good fifty yards away and was wondering how he and his fellow prisoners could survive on the meager rations being handed out despite the ample supply of fish that was the result of the explosions in the coral reef the chinese were giving the prisoners only enough to sustain them and not bothering to cook the fish which they simply tossed among the pows as if amid a pack of dogs bastards murphy said but quietly enough that the guards couldnt hear him hope none of these are bloody stonefish he waited for a response but none of the other nineteen prisoners in his group said anything some frantically trying to figure out how best to deal with raw fish with your bare hands stonefishll kill you in less than five minutes only shirley fortescue balked at what lay in front of her dont worry murphy said none of these are stonefish why bring it up then she said tersely you enjoy frightening people dont get your knickers in a knot shirl just somethin to say yknow and ive told you before my names shirley not shirl piss on you lady hey mike danny mellin interjected ease up no problem dan just trying to pass the time well dont shirley said its going to be tough enough as it is we dont need your warped sense of humor on top of it listen up you two danny cut in weve got trouble enough without you two starting another war mike murphy was using a sharpedged shell to scale the rockfish wars already started murphy answered petulantly yeah danny said but were in the middle of nowhere were in the paracels shirley cut in far as i can tell somewhere near pottle or woody islands whoopee murphy said mike danny said put a lid on it what i was saying was that we have to start figuring a few things out because when theyre done building this airstrip what are they going to do with us what makes you so sure its an airstrip murphy asked tearing hungrily at a piece of fish well danny said its the wrong shape for a baseball diamond shirley fortescue laughed yeah well murphy said feeling foolish in light of mellins repartee why in hell would the chinese be blowing up a reef and rolling it flat when theres already an airstrip on woody island because shirley answered in as civil a tone as she could manage with the australian woody islands airstrip was wrecked by the vietnamese in the first few days of the war it was blown up and the island occupied by vinhs marines within a few hours of chical getting hit the rig you were on danny said yes we got the news on the distress channel from a few foreign rigs drilling offshore so now upshut island is to replace woody island danny said right ah rats murphy said his tone trying for a jauntiness that he knew the others were either too thirsty or too hungry to share your lot he told danny seventh fleet wont let em build an airstrip here middle of bloody nowhere or paracels whatever yanksll bomb the crap out of it neither shirley fortescue nor danny mellin said anything for a few moments the australian was indisputably brave as his helping danny earlier in their capture had demonstrated and he was clearly intelligent enough to have been working on one of the south china sea rigs before the war had started yet he was surprisingly naive politically as evident from his remarks about the seventh fleet bombing upshut island havent you noticed mr murphy shirley began how many americans british and australians have been brought to this island yeah miss fortescue i have so you dont see any reason for that the fact that there must be over a hundred of us here all right so theyre using us as bloody coolies murphy retorted wouldnt be the first time would it mike danny said calmly theyre using us as bloody hostages he paused as well as coolies the president isnt going to order the seventh fleet or any other fleet to bomb the crap out of this speck in the ocean not with so many american and british and murphy looked thunderstruck so danny tried to lighten it up they wont even bomb aussies murphy was still silent lookit danny continued even when we bombed the crap out of hanoi our guys never went near the hanoi hilton shirley fortescue looked nonplussed hanoi hilton danny explained to her was the pow jail in hanoi during nam oh bloody hell murphy pronounced then how the dick are we gonna get off this bloody island i mean i thought wed at least be traded or something what do you suggest meanwhile shirley asked we swim for it very bloody funny actually she riposted it isnt bloody funny at all hoy hoy it was one of upshuts guards jabbing his kalashnikov at the prisoners indicating that they should get up and back to work hauling great loads of coral then straining on the ropes of the cement rollers to flatten it chapter fortythree tokyo if it had been handheld computer games that had taken southeast asia by storm then in japan it was the craze for karaoke patrons of bars singing to recorded music and this night jae chong was foot stomping and humming along to a raucous rendition of country music including a tubthumping version of ghost riders in the sky jae ordered another drink and though several other people had their hands up ahead of him he was the one the waiter decided to serve first the waiter jae thought probably despised him for being korean but he was a korean with money and that made all the difference for more yen the waiter would treat him like royalty and jae was spending big why not he was convinced that by now every police station in japan had his photograph or artists likeness and yellow sheet the only thing keeping him off japanese tvs most wanted program was ironically the very press that had been so vocal in calling for the capture of all terrorists responsible for the bullet train wreck for while it was widely known that there were korean terrorists in the country it was not known that the japanese defense force had a ciatype agency and to keep the press off the scent the jdf had to arrange a cover story for the killing of the three policemen including the american agent wray there were japanese constitutional restraints forbidding an intelligence agency from having links or even liaison with the us cia but jae chong was under no illusion once the jdf had its story watertight then his photo would be flashed across every tv screen in the country as the korean terrorist responsible for the murder of two tokyo policemen and a visiting american specialist ostensibly in japan to collect information on american gangs a growing problem in north america and jae chong knew that once his face went public hed be lucky to last a week in any event his cover was now completely blown whatever pyongyangs assurances to its agents in south korea he knew pyongyang would make no effort to recover him because unlike moscows rules in the old cold war chong and other abroad agents were considered expendable there were only two pyongyang rules the first being that if you were caught no recovery effort would be mounted second if you talked your next of kin would be shot not surprisingly it encouraged north korean agents to commit suicide when blown jae faced the inevitable in a drunken stupor and a cloud of lucky strike without rancor without remorse he hated the japanese deeply for what they had done to his grandparents during the second world war and besides to tell the truth hed enjoyed the relatively rich consumer life in japan as compared to the hardships of home where all the money possible had been drained off and funneled into north koreas nuclear program trust the us president to have believed that a final understanding in short a financial buyoff in terms of us aid had caused north korea to deconstruct its nuclear weapons program true the factories in question had now been effectively gutted of any nuclear potential but with pyongyangs old ties to the soviet union still largely intact with russia the men who ran pyongyang now had russian and north korean scientists going back and forth on mutually beneficial cultural exchange programs only one thing was needed a conventional soviet submarine with its nuclear missiles intact the problem now with the old soviet union in disarray wasnt the price there were a halfdozen admirals one could do business with no the problem for pyongyang was simply one of procurement and enough terrorism in capitalist countries like japan to play havoc with transport systems such as the bullet trains that kept supplying the usvun convoys that sailed from japan to be used against beijings soldiers whatever north koreas agents could do to impede the convoys would be gratefully if not publicly acknowledged by beijing by according pyongyang increased access to its nuclear secrets as jae chong contemplated his end he included in his calculations the chance of pulling off one more coup something maybe not as spectacular as the bullet train to go out into the field with this in mind was foolish of course transport police especially would be on the lookout for him no he decided he would do something less risky but equally devastating he ordered more scotch and another packet of lucky strikes even the old tightwads who ran the japan circuit in pyongyang wouldnt begrudge him having a bit of a party in exchange for what he was going to do for good relations between pyongyang and beijing jae lit up another cigarette before one of the prowling bar girls giggled and pointed out that he already had one going he lifted his glass to her and laughed no no he didnt want any company just now he was so pissed he said he probably couldnt get it up but maybe she should come to see him in the morning the morning she looked surprised thats a bit odd lover yes he agreed it was about as odd as a japanese twerp singing ghost riders in the sky and now the silly bastard was going to punish everyone with an encore the streets of laredo chapter fortyfour no the lethargic hotel clerk told baker he hadnt seen anyone hanging around the hotel and no betelchewing youth either baker pulled out two dollars to help his memory it didnt and the clerk didnt seem as upset over a burglarized room as perhaps he should have been but then maybe the new republic of vietnam like everywhere else was experiencing more crime than usual youd better call the police baker said at this suggestion the clerk seemed to suddenly come to life his alarm evident the police would not be good for business besides was bac baker sure he wanted to get involved with the police who as bac baker must know were often he paused and looked aboutvery difficult to deal with if you are a foreigner and especially if you are american my understanding baker said is that hanoi has issued directives to this specific problem that foreigners potential investors customers especially americans who are here helping them fight the chinese aggression are to be accorded all respect is this not so the clerk spread his hands in the universal plea for understanding yes yes of course he answered everyone knew about the official directives but the police were sticky beaks shoving their noses into all kinds of things that didnt concern them i dont care if you call them or not baker said nothing of mine is missing as far as i can tell the clerk seemed relieved how long baker asked would it take me to get to lang bian and the nine hamlets that make up lat village ah the clerk was smiling showing a row of dark brown stained teeth i can be of assistance you cannot walk is too far you must take bus roundtrip you understand never mind the bus ill get a taxi the clerk was shaking his head eyes half closed baker sighed wearily couldnt anything in this country be done simply without either a bureaucratic hassle andor money under the table how much you will need a permit this is fifteen dollars baker said nothing waiting ah yes twentyfive dollars for rental car bus take too long who do i rent the car from government office the clerk said smiling or you can ride bicycle yeah right baker said where do i get the permit ah bac baker here i can be of assistance ill bet no no no betting allowed strictly forbidden in how much baker cut in forty dollars the clerk said now the epitome of helpfulness hastily adding lat village very beautiful where can i get the permit at police station but you no worry i can fix baker shook his head resignedly and paid half the total of forty dollars you wait here bac baker i will arrange for car to come here the permit permit also all right but hurry it up the clerk was already on the phone can i stay overnight in lat baker called out the clerk made a face difficult i think how much twenty dollar maybe no stay is possible then how come you know its twenty dollars ha ha ha ha baker imitated you wouldnt have a connection with a hotel in lat would you ha ha look baker demanded stop screwing me around fix the police permit fix the goddamn rental and fix me up overnight yes yes of course but why overnight well you tell me lat villagehe pronounced it correctly now as lak as a way of showing ha ha that he was more familiar with vietnamese practices than ha ha had given him credit foris very beautiful you told me maybe i want to take the walk up klang in the moonlight klang was the eastern peak of lang bian mountains five peaks yes yes ha ha agreed readily beautiful in the moonshine right now i want all this fixed up he glanced at his watch by eleven this morning or im out of here understand id just as rather be back in saigon baker still refused to call it ho chi minh city a little private rebellion okayyou pay ten dollar more overnight stay no i dont i dont pay squat till i see a vehicle a permit and anything else i need understand squat baker didnt elaborate after a few seconds ha ha had figured it out i will fix he said and went out good baker said but there was no enthusiasm in his voice by now his obsession with trying to find just one mia or pow from nam was waning at least for this morning it was unusually hot for dalat normally an ideal climate yearround and the haggling one had to go through to get the simplest government approval seemed twice as oppressive in the heat officially hanoi had issued more of what amounted to help american directives and while this was being practiced in the north with regard to the usvun alliance to the south there were still many old former north vietnamese army regulars and cadres who were either too corrupt or too resentful of their old enemies to be of much help right there and then ray baker vowed that if nothing turned up in lat village or lang bian mountain hed head back to saigon and turn his attention to some other problem that was more satisfying maybe helping with the american vietnamese adoption agency when the clerk arrived he came in beaming he had everything bac baker needed and was especially proud of the rental it was a jeep either us army surplus or as the vietnamese had done with all the helos the us had left behind it was made up by cannibalizing the wrecks of several jeeps the fact that he was now hiring a usmade jeep to look for us mias and pows captured by the vietnamese who were now allies with americans struck baker as an irony that only vietnam vets would fully appreciate fourwheel drive the clerk announced proudly baker nodded so i hear good luck baker thanked him then immediately wondered what the clerk had meant good luck for what did ha ha know more about his reason for going to lak village or had he baker let it slip somehow then again there wasnt anything particularly secretive about an american official investigating a report about us mias and pows in fact maybe ha ha could help him you know anything about american mias and pows no no nothing ha ha said id pay good money baker held up a twenty and could have sworn he saw the clerk salivating at the prospect of more american dollars but the vietnameses answer was still no it was odd baker thought because the clerk could have made up any old story and taken the twenty chapter fortyfive usvun hq phu lang thuong its about time we got a break freeman told his hq staff he was referring to an intelligence report from one of general vinhs reconnaissance patrols that had revealed the reason so many chinese had so suddenly appeared at the beginning of the war around dong dang and lang son vinhs patrols most of which were badly mauled returning with only half their strength were reporting that the exits of an elaborate tunnel complex had been found just south of dong dang and that chinese regulars apparently moving at night through the tunnels had holed up in the caves around lang son ready for the massive attack on the vietnamese army and the same had apparently happened eastward near loc binh course it shouldnt come as a surprise to vinhs boys freeman pointed out theyre probably the best damn tunnelers in the world he reminded his staff of the vast tunnel complexes not only the maze of over a hundred miles at chu chi in old saigon but those that the nva had dug in the north tunnels that not even the bombs of the bs could penetrate or uproot and the tunnels that honeycombed the earth beneath beijing since the time when china had feared nuclear attack from the soviet union weve been hit freeman told vinh with the old one slow four quick strategy vinh agreed leaving it to the interpreter to explain the technique to freemans hq staff the method is simple very slow at first and extremely effective one slow means take time to plan logistical needs to the smallest detail the amount of rice for each soldier the number of rounds amount of bandages morphine dried fish everything needed for an offensive from battalion to divisional level and practice practice practice for the attack all the tunnels ending up in areas directly beneath the target once all is set then the chinese carry out the four quicks mobility attack tactics and withdrawal it is a massive hit and run only this time freeman interjected there was no run they caught the viet he stopped they caught the vietnamese and us with our pants down while we were trying to defend the lang son road coming up all around us for all we know gentlemen our blue on blue with general vinhs force might have begun with legitimate fire from pla gophers they pop up here and there in the jungle long enough to draw our fire confuse us with the possibility of an ambush then disappear down their warrens while were still firing at anything that moves freeman stepped back to the playdoh mockup of the area between dong dang and loc binh in the north down to the airfield at kep one things for certain gentlemen were going to have to retake what weve lost but first we have to stop the advance and then were going to have to engage the sons of bitches in the tunnels as we he almost said as we did in nam but with vinh present he thought it was more diplomatic not to say it major cline couldnt help a wry smile perhaps theyd make a diplomat of freeman after all general vinh said something but the interpreter balked vinh a chainsmoker gestured to the interpreter to tell freeman exactly what hed said the interpreter faced freeman general vinh said you are correct that sooner or later you will have to rid the tunnels of the pla the same as you tried to do with the viet cong sons of bitches freeman looked at vinh the latters face in a cloud of smoke nodded and smiling broadly extended his hand to vinh as they shook hands in the camaraderie of soldiers both mens hq staffs clapped appreciatively it was a rare moment in which old animosities were forgotten and only the task at hand mattered to defeat the enemy freeman circled the low country east of ban re and southwest of loc binh i propose sending in elements of first division air cavalry along these ridges above the valley a battalion westward to sever the ban relang son railroad and get enough artillery in there he bracketed the valley area between loc binh and ban re to pour down fire into the valley give wang and wei something to think about in the north besides their main force advance meanwhile general your divisions can go in with my second division east of kep that way well hit em back and front vinh looked unconvinced and ventured a few words in english on the subject you like high ground americans we do freeman responded i remember so do i general vinh now told freeman through his interpreter that he thought the plan was sound and simple and he endorsed it but he wondered if his battalions might be landed along with the americans to deal with the tunnels otherwise what the americans would win by day would be lost by night the pla using the triedandtrue method of mao of not attacking until one had overwhelming strength and retreating if one didnt a tactic that might tie down the americans for weeks particularly if the pla as the general was sure they would retreated en masse to the labyrinth of tunnels why not leave the artillery and the lower wetter regions of the valleys to the americans and leave the infantry fighting at night to the vietnamese freeman was mulling it over vinh said something else to the interpreter the latter telling freeman with a tone of apology general vinh intends no insult to the american forces who have so generously come to help stop the chinese aggression but in the unfortunate war between the republic of vietnam and the united states many of the viet cong spent their lives in the tunnels where there were first aid stations ammunition dumps kitchens dormitories wells that these men lived in and operated from the tunnels cu chi said freeman and vinh and his staff immediately showed pleasure in the recognition of freemans knowledge of the vietnam war major cline explaining to the much younger captain boyd that the huge american base at cu chi had unknowingly been built on an extensive viet cong tunnel complex from which vc would emerge at night kill steal and generally create chaos then disappear back down the tunnels leaving the americans demoralized and their commanders puzzled as to how in hell the vc were getting through the bases extensive razor wire and machinegundefended perimeter of course freeman said dont forget that our boys went down after them he had almost said after you vinh acknowledged the bravery of the us tunnel rats but pointed out that the unfortunate war was now long ago and he wondered whether the skill of tunnel clearance was still with the americans the vietnamese on the other hand had been using the tunnel complexes almost continuously since that war against chinas aggressive forays into the republic of vietnam again vinh explained that general freeman must not take this as an insult for the american tunnel rats had shown great bravery and were fearless despite the booby traps freeman thanked the general for his suggestions saying that he freeman would welcome all the help he could get from vinhs tunnel clearers but that he thought it important that wherever possible americans and vietnamese should work together with a view to better future relations between the two countries this met with general approval by the vietnamese staff who were eager to get their hands on some american equipment it was especially welcomed by vinhs political officer who was keen to keep improving vietnamamerican relations after the details of the forthcoming operation codenamed tiger had been discussed from divisional brigade regimental battalion and company level and things were wrapping up for the day major cline complimented freeman on his diplomacy diplomacy hell freeman said as he cline and boyd walked out toward the press pool tent i want americans with them so i damn well know whats going on their radio communications compared to ours are primitive and i dont want our boys in our arty batteries on those ridges left on their lonesome because vinhs boys are fighting a hitandrun maoist war captain boyd looked worried about the upcoming press conference since freemans demotion to field responsibility general jorgensen recently arrived was opening the press pool to as many as the tent would comfortably hold and he was letting reporters fan out to battle zones for live reports hadnt jorgensen learned anything from schwarzkopfs tight field control of the press in the iraqi war boyd complained to cline that the press shouldnt have been allowed as far north as phu lang thuong should have kept them in hanoi he opined well theyre here captain freeman interjected and you and i are going to have to deal with em boyd now looked twice as worried sir what if im asked about the tunnel rat business what about it well sir i havent had much background in that area none of us did son all you had was a knife handgun and a flashlight and down you went boyd nodded but seemed unconvinced were they fearless he asked as general vinh said some but very few at first a lot of men ordered down refused to go those who did often came up and told the squad leader there was nothing down there so we had to create tunnel rat units guys who volunteered you ever go down general boyd asked yes i did not in nam but in another op scary sir son freeman said as he approached what he called the bullshit tent never been so friggin scared in all my life damn near shit myself but i got the bastardright in the belly what kind of booby traps were there cline gave boyd a backoff look but the young press aide was too interested in hearing freemans answer captain do you want to have nightmares no sir then dont ask me about booby traps and dont go asking any of the troops most of them havent ever seen a tunnel and i dont want to spook their morale unnecessarily in the press conference the first such joint conference ever shared by a vietnamese and us general before so many reporters marte prices was the first question taken by freeman general thereve been rumors going around about tunnel complexes occupied by the pla in the border areas will our men be involved in fighting them we usvun boyd whispered ah i dont know where you couldve gotten those reports from ms price but it will be the task of the usvun forces to engage the enemy until he withdraws his forces beyond the vietnamchinese border thats all were here for abc had his hand up general freeman how do you feel being relegated to field command from overall command of usvun forces suits me fine general jorgensen is a fine soldier this is like a football game coach can change anyone to any position he likes cline winced inwardly but outwardly looked unperturbed the general he knew would be quoted by someone somewhere as comparing the war to a game a cbs reporter was identified general vinh this is a followup from a question asked earlier will us forces be fighting in the tunnel complexes there was an audible murmur of surprise among the assembled press corps the question being all but a direct accusation that freeman was holding back general vinhs interpreter took the question waited for his bosss brief reply and announced we know nothing of a tunnel complex but what if there were tunnels marte price interjected then wed fill them in freeman said smiling this got a laugh until marte said you mean youd just suffocate men without giving them a chance no freeman said goodnaturedly we wouldnt do that he turned from the podium as another question about tunnels was addressed to vinh still smiling freeman told boyd quietly i want to see her in private offtherecord his troops called it the george c scott look cold fury under a camouflage net vinh spoke to the interpreter again and the interpreter told pierre lasalle of french television that he knew nothing about tunnels freeman announced the news conference was over there was an uproar from the press freeman was in a rage boyd you get ms price here right now this instant you hear me yes sir when marte price entered the generals tent he knew boyd must have told her he was furious and he made no attempt to hide it against my better judgment he stormed i gave you clearance to accompany the emref and the first thing you do is try to undermine my credibility and general vinhs let alone that of the entire usvun force offtherecord general boyd warned in the bravest advice he had yet given the general what yes offtherecord ms price can i tell you can i trust you with something offtherecord yes gen she couldnt finish her throat and tongue dry as parchment all right he thundered i know what you and those otherreportersare after you want to do to me what you did to our field commanders in nam you want grisly descriptions of tunnel warfare so you can get on prime time and worry the hell out of every parent and family of our men over here you want to serve up blood and guts for dinner and upset our boys folks so bad that theyll be demanding we be sent home marte price tried to speak but he rolled over her like a monsoon what you dont realize young lady is that these boys are here because the most populous country in the world and the only other world power militarily is eating away at its neighbors like a goddamned jackal and if theyre not stopped theyll be encouraged to war war instead of jaw jaw over every goddamn territorial claim they make hell dont you realize the chinese have had wars with everybody anywhere near their fence india pakistan the russians siberia laos vietnam now theyre laying claim to every goddamn island and reef over five hundred of them in the south china sea and what do you want to do you want to do a goddamn liberal dance about our boys going down some goddamn tunnel because it makes good copy for your rag now piss off an hour later general freeman called on marte price he couldnt tell whether shed been crying or whether she was being deliberately cold i apologize for losing my temper i apologize for telling you to to piss off that was ungentlemanly of me and i regret it and the rest general i dont withdraw a word of it its true i wouldnt trust you people as far as i could kick you the road to lat village or rather the nine hamlets that constituted the population of just over seven thousand was in bad repair following heavy rains and raymond baker was glad that ha ha had got him the jeep for the sevenandahalfmile journey he was stopped twice by police who demanded to see the required permits and who in the second instance argued that the date stamp on the dalat permit was for tomorrow and that therefore he should not be on the road and should be fined one million dong about ninety dollars us exasperation barely under control baker told them about the clerk at the hotel and that perhaps what he should do is have the us legation in saigon ring the officials of general vinh in hanoi that did it albeit grudgingly he was allowed to proceed and once in the first hamlet in the early afternoon he let it be known that he was looking for information about us mias and pows from nam appealing to their patriotism telling the village headman that our soldiers and your soldiers are fighting side by side to repel the imperialistic ambitions of the chinese and that therefore the vietnamese people and all those who had been exploited by the chinese nogooders had a patriotic duty to help him find any missing mias or pows from nam then they could rejoin their comrades in the fight against the chinese invaders baker had particularly balked when it came to using terms such as imperialist nogooders and patriotic duty but then again why not use anything he could he added that there would also be a substantial reward for helpful information leading to any pow or mia a lot of villagers on their way back from market stared at him as they had stared for thousands of years at barbarians who smelled like dog and often to the asians disgust grew facial hair but beyond that no one took much notice other than a crowd of boys who despite the villages relative prosperity soon clung about him their hands out for money or whatever he might have had to give the only thing he wanted to give was hope to at least some of those parents back in the states who simply did not know for sure whether their kin were alive or dead if they were dead then at least they would know for certain and the grieving could begin police he noticed were everywhere in dalat and suddenly in the beautifully rich clean air that had followed the downpour he realized how futile it all was who would dare approach a stranger with such information with policemen sniffing everywhere perhaps he could do better by forwarding a request to usvun hq in hanoi or was it now in phu lang thuong baker wished he could give mias next of kin some idea of how frustrating it was trying to follow a single lead through the tangled web of bureaucracy it always ended like this despite the most optimistic beginnings and who could blame the vietnamese what would he do in their position with officialdom ever ready to swoop for some reason that might rest on nothing more than a petty whim or vindictiveness baker decided he would return to dalat in the morning if he failed to get anything that would substantiate the old chineses claim made on his sampan that there was an mia in one of the lat villages there was no hotel in lat but for the twenty dollars hed given ha ha it had been arranged that he would stay overnight in one of the village thatchedroof houses built high on stilts without knowing it at least at that moment the american was among people who if they knew anything would most likely tell him for the lat villagers were made up of old men who along with other minorities had helped the americans in the early seventies the evening meal was rice and some kind of meat that they told him was pig which he doubted and black beans they told baker through a local translator that you see the hill people the montagnards were correct they always said the americans the green facesthey meant green beret commandos face paintwould not desert them that they would come back its been a long time baker said by way of apology what is time to us the family elder said smoking his pipe at full blast the important thing is they came back one of the younger men shook his head from side to side the important thing is will they stay no another man said matteroffactly as he held the rice bowl close to his mouth shoveling with his chopsticks the question is what will salt and pepper do who cares what they will do the old man said angrily there is always one rotten banana in the bunch one the younger man said in this case there are two who are they asked baker montagnards no no the old man said waving aside the mention of montagnards they are rebels from what tribe then baker inquired no one spoke busily eating and drinking tea the silence growing heavier by the second baker felt his gut tighten as if hed swallowed a slime ball along with his rice slowly he put down his bowl are they americans he asked quietly yes the young man said do you know where they are the old mans chopsticks waved in a wide gesture toward the peaks of lang bian mountain up there why do you call them salt and pepper the young man shrugged nonchalantly one is white one is black youre sure theyre americans yes the old man said offering more tea baker was simply lost for words hed come looking for mias and possibly pows not renegades he blew on the hot tea could you contact them the old man shrugged i dont know who wants to talk to such vermin baker conceded the old mans point who would want to find two turncoats hed sure as hell get no thanks from washington the chinese would of course relish the propaganda value despite the fact that whoever this salt and pepper were they must now be near middle age what do they do baker asked i mean so they turned and ran for the other side the communists but they cant still be running against our men i mean the us has been long gone the us has come back the younger man said the renegades will run with whoever runs against the us the chinese or the khmer rouge sometimes they transport heroin from laos into vietnam baker felt himself sweating despite the cool air of the lat village the very mention of the khmer rouge from cambodia the khmer rouge being one of chinas allies in the south filled him with the kind of fear and loathing some of his jewish friends experienced upon hearing the names auschwitz and buchenwald run by powercrazed madmen bent on genocide china would welcome a khmer rouge attack against the vietnamese anywhere on vietnams western border have you heard any rumors of a khmer rouge invasion he asked yes the old man said porters are being recruited to move ammunition and supplies along the cambodianvietnamese border and the laotianvietnamese border using some of the old ho chi minh trails no one spoke for several minutes the only sounds those of the fruit birds from the hill country and the sipping of tea finally baker still trying to absorb the shock of the information and the implications of it for the war should the usvun forces be hit on another front determined that the usvun field commander general freeman should be advised of the impending likelihood of an attack on his left flank but bakers thoughts immediately returned to the subject of the two american renegades do you know what rank they hold baker asked these two no have you seen them yourselves i did the young man said once it was a drug line moving toward saigon ho chi minh city the father corrected saigon the young man repeated and baker knew he had an ally i saw them for only a moment they were in nva uniforms with the big metal rings on their backpacks remember the rings were for attaching camouflage leaves and such so that unlike an american an nva soldier could move his head around without any camouflage moving they had gone past so fast you could not see them clearly but the white one was much smaller than the black one would you recognize them again no though i have heard they never separate and the white one is bigger than most vietnamese sometimes they move from place to place by air but it is said they only transport drugs on foot baker sat still both hands cradling the cup accepting the offer of more tea then he sipped the tea and a crisis had passed because he had resolved what to do the moment he got back to dalat hopefully tomorrow evening he would send a message to usvuns hq hed get shit for not having notified state first or the pentagon and not going through normal channels but he took comfort from the words of field marshal von rundstedt who once declared that normal channels are a trap for officers who lack initiative he thanked his hosts for the meal and went outside to bring in his sleeping bag from the jeep despite the fading light he saw that all the tires on his jeep had been slashed vandals the old man pronounced hooligans from dalat no doubt no matter who it was baker told them it meant he would have to go back to dalat by bus in the morning what time does it leave seven from habit baker unzipped his sleeping bag to make sure that no bugs or snakes had set up shop then laid it down on the palmmatted floor sat down and by candlelight wrote down a summary of all hed heard that night he folded it when he was finished took his boots off and stuffed it down his right sock until he could feel the square of paper under the arch of his foot then he quietly begged pardon and asked the young man who had said saigon instead of ho chi minh city whether it was possible for him to get a weapon a pistol anything the young man said this was possible caches of arms had been buried by many villagers during nam but bac baker must understand that this would cost money not for himself but for those who sold such things illegally two hundred american dollars travelers checks sure american express or visa okay fine the young man soon returned and handed baker a service revolver and two full clips sure baker admitted to himself he was feeling a little paranoid about it all but it was just in case the tire slashers werent simply vandals after all there was a scream the old lady who had come to clean up the kitchen someone had placed the chopsticks baker had used upright in his rice bowl since time immemorial a buddhist sign of the dead moving quickly baker removed his raincoat flashlight and what few other belongings he had in the jeep and bunched them in his sleeping bag to resemble a body he turned out his lamp then sat in a corner of the room where he had a clear view of the open doorway his ears straining for the least sound the gun in his right hand resting on the left for instant use all he had to do was stay awake till morning he tried to remember what they had told him on the firing range back in washington but all that seemed and was a world away he thought about the chopstick sign the message didnt worry him so much as whod done it hed heard nothing could someone have come up to the high house without making a sound if not it must have been someone in the family was the young mans use of saigon instead of ho chi minh merely a ploy to build confidence in him was the young man an agent provocateur in any case baker hoped he wouldnt have to use the gun merely having it in vietnam was highly illegal and hoped the tire slashing and the sign of the dead were merely two unrelated incidents perhaps the chopsticks being put in the bowl like that sticking up like incense tapers was a nasty bit of teasing by someone else in the village all right baker told himself so it was a cruel prank by some spiteful neighbor and had nothing to do with him the problem was still the stealth it took for someone to come up to the house creep up the ladder steps do it and leave without being noticed by either him or his hosts which brought him back to the family again he heard a soft thud like a rubber ball thrown in through the doorway a grenade he switched on his flashlight ready to kick it out the door and instead saw nothing but a slash of brilliant green slithering toward him he fired with one hand holding the flashlight the other pulling the trigger until hed emptied the his hands shaking uncontrollably from his phobia of snakes the snake having disappeared under the mattress by now of course it was as if the house had been bombed everyone running and talking excitedly lanterns coming on and swinging through the hamlet baker tried to talk but couldnt instead he pointed the handgun at the mattress finally he could manage a few words con tran he said con tran it meant python but he couldnt remember the word for snake con trangreen you understand con tran sure everybody understood who didnt understand pythons said one of the contemptuous teenagers are known for their great flying ability must have been a bat another said the young man his hosts oldest son who called ho chi minh saigon carefully lifted up the riddled sleeping bag and straw mattress with a stick in one hand and a long knife in the other there was no snake there only a wild pattern of holes that the bullets had made after passing through the sleeping bag mattress and thatched floor soon the rest of the villagers went home they needed sleep for their work in the fields more than they needed stories of flying pythons from a mentally ill american and in his citybred panic the american had totally lost face yet the next morning when a policeman arrived wanting to know who had been firing a gun last night none of the villagers could answer him they were all asleep they told him no one wanted trouble for the hamlet oh yes they said theyd heard shots coming from the direction of lang bians peaks but vietnamese had lived with the sound of firing for a thousand years a poacher perhaps everyone knew that since the vietnam war deer wild pig and even tigers had begun to repopulate the area saigon as baker had begun calling his hosts oldest son was apparently the only one who believed baker that a snake despite the height of the houses stilts had been in his room what color was it he asked baker green then it wasnt a python no no but i couldnt think of your name for snake saigon asked what kind of green very bright a bamboo viper saigon said baker didnt want to ask the next question but his need to recover face at least for himself after his outburst of panic forced him to he asked saigon if a bamboo viper was your ordinary elephant grass nonpoisonous creepy crawly or what had it bitten you you would have been dead within the hour you had better keep the gun in one sense it was the last thing baker wanted to hear yet it reassured him to know that someone at least believed his version of what had happened someone is after you saigon said youve come too close i think to salt and pepper i dont think they are directly involved otherwise youd be dead they are probably off west somewhere in cambodia or laos but i think the slashed tires the rice bowl and the chopsticks this is all how do you americans say it lowtech the word has been put out but now with the americans helping us in the north no one wants to do it overtly he paused to kill you in the open they wish it to seem like an accident slashed tires are hardly covert baker said true but that might have nothing to do with it teenage bad types and why wondered baker are you telling me all this is it you are you after me are you just telling me all this so as not to make me suspicious it was as if saigon could divine what baker was thinking im helping you saigon said because you are here helping us i wasnt born until after the war for me it is history i do not dislike americans thanks baker said i feel awkward with the gun what if the dalat police stop me theyll stop you because youre breathing it was the first time since last nights meal that saigon had laughed it is true they would stop their grandmothers give it to me you will be safe on the bus going back to dalat ill send someone to your hotel with it i think you should have it you think i should pursue this matter of salt and pepper saigon shrugged this is up to you but till youre back safely in saigon i think you should keep the gun i will keep the sleeping bag if the police saw that they would be suspicious yes baker walked a few paces then stopped it was sixfifty and the first bus out would be in ten minutes he took out a note hed written about the existence of salt and pepper and of the possibility of a khmer rouge flank attack against vietnam he gave the note to saigon telling him that if anything should happen to him saigon should give the note to a senior cadre in dalat to be passed on to usvun hq as the crowded bus began its bumpy journey back to dalat baker felt the loneliest he had in years in going to dalat he was running away from lang bian mountain chapter fortysix it was an awesome sight even for seasoned chopper patrols over two hundred helos carrying two thousand of second armys assault helicopter battalion and airborne into battle fifty miles north of phu lang thuong to the edges of the valley southwest of loc binh from a distance to the fighters and bombers already plastering the scrubby ridges around loc binh with he and napalm the choppers made it look as if the sky was full of gnats marte price had wrangled a ride on one of the helos general jorgensen she discovered was a much easier obstacle to work around than freeman jorgensen at pains to be politically correct had also allowed several other reporters including lasalle to be in the first wave marte price now wished jorgensen had refused permission the noise of over two hundred helicopter engines and rotors chopping the thick humid air and the distant thunder of heavy ordnance being dropped to clear the ridges of the pla combined to fill her with a fear she had never felt so intensely the members of the nineman squad she was with were mostly silent all but two sitting on their bulletproof kevlar vests instead of wearing them fearing shots from below that could easily penetrate the skin of the chopper and hit their genitals the minutes before deplaning were filled with apprehension each man knowing that the pla might well be ready to spring a trap around the landing zones holding their fire till the helos soldiers were spilling out on the flats between the ridges and then opening up in a murderous ambush as the first battalion of airborne went in led by colonel smythe freeman was in the control chopper high above the swarm of helos below with f tomcats from the enterprise riding shotgun making sure that the helos were properly dispersed to ensure the perimeter about a half mile across normally a colonel or a onestar brigadier general would have been directing the local deployment but this had been freemans plan and if he was going to take responsibility for it he wanted to personally direct it besides like patton he was known as a frontline general no matter whose plan it was furthermore second army was his until told otherwise by washington then it happened bravo company of the first battalion were deplaning close to a dike running along the edge of a rice paddy when the field seemed to erupt in fire the fusillade of bullets coming from a scrubby and partially treed ridge that sloped down to the valley floor of green fields even as a star or sixpoint mm howitzer gun position was being set on the ridges south of the landing zone with mms slung under the bellies of an equal number of heavyload chinook choppers the pla infantry were laying down a murderous fire on the americans how did the pla know there would be a major force attempt to secure the valley as a hub from which to spoke out attacks against the plas supply line between lang son and loc binh and the road between loc binh and lang duong in fact they didnt know the pla had guessed that freeman a general known for his keepmoving tactics wouldnt be satisfied waiting for a setpiece battle about phu lang thuong he wouldnt wait for his enemy to come to him but would probably try to leapfrog overflying the plas spearhead on the lang sonphu lang thuong road to hit wangs and weis forces deep in their own territory that would stop the chinese supply line splitting their forces and allowing two divisions from second armys i corps to close in from phu lang thuong wang and wei while having made spectacularly impressive gains so far had not managed to take hanoi the us artillery was too formidable the chinese generals now had to decide whether to recall those pla elements to the south now wheeling before phu lang thuong for the attack on haiphong on the usvun eastern flank if these pla regiments were able to reach the allied port of haiphong then the winding seventymilelong haiphonghanoi road the allies vital supply artery would be cut and with that would come a bonanza of allied supplies for the pla and whatever the pla couldnt find dockside at haiphong could be supplied along the southeast coast from the chinese city of mong cai on the other hand if the pla regiments did not pivot before phu lang thuong toward the red river delta but stood their ground to prevent the other units of second armys i corps from pressing north toward ban re and lang son the oncoming americans would soon meet up with freemans airborne allowing the americans in the north now reinforced to split into two spearheads one swinging west to take lang son the other right to loc binh the two chinese generals knew they had the numbers but also knew that if their supply line could be cut this far north then freemans second army i corps would not only advance but would be constantly reinforced by haiphong wei was still ready to go along with the two political officers and make an allout assault on hanoi imagine wei said if washington fell the terrible effect on american morale wang arrogantly waved his comrades comment aside washington did fall comrade the british burned it to the ground and look at it today if anything its fall hardened american resolve to counterattack this is another time wei responded exactly wang retorted in any case it was our agreement that if we did not take hanoi by the tenth day we would turn to haiphong yes comrade general but we have been held up on the highway to hanoi by american and vietnamese saboteurs weve not really begun our attack on hanoi enough of this wrangling wang said i demand a vote it was two for going on to attack hanoi two for haiphong very well wang said beijing must decide what do we do meantime one of the political commissars asked wangs knuckles rapped the map his regiments redflagged the enemys blue i suggest we crush freemans helicopter assault at loc binh one of the political commissars had the temerity to point out that it would not be correct to report that the americans were attacking with helicopters this would give beijing the impression that the assault was a gunship attack by american comanche and apache helicopters when in fact it was an infantry attack albeit airborne wang said nothing that would injure his career but merely smiled at the commissar the other three took this to be a sign of acquiescence in fact it was a wellcamouflaged expression of contempt for the tendentiousness of the political officers b t clearly neither commissar detected his true feelings about them he was glad they were deceived and was hopeful that freemans forces were about to be equally deceived by his camouflage at loc binh apache gunships came to the fore as those who had deplaned their troops flew westward of what were now being called the loc binh fields the apaches spraying machinegun fire into the scrub and bamboo that came down to the edges of the fields in a confusion of communications some choppers got the order to withdraw with their full complement of troops so tacair could be brought to bear while others still a few feet above the field their blade wash flattening the elephant grass along the edge of the fieldridge interface deplaned their troops into a maelstrom of smallarms fire directed at the troops just landing their most vulnerable moment the helos also drawing heavy fire up on a ridge held by the chinese a battery of mm machineguncum aa fired had already downed three choppers one after its troops had alighted the other two while fully loaded approaching hovering position two tomcats came in low dropped napalm on the batteries and rose quickly as an enormous roiling orangeblack ball of flame engulfed what just seconds before had been enemy positions but meanwhile the pla were walking mm heavy mortar rounds across the fields telling freeman that the pla crews must have had time to angle prepare their trap then the walking would stop the rounds hitting the americans with unison rounds in which up to ten mortar rounds landed together shrapnel whizzing through air immediately followed by the screams of men being hit freeman seeing he was between a rock and a hard place had to decide to cut and run or drop more men into the maelstrom of fire there seemed to him a better than fiftyfifty chance that he could hold position with a stream of troopcarrying helos keeping up the supply of men and materiel into the lz while its perimeter was being established we keep going he ordered hold the perimeter already more helos were taking off from phu lang thuong meanwhile wang was on the phone with his loc binh field commanders ordering them to commit several reserve battalions from the chengdu military region over four hundred men down the ridge and into the fields by which his commanders understood that he meant them to penetrate the perimeter wang put the phone down and yelled weather report clouding over sir but clear for helos below two thousand feet then said wang grimly he will keep pouring troops into the area until he pushes the perimeter uphill it must have been a terrible shock for him to find us waiting to have forecasted this probable landing site but now that shock is over wang was pacing anxiously i think he will stay at least so long as the cloud ceiling makes it possible to call in air support wang ordered another battalion another eight hundred down the ridge into the fields to where pla mortars had cratered an area of about fifty yards across through which platoonsized elements of wangs chengdu army were penetrating by now several hastily emplaced us mm batteries were opening fire and freemans men saw several volcanolike explosions of scrub bush and red earth still the plas mortars were proving the more deadly fire screams of incoming causing the americans to scramble to what cover they could find in the detritus of war from empty ammo boxes to the dead now it was handtohand where the mortars had broken the americans defensive ring and dlupo rhin and martinez found themselves in a firefight through clouds of smoke grenades theyd tossed into the breach it wasnt much but it was enough to slow down the pla regulars rushing through the clouds of dense white smoke their shadowy figures cut down by the us infantrymens best friend the pig the m machine gun two oclock two oclock martinez yelled dlupos m fired and the figure fell in a rush of three pla soldiers through the smoke one was unlucky enough to run across the field of fire of private first class walter b sloane sloane had a twelvegauge pump action shotgun and fired twice the chinese soldiers head gone his bloodsplattered torso still running around sit down ya silly prick some gi yelled out and that was it martinez dlupo and even a harried radio operator rhin couldnt contain their fearbred laughter martinez laughing so hard he could hardly change magazines rhin could barely be understood by one of the following air cavalry companies coming in with priority landing status what the hells the matter with you soldier a major bellowed we jusman sloane just blew his head off now you listen to me goddamn it get a grip on yourself fella rhin told martinez they were to get a grip on themselves and martinez having just fired off a threeround burst said what parta me would he like me to grip shit man cant rhin only got under control when a mortar shell landed yards away miraculously he wasnt hit by any shrapnel but the concussion knocked him to the ground a large ochercolored sod of earth from the dike along the edge of the field hitting him in the stomach completely winding him he was gasping for air unable to speak so martinez had to take the field phone identify your lima a voice yelled identify your lima over far as i can tell martinez answered were at the northern edge of these fields lot of white smoke over theres white smoke everywhere mark the lz with purple smoke can you do that over roger can do over out it was a terrible mistake for martinez not to know that days prearranged signal for an lz as the americans had the enemy wavelength and were using vietnamesechinese interpreters so too did the chinese have the american wavelength and vietnamesechineseenglish interpreters within seconds of the transmission between the air cavalry major and martinez the helo pilot saw a purple column of smoke curling up from the swirling hell of shrapnelinfested white smoke and ground fire he started to descend and saw purple smoke rising this time in the northern sector somewhere farther east jesus christ the air cav major said which fucker is ours i say we go in on the first one major the pilot said if its a pla dupe we gotta assume our boys were the first to lay purple guess youre right lieutenant take us in yessir the blades of dozens of choppers above them the neverending cracks of smallarms fire and roaring machine guns around them dlupos platoon was in a cacophony of sound and confusion farther east unseen by their fellow soldiers on the ground the helo with the cavalry major descended into purple the purple smoke now buffeted away by the downwash the helo no more than ten feet from the ground jesus the pilot yelled recognizing two or three pla regulars below him rifles raised it was too late an mm sovietmade rpg round exploded into the guts of the chopper aflame it fell like a brick its blades broken and spinning like a scythe through the field the explosion of its gas tanks an enormous saffron cloud the bodies of its crew and squad of air cavalry curling grotesquely into wizened black fetal positions the smallarms ammo inside the fiercely burning shell of the helo was popping off the smell of cooked flesh oil and burning gasoline wafting across the battlefield from this point on no lz identification procedures were to be given in plain language over the field phones only prearranged phrases or strips of cloth that would confuse the enemy the men pouring out of following choppers were now doing so in the center of the field and running out to relieve andor reinforce the troops on the perimeter freeman kept pouring men in dont let em bearhug you he ordered his commanders as he landed in some tall elephant grass growing along part of the dike whatd he mean marte price asked a private who was busy seeing whether it was possible for a human being to melt into elephant grass by will alone whats he mean bearhug she repeated only now noticing that the recorder in her hand was shaking uncontrollably she dared not ask freeman his aide cline or even his somewhat ironically timid press officer boyd bearhuggin maam someone with a southern accent explained is when tha enemy gets in so close to ya ya cant use arty thats artillery maam as covering fire for your men cause if you do youll kill as many of your own guys as the enemy maybe more marte price spun around and crashed into a soldiers m rifle a hole and a large splotch of blood on her left breast medic a soldier near her shouted medic reporters been hit freeman moved her as gently as speed would allow the pain of it making her gasp a medic barely out of a chopper by her side he slit open her blouse cut her bra off and gave her a shot of morphine then taped her with a thick wad of field dressing then with freemans help the medic carried her to one of the relay choppers about to take off back to phu lang thuong im sorry she told freeman who merely patted her on the other shoulder shouting youll be all right a milliondollar wound she had heard him clearly despite the terrible confusion of the battle and she vowed then that her wound would not be a ticket out of the war she would get well and she would cover this war as she had first intended at the front at the northern edge of the perimeter the fighting was handtohand with rifle knife and bayonet and the american artillery couldnt help but the perimeter was bulging here and there no longer the circle of freemans plan but larger in area if only the bulges could hold and not be squeezed by the pla here the american ability to reinforce and resupply with a speed unmatched by any other army proved the decisive factor along with the fact that freemans troops knew he was there they also knew marte price was there a woman whose very presence not only commanded their protection but also meant that their performance would be reported that day but if as well as the bravery and training of the airborne troops there was one weapon that turned the tide at approximately hours it was the us flamethrower which not only arced toward the pla it could see but set a deep pie slice of underbrush afire and soon the high canopy of forest on the hill and its ridges were ablaze forcing the pla infantry back where they simultaneously became visible to freemans forward air controller who in his cessna bird dog spotter plane was now directing the heavy ordnance from three f tomcats from enterprise right on top of the retreating pla on the next bomb run however the tomcats couldnt see any more targets for the fires smoke and neither could the fac freeman ordered the first battalion into the burnedout pie slice that had now become a charred threeacre patch on the southern side of the ridge that slanted up from the wet muddy fields over which thick white smoke was now pooling having been blown away from the pla positions but neither the advancing us infantry battalion nor the fac or tomcat pilots could see any chinese on the far side of the ridge freeman grasped the field phone and coughed roughly to rid his throat of smoke scrape now listen colonel i want your boys to do two things simultaneously first i want alpha company to get up to the ridgeline facing loc binh watch for booby traps and dig in then i want rats from bravo company to go down after the pla and charlie company to stay in reserve so when those tunnel maggots come up for air after we smoke em out well have reception for them you got that over roger alpha top of the ridge bravo farther down and charlie covers the rear over how many tunnelers you got there colonel over half a dozen trained general over not enough you grab anyone vietnamese or us under fivefour and weighing under and send em down over ill do my best general over no you wont youll flush those chinks outta there for us to shoot or ill have your ass out lasalle had made a special note of freemans use of the word chinks mon dieu if he could get that pic hed heard about of freeman finishing off one of his own wounded along with this chink gaffe hed probably get the lead story for paris match then it suddenly hit him what in hades was he doing up here at the front while marte price was back at the first available field hospital a firstrate opportunity for him to really search her tent he waited till he heard the next medevac chopper come in its prop wash dispersing the smoke as several medics loaded two badly wounded men on its side litters the sergeant told the frenchman he couldnt ride this one out they had several walking wounded with serious enough bleeds that hed have to wait no sweat he answered loudly as alpha companys mortars pounded the top of the loc binh ridge lasalle waited he didnt care if they thought him a coward bolting from the battle not if he could get time to really do a cinema verité as it were of the great american general freeman lasalle didnt like americans never had if the french were too proud the yankees were much too cocky he planned to take them down a peg or two he could see his prizewinning article now pierre lasalle at the front exclusive lasalle had never forgotten freemans comments about the french unwillingness to let the usaf overfly french airspace during the bombing attack on khadafy in libya the frogs only care about the frogs their idea of collective security is to have a multinational force protect france and to hell with quid pro quo the only american lasalle liked was jerry lewis battalion leader colonel melbaine had alpha company atop the ridge as freeman had ordered and charlie company was spread west to east at the base of the slope forming a backup line about three hundred yards long several of the tunnel rats from bravo company stripped to the waist were preparing themselves with fieldphone transmitting throat mikes and transmitter packs that nowadays obviated the need of spool wire trailing behind in addition to the mike and shaped flashlight each rat went down with a spare clips in side pockets colonel melbaine said he had only five qualified rats ready to go he needed more to go down but guys hed thought were around five feet four and around pounds had suddenly grown fatter said theyd love to go down but fuck it they were too wide general freeman turned to major cline bob get me a kit im going down general jesus sir pardon me but youll get stuck down there dont be so goddamn rude im in top physical shape but sir cmon bob dont give me dance get me a flashlight a and a miketransmitter unit with the five other rats ready he signaled the six of them to go down a second later each man was down a hole in the fireravaged earth in the darkness freeman found the arched runnel dug by the pla for the pla as much a squeeze as bob cline had predicted his heart thumping so hard that he felt sure the whole of bravo company must now be privy to his fear he felt carefully in front of him using his knuckles to rap the damp cool earth the pla known to set punji sticks razorsharp angled bamboo that would go right through a mans boot the earthen top of such traps often built to support the lighter pla troops but not the generally heavierbuilt americans his flashlight fell on a zshaped corner constructed to prevent grenade shrapnel or concussion from wiping out a whole length of tunnel rather than just a portion of it twenty feet in came freemans subdued voice passed a z going toward a u bend like a bomb squad member or test pilot he was recording everything for them should he get killed the next rat down would know how far to go before he could expect anything new he heard a crack like a stick breaking one of his tunnel rats had made a contact the shot echoing through the tunnel complex but whether left or right of him he couldnt say he was halfway around the u bend when he came across something he had never seen or heard about in the tunnels before a saloonlike bamboo door breathing hard sweat breaking out on his neck he took a moment to compose himself then he noticed another tunnel veering off to the right so that he had a choice either straight ahead into the tunnel or to veer off to the right he heard a noise the scurrying of some animal and felt the wet rush of a huge gray rat along his side that caused his whole body to shiver am at a bamboo door he reported to those topside have probably gone in eighty feet another section of tunnel goes off to the right which way to go bamboo door looked fishy as if it was inviting him to come in perhaps it was a pla sign that beyond lay a deadend storage area was that where the rat or whatever had scurried past him had come from he turned the flashlight on and off just long enough for him to see that below the door there was some spilled rice huh freeman said gruffly desperately fighting a growing sense of claustrophobia and the stench of rotten air door definitely looks wrong ten to one you touch it and you trip a grenade his throat was bone dry despite the cool dampness of the fetid tunnel will use white smoke to make vertical shafts visible if i find any am resting awhile before i move out it also gave freeman time to listen for a few minutes to hear despite the steady thunder and staccato of battle overhead if there was any movement coming his way the door drew him toward it but he resisted the temptation it was a suckers trap if ever there was one he took the right tunnel instead chapter fortyseven the move of prisoners from upshut island to the mainland was as abrupt as it was unexpected the south chinese intelligence bureau had suddenly been apprised of the disposition of american naval forces in the south china sea it was impressive with at least six hunterkiller los angeles subs within range of the island which was merely another way of saying that if any pla aircraft took off from the island against the us seventh fleet they would immediately be brought down by the seventh fleets surfacetoair missiles and so in one report by the chengdu intelligence bureau the reason for keeping un pows on the island as hostages against the us air attack no longer made any sense what was the use of having allied hostages on upshut island to protect the runway from us bombs if the pla planes on the airstrip were rendered unusable because of the seventh fleets missiles much better it was decided by beijing to move the pow hostages to a location where they could be of more use as hostages andor coolies and so in a stench of sweat and kerosene fumes and as quickly as theyd been brought to upshut island the american australian vietnamese and other un pows were placed aboard pla transports clearly marked with a red cross blindfolded and handcuffed to the inside lugs on the planes fuselage and flown north from the paracel islands then east into chengdu province they were then taken to yet another airfield in the making one not invulnerable to missiles such as the tomahawk but a field in china proper not in the disputed islands of the south china sea it was thought that though the americans might drop bombs on their own if strategic considerations deemed it imperative to do so the us would not sacrifice the other pows the australians vietnamese and british it would create an uproar within the united nations coalition in any event the americans would think twice for another reason to bomb an internationally recognized dispute island was one thing but to attack an airstrip in china proper would be an enormous leap into the political unknown it would create the kind of political maelstrom in the offing when macarthur wanted to cross the yalu into china during the korean war the mere suggestion that because of strategic and tactical considerations he was thinking about it was enough to bring un criticism and led to truman firing him to be part albeit the major part of a usvun force was one thing but to allow us airpower to cross the vietnamesechinese border to hit inside china proper went way beyond the mandate jorgensen and freeman had two f tomcats on combat patrol two hundred miles from the uss enterprise were told by the carrier awacs about the red cross plane and the fs swooped down to have a looksee the chinese have painted red crosses all over the patrol leader reported do not engage enterprise advised i say again do not engage thatd be all the usvun would need the downing of a chinese red cross plane though the enterprises skipper was willing to bet a months pay the bastards were using it to ferry pla troops back and forth from all the islands claimed by the pla for the peoples republic of china for those in the chinese transport plane a pla c made to carry forty fully armed troops but now jampacked with ninety prisoners the sleepinducing drone competed with the anxiety of not knowing where they were going where the fuck are we mike murphy demanded above the steady roar of the engines and trying to use his facial muscles to work down the blindfold well were not in hawaii shirley fortescue whispered well danny mellin said my moneyd be on china somewhere on the southeast coast there was a thud followed by an agonized expulsion of air up shut commanded upshut and now from a slit of light mike murphy could see lieutenant mung the interrogator aboard the destroyer it looked as if they were moving from upshut island lock stock and barrel through his tiny window on the world murphy could get only a tantalizing glimpse a trace of silver that would be somewhere in the northern sector of the gulf of tonkin if mellin was correct soon they began their descent ears began to pop and some experienced needlesharp pains in their sinuses their faces contorted as they leaned forward in a vain attempt to get away from the rapid change in pressure hands straining against roped wrists there was a banshee howl as the undercarriage came down and engaged then a sharp bump and a second or two when everything felt out of control a political officer was already aboard before the props stopped turning welcome to ningming you will work hard and prosper the cadre announced smiling mike murphy stood up lieutenant mung wanted to knock the australian down but stopped when the commissar held up his hand whaddya mean by prosper mate you mean youll let us go free the cadres smile showed yellowstained teeth yes when you work hard you help fight american imperialists this will help win war then you go home everybody happy yeah well what if we dont want to work for you or any other bloody cadre the eagerly nodding cadre was still smiling his features thrown into gross relief by the flashlight he was holding you not work you will be shot yeah murphy said sullenly well how we gonna work with our bloody hands tied up christ you lot are straight from the bloody goon showya know that we do not understand this the cadre said back off mike mellin warned well shit we arent prisoners of war for chrissake were just a poor bunch of bastards picked up off the rigs you will have your hands unroped the cadre said in the morning you work two hundred of you you will help make ningming large airport from which to bomb the usvun forces murphy charged this the cadre conceded is correct but first you will build your accommodations he said something sharp to upshut who unclipped the stock of the ak walked over and clubbed murphy to the ground with the australian in a protective fetal position upshut kicked at his groin and missed his boot crunching the australians cupped hands next upshut walked about murphy and started in on his kidneys ending with a final vicious kick at murphys face catching the australian on the right cheek now bleeding profusely upshut handed his rifle to a soldier still looking down at murphy always big mouth never up shut always for girl yes for girl he pointed at shirley fortescue for her yes yes he bellowed and took his foot back for another kick yes murphy said yes upshut said for girl he knelt down next to the bleeding prisoner you lose face australian next time you die you understand yes tell me you full of shit murphy wet his lips but before he could speak upshut stopped him telling him that he wanted everyone to hear mung nodded and upshut kicked him in the base of the spine murphy groaned with pain tell them im louder mung ordered holding his hand out for the ak im full of shit all the prisoners averted their eyes to lessen his humiliation but in doing so they too lost face ningming a railhead with one airstrip was thirteen miles from the vietnamesechinese border twentysix miles from dong dang and lang son in vietnam and twentyfive miles from loc binh where freemans second army was waging war on the ridges south of loc binh chapter fortyeight in texas mrs mellin received yet another letter from the head office of the veterans administration in washington dc dear mrs mellin thank you for your letter of march inquiring about the possible whereabouts of your husband daniel e mellin who has been missing since the fire at an offshore drilling rig in the south china sea i fully empathize with your frustration at not receiving any solid information regarding your husbands whereabouts beyond the information given us earlier by the royal bruneian government that the fire at the scene was so intense that many bodies were burned beyond recognition we are of course continuing to investigate the matter but given the present hostilities between china and the usvun forces our inquiries to date have been met with silence on another front that of the mia status of mr mellins sister angela there is the possibility albeit a faint one that increased contacts between the republic of vietnam and the united states necessitated by the usvun coalition will yield longawaited information on some of the more than two thousand mias and suspected pows still held in vietnam the director has asked me to assure all those family and friends of mias and pows that the department is doing its utmost in this matter he has also suggested that public appeals through the media phonein shows and privately written letters to the government in hanoi tend to inhibit our inquiries rather than help rest assured however that we will not cease in our efforts to ascertain the whereabouts of mr daniel mellin and ms angela mellin chapter fortynine not having heard anything for several minutes in the tunnel freeman still on hands and knees edged his way from the bamboo swing door into the first curve of what turned out to be an s and not a u bend somewhere above him he heard the faint stutter of what he guessed was an m probably chopping down a pla soldier whod felt trapped on hearing tunnel rats coming for him from two directions at once at the end of the s turn freeman came adjacent to an alcove about four feet deep four feet high and six feet long containing two bunk beds of bamboo and set into a small recess an oil wick candle beneath the bottom bunk were several dozen plastic hoops known to the americans as beijing hoops when twigs and leaves were attached to the plastic rings a soldier wearing them could turn his head degrees without the camouflage moving at the end of the bottom bunk was a small first aid kit freeman knew that whether your enemy had morphine was one way to tell how wellequipped he was but to find out that bit of intelligence would have meant opening the box which he didnt do seeing a deep shadow off to his left about three feet away he determined it was another alcove and made his way toward it its three walls contained rolls of curtainlike muslin that could be unrolled to form cloth walls insects couldnt penetrate in the middle of the alcove taking up about half its length was a bamboo operating table with various instruments laid out including forceps suturing needles scalpels and clamps there was a large light overhead its socket set into the earthen ceiling the wire leading from it went across the roof of the tunnel to a smaller alcove no more than two feet deep five feet long and five high where freeman found an old flying pigeon bicycle on rollers when pedaled the turning wheels would produce electricity to light the small operating theater seeing a cone of light ahead of him at right angles the beam moving farther to his left freeman released the safety on his lay flat and held the revolver in two hands the beam went out its images still dancing on freemans right retina the general from experience having kept one eye closed he opened it now shutting the right eye delta two he called lima came the correct response from one allied tunneler to another freeman could hear his own sigh of relief nothing is better than hearing a friendly voice down one of those godforsaken gopher holes hed once told bob cline he switched his flashlight on then off the other tunnel rat did the same freeman could see he was approaching a t section with the other soldier about to cross it though becoming more claustrophobic by the minute he whispered ill take it son you head back make sure you let our boys know its you coming out dont worry the soldier whispered i will freeman patted the youngster then crawled cautiously across the junction to cross the t and follow the tunnel to its end and in so doing added to his legend to the mystique of those commanders before and since caesar whose men knew they would never be asked to do something by their commander that he would not be prepared to do himself when freeman crossed the t and was alone again in the enemys subterranean world an involuntary shiver passed through his body he felt the claustrophobia worsening the everpresent danger of suffocation so heavy upon him that he had to fight not to throw up combined with his own body stench he smelled the damp mold of the tunnels themselves and felt an overwhelming urge to go as fast as hell and get out but speed he knew was as sure a killer as a hidden grenade or trip wire carefully does it he told himself and when he moved forward felt the rush of gut acid up his esophagus and cursed himself for not bringing antacid pills next to his and knife a tunnelers best friend he felt ahead with the base of the flashlight in his right hand careful of any traps the ground was holding now he gave it the full weight of his right hand as he moved forward with his left suddenly the ground went from under his left hand his body driving it down hard on the punji sticks it was the first time anyone had ever said theyd heard freeman scream two punji sticks each tipped with excrement had penetrated his left hand simultaneously he saw a shadow flitting ahead left to right he challenged got no answer and fired two rounds that echoed eerily in the subterranean world freeman slumped for a moment then regained his composure enough to back up out of the tunnel his hand bleeding profusely chapter fifty it seemed as if the bus back to dalat had no springs it was certainly overloaded and despite a sign albeit a small one warning of fines for expectorating on the peoples buses ray baker could hear the loud guttural rumbles of spitters about to take aim through the openair windows some of the children in the back of the bus were yelling with glee as the vehicle bumped and rattled on its way to dalat it made ray baker nervous all the noise and the disease of saigon had spread to the north ghetto blasters blasting everything within earshot the sound amplified by the interior of the ramshackle bus he suddenly had a case of déjà vu a bright morning like this bodies pressing up hard against one another the smell of people jammed together engine fumes and dust kids squalling then screaming an american collapsing in the aisle eyes bulging falling flat on his face adults screaming reaching for their children to get them away from him the american facedown a knife protruding from his back no one helping him baker had been unable to reach him because of the stream of hysterical passengers pouring from the bus as it skidded to a stop several passengers climbing out the open side windows a stampede no one but him wanting to help the american no one wanting to get involved suddenly the flashback over he turned around a baby saw his face from less than a foot away and began screaming there were only other children and harried parents trying to maintain some sense of order while balancing the various fruits vegetables and village wares they were taking to dalat it was then that he saw the boy from yesterday running by the bus sending out a long crimson stream of betel juice and waving happily to him oh yes baker said smiling maliciously at him i want to see you too you little bastard it was the boy who must have fingered him or at least suckered him away to the market while they did over his room whoever they were when baker got out of the bus the boy was nowhere to be seen then on his way back to the hotel he saw the boy nonchalantly coming toward him not even pausing as he spat the next stream of betelnut juice onto the dusty street baker wanted to ask the youth a pile of questions but all that came out was hi in response to the boys greeting only then did baker ask who are you friend bac baker friend of americans okay true the kid had indirectly got him the info about a couple of mias but how about the woman and the lemon baker confronted the boy wasnt that just a dead end to allow whoever was paying him time to ransack his hotel room the boy didnt understand ransack but thought he understood after baker had given him another dollar i dont know who did this he said to believe him or not baker wondered he asked the boy who had hired him this morning or did he just happen to rum up at the bus stop at that particular time the boy was astounded by the question whether something had been lost in the translation or not baker didnt understand but in any event the boy said same man yesterday today same man bac baker yeah all right but who the boy shook his head i tell you that no more money bad for me okay you understand bac baker yeah yeah so are you going to tell me why youre here at the market right now the boy spat a long crimson stream at a bug crawling on the sidewalk missed and told baker he say to tell you salt and pepper be back baker felt a surge of exhilaration with an overlay of panic salt and pepper will be back no be back you mean they are back yeah sure thats what i tell you okay okay baker said he suspected the warning as well as the initial contact made with the note came from the villagers son saigon tell whoever hired you thanks sure okay baker gave him another ten thousand dong the boy snapped the bill and smiled showing his brownstained teeth as baker walked across the pedestrian overpass from the mai building on a deliberate roundabout route to his hotel he told himself to calm right down as his mom used to tell him just calm right down dont get so excited all worked up yes it looked like the first solid info on mias hed had in years but it might be bullshit too people everywhere wanted to make a buck and would tell you anything right but then how about the hotel room all messed up and the damn snake in the village all right buddy boy calm down call saigon not the guy ho chi minh city tell them what you have the people youve seen and so on he dialed then moved his body so that ha ha the good friend of the police permit department on shift again behind the counter couldnt tell the number he was dialing in old saigon united states legation how may i help you jean its ray baker here got some info on mias shoot i hope not he joked aware of the in his coat pocket what jean asked nothing listen i might be a bit softspoken and oblique here but try to follow me all right roger two mias no evidence only verbal but a bit of monkey business with yours truly a lot of business ray not so far but definitely business you want us to extend your personal liability coverage let me see hmm could you do that by tonight might be difficult ray were sort of busy up north yeah of course ah dont worry about it ive got enough coverage for tonight you sure i could always try our hanoi rep nah ill be fine i might even grab a flight down tonight i can tell you now theyre full a lot of civil officials transferring south okay ill book tomorrow ill be fine friends coming around anyway you sure positive one more thing jean theres been a complaint same two mias ran with the opposition now info is theyre guides for that movie the killing fields theyre apparently doing a remake in their own studio jean asked right on the ball nah baker replied apparently they want to use the oppositions oh so is that all no theyre known as salt and pepper oh one black one white thats all for now see you tomorrow night you sure about the extra liability coverage yeah bye yeah sure he was sure about extra liability coverage like hell he was but what did it sound like to jean scaredycat look the was in his pocket what the hell anyway thered be enough damn beetles on the floor youd hear anyone tiptoeing in besides hed crush up newspapers and throw them about theyd make a hell of a rustle if someone tried to sneak in and hed use the dead bolt sit with the in his lap on the toilet too no way hed take a shower or bath after he walked up and put the key in the door he took a couple of steps to the side so he was braced against the wall and pushed the door open with his toe a few dead roaches a couple of them live but stumbling everything looked normal he did a check on the chest of drawers having put a hair where the second drawer closed on the first before hed gone to the village the hair was still there he went into the bathroom and washed his face surprised by how dark the bags under his eyes were he put a finger under each eye and pulled out to the sides it took at least ten years off him was he vain enough to get a facelift he had always wondered why people bothered but now in his early fifties he had a different perspective on it he was starting to go bald not a lot but he could tell the difference jean was going bald too and right now she was his best chance for a relationship after a shave a meal of cha cacharcoalbroiled fish fillets with roasted nuts salad noodles and fish sauce washed down by a bottle of tsing tao beer the chinese were being a real pain in the ass but they sure as hell could make beer he felt a lot better the dangers hed imagined during the day now seemed grossly overblown and he contemplated the difference a good meal could make to ones disposition he ordered coffee and started worrying about how much hed already gotten through to jean in his semiplain language code he decided to book out on the earliest flight available the next day at noon in his room coat off in his undershirt and trousers baker sat up on the bed as if on a desert island ready to indulge one of his sins and lit up a camel nofilter sucking the smoke in so he could feel it deep in his chest and see it flowing lethargically out in curlicue patterns then watching it slowly dissipate above the land of the roaches and if any creeps came through the door or from the side veranda he would pump the bastards so full of lead that in the words of james cagney when they fell theyd write later the night clerk said that the beer had probably made him sleepy whatever it was that put him temporarily off guard by the time ray baker got off one shot his throat was cut blood bubbling from the carotid artery his attacker having slid up from behind coming out from under the bed he was dead inside a minute chapter fiftyone the mash unit had to be especially cautious when attending to freemans wounds not because he was a general but because his medic alert disk showed he was allergic to certain antibiotics when they got his wound cleansed and his hand bandaged up they put his arm in a sling which he immediately dispensed with he walked back to the armored personnel carrier he was using as a mobile hq which along with an armored cavalry unit had made its way north along the phu lang thuong road then been airlifted into the westeast valley between ban re and loc binh freeman was worried about the fading light soon it would be dark and the chinese still in the tunnels would be able to exit within the usvun area and create havoc freeman and vinh knew that if this occurred there were bound to be many more blue on blue incidents but to withdraw from the hillside would simply mean giving up the territory the high ground that the usvun had fought so hard for all afternoon and going back to the fields from which theyd started freeman like patton said he never liked paying for the same real estate twice and elected to hold the high ground vinh however cautioned that it was possible the chinese might simply elect to retreat through the tunnel system on this side of the southern slope of the ridge to the ridges northern side freeman readily acknowledged the possibility at least if the chinese did slip out of the battle he wouldnt have to worry so much about blue on blue but he would be faced with the prospect of more than five thousand pla troops slipping north across the border troops which like those who slipped across the yalu river in korea could not be pursued by his airborne cav units because of the political decision in washington and hanoi that usvun forces could not cross the vietnamesechinese border which was only a mile and a half north of the ridge vinh suggested through the interpreter that perhaps there might be a way of the usvun having cakes and consuming them he meant having your cake and eating it vinh said that if tacair attacks from the carrier uss enterprise could keep up a steady bombing of the northern side of the ridge bottling chinese up in the vast underground tunnel system that traversed the ridge then at least they couldnt exit so they cant crawl out and head north freeman asked yes vinh said then tomorrow we smoke out the tunnels through the camouflaged entrances and exits we found on the southern side today now freeman saw the extent of the vietnamese generals strategy bottle their northern escape route overnight by ceaselessly bombing the northern side of the ridge and in daylight man all entrances and exits you could find and smoke them out with white phosphorus if necessary freeman ruled out white phosphorus but not purely on humanitarian grounds after all the usvun forces and the chinese were already using white phosphorus grenades but a regular grenade was one thing a phosphorus grenade was something else you couldnt pump white phosphorus down into a tunnel system when you werent sure where the hell it was going to come up if it got on your own mens skin you might kill more usvun troops than those of the enemy very well vinh concluded we will use purple smoke blow that down and wherever it comes up well seal unless they agree to surrender what if they decide to backtrack freeman asked i mean what if wang decides to come back through the tunnels to the fields behind us why go back to old ground you have lost to try and escape south freeman answered we dont know how far south the tunnels go do we besides they have two battalions at least from their fourteenth chengdu army down there in disney world around a thousand men infantry and some engineers why engineers cline put in because the bastards know how to dig damn it general vinh herell tell you hell his boys had over two hundred miles of tunnels in the chu chi system down south during nam and despite all our technology we couldnt rout them what makes you think we can do it here general because freeman hesitated he was proud of his second army and he was loath to take anything away from them because major the vietnamese have been at it a hell of a lot longer than we have and in the tunnels theyre better than we are he held up his bandaged hand capiche cline nodded all right but meanwhile wheres general wei vinh pointed at the map last intelligence reports say he is still proceeding down the lang sonlang ro road three miles to the west of us but our i mean the usvun heavy artillery is lined up along lang sonban re railroad and are pounding shits out of them freeman roared with laughter at the interpreters phrasing adding by god general i hope youre right we dont want our left flank penetrated no that night the ridge became known as disney hill not only to the men of freemans second army and the usvun forces but by the pilots of the fighters and bombers preparing to take off from the enterprise even now before the sun went down the great carrier was at the center of the battle group along with other ships submarines and combat air patrols included pledged to the protection of the carrier as she turned slowly into the wind of the gulf of tonkin her catapults already bleeding steam she was ready to thrust her warplanes aloft the aircraft a careful mix of ae intruders f tomcats and f hornet fighterbombers loaded with everything from twothousandpound bombs and sparrow airtoair missiles to fuel air explosive bombs there were no laserguided bombs on this mission for while the north side and not the south side of disney hill was to be hit it would not be pinpoint bombing that was required to either kill or trap the chinese in the southside tunnels it would be power bombing brute poundage this was to be excavation by high explosive already in primary flight control the handler priflys second in command whose job was so complicated and manyfaceted that it often could not be computerized watched his models of the aircraft on his gridcrossed table nowhere is war as complicated as on the flight deck of a carrier when men and machines move in a rough ballet of hand signals amid a forest of constantly moving differentcolored jerseys two of these gunners mates albright stevens and elizabeth franks a grape who in her purple jacket was helping to fuel one of the f hornets with jp gasoline had been lovers ever since hed taken her to the movie at the beginning of the voyage both of them had since found time together in some of the hundreds of nooks and crannies aboard the huge ship which as well as launching planes in any weather had to feed and minister to over five thousand crew members lucky we aint on a sub albright had told her youd find a way shed said believe i would but that was then and now they were in the gulf of tonkin not a happy place in the annals of american history and around them they knew the pla navy was determined to somehow penetrate the carriers protective shield chapter fiftytwo hopes by general jorgensens hanoi hq that relief might come to freemans usvun troops through sabotage by proxy by having taiwanrun saboteurs hit chinas southern supply route on the ningmingdong dang railway began to fade as night fell upon the battle zone the vote in taiwans lifa yuan was close with several nonpartisan or independent members swinging the slim majority to the side of the democratic progressive party against the old ones the secondgeneration rightwing remnants of the old kuomintang party of chiang kaishek in one of the strangest ironies of politics the kuomintang on the far right agreed with the communist party on the far left that taiwan was still a province of china but here the agreement between left and right ended for while the kuomintang supported the usvun presence against the beijing regime the communist party was vehemently opposed the majority of votes swung to the left crucial independents afraid that any taiwanese support for the usvun would not only infuriate beijing but be the end of the understanding between beijing and taipei the understanding was a promise from beijing that in return for taipeis support for chinas south china sea claims beijing would split certain oil concessions in the northern part of the south china sea with fiftyone perrent de facto control for beijing fortynine percent for taiwan we cant wait douglas freeman said for the taiwanese chinese to make up their minds his hq staff were looking it the red pins that stood for pla positions on and around disney hill but our state department boys might be able to swing a few of the independents over to our side cline remarked then maybe the taiwanesell authorize some of their agents in china to blow the ningmingdong dang rail line huh freeman grunted dismissively his right fist punching the map of the southern chinavietnamese border area too many maybes mights and whatifs for my liking by the time those fairies in state get off their butts chinese reinforcementsll be trundling down from the ningming railhead in their goddamn thousands sir his nervous press aide interjected its not ah politically correct to refer to people as fairies and if you mean gays id advise you to modify modify to hell with political correctness wasnt talking about gays anyway long as they keep off one another and keep shooting at the enemy theyre as good as any other soldier the fairies in state im talking about are those dithering old farts who cant make a decision one desk jockey talks to another and thats all they dotalkuntil its too late to do anything he slammed his fist against the map again the ningmingdong dang road shuddering violently freeman paused but only to get air all right look heres what we do we send in a special forces squad to blow the shit out of the ningmingdong dang line and i dont mean just in one place i mean at least three breaks west of ningming proper then again at xiash and pingxiang theyll nave to mend the line in so many friggin places itll give em a nervous breakdown freeman turned to vinh you concur general vinh nodded and said something to his interpreter the general says this is a good idea but that chinese nerves are very good in they lost more than twentyfive thousand in just three weeks and still reinforcements came through this area well maybe so freeman answered i dont underestimate them for a second but chopping up their rail linell slow them down give us a chance to secure the border here why general vinh asked cannot the american carrier planes bombard the rail yards at ningming politics general freeman answered the white house categorically forbids any bombardment in china proper they dont want to risk the war spreading any further than it has already is that the us decision or the un mandate inquired vinhs political officer does it matter freeman asked them whoevers mandate it is id get fired if i authorized beyond the border bombing only thing were allowed to do is send out patrols when our positions on this side of the border line are threatened the political officer looked nonplussed but the planes from your carrier they are allowed to bomb the northern side of the hill it is very close to the border yes freeman said but our flyboysll be able to drop their ordnance just where we want it and what if some bombs land beyond the border cline held up his hands one or two wont start an international crisis exactly freeman concurred vinh had such a determination about him that freeman in private was starting to refer to him as the bulldog what will happen if your special forces are discovered sabotaging the ningmingdong dang line that would be considered by your white house and the un as in china surely our special forces wont be caught freeman reassured him usvun teams ill send in will be made up of crack american and british commandos special air service from britain delta force from us theyll go in noe choppers nap of the earth flying itll be drop in set charges and get out low and fast general vinh nodded and what about this he momentarily forgot the english phrase he wanted the interpreter listened to vinh intently conferred with their political officer and when there was agreement told freeman these condiments salt and pepper number two freeman looked blankly at cline who looked just as blankly at boyd the press officer condiments freeman repeated salt and pepper boyd interjected suddenly condiments they mean salt and pepper the two mias that report that came to us from our legation in saigon i mean in ho chi minh city about the two american deserters one white one black yes yes the interpreter said but this name salt and pepper is taken from long ago when there were two other americans who came over to our side this is why we call these ones salt and pepper number two call them bastards freeman said infuriated by the possibility no the certainty of americans who had crossed over they must be damn near old men by now i mean if they went over during nam general vinh began to talk but his voice was drowned out by the sonic booms of the planes from the northern side of disney hill vinh raised his voice what will you do about them if this report is correct about them leading the khmer rouge up from cambodia to attack us on our western flank before freeman could reply vinh went on the chinese would be very happy about this two americans fighting against the usvun the political officer was nodding vigorously this topic was obviously of far more importance to him than the immediately pressing military situation on disney he spoke rapidly and passionately to the interpreter who explained the political officers position to freeman and his staff hanoi is very concerned about the khmer rouge infiltration across the cambodianvietnamese border while we are fighting here in the far north of our country freeman was also concerned about a war on two fronts but hed also seen photos of the khmer rouges tortured victims piled high at tuol sleng extermination center he had once told the reporter marte price that if anything like the mass murder at tuol sleng had happened to a white population there would have been un action almost immediately the khmer rouge are the scum of the earth freeman had told her bitterly and if id had my way i would have turned khmer rouge staging areas into a parking lot but of course politics you see that would have offended their great ally china general freeman vinh said his expression of bland noncommitment now replaced with the look of an old warrior who as hard as hed fought against the americans in nam had never hated a foe as much as he did the khmer rouge yet as he talked to freeman at times using the interpreter he was putting this hatred aside it was not hatred that led him to uncharacteristically plead with his american counterpart but military prudence if the khmer rouge are not stopped crossing over into vietnam all kinds of insurgents from cambodia and laos will be encouraged to start yet another war against the new vietnam which will quickly demand more usvun intervention freeman knew vinh was right it was like one of the old oil change ads for your automobile a case of pay me now or pay me later the inference being that later would be one heck of a lot more expensive in lives and materiel either freeman stopped them now or at least made a determined thrust into the laotian staging areas as an unmistakable sign of the usvuns commitment to stopping the insurgency or he would pay heavily later you major cline began then changed it to we cant make that decision general cline had said general in such a way that it was impossible for either vinh or freeman to know whom he was addressing in fact he was talking to both but was being careful trying not to offend either one general jorgensen cline continued is the only one who can authorize such a move out of our immediate sector cline paused and looked at vinhs political officer in fact as far as i recall jorgensen would have to confer with the joint chiefs and the white house for permission to find two of our mias freeman interjected another idea already forming on how to bypass the joint chiefs american people wont stand for any delay on that score major over two thousand pows and mias still missing you think the american people are going to stand still for one minute if we know where our boys are and we say oh wait until were finished with the chinese hell they wont put up with that for a second general were talking about two guys who went over for what reason freeman snapped those khmer bastards could be holding dozens of our boys before cline could answer freemans voice had taken on a terrible urgency by god major these two youre talking about may have been forced to run with those bastards for all we know an old story right you dont help us well kill your buddies but cline stammered you dont know that sir with all due respect with all due respect major you dont know the truth of it either freeman looked at vinh matter of fact quite a few volunteers in your army were more or less there because of families or friends held hostage the political officer quickly responded this was a political necessity at the time oh freeman said i see so thats what it was cline obviously didnt like the turn the conversation was taking perhaps youre both right he put in i mean i see why its militarily important to send a strong message to the khmer rouge some of our mias involved or not all im saying gentlemen is that were going to have to go through jorgensen and the president jesus christ major freeman said havent you been listening to what ive been saying if those fairies in state and the pentagon get hold of this theyll take forever meanwhile we could be taking body blows from the rouge then what do you suggest general there was a pause as freeman looked at vinh and then cline leave it to me meanwhile i want you to make sure our boys stay on the southern side of disney dont want them getting pulverized by our own tacair yes sir and remember no one moves forward till everybody stays down till dawn then well smoke out those who havent been blown out yes sir freeman turned to his press officer boyd sink that coffee youve got and come with me outside the darkness seemed to be vibrating as f tomcats and fs flew in low dropping their loads amid curtains of red and white tracer crisscrossing the sky the aa tracer was coming from those chinese who had made it through the tunnel system from the southern side of the hill to the northern slope of disney hill only to find their exits blocked by the bombing even so several of them managed to hastily man what triple a they had managed to hide in the northern complex meanwhile those vietnamese regulars and the american forces nearest the hills summit began walking their mortars across the plas triple a positions at a nice easy murderous fire of ten to fifteen twelvepound mm shells a minute to an outsider the fact that the americans were using mm rounds instead of their standard mm rounds might have seemed inconsequential but freemans decision indeed his insistence that all us frontline units from second army in the usvun line trade their standardissue mm mortars for north vietnamese army mm mortars proved to be a brilliant tactical move freeman had always been a keen student of past battles and benjamin franklin how for the want of a nail the horse wasnt shod and for the want of a horse the battle was lost he had also remembered the lessons of korea and of nam when with american gis running out of their heavy mm mortar rounds they overran enemy positions to discover piles of unused mortar shells but shells that were useless to them because that extra mm diameter of russian vietnamese and chinese mm rounds would not fit into the us mm barrel now the mortar positions the usvun forces had managed to capture or overrun on their way up from the rice paddies to the southern slope of disney hill provided the americans with lots of extra helpyourself mortar rounds courtesy of general wangs retreating units as douglas freeman set out back down the hill with boyd giving him a running commentary on what they must tell the media pack which had now exploded in size due to jorgensens come one and all nothing to hide policy the press officer suddenly fell in the darkness freeman crossing over so he could use his right arm rather than his bandaged left to help heard boyd moaning and cussing unusual for the press officer as freeman reached down to help him up he felt a sodden metallicsmelling warmth with the consistency of a firm sponge the brains pulse like a thing breathing not yet ended freeman kept moving hearing bullets cracking past him as he crouched low wondering why in hell the usvuns bandages were all white instead of khaki boyds death told him something else something he didnt like at all that some pla sons of bitches were still in the tunnels on this the southern usvun side of the hill not only were they there but they had the balls not to sit quiet but pop up god knows where and were conducting sniper attacks using the momentary but brilliant light of white phosphorus and fuel air explosive against which to silhouette their usvun targets when he reached the rear must area medical unit selfcontained and transportable where several reporters were stationed most wanting to go up forward freeman immediately reported that boyd had been killed im sorry said marte price who was in the must her flesh wound well on the mend freeman said nothing sitting down on a box near the musts long snaking hoses that led from the refrigeratorsized gas turbine unit unraveling his bandaged hand now soaked in blood the wound having opened up as hed run down the hill his adrenaline pumping look he told marte as a medical corpsman came toward him youve been in the thick of it on the road up to lang son you deserve a break the corpsman took a pair of l scissors and cut the dressing from freemans wrist to his fingertips youve got this dirty again general sir ill have to all right freeman said do what you have to but if you repeat what youre going to hear now ill have your hide got it yes sir right the general waited for ten seconds or so to catch his breath then told marte price that it had been reported there were american mias whod been sighted in the south she said nothing she knew that there were still over two thousand mias unaccounted for she took her notepad out rumor is freeman told her that theyre yellerbellies crossed over betrayed their country for preferential treatment marte price remembered reading about korea where dozens had gone over to the chinese so many that the government ordered an official inquiry how many she asked him i dont know two kingpins we know about and we want to get but weve got a problem jorgensen whys he a problem you obviously dont know dangerous dean jorgensen hes a nice guy but not too much in his top story career man a yesman pentagon sent him to hanoi ghq because hell do whatever washington tells him no matter how stupid it may be in the field he wont rock the boat freeman paused for a moment i should tell him we have to go get these jokers make an example of them theyre supposedly helping the khmer rouge trail finders on the cambodian border which means they were probably special forces if they know the areas trails that well might have been with the montagnards hill people before they crossed over i dont know but if we let em lead those murdering khmer bastards to hit our left flank out of laos well neither vinh nor i want a twofront war but if we stop them now before christ the corpsman was dousing the punji stick wounds with iodine go on freeman told him then turned back to marte price he could tell in the spill of light from the must hospital that she was excited by the story her bosom rising and falling fast in the sweatdrenched khaki he felt himself getting aroused how many do you think there are general i mean mias he grimaced as the iodine seeped deeper into the wounds i honestly dont know two two hundred who knows for sure but we have a definite sighting a guy liaison officer from ho chi minh city apparently picked up their trail in a place called dalat hill country a ways south of here general marte said i appreciate the scoop itd get me on cnn but im not some hick in from the sticks youre using me to bypass jorgensen and washington am i the corpsman was putting a new bandage on you bet your sweet ass you are thats no way to talk its what you understand freeman exhaled heavily all right but its no game marte it was the first time hed called her by her first name and she didnt need to make a note of it if we can get the green light he said to send a recon party to say the laotianvietnamese border we could kill two birds with one stone marte saw where he was going a chance to actually find two mias while serving notice to the khmer rouge to stay in their own backyard she also saw herself in her minds eye on the larry king show via special hookup with hanoi just one mia found would be one hell of a story amid the present inconclusive seesaw battle between the pla and usvun all right she said ill run it if the networks okay it if pull the other one marte mias found would be the biggest story since the oklahoma bombing think so i know so and if you get the public demanding immediate action our reconnaissance down therell send a strong message to beijing and the khmer will hopefully stop a second front or at least prevent a fifth column from attacking us on our left flank one thing i dont get general whats in it for the khmer rouge whats always in it for those psychos more killing power those guys are on another planet thanks she said quietly hows the hand itll be fine if i were you id bounce your story from an unnamed source off the satellite right now she started walking away and he caught a glimpse of her derriere in a residual stutter of flare light he felt as hard as a rock she stopped walked back to him and spoke softly is a dawn attack still on he was hugely disappointed for as shed turned to come back he would have sworn it was going to be to utter some term of endearment yes he answered its on you think youll be able to push them back all the way down the north slope piece of cake he said and gave her a smile she couldnt see in the dark as she left he berated himself for such an adolescent moment but damn it he hadnt had a woman for he couldnt remember and probably neither had young boyd it was ever a mystery why some men got hit and others didnt freeman had never believed it had anything to do with god it was a matter of pure luck and something he called survival knowhow which had to do with knowing what to do in the absence of luck chapter fiftythree as jae chong staggered out of the karaoke club into tokyos ginza district the forest of neons became a blur of light the cold night air that made his nose run doing nothing to sober him up as he made his way smiling through the crowds which dutifully ignored him ironically it was the fact that he was drunk that allowed him to go unnoticed as japanese in general while disapproving were used to the outflow of drunks in the allbutmandatory swill that upandcoming young male executives took part in with their bosses after the working day chong though he knew perfectly well he was drunk and had difficulty even reaching in his pocket for tissues felt invulnerable if any japanese dare fix him with a disapproving stare he was ready to stare back and stare them down to hell with the lot of them they had never conceded that the second world war was their doing in the pacific all their revisionist historians busy writing tracts about how japan was a victim what they did in korea was unspeakable they deserved the atom bomb and now the americans were their friends well sort of damn them all the japanese and the americans and a policeman approached him but chongs air of confidence stayed with him there being no discernible difference in his pace or manner the policeman pointed at the pavement behind chong you dropped your keys what chong said usually when they saw koreans they wanted to see id oh chong said thank you and he bowed before he bent down to retrieve the keys and two or three tissues that hed dropped wondering as he did so how it was that facial tissues always ended up in tight little balls in your pocket and knowing instinctively that the cop was going to recognize him before they got much farther apart the air of confidence hed had evaporated suddenly and he turned right into the first alley he saw and ran down the dimly lit canyon he turned right once more stopping slamming himself back hard against a cold brick wall panting fighting hard to slow down his heart which was banging inside his chest so loudly he was afraid someone would hear it it was only a second later that chong heard the whistle and the cop running but would the cop turn into his illlit alley or into the one on the left he could hear the policeman stopping momentarily could hear him breathing or was it his own breath then the cop started running again chong saw the policemans shadow the moment he turned right he leapt forward then and stuck the knife in the cops heart he wrenched it out the policeman sliding down his eyes bulging his left hand clawing in the dimlit air his right trying futilely to grab the brick wall chong stabbed him again leaving the knife embedded deeply in his chest chong was half running half walking attempting to slow down his excitement plunging the blade into one of his persecutors had been one of the most satisfying things hed done in a long time but with it came fear too gobbling up his earlier confidence and he was afraid that when he hit the stream of pedestrians and latenight shoppers he would have that hunted look that hunters so easily spot relax he told himself breathe the air deep into your stomach thats it no dont force a smile or even a grin try to adopt that slouched anonymous expressionless look meld into the crowd now he had two phone calls to make to confirm a rumor he had heard from the third agent in his political cell the second agent having been tazuko komura who had been killed along with all her other victims on the bullet train the rumor hed heard concerned the loading of supplies aboard the us hospital ship the ss tampaspecifically blood supply it was a common enough guide to impending war for a countrys intelligence community especially nato and the warsaw pact to keep tabs on such things as the movements of vips in departments of defense and associated industries and on the present state of blood supplies any sudden increase of plasma and blood supplies a sign that hostilities were about to take place in the case of the ss tampa it was only natural that blood supplies would have been maximized before she had set sail for the south china sea to serve as usvuns hospital but chong had wanted more telling information though hed intended to make the two calls in the morning after he had sobered up the fright of his knowing that the death of the policeman in addition to the jdf agents and the american he had killed would be sparking the biggest manhunt in tokyos history quickly persuaded him to risk using a public phone booth to make the confirmation calls under the guise of being a furnace salesman the first number rang until the message machine came on chong hung up watching the reflections in the perspex bubble of the phone booth when he dialed the second number one of the mans children answered no her father wasnt at home could she take a message no thank you chong replied and hung up conscious of two things simultaneously that he was starting to get a pounding headache and that someone was standing behind him he whirled about only to frighten a teenage schoolgirl who stepped back a few paces and stared at him he mumbled an apology and walked off joining the crowd where he became aware of people now looking at him glancing down at his trousers holding his aching head his gaze followed theirs and he saw a long streak of blood from his crotch to the knee of his right trouser leg shit he groaned and kept his eyes open for a drugstore there he took a plastic shopping bag to try to hide the blood bought a package of acetaminophen gel capsules and went over to the stores fridge for a guava juice the druggist had a good look at him and when chong left the store rang the police the censors in general jorgensens hq in hanoi knew they couldnt stop the story of the mias getting out but they tried under jorgensens instructions in the interests of security by which jorgensen meant in the interests of the pentagon mia and pow office to limit the damage jorgensen insisted that from cnn center in atlanta the satellite feed sped all over the world to millions of viewers would consist of a twopart story first that turncoat american mias from the vietnam war had reportedly been sighted in vietnams central highlands second that a column of fifty to one hundred khmer rouge had reportedly crossed the vietnameselaotian border in this way jorgensen hoped that in the viewers mind the renegade mia story would be connected with the khmer rouge so that any public demand to have the mias found would not automatically become a call to commit us forces to fighting the khmer rouge with whom the pentagon had no intention of closing but jorgensen had been too clever by half as american viewers coast to coast were jamming washingtons and cnns fax lines clamoring for the return of the mias immediately because if they had been turncoats in nam werent they now allies with the us against china the spirit of forgiveness was across the land and the call was bring em home it didnt occur to anyone except freeman marte price and a few others on the spot that salt and pepper two might not want to go home but freeman didnt care in a roundabout and unpredictable way marte prices report had done what freeman had hoped for it galvanized us public opinion to send in us troops if necessary to bring out those two mias and the others the vietnamese would now be hopefully willing to release if they wanted to count on continued usvun assistance in repelling the chinese invasion freeman immediately requested and received albeit reluctantly permission from jorgensen to send in an mia reconnaissance force but jorgensen insisted that freeman change the name from operation eagle to operation homecoming i dont give a damn what its called freeman said on receiving jorgensens instruction itll be carried out by a special forces task force of about a hundred men assorted usvun commandos chosen mainly from the us delta british sas and the british gurkha regiment i thought youd only need ten men jorgensen countered on the secure phone the explosions of us tacair from the carrier and chinese triple a in the background making it difficult for freeman to hear the commander jorgensen waited for a lull in the bombing there was none and so he shouted again asking why freeman was sending in so many men we might accidentally bump into the khmer rouge freeman answered now douglas you listen to me this is purely a recon patrol to find out about those two mias exactly freeman yelled not bothering to duck as enemy mortar rounds exploded in the trees around the must tent its a reconnaissance in force before jorgensen could object freeman added im sure youll agree general we owe it to the folks back home to give it our best shot to rescue any mias be a feather in your cap general i dont care about feathers in my cap douglas course not sir suddenly the line was frying with static and it was several seconds before contact was reestablished and jorgensen made it clear that under no circumstances was his special forces group to engage the khmer rouge thats a political decision jorgensen said adding thats washingtons call of course freeman said and they signed off amicably enough whats up cline inquired im sending a force west were gonna kick ass major you heard what general jorgensen said sir it was a bad line freeman replied witnesses cline said our boysd have no option if they were attacked cline paused and from habit looked about for the press aide if young boyd was here general i think hed point out young boyd was a good officer major so are you but youve got to remember youre in the field here weve got a chance to teach those khmer rouge bastards a lesson leave it up to the politicos and theyd wine and dine the sons of bitches its possible we could rescue some mias freeman looked exasperated like george c scott with a cigar between his teeth what the hells the matter with you major some miasyou know as well as i do that by now most of those mias are long dead and buried or went nuts paddled off upriver and shot emselves sides the only damn mias im interested in right now are those two shitbags running with the khmer rouge by god id like to meet those two gentlemen we couldnt allow them cline began i mean our reconnaissance force to cross over the vietnamese border into laos who said anything about crossing over into laos with a cigar in his mouth freeman gave cline the impression that he was grinning chapter fiftyfour marte price had not yet returned from hanoi to second armys rear hq in phu lang thuong even so pierre lasalle knew he had to hurry if he was to find the photo of freeman shooting one of his wounded men there was no doubt in lasalles mind that such a photograph existed there were simply too many rumors for it to be untrue and lasalle didnt know a photographer in the world who wouldnt keep such a shot hed had a duplicate key made from the one he borrowed from her purse in the aftermath of their lovemaking and now he had it in the lock of the gray metal asbestoslined box in another second he had the lid open and was rifling through its contents several ninebytwelve brown envelopes filled with blowups and negatives each print marked and numbered according to what roll of film it belonged to even so lasalle could tell at once that there were considerably fewer photos printed than there were negatives merde it would take him hours to examine every negative there were hundreds of them like most professionals shed taken dozens of shots in an effort to capture a story she wanted to file he was avidly searching through the box for some kind of master index but could find none only a sharp electronic organizer notebook excitedly he pressed the on button but couldnt access it as it was asking for a password merde the frenchman heard a noise outside a hummer coming to a stop then voices hers among them thanking someone for the ride anytime maam anytime quickly lasalles hands shoveled the contents of the gray box back in closed the lid took out the key and sat on her bed grabbing a magazine from a small pile she had by the bed what the pierre at last he said rising from the bed taking her hand and gallantly kissing it i thought youd never come so how was hanoi what are you doing here she asked still in a mild state of shock he straightened up and looked at her with a surprised quizzical gaze waiting for you of course i hope you dont mind it was raining earlier on so i let myself in he was still holding her hand you look positively ravishing she took off the vietnamesestyle cap and shook her hair loose raining oh he said just a little but i have an aversion to rain he paused took a step back and gazed at her with mock concern oh dear you are angry with me for letting myself in what oh no not really she said just surprised i guess pleasantly i hope he said a grin passing into a wide smile she visibly relaxed and threw her cap over onto the bed i didnt know youre a fan of cosmo what oh the magazine he winked at her i only look at the pictures hmmm she said smiling i suppose youre too sophisticated to read the love advice he glanced down at the pouting beauty dressed in a tight gold lame dress and read aloud how to keep your man once youve landed him lasalle shrugged i dont need advice oh she answered playfully really really but thats easy to say perhaps we had better put me to the test yes hmmm maybe she responded i dont mean to be unkind but maybe you should give me time to shower im perspiring like a she hesitated go on he said like a what she sat down on the bed shucked off her armyissue walking shoes and began massaging her foot lets just say im sweating okay okay i love it what perspiration in a woman yes how do you say it it turns me on youre sick for love yes be a sweetie and come back later i really am dog tired dog tired he approved of the phrase but wasnt quite sure why it involved a dog oh gimme a break she said let me shower and rest for a while ill see you tomorrow tonight tomorrow i am he thought hard for a moment devastated youll live she said and changed the subject how are things on disney lasalle gave a gallic shrug his bottom lip saying it all who knows they are bombing the turd out of the shit she corrected him playfully the what theyre bombing the shit out of the chinese no out of the northern side of the hill to keep the chinese in their tunnels till morning jorgensen is sure the chinese will have had enough by dawn that they will surrender in droves freeman he shrugged again hes not so sure the ones not damaged by the bombing might come out fighting marte yawned so can you give me a lift up there tomorrow of course but we wont be allowed close to disney she winked at him i have ways i know lasalle replied ah she said in mock disgust dont you guys think of anything but sex la guerre and sex he proclaimed spreading his hands in the air what else is there chérie when he left marte began to undress sniffing at her underwear to see if it would last another day unwashed and looking down at her khaki pants shed been walking through fairly tall elephant grass yet there were no water stains on the pants it must have been a short shower of rain pierre had sought refuge from or maybe he thought that being there ready for her shed fall into his arms he was a little conceited in that way werent most frenchmen thinking they were the best lovers of course she admitted to herself pierre was no slouch hell neither was she and that bit about him saying he liked women perspiring was disgusting and deliriously naughty chapter fiftyfive jae chong sought refuge in a fourmovietheater complex off the ginza strip and in the flickering darkness he had time to think the difficulty would now be how to get out and make his way home let alone make the two calls about the blood supply shipment he tried to remember whether there was a phone in the lobby but he couldnt recall hed been moving too fast for the clerk in the box office to look down and see the bloodstains on his pants inside the theater the smell of the fake leather seats triggered a smell memory in him and momentarily he was back during his first meet with the other two agents in his cell eleven years before tazuko komura was just fifteen then and chong recalled that the last time hed seen her only a few days before she blew up the tokyoniigata express her eyes were those of an old woman weary and frightened that the next knock on the door or the person behind you was from japans counterespionage service chong had thought then that she wouldnt risk leaving her bag any piece of unaccompanied luggage would immediately raise suspicion inviting the conductors to inspect it no hed known then that shed stay with the bomb till the end and thats what hed do too only a crazy would think he had a chance now that every cop in the tokyo prefecture would be looking for him maybe there was a phone in the rest room the movie which he hadnt been following now moved from a vast field of corn and blue sky into a dark passage he eased out of his seat then and made his way out toward the mens room passing several teenagers and an elderly couple sitting down in the lobby waiting for the next show in the adjoining theater to start none of them took any notice of him there was no phone another man entered in his late sixties or early seventies suit and tie and stood at the urinal two down from him trying to hit the piece of camphor ice with his stream hed do nicely chong thought noting that the man was alone and about his size the man had a paunch but better too large than too small chong waited until the man was behind him then struck out with his elbow slamming him against one of the cubicle doors chongs right foot followed smashing the man on the right side of his face the force of the kick driving him straight into the cubicle chong went right in after him stamping on the flush ball set into the floor causing the toilet to roar as the old man began to push himself back from the cistern chong hit him with a left the man fell again knocking himself out on the edge of the toilet chong heard the washroom door open he stepped out of the cubicle kicked the kid he saw in the groin and smashed his right fist against the boys temple knocking him unconscious then chong returned to the cubicle pulled off the old mans jacket and pants put them in his plastic drugstore bag and walked out a teenager a boy was approaching the washroom i wouldnt go in there chong said drunks been sick all over the kid frowning in consternation nodded and backed off not quite sure what to do chong disappeared back into the theater the damn cornfields were back again but he didnt mind the light helped him find a seat in an empty back row where he slipped off his trousers put on the old mans trousers and jacket and walked out it was only now that he felt the bump in the jackets left inside pocket he took it out and saw it was thick with hundredyen notes a small fortune to a worker like chong the irony was that there were no coins for a phone hed have to break one of the yen notes colonel melbaine still had alpha company on the top half of disney hills ridgeline waiting for the tacair bombardment to stop before they could sweep forward and force the remaining dugin chinese to come out or die in the tunnels i aint in no hurry dlupo told martinez neither am i doolittle added weve got a ringside seat mate besides far as im concerned they can bomb till hell freezes over just then they heard sporadic firing behind and below them thats a friggin ak down there dlupo opined turning his head to look a hundred yards or so down the slope now added to the explosions of the tacair bombs they could hear the distinctive popping of usvun ms followed by the boomp boomp boomp of mortar rounds taking off then the sound of a bugle fucking hell martinez said swinging his rifle from the top of the ridge pointing it downhill instead what the fucks that man a greenhorn called from the next group of foxholes on their left flank its a fucking chinese bugle man dlupo informed him that way they dont have to use no radio they aint got no fucking radio martinez said what the fucks going on came another voice then whether or not it was a wild guess or whether hed seen the outline of a pla soldier illuminated by the burst of his kalashnikov doolittle yelled chinese where the hell they come from man a black soldier asked from the fucking tunnels you dork mustve crept down past us man dlupo had already switched off his safety past us crap man theyre coming out of the tunnels at the base of the hill sos they come right up in the middle of the fucking battalion man and behind us a figure came running at them from the direction of the bottom of the hill dlupo fired and brought him down with the first shot no no no came a frantic screaming voice americans amer flares a platoon lieutenant from bravo yelled coming up on dlupos right he didnt want to illuminate his own troops but with one blue on blue already he had to chance it yelling out flare again so that all those in alpha bravo and charlie companies at the hills base could get their heads down andor freeze to deny the chinese any sign of movement dlupo saw at least four or five pla within a hundred feet of his nineman section added to the noise of the air bombs there was now a cacophony of machinegun bursts purple and white flashes of exploding grenades the firing of rifles and amid them the crash of mm mortars falling trees and bushes blown skyhigh the freshsmelling dirt from their roots coming down with other debris of stone and shattered wood on the helmets of the usvun troops most of whom were the americans from melbaines battalion in the dying and flickering gray of flare light martinez cut down two pla rushing his foxhole from the cover of low shrub while the american that dlupo had shot was being dragged by his buddy toward the foxholes of dlupos alpha company squad what the fuck you doing man the buddy yelled at dlupo oh man the soldier was crying with rage you dumb bastards you killed my buddy you shut up man the black soldier said reaching out toward the downed mans body the soldier released his buddy and let fly with a left that missed the black soldier causing the puncher to overbalance and fall the black soldier grabbed the mans collar listen to me man your buddy aint dead still a pulse man get a grip on yourself now git down and shut the fuck up medic he yelled man down abruptly he stopped shouting one of the shots crackling overhead had hit the wounded mans head exploding his brain over other members of the squad by the time the medic made it through the whistling shrapnel of a mortar round the crying soldiers buddy was dead martinez dragging the two bodies in front of him for extra cover martinez saw a chinese fifteen feet away coming at him with a kalashnikov lookalike a t on full automatic its bayonet catching flare light martinez and doolittle opened up an m tearing the air to the right of them and they saw the chinese soldiers body stop torso and legs lurching an arm separating the t crashing to earth martinez exhilarated by the kill heart thumping in fear cast a sideways glance at dlupo you all right lupe dlupo was throwing up martinez put his hand on his buddys shoulder fucking accident man we all thought it was charlie yeah doolittle chimed in whatre we sposed to do when the fuckers are amongst us ask for fucking id son of a bitch shoulda yelled at us fore he started running thats right martinez said gotta put it behind ya lupe but martinez knew that dlupo would never be able to put it behind him wish to christ it was me dlupo said his voice taut with anxiety aw rats martinez said listen ill tell the captain doolittle saw a shadow in flare light was it a tree or a wellcamouflaged gook or one of his own he fidgeted with his rifle holding his fire we dont have to tell anyone marty yeah we do martinez said yeah dlupo said his voice barely audible in the bedlam erupting all around them yeah we do dlupo was right not just about having to report his blue on blue but in having quickly assessed what had gone terribly wrong amid the usvun units on the long southern slope of disney hill the chinese instead of fleeing north of the ridge atop the hill or lying low until the tacair bombardment ceased had come back streaming through the tunnels like so many ants erupting out of exitcumentrances at the base of the southern slope and in the middle of the americans there were more us infantry killed by friendly fire in the predawn darkness than all those accidentally shot in the vietnam war the chinese showed no fear and no mercy taking full advantage of the fact that having burst forth from the tunnels sometimes only yards from an american position they were immune from the american artillery some miles south of the hill because of the wellknown american and usvun refusal to shell their own troops with dawn approaching and the end of the enterprises bombing runs just north of disney hill freemans forces were in sudden danger of catastrophe if the chinese came out of their tunnels on the northern side and counterattacked the americans and other usvun troops would then be caught in a crush movement between the chinese whod poured out of the southern sections of the tunnels and those who might still be alive under the bombed northern section major cline opined that he didnt see how anything could have survived the bombing on the north side freeman who had been in an optimistic mood after having seen off the special forces which were heading west on the mission to the laotianvietnamese border was now a man who knew second army and his career were a step this side of a military disaster if the chinese counterattacked from the northern side it was already a highly dangerous situation with god only knew how many pla already among his troops he had to do something quickly chapter fiftysix from what he liked to call his eagles nest jonas breem in his winered velour robe gazed down on the blue earlymorning reaches of victoria harbor pouring coffee from the sterling silver pot and pontificating on the stupidity of the russian inventor kalashnikov who had designed the most popular assault rifle in history with millions now sold around the world without kalashnikov receiving a single royalty now if the doddering old fool had done business with me he told mi yin who was just waking up he would have been one of moscows millionaires but no with the mind of a peasant and true revolutionary he gave the patent to the party and some other old fool laughed his way to the bank kalashnikovs were on breems mind this morning because he had just brokered yet another delivery of five thousand ks between moscow and beijing for the pla and was reveling in his latest profit in excess of a hundred thousand dollars ironically not all of the shipment had come from corrupted russian factory managers but from us sellers who had seen the end of the us market for the assault weapon following a congressional ban on the kalashnikovs and others of their ilk breem was highly amused by the certainty that many of the rifles sold to him at bargain basement prices in the us were now killing americans or army suckers as he referred to them you want to be a loser mi yin join the army all the racking same babe nowheresville know what i mean mi yin murmured something but breem turning from the enormous grandview window of his skyscraper could tell she hadnt heard and when jonas breem spoke everyone was supposed to sit up and listen he picked up a tulip glass still half full of champagne and taking a step toward the huge kingsize bed threw the silk sheets aside and emptied the contents on her crotch hey that woke you eh her mouth open in shock mi yin shot up in the bed quickly clasping a pillow protectively against her oh spare me the modest virgin bit breem said walking back to the table youve been gone through more times than hey what are you doing going to the bathroom she said petulantly do you mind yeah breem said come here tossing her hair back the pillow still in front of her she looked to see if he was serious he was he nearly always was cmon come here she walked toward him around the bed trying to affect a nonchalant air of selfassurance but she was still clutching the pillow put that fucking thing down ii have to have a shower you have it with a pillow for chrissake he snatched it away from her and tossed it on the bed you stink like a wino you know that if you say so i say so holding a cup of coffee with one hand he gestured toward the bed with the other go on spread out i feel like a dawn breaker cant i shower first you dont get it do you he smiled maliciously she understood him all right she was supposed to lie flat on her back and let him lick her he undid the robe and flung it away from him pressed a remote on the bed stand and the drapes opened wider he liked to imagine everyone was looking up at him performing cunnilingus pissing themselves with envy as he put it know what im gonna do to you he waited you know babe no she had to answer even though she knew very well what they were going to do theyd done it enough im gonna lick your cunt till its dry no she said he knelt over her suddenly his hand flashed out slapped her hard on the cheek her face flushed with the pain and humiliation what he said indignantly whatd you say no she repeated you little bitch he hit her again so hard she began to cry hey hey he suddenly became solicitous of her wellbeing kissing her youre all right babe its all right the next instant he slid back down her breasts her body and buried his head between her legs his tongue darting hungrily like a lizards inside her his hands bunching the sheets up beneath her to get her higher now he began licking her his slurping noises like a cow with a salt lick he stopped his breathing short excited you like that babe she knew yes was the answer he wanted but he liked her to pause a moment as if teasing him yes she said its beautiful dont stop love you babe i he couldnt say all the words he was so aroused panting he raised himself onto his elbows his head sinking beneath her shoulders like a wildebeest at water know what im gonna do now yes she said oh god shed made a mistake but before she could recant he was raging at her you stupid bitch what do i pay you for eh what no she said quickly no i dont know you dont know what i pay you for no no she said frantically i mean i dont know what youre going to do to me ah he was on his feet his tumescence already subsiding shed fucked up the script it had to be perfect goddamn it you stupid bitch go on get into the fucking shower you incompetent whore mi yin let the shower cascade over her cleansing her out of his grip for a few precious moments the things she did for beijing shed had enough if she didnt find out whether he was faking the well surveys shed tell beijing he was anyway the risk was they might want to see an original forged chart from which hed made copies and on which potentially rich oil finds were hidden it was a risk either way but better be in the bad books with the party than stay any longer with this pig she could see him naked through the curved bubbled and transparent glass wall of the shower she saw his hand on the handle and so she quickly turned off the shower turn it back on he commanded her with the water falling on both of them he pushed her against the glassbubbled wall and she stiffened as she felt him rubbing the bar of soap between her buttocks he was hard again pushing into her rectum you like this babe yes you want it deep she hesitated you want it deep to split me she said atta girl chapter fiftyseven chong rode the subway for the next two hours perhaps he could send the message to pyongyang immediately on his own recognizance assuming the rumor to be true but his training told him otherwise like a good newspaper reporter he had always operated by confirming such a rumor on the basis of two independent sources and so as he sat in the subways his face covered by the pages of the asahi shinbun the subterranean reflections flashing past him like memories of another life he waited until eleventhirty before he called the two agents one an english speaker was watching cnns transworld service the other had already unrolled his bed mat when the phone rang but both told him the rumor was correct that freeman had had large numbers of american soldiers stationed in japan called to give blood for the usvun hospital ship uss tampa heading for the gulf of tonkin this was normal in such war situations but the tampa had taken unusually large amounts of rhnegative blood aboard chong again called the first agent and worked the phrase inclement weather into his dialogue an instruction to the agent to forward the information immediately to pyongyang in turn pyongyang sent a most secret class one numberforword onetime pad message to its embassy in beijing there is no rhnegative blood in china if the american general was storing it up aboard tampa it could mean only one thing he was prepared to strike deep into china proper north korea secretly but immediately pledged troops to help china if this eventuality arose knowing that china already had enough with a professional army of over two million the gesture from pyongyang however would be greatly appreciated and might well secure what north korea after her forced agreements with the us needed or rather wanted most to have china share as much as possible nuclear technology andor weapons with north korea chapter fiftyeight a mile south of ningming the barbedwire enclosure mellin and the other pows had landed near was about two hundred yards long by one hundred yards wide rolls of german concertina razor wire formed another inner perimeter five feet in from the outer rectangle there were no buildings or tents only tenfoothigh hills of cement bricks beneath blue plastic covers about a hundred feet apart and between them a dozen or so pallets of bamboo either lashed or nailed together it was difficult to tell from a distance to look like long fiftybytwentyfoot rafts dont like the look of this murphy said no bloody cover what if it starts pissing rain youll get wet shirley answered yeah murphy responded so will you luv dont call me luv sorry shirl and dont she stopped upshut was looking their way danny mellin noticed that the big barbedwire enclosure to which they were being directed had been erected on higher ground above the marsh and he commented to no one in particular among his fellow pows that were going to have to build our own accommodation sooner we do sooner well get cover i suppose now were bloody hostages for that friggin strip murphy said nodding north toward the airfield yes mellin answered well lets try to get along with them mike okay you serious listen mate if you think im going to cooperate with this fucking lower your voice mellin said sharply the helos were taking off he added softly no point in getting them riled up for nothing bsides i dont see weve got much option theyve got all the guns yeah murphy answered but we dont have to bloody well kowtow to be quiet it was shirley indicating upshut and several other guards coming their way dividing the pows into squads of ten prisoners each suddenly the sun was swallowed by cloud and the marshlands the higher ground and the airfield were cast in a depressing gray metallic light that took the sheen of the long elephant grass it made the airfield now caught in a shower of rain look farther away than it really was a dark column of threeton khakipainted trucks was coming from the airfield when it pulled up at the edge of the marsh about three hundred yards from the pows an officer alighted from one of the trucks with a pla flunky a pace behind carrying what looked like a soapbox but which in fact was a depleted ammunition box of sturdy construction the major waited for the flunky to put down the box then mounted it as if he were alexander the great though somewhat dated in his phraseology his english was near perfect i am major chen you are prisoners of the peoples liberation army no shit murphy murmured you are here to work first you will be so good as to construct your accommodation thirty bodies will be in each brick house you will be pleased to build your accommodation quickly and well guards will direct you ill bet one of the prisoners said you will behave well major chen said he pointed northward after you will assist in enlarging ningming airfield anyone man or woman who refuses to work will be shot he waited some seconds for the last bit to sink in questions murphy had his hand up the major pointed to him speak were not soldiers were civilians we shouldnt even be prisoners danny mellin added to murphys comment even if you do consider us prisoners of war under the geneva convention youre not entitled quiet major chen shouted i want nothing about geneva you are in china the geneva convention is bourgeois propaganda when will we be fed an englishman asked we havent eaten rice chen replied thinking the englishman had asked him what they would be fed and some fish perhaps medical care another shouted the same as our soldiers chen said that means sweet fuckall the aussie said someone told him to shut up up yours came his response the major said troublemakers will be shot none of the pows including murphy said anything a few of them moved uneasily build well the major urged remember the three little piggies despite the tension a prisoner unable to contain himself burst out laughing the next instant the major was walking back toward the truck his flunky trotting after him what about the three fucking piggies murphy asked no one in particular do you think shirley fortescue said angrily that its possible for you to utter one sentence without using the f word murphy screwed up his face not fucking likely no speaking one of the guards shouted making his way toward mellin it wasnt him murphy said it was me no speaking the guard lifted the butt of his kalashnikov threateningly no one moved the guard though still glaring at murphy lowered the rifle finally he turned to mellin you boss number one squad yes it was half command half question all right danny agreed not seeing any alternative then the guard seemingly ignorant in all other respects made a decision that even though he couldnt have known was as brilliant as any that king solomon made he designated mike murphy as boss number two squad yes no murphy said ive got no bloody intention of helping you the guard didnt understand all the words but he knew refusal when he heard it in any language and he kicked murphy in the shin then slammed the rifle into his chest knocking the australian down boss number two yes yes mellin said hell do he say the guard shouted lifting his rifle menacingly again yeah all right murphy gasped pushing himself up boss number two the guard gave a curt nod and grunt of approval before moving on and designating eighteen more squad bosses look someone said nodding toward two trucks stopping at the edge of the marshy ground steam rising from the covered rear of each truck the first two trucks contained boiled rice for the guards with a helping of fish paste the prisoners received only a bowl of rice each from the last truck and wornlooking red plastic cups of green tea and about fucking time murphy quipped out of the guards earshot mellin moved over to shirley fortescue as they were lining up for the meager rice ration shirley look i know murphy rubs you the wrong way but try to ignore his bad language hmm she answered coldly and stopped as upshut appeared on the scene from one of the truck cabins with a twentysixounce bottle of tsing tao beer he was taking the top off with his teeth and shirley told mellin its like trying to ignore a bad smell cmon mellin said hes okay underneath he was the only one with guts enough to help me when i was first cap upshut was now by the tailgate of the truck arrogantly drinking his beer it started to rain upshut went back to the trucks cabin and through the windscreen watched ningming airfield turn to a watery blur as murphys turn came to receive his dollop of rice and mug of green tea he said thank you out of habit and returned to where the other forlornlooking pows were huddled in the rain youre right a fellow prisoner said to mellin checking that none of the guards was looking in his direction sooner we lay those bricks sooner we get out of this damned rain there was a low murmur of approval except for murphy who commented fuck the bricks where the hell are we this ningbloodyming how fars it from the chineseviet border bout fourteen miles another australian said as the crow flies yeah murphy responded well im a fucking crow anybody else danny no one answered more guards were headed their way shouting at them to get up and start working quickly quickly chapter fiftynine to an outsider the incoming flight of hercules helos containing freemans usvun interdiction force made up of volunteers from the us armys delta force british special air services commandos and gurkhas would have seemed uneventful for some of the older men in the ifor however the flight to da nang was a return to the old days of nam that part of their youth that was among the most hellish and intensely felt experiences of their lives a few among the helicopter pilots who would fly them to the laotianvietnamese border would be using routes theyd used before when nixon had authorized secret strikes into enemy sanctuaries in cambodia and laos during nam colonel a berry chosen by freeman to command ifor had distinguished himself behind enemy lines in the gulf war against iraq when saddam insane had invaded kuwait berry was extraordinarily confident and well trained like the men he led he also had a prodigious memory it was the memory of his greatgrandfather schooling him in things military that came to him now and despite the roar of the engines and the thump of the undercarriage he could still hear the old man telling him of the french forces at dien bien phu near the northern laotianvietnamese border miles west of hanoi the french tired of the hitandrun tactics of the communist viet minh forces had wanted a pitched setpiece battle and they got it in one of the bravest and ultimately one of the most humiliating defeats in military history the french were thrashed lesson one berrys grandfather had told him to never ever underestimate the enemy the planned sabotage of the thirtyfivemile ningmingpingxiangdong dang section of the southern rail line was called off on the express order of c in c usvun forces general jorgensen he consulted freeman who in an unprecedented decision considering his military career agreed with the c in c that not even delta force or sas the two elite special forces of the united states and great britain respectively should be used no one could be used freeman had viewed the latest kh spy satellite photos which revealed evidence of the massive manpower of the chinas peoples liberation army what beijing couldnt do because it lacked the us stateoftheart technology it did through what any economist or military strategist would call a laborintensive operation general wei drawing on reserves of the chengdu provinces fourteenth sichuan army had placed a pla soldier every fifty yards along the thirtyfivemile rail line from ningming to the border in all it came to men each with nothing more to do on an eighthour shift than watch his fifty yards of track with orders to shoot anyone who even remotely looked like a trespasser the first sequence of digitized satfotos relayed to jorgensens usvun hq in hanoi had picked up about twelve hundred dots which on magnification showed up as soldiers on railline sentry duty but it was the second and third sequence of a section of track south of pingxiang that showed up twice as many men alerting usvuns hq that there were three shifts of eight hours each during every twentyfourhour period so that each fifty yards of track effectively had three men assigned to it they were not any of weis crack frontline troops most of them being from militia units but they could shoot and each man was armed with an ak rice trains came out of dong dang pingxiang xiash and ningming once a shift to feed and water the troops damn it freeman complained i wanted that track blown up in at least three places no chance of bombing it major cline asked hell no the fairies wont permit it thatd be an in china attack and might have international repercussions besides any pilot from nam days or any other warll tell you that a damn rail track is one of the most difficult targets there is even if the weathers good which it isnt and you do manage a pinpoint hit with a smart bomb the sons of bitchesll have it fixed and taking trains the next morning freeman picked up one of the satfotos and held it beneath the magnifier see these squares every few miles he asked cline but didnt wait for an answer their maintenance shacks have t wrenches and assorted tools providing the train jacks arent actually destroyed which they arent in most cases only the ties are busted then they can relay the track he dropped the satfoto on the table hell with over three thousand men stationed along there theyve got the manpower to fix up a broken length of track in a few hours so what can we do cline asked fully expectant that as usual freeman would have an alternate plan i dont know freeman replied meanwhile weve got the pla coming out of their holes all over disney bearhugging it to death by bearhugging freeman meant that the pla were pressing right up against and among his troops so that no american or other usvun artillery could be called in against the hill without killing as many americans as pla or even more meanwhile the trains from ningming kept coming laden with troops and ammunition on disney hill the fighting was ferocious with no quarter given by either side much of it was handtohand after ammunition supplies had dwindled or when the american positions on the southern side were overrun it was here that american technology met its waterloo for unlike the chinese who used aks most of freemans troops were armed with the m with grenadelauncher tubes which wont take a bayonet this small but salient fact was in the end responsible for what looked like an impending usvunamerican defeat on the hill for it meant that with bayonet attached the ak became an all but unstoppable lance in the hands of the chinese martinez and doolittle were down to their last clips dlupo was firing sporadically hesitating every few seconds to doublecheck his targets in the flare light and rhin was down to his mes last two link belts of fifty ball rounds each when they along with everybody else in the dawns early light heard the chopping sounds of helos in the south coming from the direction of bien dong it was some second armored cavalry helos heading in from as far away as phu lang thuong most of the fighter planes from the enterprise now at the end of their loiter time and leaving more fighters were coming in to take over the tacair support on the northern side of disney but there was little if anything the fighters could do to relieve the usvun forces on the southern side with chinese and americans in such close proximity only the slicks the helos could help even so as the hueys like so many giant gnats descended in battle line they were exposing themselves to terrible danger the helos leftside gunners tried to pour concentrated fire from their pintlemounted ms at pockets of chinese troops the helos on occasion themselves taking fire from some pla troops near pointblank range as each huey slick touched to unload troops ammunition and water colonel melbaine commanding usvun forces on the hill seeing the situation quickly degenerating into crisis was in brief radio contact with freeman the general against every tenet of his keep moving and never retreat philosophy concurred with melbaines decision to pull the usvun troops back down the southern side of the hill with the intention of regrouping at the fringe of the rice paddies and extricating them from the chinese so that us artillery could pound the southern side of the hill but freeman and especially melbaine on the spot knew it would be one thing to give the order for his troops to withdraw and quite another to execute the maneuver in a microcosm of what was happening all across freemans front the withdrawal was a debacle and in the dismal gray light of a rainstreaked dawn confusion reigned with general weis pla troops adapting more adroitly than anyone expected to the new situation showing no fear their confidence surging with their successful and unexpected counterattack via the tunnels on disneys southern side the chinese stuck like glue to the retreating americans and assorted usvun troops the moment a squad of us second armys troops withdrew down the hill the chinese rather than occupying and securing the vacated positions kept pursuing the americans and other usvun troops they were not only intent on driving melbaines troops away from the hill but equally determined to stay among them so as to keep frustrating the attempts of freemans artillery to scour chinese positions on the hill american casualties were mounting by the minute over eighty men already killed many more wounded however through the bedlam of radio traffic at his hq freeman kept his cool and in an order that seemed eccentrically insignificant to major cline and others at the time ordered more of his vietnamese contingents mortars flown into the paddy area south of the hill where melbaine was trying to consolidate his troops tell those helo pilots to land well back i dont want those mortars unloaded too close to this freeforall on the hill tell them to loiter till they see a clear area from which they can pour suppressive fire trouble is sir freemans tacair liaison officer said the chinks are staying with us all the way then have the helos loiter farther back freeman said in an overriding tone of exasperation yes sir and alert i corps airborne i want them ready when we need them things were getting worse on the hill and dlupos squad was an example of what was going wrong rhin whod been manning the m machine gun which was now so hot it was cooking off rounds without the trigger being pulled was hit in the left leg it was possible for him to walk or rather limp but he was a man down and martinez was already calling in a medevac helo the pilot with the exemplary courage of their breed was coming in low while the remainder of dlupos platoon stopped their retreat to quickly form a defensive perimeter around a landing zone between shearedoff trees the firepower of the pursuing chinese seemed to suddenly center on the huey the helo the wash of its rotors kicking up dirt leaves and other debris was taking hits all over the pilot forced to take off in a wind shear the helo dropped ten feet and swung sharply to the right its rotors colliding with a broken stand of timber the helo rose sharply as if by some giant hand and then fell like a grenade to the ground its broken rotors from the main shaft and tail cartwheeling what was left of the main rotors decapitated an american from dlupos squad chopped up a mortar squad of chinese and also killed a vietnamese machine gunner amazingly the pilot suffered no more than a broken arm and severe bruising but it slowed everyone in dlupos squad freeman then made a tactical decision that would not endear him to the men of second army or the american public if it got out he made it because as he would later cryptically tell marte price thats what they pay me for he ordered squads to keep moving down the hill he didnt want any more calls for medevacs because every time a slick tried to come in every american in that sector stopped moving in order to secure the lz and every time the retreat slowed it meant more men were cut down and more helos destroyed accordingly freeman ordered melbaine to tell any wounded who couldnt be moved to stay put and do the best they could for the time being well get to them later freeman promised by christ ill go in later and get those boys out myself but damn it right now we have to get our forces out of there or theyll all be chopped to pieces on the hill in the cacophony of battle the order did not go down well martinez was yelling to rhin over the sound of mixed smallarms fire the scream of other wounded men and the steady woomph woomph woomph of the hueys overhead being told to exit the area their m machine gunners risking a burst only now and then when there was little or no chance of hitting usvun troops which wasnt very often dont worry man martinez called out to rhin old man says hes gonna come in himself and get you guys out later on yeah right rhin said tell the old man to go fuck himself rhins face was a grimace but it wasnt from pain the morphine shot coursing through his veins it was sheer anxiety creasing his face rhin wondering what in hell would happen when the morphine wore off and chinese were closing in martinez grabbed a bandoleer of mm ammo for the m from dlupo who wasnt doing much of anything and gave it to rhin who he knew would have to feed the belt himself in the absence of boxed magazine ammo aw shit martinez said im staying with rhin martinez dragged the m toward him and set it up so that rhin could feed in the belt hey soldier a captain from bravo company yelled move out down this hill now but sir do as i fucking s he never uttered another word an ak round bursting his head open at the base of his skull bone splinters and blood blown out like an aerosol spray move a sergeant yelled to martinez while returning fire at the closing chinese troops go rhin said get outta here go man martinez slapped rhin on the shoulder see you man yeah as the remaining american and usvun troops ran crawled and moved however they could down disney hill weis pla swarmed onto the hill more and more coming out of the tunnels their losses were staggering over four hundred casualties in firefights and rushing tactics in less than twenty minutes and still they kept coming many of the retreating americans unable to fire weapons because the m barrels despite new nonferrous lining were overheating the chinese over two thousand of them now on the hill kept pressing the attack which to the delight of general wei in his hq just south of pingxiang was fast becoming one of the most humiliating routs in us military history in the southern chinese dialect weis and wangs staff were referring to the americans as chicken chow mein the americans nearing the base of the hill and trying to put as much distance as possible behind them so artillery could be called in fought desperately to consolidate their position before the entire rout became a massacre the spearhead companies of weis chengdu army moving down the hill killing every american left behind some americans and other usvun soldiers now out of ammunition put up their hands in surrender one of them was private rhin as he sat there his hands up he saw one chinese soldier approaching him cautiously as if melting in a mirage the heat haze caused by the redhot barrel of his m which had just jammed his hands up higher rhin sought to reassure the pla soldier no booby traps man im clean rhin knew that the chinese soldiers more of them nearing his position now couldnt understand the words but he hoped theyd understand his tone im safe man no booby traps the chinese nearest rhin looked down at the big american soldier as if he had never seen a black man before then bayoneted him through the heart under weis express orders no prisoners were taken prisoners in combat were a nuisance and could cost you valuable rice rations and water marte price tried to report the battle of disney hill as objectively as she could telling of freemans controversial order that had ended in tragedy for the men like rhin left on the bloodied hill but cnn was carrying the story under the news headline as freemans folly pierre lasalle didnt even pretend to be objective his hardhitting piece for paris match with photos accused freeman of ineptitude and heartlessness while at the same time implying that the men of the us second army were cowardly and from a strictly military point of view had deserved to lose and be swept off disney hill chapter sixty at the ningming airfields pow camp mike murphy danny mellin shirley fortescue and the other assorted two hundred prisoners taken either from the spratly island claims or oil rigs were waking up from a wet cold night spent under badly leaking ratholed tarpaulins in line came a guards instruction the straggly line of worn tired faces bodies shuffling toward the feed trucks looked more like a column of refugees some who had caught cold in days and nights since theyd been captured coughing and sneezing unwittingly spreading their germs among their malnourished companions for mellin the problem in trying to oppose the chinese order that they all become construction workersby which the chinese really meant construction slaves to first build their own huts to house them was in trying to organize his fellow prisoners with his military background mellin had immediately seen that even with the simple problem of getting their rice and tea ration what was needed was armylike organization instead of having them all moving about at random like lost sheep the ration this morning was the same as before a wooden bowl of white sticky boiled rice and a mug of tepid water with only the faintest aroma of tea jesus murphy said pulling a threadbare blanket about him as he received his ration looks like they just passed the racking tea bag over this tub of the cup flew from his hand knocked away by the servers ladle an ak butt striking him hard on the head and shoulder sending him sprawling on the wet muddy ground his rice bowl upturned the guards about the rice truck burst out laughing as they watched the australian scrabbling in the mud to get the rice back into the bowl he asked for another cup of tea he was refused bad man one of the guards said murphy had to be content with picking out the mud from the rice and using his plastic pow cup to catch some of the runoff water from the tarpaulins to drink and to clean the rice as best he could hell never learn shirley fortescue told danny mellin as they congregated with the other prisoners under their tarpaulin no danny agreed his tone unlike fortescues one of compassion which she thought was misplaced well she said he asks for it doesnt he i mean i dont like what these bloody chinese are doing either but well what im trying to say yeah said murphy who had been walking toward them in the crowd what are you trying to say shirl about these bloody chinese despite his anger of a moment before murphy was now grinning like a victorious teenager perhaps shirley thought because the australian had caught her using a swear word what im saying mr murphy she answered stiffly is that one has to get on with people people murphy said sneeringly these arent bloody people sweetheart theyre our enemy you know what i mean yeah i know the australian responded loudly enough danny thought to bring the guards down on him again if he wasnt careful yeah i know what you mean murphy continued his voice growing louder you mean we should suck up to em dont ya kiss their ass well not me sis hold it down someone said upshuts coming our way either upshut hadnt heard murphy or was too busy to want to do anything about it in line he shouted quick quick he laboriously informed them through the camp interpreter comrade lu that they must build the mud huts in one day no huts no big covers he meant no more tarpaulins to sleep under you understand yes mellin said speaking as leader for his squad of ten after upshut had gone murphy said albeit quietly this time a hut in a day no fucking way mate why not danny said twenty of us weve got the concrete bricks theyve been kept dry under their tarpaulins we can start now oh can we murphy answered looking from mellin to shirley fortescue listen bud youve been listening to this sheila too much i thought the whole idea wasnt to help the chinks but to break out if we could fourteen miles to the border mate i never said anything about escaping danny said besides itd be a lot longer than fourteen miles thats in a direct line murphy his blanket still wrapped around him glared at the american what the hells the matter with you yank eh day i helped you up i thought i was picking up someone with guts be quiet someone else said yes another hissed youll get us all in a jam in a jam murphy said loudly his eyes bright with anger you fucking dodos dont you understand didnt you listen to uncle lu youre already in a fucking jam they want you to build your own friggin prison to lock you up in and youre just gonna do it the australians head was jerking left and right as if suddenly overtaken by a nervous tic what would you do shirley fortescue asked him refuse and get shot no but he stopped as if hed forgotten the question his head again in a nervous tic less violent than it was a minute before but still there ii wouldnt help em he said you know goslow tactics for chrissake someone said lower your voice murphy tried but was only partially successful his voice rising and dropping without any warning or apparent control accidents he blurted out yknow make me mortar too wet yknow people edged away from him they all knew what theyd get for any kind of sabotage the australian wasnt thinking clearly listen up it was danny before we start i want to make a request a guy in one of the other groups is pretty ill kept him on one of their ships hardly fed him at all im asking everybody to save a spoon or two of rice per meal over the next few days give it to me okay with everybody there was a murmur of assent however reluctant they were to share their already meager rations how bad is he shirley asked danny what sorry what was that how ill is he she asked well without the extra rice he probably wont make it shirley moved off toward their brick pile asking no more questions danny mellin was glad hed just told them all a blatant lie but he figured that by the time anyone found out hed have gotten the rice he wanted chapter sixtyone with hanoi miles away to the east and the refueling depot at ban lot behind them the command helo and the three big bananas or chinook troop carriers carrying freemans interdiction force two huey gunships on the flanks approached the laotianvietnamese border in a mist that wreathed the hills and filled the valley around dien bien phu the joint usbritish rangersasgurkha special forces group was under the overall command of us army colonel berry with british sas major anthony leighhastings and us ranger captain walter roscoe jr assisting the threeplatoonsized force had been ordered by freeman to go in four miles southsouthwest of dien bien phu along the valley floor to a point one mile west of the ban cong deng road junction near the southern end of the valley their secret mission was to interdict the road that wound eastward out of deo tay chang a small vietnamese settlement only a mile east of the laotian border it was hoped the special force would engage and stop the infiltration of any khmer rougeled enemy column before the latter could reach the ban cong deng junction and have the luxury of either heading north to dien bien phu just inside vietnam or east farther into vietnam as the big chinooks descended into the mist their woka woka woka sound beating the air curdling the mist the thirty men in each helo gripped their weapons and their bulletproof kevlar vests which most of them had been sitting on against the prospect of losing their genitals from ground fire a fear they shared with all heloborne troops the two ms on each of the two gunships opened up pouring down what the gunners hoped would be suppressive fire in the event that contrary to green beret recon team info the khmerled insurgents had already reached the ban cong deng junction east of the landing zone the moment the first helo landed rangers and sas fanned out forward and aft of the chinook to establish a fire perimeter the rotor wash sending shivering waves of water in a nearby paddy rice stalks bending in the fearsome wind and howl of the manmade storm there was no return fire and soon all three lzs were declared secure the helos disappeared into the mist the chopping of their rotors growing fainter suddenly as the jungle swallowed up the last of the ninety commandos of the rangersasgurkha force it was as if nothing had ever disturbed the stillness of this remote valley where over four decades before the french had met their modern waterloo now the tricky parts over major leighhastings said the hard part begins he meant setting up ambush in terrain where the difference between being the hunted or the hunter could be a matter of seconds the movement of a leaf the crack of a twig chapter sixtytwo it wasnt until some of the incoming wounded not those on disney hill but from the accompanying or western left flank attacked by weis troops were brought in by the medevac helos to the must that the extent of the wounds among usvun troops became known in the heat of the battle few but the medics had noticed that enemy bullets not shrapnel had been splitting open the kevlar bulletproof vests by the time the wounded were on the operating table the vests had been taken off revealing horrific chest and head wounds caused by just one bullet it was almost impossible to stop the bleeding and there were hundreds of minute razorsharp pieces the doctors at first assumed the wounds had been caused by mortar shrapnel but it wasnt a surgeon or medic who would eventually solve the problem it was freeman who had flown in via chopper from his hq at phu lang thuong after hearing about the new kinds of wounds hed also heard that the pla had been firing on the medevac choppers using the red cross insignia on the nose and side as aiming points thats nothing new he said thinking aloud well have to have a fighter escort for the most serious cases after theyve been patched up and sent on to our hospital ship in the gulf he turned to cline just as they were landing bob while i look at the sitreps you get me x rays of some of our boys with those wounds everyones talking about yes sir and bob bring me actual fragments yes sir as freeman exited the chopper in its dust storm he instinctively ducked and returned a salute to a colonel of artillery whose expression told him something else had gone wrong what is it colonel sir were losing more men on the hill why there shouldnt be any of our men left on the hill i gave an order to withdraw i know sir but some of the guys stayed with the wounded theyre getting cut to pieces by pla mortars and i dont want to send arty in on them kill our own men colonel freeman said if we dont move those damned chinese off the base of that hill well have to withdraw farther back into those goddamned paddies and once we get stuck in them well never get out you listen to your fac use he and fire for effect he meant for the colonel to listen to his forward air controller who was up ahead in a bird dog or cessna flying around at ninety miles per hour within range of pla smallarms and triple a fire if the colonel fired for effect laying the high explosive down where the fac told him then hopefully the american arty of mm and mm would hit pockets of chinese rather than us and other usvun troops even so both men knew some fellow americans would get hit but they also knew that if us artillery wasnt used on the position then the chinese swarming down the hill would kill even more americans in the paddies now the artillery colonel became the next son of a bitch that day as americans died on the loc binh front no matter that the facdirected arty given the battle conditions was as accurate as anyone could have hoped for freeman took full responsibility for the order and earned the unenviable reputation of being the first american commander since world war ii to call down artillery fire on his own men only the chinese did that in just over seventeen minutes of vicious closein fighting when attackers and attacked both ran out of ammunition and the fighting became handtohand as it had earlier farther up the hill the momentum of the pla attack faltered in those seventeen minutes which seemed like seventeen hours to two dozen or so american and usvun troops freemans artillery stopped the chinese advance giving his men at the paddies edge time to get behind the long dike and set up defensive positions as slicks huey helos flew in and dropped off ammo baby ruth bars and water supply it began to rain then but not before the quiet confident tone of the forward air controller came on armored column heading south approx two miles i say again two miles from pingxiang how many tanks cant say saw five before mist closed in type ts that meant soviet main battle tanks top of the line sold to the pla after the breakup of the soviet union freeman ordered in strikes from the carrier enterprise this he said is where we show them what american technology can do right bob yes sir cline said unenthusiastically if you say so freeman turned on him what the hells the matter with you cant take the heat there was silence between the two men despite the usual mindnumbing noise of artillery screaming overhead and the ceaseless babble some of it frantic from the remaining men trapped on disney if i hadnt called in arty freeman thundered the chinese would be here now we wouldve been pushed so far back from that hill wed be in retreat all the way to hanoi bob cline nodded damn it major if youre not up to it get out of the kitchen it was freemans unapologetic tone that shocked cline out of his uncertainty yes sir ill be fine you bet your ass youll be fine a hell of a lot finer than those boys on the hill boys it was marte price the press pools designated hitter for the day arent there some women combat pilots general aboard the helos and the carriers see the front door of that tent freeman snapped yes well that gender shit stops there i havent time for it you understand yes general shed never seen him so angry before and he almost never swore in front of women if you want a story he shouted over the noise look at these in his hands were tiny shards of steel that cline had brought him earlier what are they fragments from whats called an apbr armorpiercing black rhino round made in alabama out of carbonbased plastic has what they call a polymer tip explodes into splinters inside the body wounds are huge six inches in diameter if it hits a bulletproof vest goes right through wounds are even bigger its banned in the states then where do the pla get them hong kong probably thats the usual source so the cia tell us who exactly we dont know but were sure as hell trying to find out is it that serious marte asked naively serious hell pla using that ammunition is equivalent to them having an extra regiment to throw at us and never mind the effect on morale its like a wildfire among the troops makes everyone hold back and on top of this withdrawal freeman stopped withdrawal and retreat werent part of his normal vocabulary they stuck in his throat in that moment marte price discovered something about freeman that reminded her of what shed heard about patton here was a general a warrior whose ferocity and élan in battle were legendary whose code of honor drew a line against this advance in technology the use of the armorpiercing black rhino bullets in a wound caused by a black rhino round he added its almost impossible to staunch the bleeding its horrendous youre an anachronism general marte said admiringly i thought all soldiers would use anything no he interrupted otherwise wed be using nerve gas another monstrosity besides the need for extra blood on hand is doubled once they start using black rhino tears flesh to pieces each fragment is like a razor a separate wound general marte responded i have pretty good contacts in hong kong if you like i thought freeman cut in that youre to report on the military not help us itd be a good story she said one good turn deserves another freeman responded and they both realized they had compromised their professional integrity and that neither felt guilty general it was major cline and he clearly had more than the impact of second armys retreat on his mind could i have a word in private sir blushing marte price quickly left the hq tent whats up major freeman asked him sir words got out about our special forces group near dien bien phu and theres hell to pay in washington and the rest of the country larry kings asked the head of the joint chiefs to appear on his show shit thats only half of it sir the new york times is on to it theyre going to run an editorial on it tomorrow theyre comparing you to nixon when he ordered the secret bombing of cambodia and laos during nam well theyve got that right freeman said unabashed i mightnt have agreed with everything he did but by god he was right to hit those commie staging areas bastards would slip across into nam shoot up our boys then run back over the border trouble is general in washington the democrats and some republicans are charging that seeing theres no big enemy troop movements out of cambodia or laos so far in this war that i shouldnt have sent in any special forces until we were attacked right thats more or less it sir theyre saying that democratic nations have an obligation not to indulge in preemptive strikes tell israel that freeman said goddamn it if the israelis had waited to be attacked en masse before they took action there wouldnt be an israel by now were going to have to respond general goddamn it its bad enough ive had to pull melbaines boys back to the damn paddy fields now i have to fight our own press cline knew all about that but his job wasnt to agree with the general it was to hit him in the teeth as freeman had once put it with the bad news as well as the good were going to have to respond general he repeated his tone as demanding as his rank would allow i know freeman said thoughtfully if hastily looking at the huge map his steelblue eyes followed the winding course of the laotianvietnamese border around the splotch of green that marked the elevenmilelong valley running north and south of dien bien phu and ban cong deng call a press conference in an hour we wont restrict it let in every son of a bitch in hanoi who wants to come ill straighten it out cline shook his head its going to be tough general weve got every longhaired weirdo yapping on this one weve even got the environmentalists lobby charging that youre going to use some chemical like agent orange to defoliate the border areas round dien bien phu and ban cong deng theyre afraid of hurting the trees freeman gave him a crooked grin maybe i should let marte price take a photo of me hugging a goddamn bush shed be the last one id give anything to freeman looked puzzled why not well we cant prove it but our g section suspects her of leaking our laos special forces op not directly but via that french shit lasalle scratching one anothers back rumor mill has it that hes screwing her freemans facial muscles knotted damn it i gave her info about the rhino rounds she could roast us on an open spit with that one how cline asked i told her it affected morale she could say our boys are backing off cline cut in exactly damn sir it was a call from the operations table melbaines men those that were off were now all in the rice paddy coming under mortar fire the field was turning into a churning sea of muddy water as the plas mm mortar rounds exploded throwing up geysers of rustcolored water green rice stalks and shrapnel from the mortar shells meanwhile various smallarms fire mostly aks peppered the turbulent paddy several bodies two americans and a vietnamese were floating bumpily in the wash freeman called for arty to straddle the narrow margin of ground between the rice paddy and disneys apron of high ground now swarming with more pla reinforcements coming from the tunnels the generals request was answered in less than forty seconds with a creeping barrage of he that soon covered disneys southern slope in a dust storm of dirt and pebbles that swept southward by the wind fell like hail on the embattled usvun forces on the edge of the paddy anticipating the blind pause this would create for both sides unless they wanted to waste ammunition by firing at nothing in particular freeman ordered in a brigade three thousand men of the third airborne cavalry division which had landed in hanoi only a few hours before it was a sight that impressed even the old battlehardened vets of both sides in nam slicks dotting the gray metallic sky in an aerial armada carrying the three battalions three thousand wont be enough to stop them general melbaine shouted into his cellular field phone i agree freeman growled back it isnt going to stop them its going to push the sons of bitches back into china where they belong you hang on colonel im about to give you a lesson in logistics arrogant son of a bitch melbaine said collapsing the phone slipping it into his pocket how the hells he going to push em back were already running out of ammo and the airborne can only bring in enough for themselves never mind us hes got hanoi fever a vietnamese major nearby suggested hes nuts melbaines second in command said craziern a twobit watch all that freeman had meant by a lesson in logistics was that the three battalions under his express orders were also equipped with vietnamese mm mortars chapter sixtythree the special forces contingent that made up the interdiction force under colonel berry had now crossed the border into laos reaching the fan stem where two trails coming out of laos converged there the ifor contingent split up into three columns echo commanded by sas major leighhastings foxtrot us colonel berrys men and delta led by us ranger captain walter roscoe the plan was for two columns echo and foxtrot to go farther in along the two trails that eventually spread out to make a fan or smaller trails and lie in ambush waiting for any enemy main force en route to vietnams western flank the remaining column of thirty men delta under roscoe would wait back at the border in order to net any enemy survivors of an ambuscade or any smaller patrols that either echo or foxtrot would let pass rather than fire upon and so betray its presence to an oncoming enemy force normally such ambushes would consist of no more than ten men but intelligence both from aerial pix and ground movement sensors dropped by air indicated companysized enemy activity and the point of freemans three special forces interdiction columns was not simply to verify such activity and then call in air strikes but to engage the enemy on the spot and wipe them out however as echos and foxtrots security teams a pair of soldiers from each column went uptrail and downtrail about seventy yards from the selected ambush site the fact of their general presence in the area was already known to salt and pepper two the incursion into the fanshaped jungle area of about thirty square miles west of the vietnameselaotian border was already on page one of paris match under the byline of pierre lasalle immediately general wang ordered a sixhundredman battalion of the elite chengdubased paratroop commandos south from mengzi to dien bien phu anticipating such a response and despite the international uproar over his having ordered the special forces contingent into laos freeman nevertheless asked jorgensen in hanoi to authorize interdiction by us fighters aboard enterprise jorgensen refused pointblank now his career was on the line as well as douglas freemans normally a placid man jorgensen with visions of a courtmartial foremost in his mind was trying to control himself general he said gripping the phone so hard his knuckles were white you dont seem to grasp the seriousness of the situation sir freeman cut in i understand it very well the position of ninety of my best men has been compromised by a goddamn frog and i want to give them air interdiction and tacair support i dont mean the military situation jorgensen shot back im talking about the political fallout everybody in washington and at the un in new york is up in arms about you widening the war its the nightmare of nam again kennedy nixon lbj all widening the war in the belief they were going to end it end it freeman riposted by god ill end it easy enough you give me an abomb which i know we have on the enterpriseand ill end it in half an hour drop that baby on ningming and well have peace talks within twentyfour hours guaranteed ill turn ningming into the worlds biggest fishpond the moment he said it freeman wished he hadnt but before he could retract it his normally calmspoken superior had blown a fuse youre mad youre insane im relieving you of command of second army as of now you hear me general you hear me i hear you sir the phone line went dead cline had heard enough of the conversation jorgensen yelling to know it was very bad news freeman who had put the phone down slowly left his aide in no doubt ive been relieved by god i he didnt finish the sentence cline though shocked had pressing business at hand but with his boss no longer in command it was confusing all around what is it freeman asked sir weve got arty pouring fire down on disneys south side you want our boys to wait for the airborne hell no soon as arty clears a sector i want us and the other usvun troops to occupy it soon as we have high ground cleared we take it that way the airborne with my mortars will have lzs for the choppers besides the more dirt we can stir up with arty the better tricky for the helo jockeys i know but its as good as smoke cover hell our boys should be using smoke anyway winds blowing north general its taking smoke away from us covering the enemy well hell we cant have everything anyway maybe itll hide the upcoming choppers freeman paused what time you make it major fifteen twenty hours general then i suggest you record receiving my order at fifteen hundred cline looked at him nonplussed before i got fired freeman explained might as well cover your ass yes sir but what about the press conference in phu lang thuong there must be near a hundred reporters waiting there what about them well sir i mean are you going to tell them youve been relieved freeman shrugged thinking it over he sighed shaking his head hell no i want to try to help my boys in those ifor columns i sent them in there and now with that prick lasalle telling the whole world where they are least i can do is try to help em shift world opinion beg pardon general but how in hell are you going to do that watch me freeman said yes general but what if jorgensen finds out about this press conference youre about to give we tried to contact him for permission didnt we lines down cline suggested whatever you like major it was amazing cline thought freeman had just been fired and the son of a bitch was back on the attack the general noticed clines astonishment as the major opened the tent flap on the way to the hummer that would take them to the press conference center in phu lang thuong as they got aboard the highclearance hummer which had a bad time of it bouncing over the potholed road the general glanced at cline bob i want your computer boys to dig up state department policy memos visàvis hot pursuit across borders cline asked specifically across borders freeman said those fairies in washington think im a grunt general well i am damn proud of it too but i do my homework major by god i do remember what frederick the great said laudace iaudace toujours iaudace audacity audacity always audacity freeman knew that once he mounted the press centers improvised podium a wooden slat tent base he would see a phalanx of hands shoot up one of them would belong to marte price and another to pierre la prick salle both reporters he knew by now were politically left and after blowing the special forces contingent in laos la prick salle probably wouldnt think hed take any questions from him echo and foxtrot columns two pairs of security teams made several listening halts along the site chosen by major leighhastings for a possible ambush the job of these four soldiers was to alert the rest of their columns as to the size of any enemy force coming either way everyone expected any enemy columns to come from deeper in laos to the west but the possibility of an enemy force returning from the east from action in vietnam also had to be considered the security teams for foxtrot column were in position within another quarter hour with the echo security teams three miles south of foxtrot about twentyfive minutes later both echos and foxtrots leaders moved in their assault teams of twentyfive men each into their positions along each trail of the fan setting it up for ambush the remaining man in each of the two columns of thirty men was now free to command it would be these two men who staying still for the next twenty hours like the rest of their column would take up the best ambush position for overall command of their respective columns it would be their order and theirs alone that would unleash fire should the khmer rougeled columns come their way crescentshaped twoandahalfpound claymore mines each loaded with over six hundred explosive embedded steel balls were set up in the undergrowth of the triple canopy jungle along one side of the trail the camouflaged twentyfiveman assault team sat behind the protective sixtydegree arcs of the mines the assault teams making damn sure as commander berry ordered that each convex side of each claymore embossed with front toward enemy was pointing away from the ambush column each columns leader in radio link with both security teams at the two ends of the yard stretch of trail if a man defecated he did so by squatting over a glad bag no paper was to be used and the bag would not be buried lest it be found and dug up by wild animals creating the possibility of revealing the columns presence the excrement like everything packed in would have to be packed out for if the hopedfor ambush did not happen for either echo or foxtrot usvun might want to return to the already scouted sites if freeman had his way because of the radio silence imposed outside their local radio link neither echo foxtrot nor delta columns had any information about the outside world in general or freeman in particular the men in delta column under us captain roscoe were waiting in the marsh area around ban cong deng six miles southsouthwest of dien bien phu without exception every one of the thirtyman special forces column was covered in leeches sucking the blood out of them with no smoking allowed there was no way to burn them off and the difficulty with using insect repellent was that it had an odor the khmer rouge guerrillas could detect amid all the other smells of the fetid swamps mr lasalle freeman said smiling pointing at the french correspondent lasalle was caught off guard but after an initial ah and a pause to collect himself he asked general is it true that usvun special forces under your command are now in action against elements of the khmer rouge across the border in laos no mr lasalle thats not true freeman replied weve been patrolling close to the border thats certainly true but were under strict orders from the us state department and the president not to engage the enemy in laos cambodia or anywhere else unless such action comes under the explicit conditions of the state departments policy of hot pursuit whats that general yelled another correspondent an australian policy of hot pursuit sir is the policy whereby if american troops are on border patrol which they are to protect the usvun left flank and are fired upon by khmer rougeled guerrillas for example or by anyone else we are free to pursue the attackers until we establish what we consider a safety margin at the border how come we havent heard about this before general freeman seemed astonished by what he was clearly indicating was the naïveté of the question no ones asked me he said there was a smattering of laughter pierre lasalle was waving his hand frantically freeman let him wave and took another question from a television reporter general are you denying there are usvun special forces in laos yes but if they are there then theyve clearly crossed the border because of the increasing concern we have about khmer rougeled forces violating the neutrality and environment of laos the assembled correspondents knew well enough what laotian neutrality was but this was the first time theyd heard about us military action to help the environment freeman answered with such audacity that it even sounded logical to cline who knew damn well the general was making it up as he went along the environment ladies and gentlemen as mr lasalle rightly stated in his report for paris match is of prime concern to us all we meaning the us committed in my opinion a disastrous mistake when we used agent orange here during that unhappy war as well as defoliating large tracts of rain forest and jungle it killed much other flora and fauna now of course we realize the acute dangers to flora and fauna all around the world in laos the khmer rougeled guerrillas are strippingstripping ladies and gentlemen by slash and burn the valuable and ancient teak forests to smuggle the teak across the border to sell to chinese traders who quite frankly dont care how much slash and burn goes on or how much damage is done to these precious virgin forests the general paused by god im proud of any american and any usvun member who is prepared to do battle with these marauders who think they can plunder the rain forests of southeast asia the chinese are voracious ladies and gentlemen voracious in their appetite offshore as well as inland the southeast asian nations want to share ocean resources for example but what does beijing want it demands all the resources of the south china sea it wants all the resources it can lay its hands on he paused again taking everyone into his gaze and quite frankly ladies and gentlemen the united states so long as ive got anything to say about it is not going to stand idly by and let chinese run rampant over its neighbors environmental concerns there was applause then he hit them with what he would later describe to cline as his daisy cutter a fifteenthousandpound bomb the biggest conventional bomb in the world another thing ladies and gentlemen we now have proof positive that at least two of our mias from nam are in the border areas of laos thank you and he was gone within minutes cnn was beaming freemans press conference all over the world within hours mia groups via internet throughout the united states were clamoring for the president to authorize general freeman to follow up all mia information to go into laos cambodia wherever it was necessary and it was the first time since its inception that greenpeace worldwide applauded and loudly supported the efforts of a member of the american military to protect the delicate ecosystems of southeast asia from environmental rape bruce the president asked his aide bruce ellman whats your view on freeman fire him mr president as general jorgensen recommended and make jorgensens relieving freeman of command official chiefs the president looked around at the joint chiefs of staff it was a twotwo split navy and air force tending to agree with ellman albeit with some reservations given the heat of battle the army and marines declaring their bias for the man on the ground argued that perhaps douglas has acted somewhat hastily in sending a recon force on the border it wasnt on any border ellman chipped in it was a striker force sent over the border into laos violating laotian neutrality ellman paused with all due respect gentlemen doesnt anybody remember the uproar when nixon secretly sent bombers into cambodia he sent them for good reason the army chief said to destroy enemy staging areas in whats supposedly a neutral country douglas is doing the same thing its outrageous that khmer rougeled brigands can carry out hitandrun raids on usvuns left flank and can then slip safely across the border in laos and be untouchable hes violated policy bruce ellman said hes got to understand that washington directs this war not douglas freeman hes just like macarthur in korea he wanted to go across the yalu and hit the pla in their staging areas we couldve had an allout war with china it was an uncomfortable choice of analogies for ellman as there were still people in washington who believed the plas staging areas across the yalu should have been attacked and that had macarthur done so he would have won the war they believed that the us would then have not had to put up with an unsatisfactory armistice not peace along the th parallel between what was now north and south korea well admiral reese commented at least jorgensens decision to relieve him has only been conveyed to freeman it hasnt been announced publicly yet even though the new york times and others are demanding he be fired you can rescind jorgensens order mr president and what would that do for jorgensen the president asked rhetorically itd hardly be a measure of confidence in my c in c i agree ellman said its certainly not what chain of command is all about up till now cia director david noyer had said nothing but ellmans last heated comment evoked a response mr president noyer began as of now general jorgensens decision to relieve freeman isnt public knowledge and so if you were to rescind the order youre not going to cause jorgensen any great harm yes his professional pridell be ruffled a bit but god knows everyones suffered that from time to time its nothing compared to what will happen if the american people perceive that the white house is not responding to a clear and present danger to our boys in vietnam and im willing to bet that sanctimonious editorials from the times and others notwithstanding the public in all the usvun countries will support freemans decision of making a preemptive strike in laos if it in any way gives more protection for their troops in the usvun force mr president ellman cut in impatiently may i speak my mind the president swiveled his chair away from his desk to face his aide i thought you were bruce i mean lay it on the line go on sir freemans an insubordinate son of a bitch who needs to know just like macarthur did that youre the supreme commander fire him like truman fired macarthur david noyer shook his head mr ellman you ever seen the tickertape parade that macarthur got in san francisco and new york after truman fired him if it had been an election year then as it is now doug macarthur could have been elected god almighty anyway quite apart from that with this noyer turned back to the president i think freeman is right quite apart from trying to protect his left flank he protect his left flank ellman cut in looking about at the joint chiefs im no military strategist but the laotian border near dien bien phu seems a hell of a long way from the fighting around he had forgotten the name momentarily loc binh disney hill david noyer put in about miles away well there you are ellman replied as if the distance had put an end to any argument about an attack on the left flank i suppose the air force chief added if they carved out an airfield on the laotian side or at dien bien phu freemans western forces could be in real trouble course we have the airpower from enterprise we could rule the roost cia chief noyer tried not to sound exasperated but it was an effort gentlemen youre thinking like good military men but he almost said doug freeman but sensed that would be interpreted as firstname bias but freeman is thinking like a chinese political officer hes not only concerned about an attack on his left flank drawing too many troops away from him later on he knows that while dien bien phu is miles away from the action around loc binh its only miles away from hanoi if the probes by the pla and their bosom buddies the khmer rouge over the border are successful go unchallenged they could come en masse and take hanoi just like the viet cong took old saigon then wed be in deep manure remember they wont come by plane theyll march as the nva and vc did down the ho chi minh trails and south into old saigon and the distance between freemans enemies in laos and hanoi is a damn sight less than it was between hanoi and old saigon and no amount of us air superiority will stop them as we found out in nam if freeman doesnt make it clear that he wont tolerate incursions from safe havens across the border we could have a khmerguided pla army around hanoi in a matter of weeks then we would have a twofront war noyer paused breathed deeply there was a long silence and then the president said tapping the blotter thoughtfully with his letter opener theres the problem of the mias freeman mentioned at his press conference only two of them ellman said the president nodded i know but it might as well be the two thousand we have missing have you seen the faxes he meant the messages sent to the white house asking demanding begging the white house to let freeman cross the border if thats what it took to find a single mia but sir ellman cut in from what ive heard these two reported mias might have been turncoats perhaps the president said but theres always the possibility that they might know about other mias at least thats a recurring theme of many of the faxes im getting exactly noyer said if were seen as not doing anything about the mias we look pretty hard and nasty no matter where they are we always try to get our people back were not talking here about one of your company men ellman told the cia chief were talking about turncoats yes we are talking about one of the companys men his name is correction wasraymond baker and he had his throat cut in a fleabitten hotel in dalat in the central highlands because he was trying to track down a lead to salt and pepper two who the hell are the marine commander began salt and pepper the president explained apparently ones white the other black oh look the president said im going to tell jorgensen to sit on his order to relieve freeman at least for twentyfour hours before we decide this will give me time to weigh all the facts ellmans beeper sounded he immediately clicked it off and excused himself two minutes later he was back telling the president and assembled chiefs of staff that larry kings producer was on the line they want someone to interview about freemans decision to cross over into laos no one volunteered the president gave ellman the nod tell them youll do it bruce and before you go on make sure weve monitored public reaction not only the mia business but the publics reaction to usvun troops being in laos or anything else connected with this business noyer was appalledgovernment by gallup pollbut he said nothing hopefully most of the public would be for it ellman went to the fax office and started going through the piles of faxes with another aide he shook his head disgustedly commenting to the aide course rush limbaughs for it hed like freeman to invade laos cambodia and thailand as well might as well throw in singapore and malaysia while hes at it too what are you going to tell them another aide asked on the larry king show i mean i dont know ellman replied curtly that other pile of faxes over there what are they about theyre concerns about deforestation in southeast asia applauding freemans concern about the natural habitat greenpeace faxes most of them greenpeace ellman said in a tone of disgust theyre more worried about animals and plants than they are people ellman was still mumbling about freeman and the goddamn mess hed gotten them all into when more greenpeace faxes arrived chapter sixtyfour one of echo columns twoman point security team was armed with a winchester fiveround riot shotgun while his partner was sporting a heckler koch mpk submachine gun a weapon of choice in the special forces the fully automatic gun set for threeround bursts of mm parabellum nothing had moved for hours as they the twentyfiveman attack team behind them and the rearend security pair from foxtrot waited if audacity audacity always audacity was freemans motto patience patience and more patience would serve the three thirtyman special forces columns it had been an especially difficult lesson for some of the american and british special forces who were more used to urgent rescue and fast deadly antiterrorist actions even so every man knew that a mistake a premature move a bush mistaken for an enemy soldier and fired upon a fart a cough could cost his life and the lives of the other twentynine men in his column approximately three miles to the south beneath the jungle canopy foxtrot column also lay in wait while in the marshy area south of dien bien phu under captain roscoe delta column had taken over what high ground there was mens bodies particularly the chest were bloodied by leeches and assailed by mosquitoes of the three columns it was delta that craved prayed for action just to be able to move to deal with the goddamn leeches to smack a mosquito stone fucking dead the men of delta were not to be disappointed for the pla airborne regiment which meant it had been formed on august en route to the valley around dien bien phu were on the red light all standing making final checks and adjustments before the jump into the low but heavy gray overcast delta columns thirty men unlike the sixty in echo and foxtrot were not strung out on one side of a trail behind a line of tripwire claymore mines but instead were dispersed in an ovalshaped perimeter ten men on either side and five each at the ovals ends in this way they could watch forces either way in the event that the khmerled guerrillas or pla decided to outflank echo and foxtrot now that theyd been told by a birddog cessna message drop that courtesy of la prick pierre lasalle the whole world had been alerted to the presence of freemans usvun special forces column in laos captain roscoe in charge of delta not wanting to break radio silence sent four of his men ahead as runners two for each column to alert echo and foxtrot that their general if not specific position was known to the enemy and that they should return posthaste to delta in the two pairs of runners one man would cover while the other advanced in a tactical leapfrog until they reached their respective columns all four messengers torn between the need for speed quiet and the fear of being mistaken by echo or foxtrot as an enemy scout sneaking up behind them chapter sixtyfive one of larry kings braces was twisted he quickly readjusted it and was on air good evening tonight we have mr bruce ellman special aide to the president and were going to be talking about the controversy that has erupted over general freemans action in the chineseunited statesvietnameseun conflict specifically freeman sending a strike force into laos ah larry ellman interjected politely it isnt a strike force its a longrange reconnaissance patrol yes but its a military force right thats crossed the border into laos well were not a hundred percent sure of that larry cmon bruce freemans troops have either crossed the vietnamese border into laos or they havent no what i mean larry is that the border areas around there around where what part of the border around the area west of dien bien phu often older maps show different border lines it reflects the various national territorial claims king hunched forward then youre saying theyre not in laos no i just ah i want people to know that often crossborder incidents are not always intentional but youre not saying freeman made a mistake are you or are you are you saying the white house denies we have troops in laos at this moment no im not denying it but its a very complex issue larry how so our boys are in laos or they arent right yes right theyre in laos ellman agreed they were adding theyre not all us troops some are british does the white house support freemans incursion hes the man in the field and he has to call the shots as he sees them so he has the presidents full support yes hes certainly getting high marks from the public i dont want to sound too cynical here bruce but does the white houses support of freeman have anything to do with the polls showing the american public is over seventy percent in favor of freeman making a preemptive strike in laos well first of all larry theres been no preemptive strike as yet as i mentioned earlier its basically a reconnaissance patrol weve no reports of combat in the area about the polls larry i think you are being overly cynical king smiled comes with the territory bruce ellman smiled i understand but to answer your question about the widespread public support for freeman that has no bearing quite frankly on how the administration views general freemans action this administration doesnt govern by poll the president was elected to exercise leadership fine but you cant deny bruce that the widespread support for the president cant do any harm in an election year ellman shrugged as if the comment were irrelevant perhaps but the president supports general freeman because he thinks the general has handled a delicate situation well whats delicate about it well larry general freeman had several options at his disposal he could have called on the air force to spray defoliants on the border crossings the khmerled guerrillas are using you mean using herbicides something like agent orange to denude the border crossings so they could be monitored what by satellite exactly larry it wouldnt be agent orange there are other less toxic herbicides we could use but we think general freeman has shown both a great deal of concern for the people of laos and great respect for the habitat i dont know if the publics aware wait a minute what public are we talking about here laotian or the us the us okay sorry go on well what im saying larry is that general freeman is extremely sensitive about the habitat we made some awful mistakes during the vietnam war using herbicides and he doesnt want to repeat them and because of the thoughtless greedy slashandburn tactics practiced by those in the region deforestation and the loss of rare species of mammals and birds is horrendous in vietnam alone more than a thousand square miles of deforestation takes place every year on top of that the khmer rougeled guerrillas are constantly raiding vietnamese forests for teakwood for which theres a high demand and all the time got to take a break king cut in turning to the camera well be right back dont go way after the intense barrage of commercials king asked bruce ellman to take up where hed left off on the topic of environmental protection i was going to say larry that it isnt just the destruction of over species of mammals deer leopard rhinos et cetera or the threat to the more than seven hundred species of birds that were concerned about but the fact that deforestation has a terrible side effect on the people of the region and here im talking about massive erosion on hillsides massive soil erosion destruction of water tables with consequent flooding and the resulting hold on a minute bruce youre losing me you say freeman had all this in mind when he sent in troops rather than sending in machines bombers et cetera to clear the area larry you dont have to believe me just read the transcript of general freemans press conference last night in phu lang thuong king held up his hands in surrender okay and i aint gonna even try to pronounce that what was it phu lang thuong if you say so king joked then looking into the camera he told his millions of viewers that after the break hed be taking your phone calls the first was from tucson arizona a young man by the sound of him telling larry how much he loved the show how hed been trying for months and this was the first time hed gotten through whats your question ah its for mr ellison ellman king corrected him yeah ellman what are you gonna do about the french king and ellman looked at each other kings lower jaw coming unstuck what dyou mean about the french well it was on some news report or other some french guy blew the whistle you know oh king interjected you mean the king snapped his fingers trying to recall the name you mean the guy who broke the news about freeman sending the special forces in yeah lasalle pierre lasalle right yeah some name like that well arent the french in this usvun force i mean no ellman cut in theyre not well the caller said that guy put our guys behind the eight ball know what i mean and i think we should do something about it teach em a lesson king shrugged what do you want us to do bomb paris itd be a start king switched him off he has a point though bruce doesnt he i mean that was a pretty scurrilous thing to do putting our guys and the british in jeopardy now the chinese have to know where freemans force is weve already sent a note to the french ambassador here in washington the next caller said what we oughta do is stop buying champagne thatd show the sons larry switched him off ad libbing we stopped buying champagne around here the embassy circuitd come to a dead stop wouldnt it bruce ellman grinned he was feeling great the questioners talking about the french news blowing the special forces operation was taking all the heat off the white house he hoped itd keep up but the next question was from a greenpeacer from london ontario canada i never thought id be congratulating the military but i have to tell you that finally weve got a general whos using his head instead of blasting away with bombs and herbicides attacking the environment hes sending in men i mean military personnel to assess the situation ive read the reports of general freemans press conference and hes the only military person i know of whos concerned about the destruction of the habitat king pursed his lips nodding hes right isnt he bruce freemans the only one i mean general concerned about the environment i mean putting it as a policy over and above purely military considerations ellman politely disagreed no norman schwarzkopf showed the same kind of concern over the oil fires in kuwait yeah king said but i mean that happened after the iraqi war had started here freeman apparently took habitat damage into consideration before he sent in his special force next caller amsterdam hello it was a heavily accented dutch voice hello i think its disgraceful larry that the americans and british are making war at all this dispute between the chinese and vietnamese should have been settled peacefully well sir king began that was tried in the un didnt work so now we have a un mandate for usvun to step in and protect vietnamese sovereignty the caller was adamant there must be a way to settle it peacefully and king cut in so you believe everything can be settled peacefully yes i wish you were right caller but sometimes however unpalatable it is we have to get out the strap the last caller was a quietspoken woman whose phone number showing up on the producers console identified her as a previous caller a mrs mellin but the producer recognizing her soft hesitant voice let it through she said that she was as concerned as anybody about the habitat but surely the most important considerations behind general freemans sending in special forces were to protect americans and other usvun members from attack from laos and to help free any mias bruce ellman saw his chance and took it i think the caller is absolutely correct larry the mia issue has always been important to this administration and the president doesnt want anyone to forget it but mrs mellin continued why is the mia issue still not resolved im the sisterinlaw of an mia an army nurse and my husband has been missing since the beginning of all this maam king interrupted gently i understand about your sisterinlaw being an mia youve called before right yes point im making maam is your husbands not strictly speaking an mia correct me if im wrong but wasnt he isnt he one of those taken from one of the oil rigs yes but hes still missing and i we know that maam sorry were running out of time bruce administrations on to this right tracking down american nationals who were snatched yes we are larry i mean mrs mellin said they say some mias had been you know turned around by the communists over there but we still owe them our compassion until youre right maam king cut in point is we owe every vietnamese vet and mia a hearing we werent there they were exactly a heartened mrs mellin said gotta run thanks bruce pleasure larry tomorrow night another guest shes often nude always naughty and shes a member of the italian parliament see you then the president zapped the tv its light dying as he beamed he looked around at the chiefs of staff well whats the consensus chief of naval operations admiral reese was the first to respond i thought ellman handled himself very well i thought he did brilliantly the president said there was no disagreement in the oval office yes the president continued freeman is riding high in the publics opinion and we were right to support him i think general jorgensen acted a little hastily on this one you want me to speak to jorgensen the army chief asked straighten out any misunderstanding between him and douglas id appreciate that general the president answered in any case admiral reese added douglas is going to have his hands full with this breakthrough at disney yes the president agreed i think that for jorgensen to relieve him at the moment would be very unwise what they meant was that if someone had to take the heat for what all indications showed would be a disastrous defeat at disney it might as well be a popular public figure at least a temporarily popular figure like freeman and if anyone on jorgensens hq in hanoi thought general jorgensen would be offended by being overruled albeit quietly by the white house they couldnt have been more mistaken jorgensen whod had time to mull over his own earlier flash of temper in response to freemans outburst was in fact enormously relieved by the call from the white house he was no fool and also hed seen the larry king show if freeman was that popular all of a sudden then let him hold on to the field command of usvuns second army let him get out of the terrible mess he was in on disney hill and it was a mess the armada of over choppers carrying the american air cavalry freeman had called in unable except in a few cases to disgorge their cargoes of men and ammunition because of heavy smoke being laid down by a pla mortar barrage the mm falling all along the base of the hill blinding the helo pilots and the hueys gunners the four troopers two running to warn echo two for foxtrot were within fifteen minutes of reaching leighhastingss column and berrys when the two most forward troopers one running to echo one to foxtrot ran into spiked deadfalls at different times these were booby traps made of long sharpened stakes protruding from a fourbysixfoot wooden box suspended high in a tree by a cord or vine whose quickrelease knot end is hidden by the undergrowth near a trail when an enemy soldier passes underneath the tree the knot is released and the whole spiked contraption falls on him if hes lucky the spikes kill him outright but in most cases the long spikes inflict terrible wounds all over the body the two men hit this day were badly wounded one with a punji stick penetrating his abdomen and exiting through his genitals their buddies had only two choices to finish them off or leave them neither could carry a wounded man out for their mission was to warn both echo and foxtrot columns that their position had been blown one of the wounded mans buddies took out his kbar and hand shaking drove it into the mans heart he heard a noise behind him but was too late ak rounds blowing his head off scattering its contents across the trail echo would not be warned unless the weather cleared and someone from high up in a tree managed to see the dots of descending chinese paratroops over dien bien phu in the far distance the buddy of the man hit with a deadfall on the foxtrot trail thought quicker and fired a wide arcing burst as he went to ground behind the man whod been spiked he used the dead body and the bloodied booby trap as cover while he threw two willie petes or white phosphorus grenades into the green jungle on either side of the trail he followed with long bursts from his heckler koch spraying twentyfive rounds of mm parabellum in less than two seconds as he leapt up and kept running down the trail his eyes trying to take in the overhead canopy as well as the trail he rounded a bend saw a trip wire jumped over it and kept running all his senses alert for danger he heard something moving to his right and dove to earth a bush quivered and he gave it a threeround burst there was a squealing noise the wounded boar making it halfway across the trail before he slumped dead heart thumping sweat coursing down his back the special forces trooper a us ranger william kacey looked up the trail saw a patch of ground with less dead leaves on it and figured it was a punji stick hole he guessed he was about ten minutes away from colonel berrys foxtrot company whether or not the pair of troopers heading for echo had gotten through kacey had no idea after five minutes of staying stockstill letting his pulse fall his eyes constantly looking about kacey decided to stay a bit longer something else was moving you could sense it from the bird noises louder than usual as if telegraphing one another a warning now kacey heard movement coming toward him on the trail but it was a careless sound not the noise of someone trying to tread lightly the girl was probably around seven years old and when she saw the pig gasped with fright and stood still holding a bamboo stick by her side as if wondering what to do kacey as yet unseen by her was also thinking what to do if she spotted him could he afford to let her run back to the hamlet or wherever shed come from it couldnt be far away she was standing upright only her head bent forward as she looked down at the pig kaceys brain was racing something wasnt right what did they say in the movies its too quiet out there it wasnt quiet the birds were making a racket was it the smell of the place no it was the usual damp musty leaf odor of the forest it was the way she was standing as if she had a stick up her ass a walking booby trap an old viet cong trick turn a kid into a walking bomb it was only now that kacey realized her left hand was bunched up a grenade right then he knew he wouldnt kill her even if she let go of a grenade or whatever a homemade job with lots of nails and the gunpowder taken from an unexploded nam bomb but he wouldnt harm her jesus christ wasnt that what he was over here for as part of the usvun attempt to show china that you wouldnt put up with bullying no that wasnt it she was about the same age as his daughter the girl moved closer to the pig and hesitantly touched its stillwarm underbelly with her big toe she did it again then satisfied it was dead looked behind her for several seconds then looking forward stepped over the boar and stopped dead her eyes following the short barrel of kaceys machine gun her body giving a start as she met his eyes her mouth agape she had never seen a black man before shh kacey whispered putting a finger to his mouth then with the same hand gesturing for her to give whatever she was holding to him he could see it was a grenade with the pin pulled only her grip keeping the release lever down she looked back along the trail again and in that instant the ranger was about to grab for it but one fumble he waited till she turned and looked at him again smiling he very slowly extended his hand her tiny warm hand withdrew from him for a moment he stopped his dry mouthed smile fixed his tongue cemented to the roof of his mouth she let him close his giants hand around hers and his thumb took over the pressure on the lever now he was in a real fix what do i do with the fucking thing as she turned and walked away from him stepping carefully back over the dead pig kacey transferred the grenade to his left hand in case he had to fire the hk singlehanded and felt for the first aid pouch around his helmet hed tape the grenades lever down he had it done inside a minute and first pulling the pig off the trail then moving into the mildewsmelling bush he made his way forward at turtle speed torn by his desire to get away and make sure foxtrot company was alerted to enemy presence and the need to be absolutely quiet should the girl bring anyone back chapter sixtysix with the weather closing in nimbostratus cloud now spreading out over the valley above dien bien phu in a low metallicgray ceiling the american air cavalry still had smoke to contend with the aerial armada of helos carrying the battalion had to turn back to the delight of pierre lasalle who from the safety of hanoi kept filing stories critical of the us presence general jorgensen called freeman at second armys hq at phu lang thuong douglas harry jorgensen here washingtons pressing me they want to know if we can hold disney hill or whether you should pull out before casualties become unacceptable general we have pulled back by god i hate to have to admit it but we have and were still being hit those bastards of weis are swarming out of those goddamn holes like ants trouble is there was a sizzle of static on the line trouble is we cant pull back any farther otherwise well be waist high in paddy water im not saying pull back as far as lang duong but if you can get out of the paddies onto higher ground we can maybe move some armor in negative were between a rock and a hard place here we withdraw any farther well have to fight waist high in mud turn into a goddamn turkey shoot for the chinese no were going to have to make our stand where weve dug in between the base of the hill and the rice paddies least tacair can hit the hillside but the choppers cant see where theyre going general you get me helos to bring those men in tonight and ill counterattack what it was like being down twenty to zip in the rose bowl at halftime jorgensen thought and the losing coach telling you he was going to win the game last thing they expect general freeman continued ive got mortars i need is the men the static was getting worse but whatever freeman had said jorgensen told his aide in an aside that it was going to take more than mortars freemans forces were already running low on ammunition and despite some blind drops into the smoke and mist most of the ammo crates had disappeared underwater anyone who had to leave his weapon and pack behind wading out to try to retrieve them was at especially high risk as chinese snipers at the edge of the smoke used the sodden parachutes as range markers douglas yes general im sorry for my remarks my fault freeman cut in i have a penchant for sounding off when what i should do is shut up youre the best field commander for second army douglas ill try to get you those helos when jorgensen hung up freeman in an uncharacteristically paranoid moment under the stress of battle wondered aloud to cline what jorgensen had meant when he said he was the best field commander for second army for second army freeman said hypothesizing that jorgensen might have meant he wouldnt be the best field commander for any other us army i dont think he meant that for a moment cline told freeman he means youre the best man for the job cline paused for the situation were in freeman turned on him the situation were in major is a retreat by god is that all he thinks were good for i told him i was going to counterattack and i will damn it freeman said pacing up and down before the situation map i need a prayer for good weather like georgie patton had at bastogne get some air cover bob get that senior padre of ours to see to it embarrassed cline opined that the padre was probably pretty busy with the wounded that the dustoffsor medevac choppers had brought back to phu lang thuongs field hospital freeman looked surprised i thought all our wounded were going straight to the tampa they are general but there were so many wounded in disney that there was a backup of choppers all the way off haiphong harbor so some came back and unloaded at phu lang thuongs field hospital as i said the padres are pretty busy whats the matter with you goddamn prayer only takes a minute i want a prayer and i want to see a copy of it padres know the right wording yes sir reluctantly cline made his way toward the field hospital feeling more embarrassed by the second until he realized that if you believed in god freemans request a symptom of disneyinduced stress made perfect sense he realized then that what really bothered him was his own angst the persistent question he harbored at the back of his mind as to whether or not god had made man or man had made god freemans order for a prayer was forcing cline to confront his own uncertainty ive already said prayers major the overworked padre told him im praying for every man thats wounded on our side as well as on the chinese i dont know whether the generald appreciate that the generals not god major though sometimes he acts like it look padre i dont want to get in a slugfest with you the generals ordered a prayer a prayer for good weather so we can get proper air cover to kill more chinese no the major said feeling his temper rising to get out of this murderous trap our boysre in the padre said nothing hed just administered last rites to a man a boy really whose face had been blown away by a chinese stick grenade look padre cline told him quite frankly i dont give a hoot if you write a prayer or not im not one of your flock but if i dont have something on paper to show the boss im going to get reamed out so what is it to be you want to write the prayer or tell him personally that you wont the padre sighed ill write a prayer cline resented the doginthemanger tone listen padre last time i heard you give a sermon which i was required to attend you were going on pretty strong about defeating godless communism i still am but not men cline rolled his eyes impatiently thats like saying you want to fight nazism but you dont want to kill nazis cant be done padre will you write it nowplease the padre took out his pen and notebook and wrote dear lord we ask of you that you give us fair weather so that we may have time to withdraw our men from this catastrophe cline read it jesus christ padre that wont do it how do you know what god wants im talking about the general he reads this this catastrophe and withdrawal bit hell go ballistic wordlessly the padre took the note crossed out catastrophe put danger instead and changed withdrawal to rescue thats a bit better cline told him but its only i mean its kind of short isnt it cant you tart it up a bit you mean puff it up yes cline said angrily puff it up now the padre wrote again looking up now and then collecting his thoughts cline read it okay fine thanks padre and he walked off youre welcome and major cline turned around yes no offense to you or the generalits been a bad day for all of us cline nodded appreciatively i hope your prayer works padre freeman read the prayer aloud as he buckled on his holster dear lord we most graciously beseech you to put a halt to this inclement weather so that our soldiers may more safely regroup against the attacks of the enemy and may proceed in this united nations effort to bring peace once again to the region amen freeman shook his head in disappointment i dont know bob its all right i suppose adequate but theres no majesty in it no pizzazz almost think he was praying to the secretary general of the un we want a prayer for battle for victory this is a weasel prayer not a prayer worthy of second army not for warriors damn it he crushed the note ill write it myself and you can deliver it to him and i want him to use it in the next service by god our boys deserve better than this he rewrote it and read it to cline dear god we ask for a cessation of this inclement weather so that our men may advance against our foe defeat them in battle and so drive the godless hordes back to their communist enclaves and may our victory be so decisive that the warlords of communism will pause before committing further acts of war against those who fight in your name amen cline said it sounded great and delivered it to the padre it was said that night at at the hospital a half hour later a typhoon harold struck north vietnam the cloud cover descending even lower the torrential downpour ruling out any possibility of tacair support for freemans beleaguered troops chapter sixtyseven at the pow camp south of ningming danny mellin mike murphy and shirley fortescue were busily building the brick walls of their huts any reluctance the australian had had earlier was now gone drowned in the monsoon that had first struck the border area around loc binh where freemans besieged troops were fighting for their lives on the narrow margin between the base of the hill and the waterswollen paddies unknown to freeman who was now en route to the loc binh front the monsoons deluge had probably saved his troops on the margin since the downpour coursing through the artilleryscored rustred soil of disney hill was flooding many of the tunnels whose drainage systems were clogged like leaves in a houses gutters with the artillerymashed vegetation strewn all over disney in fact during the flash flood more pla troops en route from the north via the disney tunnels were killed by drowning than were killed by the us and other usvun troops the rain cleared the smoke enough for the aerial fleet of choppers to return and to go in using the margin as their landing zone violet smoke ground flares identifying the dustoffs the medevac helos lzs those helos whose red crosses were clearly visible on nose and sides were as usual used as aiming points by wangs soldiers who knew that the americans obsession with trying to get their wounded out would delay any counterattack the air cavalrys gunships however were quick to respond thes on either side of the choppers sending down a deadly rain of oneinfive tracer the frontmost helos also firing off salvoes of inch rockets from their dual pods of nineteen apiece in this earpounding confusion of raincurtained battle freemans air cavalry unloaded on the margin which had more or less become a hundredyard airfieldcumstarting point for freemans counterattack because now his consultation about weaponry with the vietnamese general vinh came into play standard mm vietnamese mortars enabled freemans troops once again to fire not only their own mm rounds but pla mm rounds as well in short as the air cavalry rapidly stiffened the usvun line on the margin enough to push wangs chinese army back fifty to seventy yards on disneys artillerypockmarked southern face the pyramids of mortar rounds that had to be left behind in the sudden and totally unexpected withdrawal fell into the hands of freemans air cavalry mortar squads now they quickly fed the chinese ammo into the mm mortar tubes the mortar rounds explosions not only an incentive for the already retreating pla to retreat farther but simultaneously further weakening the tunnels with a series of caveins from the rounds concussion at one point the caveins sealed the fate of an entire company of chinese troops yes there were us casualties caused by tunnel caveins that produced sudden sinkholes which in turn swallowed usvun troops but the losses were minuscule compared with the chinese losses and now with ample ammunition supplies to feed the gaping mouths of the mortars the high morale of the american advance continued elements of the us cavalry reinforcements having already gained disneys summit after unforgiving handtohand combat along a deep lshaped trench the same trench only a half hour before had been a tunnel filled with pla a tunnel that fed into the disney complex as a conduit for those troops disembarking from the ningmingpingxianglang son railways troop trains chapter sixtyeight danny mellins pockets were bulging with boiled rice donated by other pows in their belief that it was going to help one of the rig workers who had been captured first and was therefore the most malnourished pow but the rice wasnt for any pow instead mellin with the help of shirley fortescue mixed the grains of boiled rice in the mortar used to cement the bricks together for what would be the lower center part of the wall facing the long coils of razor wire that served as the outer main wall of the prison until a proper highwire wall could be built to replace the wire perimeter so mellin said to murphy and shirley fortescue who were acting as his cover while he sprinkled another handful of rice in the cement i need you to get me a pair of wire cutters oh right murphy said ill order one from sears just give me the catalogue ill fax em right away danny ignored the australians sarcastic tone thought you aussies he stopped as shirley whispered hes coming upshut was shouting at one of the pows an older man in the brickpassing line who had crumpled with exhaustion the old man struggled to his feet a bayonet prodding him sharply in the back drawing blood when upshut saw the waisthigh wall of mellins group the highest wall so far of any of the five prisoners huts being constructed he nodded adding a grunt of approval mellin smiled accommodatingly as did shirley fortescue murphy whispering prick when upshut was out of hearing range murphy turned back to mellin so what was that about aussies mellin tapped the next brick down with the handle of the trowel i thought you aussies were the cando sort improvise mellins fingers like everyone elses were raw from handling the bricks without gloves of any kind if you and another hut boss can lose a couple of trowels we could make a bloody good pair of cutters first thing theyd miss shirley said matteroffactly shirleys right danny added every trowelll have to be accounted for yes she said passing another brick for gods sake think of something practical dont be so fucking uppity murphy retorted just a thought all right you two mellin said knock it off shirley you got any ideas using the rice isnt going to help us at all unless we can cut through the razor wire now that they were getting near the bottom of the pile the bricks were covered in mud kicked up by the downpour that had ceased only twenty minutes before turning the whole compound into a redcolored slush nothing comes to mind shirley said anybody have a good nail clipper or gimme a break murphy said you think everyone here was doing their nails when the chinks picked em off the rigs i dont know shirley said calmly but i know that if they have a nail clipper she turned to danny you know some have a nail file attached oh for chrissake murphy cut in yeah great idea if we had a year or two to just a thought she countered trying not to get angry mellin took particular note of this pointed exchange between the two because it reminded him of his sister angela before shed broken up with her one and only boyfriend in the days before she had gone to nam as a nurse they used to have the same kind of bitterly sarcastic exchanges during a fight but then it would soon be over and though angela never admitted it to danny he was sure their differences had been solved by sex it was almost as if they had to have a row to deny the intensity of their physical attraction for one another danny had become convinced it was the same with mike murphy and shirley there seemed to be a strong albeit hidden sexual attraction between them with no room for middle ground it would be either sizzling hot or icy cold then as if to suddenly confirm his suspicion murphy conceded that a nail file however small might be of some use after all not as any kind of wire cutter itself but as something that could be used to make a cutter make one out of what mellin pressed mike murphy grunted agreeing that it posed quite a problem well he said theres only one way dont tell us shirley murmured sarcastically it might help us we steal a cutter murphy answered before anyone else could object the australian added look they must have one or more to have set up the coils of razor wire around the perimeter makes sense danny conceded but i havent seen any of upshuts guys carrying them about neither have i murphy agreed thats why they have to be in the trucks glove box maybe or tool kit in the back i didnt see any toolboxes in the back of the truck that brought us in shirley said nor me danny told murphy which means youre probably right they must have cutters in the glove box as murphy passed another brick for what would be their prisons wall and its rough surface tore a small flap of skin he cursed the lack of gloves once again adding only chance well have will be slop parade he meant the five oclock ration of rice and tea somebodyll have to get under the truck and try they stopped talking as one of the guards ambled closer as the guard moved farther away murphy said well have to get in the passenger side and have a looksee in the glove box shirley nodded we could create some kind of diversion get people to crowd around the truck murphy frowned at the idea problem is wed have to let more people in on our plan i didnt know we had one yet shirley quipped well murphy retorted i take it were going to bust out the hut wall then cut through the wire dont have to be a fucking genius to figure that out except he looked now at danny youd better be right about that fucking rice mate otherwise were dead as fucking doornails danny said nothing nor shirley who was too disgusted with murphys bad language i dont like your silence mate murphy said as he took hold of another brick his thumb was now bleeding cmon danny tell us you ever done this before the old rice trick no but but nothing jesus christ danny whole fucking plan depends on you and the friggin wall mate i know that danny replied tartly you think i upshut was coming back on his rounds so they fell silent murphy still cursing under his breath about the lack of proper gloves for handling the bricks gloves or rather a glove an asbestos one was on the mind of the third m assistant machine gunner in the echo column west of dien bien phu hed lost the glove supplied so that in a firefight you could quickly change a redhot barrel for the cool spare one in less than three seconds somehow the piece of green fishing line that he normally used to attach the glove to his kit had been severed from the pack probably twisted in underbrush and giving way when hed moved forward quickly after a sit and listen the assistant gunner knew that if it was discovered missing by any of the other special forces he would henceforth be called tom turd of the month it was serious business if you couldnt change the barrel the time lost could be responsible for a lot of men killed causing your position to be overrun letting the enemy inside your perimeter from where he could wipe out the entire column with the machine gunners buddies having only one corridor of retreat in front of their own overlappingfire claymores in the jungle five miles to the south of echo and beyond the laotianvietnamese border kacey the remaining ranger of the twoman warning squad sent by deltas major roscoe to warn foxtrot had moved well off the trail from where hed seen the young girl advancing slowly silently on a line parallel to the trail the ranger could see a clearing several huts and now coming down the trail a squad of five no six men khmer rouge led by a brother a black man or was it the heavy mud camouflage no he was black and the little sevenyearold girl in front of him nudged along by the barrel of the mans ak suddenly the khmer squad stopped about a hundred feet from where the ranger had seen the little girl earlier the khmer patrol now using the girl as a shield the point man inched ahead covered by the other six khmer the khmers stopped again next to where the ranger had been hiding they were checking out her story probably using the girls family as hostages back in the village the khmer point man wanting to see where the dead pig was and so see if anyone had been hiding by the trail kacey knew it would take only a few seconds for the khmer to discover broken twigs and bruised underbrush and conclude that someone had been hiding there and had taken her grenade the khmers leader gave a spreadout hand signal and in seconds the other six men of the enemy squad had disappeared into the jungle beneath the high canopy of trees kacey was caught in a dilemma the only way for him to move fast enough to warn foxtrot column that their general position was now known by the enemy would be to break cover and move quickly down the trail yet to do that would put him in danger of running smack into another enemy patrol andor booby traps he knew he had to risk it the closer he got to foxtrot the better the chance of warning them to split in time and head back for pickup along with echo and delta columns still moving slowly and well in from the trail he could see the six khmer spread out in a line about seventy yards behind him as he neared the edge of the bare ground around the village huts working his way carefully around its perimeter in between the huts he saw there were patches of bare ground all but devoid of the dead leaves one usually saw he guessed that they were punji traps the teepeeshaped bamboo stick cages that normally identified the booby traps for the village children now removed kacey was sweating profusely not only because of the sticky heat but from the growing anxiety that was creeping up on him as surely as the seven khmer coming up behind him hey buddy it sounded like an obscenity so unexpected was it kacey froze it was definitely an american voice not a trace of a foreign accent it had to be the black man hed seen kacey said nothing he couldnt see the speaker and presumably the speaker couldnt see him otherwise kacey knew he would now be dead hey man the voice called out again i got a deal for you there was no echo the disembodied voice quickly lost in the sudden hush of the jungle you come out man or the girl gets it you understand there was nothing mysterious about it a straightforward threat and not even for a split second did kacey doubt that the other black man meant exactly what he said and not for a second did the ranger doubt that if he didnt get to warn foxtrot column then thirty men would become the victims rather than the executors of a fatal ambush it was the girl or the column but what if he didnt answer the black man what if he simply kept quiet how could the black man and the remainder of the enemy patrol be sure he was still in listening range that hed heard the black mans threat for all they knew he could have been well back on the trail by now hightailing it in the direction hed come from to delta in the marshland below dien bien phu you hear me man came the black mans call kacey his finger on the trigger guard of his hkmp said nothing two could play this game though the tail of the monsoon had now passed over the pow camp at ningming the ground was muddy and several of the weaker prisoners slipped on the way to the slop truck for the bowl of rice and cup of tea the truck being mobbed as cover for murphy to slip under the tailgate quickly wriggling forward on the passenger side he heard the shouting of the guards at the back upshut among them and several warning shots fired he rolled out got up tried the passenger door it opened and he was inside the trucks cabin two things caught his eye at once a small battered dirty plastic toolbox in the passengers foot well and a bunch of keys hanging from the ignition the gate through the razor wire being fifty yards away a run for it crash through the friggin onearm barricade and drive like hell he was excited but he wasnt dumb probably wouldnt make it anyway besides there was the minor matter of leaving everyone else behind not nice there were no wire cutters in the toolbox shit he grabbed a pair of pliers a file snatched the keys and got out of the truck in all it had taken less than a minute from underneath the truck murphy could see a thicket of legs one of the pows whom danny mellin had designated as a lookout saw murphy under the tailgate and shouted cmon hurry up there im starving this was immediately followed by a surge of bodies around the tailgate and murphy scrabbling amid the legs only to surface as the guards began pushing the line back while clubbing several pows to the ground you get wire cutters mellin asked handing the australian his rice bowl and plastic spoon no cutters murphy told him but i swiped the trucks keys silly bastards left em in the ignition theyre going to shoot people when they find them missing you dont say murphy said but first the driverll get shit and hell wonder whether he left em in the truck or wherever you know how it is when youve lost your keys yeah but when hes sure theyve been stolen theyre gonna shoot people exactly shirley chimed in all right you two murphy snapped cool it ya dont think i havent thought that out so what are you going to do with them shirley asked hold out for a reward very fucking amusing all right mike danny cut in whats your plan well first we get a good impression of the key surely to god weve got someone in this camp who can make a duplicate can do it from wood if you get a good impression and how shirley began but the australian didnt let her finish mud he said fucking compounds a sea of mud if you hadnt noticed we get a good impression mud on a brick anythingll do shirley fortescue conceded it was the obvious thing to do then return the keys danny asked right murphy said only we dont have to be particular i mean we dont need to get anyone back into the cabin just toss the keys outside the truck by the drivers running board hell figure he dropped them getting out okay danny agreed but move fast well have all the pow huts up by tonight good as done murphy quipped gripping the keys and disappearing into the crowd of pows chapter sixtynine kacey had done nothing but then the black man put the aks barrel against the little girls temple listen man you dont come out in thirty seconds im gonna waste the kid then im gonna start on her family you want me to bring em out well waste the whole fuckin village man if thats what it takes i aint gonna let you fuck up my business man you dig you dig kacey thought it was from another era another time another place and what the hell is business kacey said nothing his right thumb moving the catch to the full automatic position the black man yelled something in a language other than english and the tailend charlie of the sixman khmer squad ran back a hundred yards or so to the village kacey could hear nothing but the occasional faint whimper like that from a puppy the young girl crying then he heard shouting and a slap that resounded through the rain forest as the tailend khmer was half dragging half pushing two elderly natives a man and a woman laotians most probably down the trail toward the black man the young girl turned as if to run to them but the black man cuffed her about the ears then behind the tailend khmer and the old couple there came a woman armed with the ubiquitous ak and wearing one of the green liontamer hats so popular in the old nva kacey could tell it was a woman for despite the leafy camouflage about her head and shoulders she couldnt hide her figure as she came nearer about twenty yards from where kacey was hiding he could see she was white through the undergrowth kacey caught glimpses of the two elderly laotians being driven half tottering up the trail the old man tripping there was a shot and a scream so loud that kacey felt a sudden chill as he strained to see which of the old people had fallen neither of them it was the young girl whod been shot you hear me man came the black mans voice i aint foolin round here now you come out or well do the old man next man well do the whole friggin village if we have to you understand now move your ass the man was poking the distraught old laotian woman with the ak kacey stood his hands held high all right he shouted and made his way toward the track even as he realized it was a nowin situation there was no doubt in his mind hed be shot the only question remaining was whod pull the trigger salt or pepper chapter seventy a good mud impression was made of the truck key stolen by murphy and already one of the dozens of technician pows from the oil rigs was working on making a duplicate out of the hard base of his plastic tea mug while another was using the file mike murphy had brought him to hone the edges of the pliers into a wire cutter murphy told danny mellin that he saw no reason why they couldnt bust out that night shirley fortescue glancing up at the windriven sky advised against it too much moonlight she said now that the monsoons passed danny didnt like the suggestion of any delay longer we wait the longer upshut and his crew have to detect somethings going down besides we could have an informer amongst us wont take long before someone starts thinking about getting extra rations of rice a bit of meat whatever then i say go tonight murphy said moon or not lets see what the weathers like tonight danny replied might cloud over later this afternoon i say go murphy repeated wait and see danny said i agree shirley put in two to one danny said that it women got the vote shirley said looking at murphy or hadnt you heard right there and then murphy wanted her not only was she goodlooking but there was something about her standoffish manner that excited him that begged to be tamed chapter seventyone in hong kong breem satiated from a smorgasbord of sex with mi yin and two other girls who he was sure belonged to the chinese secret service put on his royalblue robe wandered over to the fulllength glass windows by his fax which overlooked the harbor and grabbed a handful of messages from all around the world the ones that interested him most were from various hospitals requesting donor organs and those faxes from fukien province a cover for beijing transmits requesting resupply of tractor bearings another cover this time bearings referring to bullets tractor to black rhino the type of bullet within minutes he had ordered the tractor bearings to be taken south to the ningming railhead breem estimated that the profit on the sale of the armorpiercing bullets alone would net him around a million us dollars and then there was the kickback from general weis soninlaw who as part of a resurging market in china was weis procurement officer it wasnt the first time that the irony of the chinese buying american bullets from an american to maim andor kill americans struck breem as funny the whole business of international arms dealers reinforced breems conviction that in this world there were only winners and losers and that right now the americans were the losers oh sure press reports were going out on cnn telling how the americans were making up some lost ground in the fighting around someplace called disney hill but breem was more than confident that once the ususvun counterattack met the fresh troops and black rhino armorpiercing ammunition now on their way via rail to the front from ningming the chinese would soon push the americans back besides if the newspaper stories were true then a ususvun force sent in by freeman to secure his left flank around dien bien phu was about to be wiped out by an overwhelming number of chinese airborne troops flicking through the channels breem picked up another news story this one from bbc television news claiming that as well as the chinese airborne a full chinese regiment of men had been moving down the miles of secondary roads from chinas mengzi to the area around dien bien phu whether this force had been sent by general wang before or after freemans ifor was now purely academic what mattered was that ignoring laotian neutrality as freeman had done the chinese now in vietnam were closing in on the valley between dien bien phu and ban cong deng and roads meant heavy artillery not that a lack of roads would have prevented the pla from bringing down their heavy guns in their last war with vietnam they had manhandled heavy guns down piece by piece as the viet minh had done against the french the bbc interviewer asked a military expert who would win all depends on what the troops are like on the ground well the interviewer said freemans lot around dien bien phu are said to be topdrawer troops well see the professor said dryly the pla is no pushover and their lot are also believed to be the top drawer as you put it and there are many more of them one more question professor if we and by we i mean the usvun forces have known about pla intervention through laos why didnt the americans bomb them because the professor said looking bored the president of the united states has obviously made a decision and in my view a perfectly justified one not to allow bombing on neutral territory in this case laos yet he let freeman in with his special force yes but my dear chap that was a field decision by freeman for which my sources inform me he came perilously close to losing his job but hes a hero now the professor blinked his forehead furrowed under the studio lights a hero yes but for how long if he loses what must surely be an outright battle at dien bien phu and at disney hill hell no longer be a hero i can assure you of that i might add that the eminent french reporter pierre lasalle is already predicting a humiliation for the americans on both fronts chapter seventytwo you prick calling me names aint gonna get us anywhere brother im not your fucking brother man you black arent you or that shoe polish i dont go round killing kids then what took you so long to make up yo mind man i thought you were bluffin kacey said until we did her right pepper smiled his ak pointing right at kaceys gut his head nodding back at the two elderly sobbing laotian hostages lifes cheap over here man dyin is a way of life this part o the world kacey said nothing lookit man all we want from you is the location of your boys settin up ambush round here we aint interested in yo fucking war man we just want safe passage kacey stared blankly at him before asking safe passage for what business pepper said easily by now a stream of porters were coming down the track butterboxsized loads suspended from poles and knapsacks on their backs kacey could tell they were khmer rouge and when the khmer rouge didnt want to kill people there was only one other reason theyd be there heroin kacey asked pure the other man smiled white as you inside oreo he jerked his head in the direction of the woman with the good figure and the camouflaged pith helmet aint only thing i got thats white kacey said nothing you coming with us buddy pepper said it was a statement not a question you guys put up any ambushes youll be the first in it right what if i dont want hey the other black man suddenly lost it jabbing kacey hard in the gut i aint fuckin askin asshole im tellin you youre comin or grandma gets it then grandpa right you dig me oreo yes then off we go you screw up nigger and grandma gets it you understand kacey didnt answer so pepper stuck him in the back with his ak you understand asshole yes kacey said and began to walk knowing that up ahead about two miles down the jungle trail his buddies in foxtrot were waiting while behind him came salt and pepper two with the two elderly hostages he didnt know what to do pepper suddenly stopped the column with a hand signal and gave an order softly to salt who led the old folks back to the village he could hear an argument then salt returned with two children a boy and a girl around ten years old kacey figured that pepper had suddenly realized how the old folks might slow him down the kids could move much faster they started off again and kacey still didnt know what to do the only hope the ranger could harbor was the possibility that foxtrots western approaches security team of two would get a good look at him recognize he was one of their own and let him pass before opening fire but what about the two kids no more than ten paces behind him to make everything worse more confused it was getting dark like most things in war kacey mused no matter how well you plan things something always goes wrong what kind of luck was it to be setting a trap for khmer rouge troops and instead run smack into a freakin drug caravan armed to the teeth chapter seventythree danny mellin mike murphy and shirley fortescue were having their own bad luck above the pow camp white clouds of cumulus were crossing the moon like a line of silvered galleons at once obscuring then revealing moonlight the silhouette of the four pla trucks that had been parked in a square around upshuts guarded administrative hut were clear one moment obscured the next and there was no way of knowing how many guards were inside beyond the long coils of razor wire that made up the camps perimeter there were two pla soldiers for each side eight guards in all constantly walking up and down the side theyd been assigned as the camp was not yet complete four threeton trucks were parked at each comer of the camp a type mm machine gun mounted atop each trucks cabin these would soon be replaced by regular guard towers the onagain offagain moonlight wasnt making danny mellins decision any easier if they waited a few days the pla would erect bamboosupported towers equipping each with overarching searchlights yet if they went now and were caught in a beam of moonlight i say go mike murphy urged glancing around at the other pows look he said turning to mellin pretty soon this thick cloud cover is gonna pile up hiding the moon i dont know if it will or not shirley said but im leaning toward murphy they could start on those towers tomorrow and as you said danny someones bound to let something slip out sooner rather than later all right danny said we go everybody know what they have to do mike answered for the others yeah two of us in the cabin one navigator one driver four in the back of the truck one man feeding the other on the machine gun right remember one cut the wire murphy answered the tension making his throat tight two danny said get the two guards nearest the truck shirley answered three in the trucks one of the others said four drive like hell murphy began jesus mike danny cut in sorry sorry four if any team has time we hook the cut wire to the tailboard and pull the shit out of the perimeter and shirley put in shoot up the four trucks inside the compound to stop them chasing usif we have time for better security the people that made up the two squads had all been chosen from the same hut they had split any money theyd managed to hide on themselves upon arrest by the pla some preferring to carry american cigarettes to yuan there was no survival kit unless you included a ball of rice saved here and there whatever was left after theyd donated enough to mellins wall the wall of the hut nearest the wire the wire looking like great rolls of silver in the intermittent moonglow via biofeedback danny was willing his breathing to slow down asking quietly every team got their matchbox compass they all said yes remember the borders fourteen miles due south from here a voice in the darkness asked mike you got those wire cutters tied to your wrist no well youd better you drop them in the dark and cant find em were up shit creek good idea danny said his heart racing damn he berated himself tying the cutters to the first mans wrist should have been one of the first things hed thought of he and the other nineteen in the two escape teams knew that the toughest part would be taking out the twoman pla guards as they walked the couple of hundred yards or so along the wire he and a couple of others were former nam or desert storm types so they knew how to kill but none of them were anywhere near their normal strength having subsisted on little more than a bowl of rice and the weak lukewarm green tea some like danny mellin had ground up the occasional bug with a spoonful of rice and forced it down at least it was protein one more thing danny reminded them be careful with the machine guns i mean when we break out itll make one hell of a big hole for all our fellow pows to run through thats good for everybody plall have to look for two hundred of us if theres a mass break and every pow in here knows the importance of the ningmingdong dang railroad having said his piece danny now turned his attention to the sky it had always amazed him how cloud formations change in seconds that the patch of sky youve been watching changes completely in five minutes it was something hed had ample time to notice while working like mike murphy and the other pows on the rigs in the south china sea something that most people in normal everyday life didnt notice there was such a change occurring now the moons face becoming obliterated as anvilshaped cumulus piled up where seconds before there had been a brilliant orb there were now only dark storm clouds soon it began raining there was nothing gradual about it it simply fell in buckets as was its wont in the region then he saw lightning and a moment later it seemed as if gods artillery had opened up the thunder so powerful they could feel it rumbling in the hut rattling the locked door danny mellin and three others including murphy picked up the base of one of the bunks counted in unison one two and smashed it into the wall where the rice had formed much of the mortar immediately they could feel that several bricks had been displaced by the shock of the bunk base the air pockets around the grains of rice having substantially weakened the mortar between the bricks waiting for the next roll of thunder they counted and hit it again there was choking dust and three of the ramming squad were on the floor mike was stuck halfway through the hole his knuckles badly lacerated but he felt the rain pouring on his head and murmured christ were through were fucking through it was a ragged hole about three feet in diameter quick mellin ordered get to the wire there was another flash of lightning during which the hole was brightly illuminated then there was another rolling barrage of thunder as the ten of them quickly got through the hole and within seconds were at the wire as murphy cut the first strand there was a rustling sound as the tension of the wire gave way but the noise was drowned out by the gutchurning rolls of thunder and the hiss of the rain soon they were halfway through the concertina wire murphy stopped and listened for the sentries he couldnt see any in the rainriven darkness nor could he hear them given the noise of the storm murphy cut more wire stopped and listened and all he could hear was his heart thumping soon within seven minutes of reaching the razor wire all ten of them were through five turning left the other five to the right both teams murphy in charge of the first squad danny the second all crouching low moving along the outer wire were astonished not to find any guards probably in the trucks shirley whispered hope to christ they havent locked the doors murphy whispered in return shirley stay with me you too frank the other three of you go around to the passenger side the sound of the rain was drumming on the trucks canopy rivulets of water running down the fenders and streaming off the running boards suddenly murphy saw a red spot dancing about in the cabin someone in the cabin smoking nice and comfy out of the rain now he said in a hoarse command wrenched open the drivers door and pulled him out already three others of murphys crew were up in the back while the other guard on the passenger side who had also been smoking was on the sodden ground begging for mercy shirley hesitated so murphy hit him with the brick once as he had the driver frank you man the machine gun shirley youre navigator lets go the moment murphy felt the keys in the ignition he couldnt contain his excitement jesus loves me he pumped the gas pedal twice and turned the key the truck started to life running roughly but going he drove the truck halfway down the wire his parking lights on and saw dannys truck or rather its two orange eyes approaching him shadowy figures jumped from both trucks and quickly hooked wire to their tailgate but before starting northward for the secondary road west of ningming both trucks now swung their machine guns about and waited till the next flash of lightning then fired at the four trucks around the administrative block it was about ten seconds before one of the trucks caught fire and from then on they were easy sport for the two gunners another truck lurched hard to its right tires now in shreds the windscreens and engines of the other two shot through with full bursts of mm the remaining two corner pla trucks could be heard starting up but they too were shot up in the surprise enfilade of fire from the two prisonercommandeered vehicles there was pandemonium as lights came on in the administration building only to disappear in the sound of crashing glass as dannys and murphys machine guns raked the building at practically pointblank range the temporary lights in it a perfect aiming point now in the madly dancing glow of the burning trucks dannys and murphys teams could see scores of prisoners streaming out from what had been dannys hut using bunk beds to ram the front doors of the other huts more prisoners came out and raced for the fiveyardwide corridor through the razor wire danny and murphy knew it was time to go a dozen or so prisoners clambering aboard as the wire on the two trucks tailgates was disconnected the trucks heading off on the pow campningming road sporadic ak fire from the compound spitting into the night on disney hill sixteen miles south colonel melbaines counterattack had regained the hills summit by dark the heavy rains slowed the usvun advance in the later afternoon but it sealed the fate of the chinese tunnels on the north side which were now no more than drainage conduits their integrity gone because of the severe structural damage done to them by the heavy us tacatr and artillery fire the day before even so melbaine knew that if general wei could be resupplied fast enough and with enough fresh troops of which he had many more than the usvun it could quickly become a stalemate again followed by another retreat by the americans and their allies and though melbaine was a toughened combat veteran whose sole job was the conduct of war he knew as well as freeman did the symbolic political importance of pushing the chinese beyond disney hill to the nd parallel beyond the border to unequivocally signal the defeat and not merely the rout of the chinese but if the big question for freeman was enemy resupply a danger that might once again push his troops back the pressing danger for danny mellins escapees was whether anyone two miles away at the ningming airfield had seen the explosion of the trucks in the pow compound it was more man likely that the thunderstorm and downpour had muffled or completely drowned out the sound of their explosions but it was just as certain that the brief firefight at the compound had been reported to the pla guard contingent at the ningming airfield the moment general wei heard reports of an attack around ningming he immediately took it to be an angloamerican special ground forces attack on his left flank behind his lines specifically targeting the ningming railhead since wei knew full well that the us president had forbidden any air interdiction inside chinese territory from weis position the enemy ground force was obviously trying what the americans called an end run bypassing the bulk of his pla troops at disney and trying to disrupt his vitally needed ningmingxiashpingxiangdong dang supply line for half an hour all along the line field phones were crackling passing on the information that american saboteurs had reached ningming comrade upshut and the others at the pow camp went along with weis interpretation of the presence of allied troops around ningming otherwise upshut and his comrades would have to confess to the spectacular breakout in their camp and why two of eight platype bm trucks were missing and four of them destroyed two still aflame outside the camps administration hut and then there was the notsominor point of upshut and the others immediately calling for a head count of prisoners in the dancing firelight of what had been the administration building it was a head count infused with fury and panic on the part of the guards the count showed that thirtyseven had escaped about twenty more than in either danny mellins or mike murphys trucks whose twenty had run out through the break in the wire slipping away in the darkness even as the remaining prisoners were ordered to form up in their respective hut groups another dozen or so slipped away on their way back to the huts as the fires from the trucks now subdued by the rain failed to illuminate the open wire beyond the huts to any of the pla guards when danny mellin saw the eggyolk smear of light that was the perimeter lights of ningming airfield he also saw stalks of searchlights reaching out like long white fingers south of the field into the rainslashed darkness this wasnt how the breakout was supposed to end with ningming field suddenly bristling with pla air force troops none of the searchlights had yet reached the two trucks but already flares were bursting in the air beyond the airfields perimeter showing just how heavily it was raining the streaks of rain illuminated like so many icicles and here and there mellin and murphy could see in the distance dim rectangular shapes coming out of the airfields perimeter pla trucks no doubt full of troops both mellin and murphy saw that it was impossible to get past the ningming field using the ningming secondary road and the rain that was obscuring them at the moment was also turning the marshland around the levy road into a sea mellin about fifty yards ahead of murphys truck pumped the brakes and stopped shirley fortescue jumped down and ran already soaking wet to the dark shape of the australians truck the vehicle momentarily etched in the glow of a descending para flare whats up murphy shouted head leaning out the drivers side mike shirley told him danny says we wont get past them and if we go off the road well be bogged down so whats he suggest we swim more or less she answered her voice all but lost in the torrential downpour hes telling everyone to get out of the trucks and head south i want to talk to them murphy yelled you get your mob out shirley ill get mine within a minute there was a sodden conference on the levy leading toward ningming with both danny mellin and murphy knowing they probably had no more than ten minutes before the pla would arrive listen up murphy said dannys right were going to have to ditch these trucks and split up that way its going to take them a bloody lot longer to track us all down including the ones who got through the wire after we got through this way we can tie up a lot of chinese troops that might be otherwise guarding that railroad from here to the border i suggest we pair off lets get going michael it was so unexpected it stunned him it was shirley yeah what are you and your number two she indicated a vietnamesechinese in the trucks cabin yeah well young trang and i figured we might give you a bit of a head start mike danny shouted dont try upshut murphy yelled and it elicited a grim laugh now go on get lost and try to team up with someone who speaks cantonese shadows of the escaping pows were vanishing beyond the flickering gray circles of dying flares and now murphy could see six pairs of yellowslitted headlights like a short fast winding snake no more than a mile away to the north and another two trucks coming from the camp behind as he quickly backed up the truck that mellin had been driving moving it askew so as to block the road he tossed the keys away and uncinching the platype light machine gun from its mount ran back to his own truck and lay down by the rear right wheel already the graceful arcs of light machinegun fire were reaching toward him from the north while behind him murphy could see the two remaining trucks from the pow camp now screaming along the levy he and trang could hear the heavy whoomp of mortars hitting the marsh water about them sending spumes of water over a hundred feet into the air with the two opposing forces heading for one another along the levy murphy suddenly decided to change tactics cmon trang he shouted lets get down the bank into the water quick grab the gun from the other truck and it was in that position from the marsh that trang and murphy let rip with the two mm machine guns soon both lead trucks on either side of the two abandoned pow trucks were afire trang yelling out kill kill in chinese further confusing the issue the trucks behind the lead truck from ningming field were unable to fire for fear of hitting their comrades in the front trucks ncos were screaming at enlisted men to get off the trucks and engage the enemy in the pow trucks because of the direction of fire coming from trang and murphy murphy fired a long burst killing the driver of the first ningming truck and setting its gas drum afire the truck blew up hurling bodies every which way the pla troops in the trucks behind now spewing out to run alongside the levy lets get out of here murphy yelled at trang and after firing the last magazine into the two camp trucks that had come up behind them with both sets of pla firing away at one another murphy and trang dropped the lmgs into the waistdeep marsh water and tearing out reeds for snorkels began swimming away from a situation of utter confusion of chinese firing upon chinese in the raging storm and of escaping pows who by now thanks to murphy and trangs delaying action had had a good twenty to twentyfiveminute start toward the border but if the chinese were confused by that nights debacle by the following morning though the rain was still falling in sheets they were much better organized for the hunt theyd already caught several of the escapees who had become disoriented and headed east in the storm instead of south upshut had them garroted following strict orders not to waste valuable ammunition particularly the expensive black rhino rounds on prisoners some of general weis staff officers initially thought that wei was making a meal out of the escape until wei and this he informed them was why he was being paid yuan a month instead of the yuan of a private drew his staff officers attention to the fact that most of the escapees if they had any brains at all would stay in sight of the ningmingdong dang rail line traveling parallel with it until they reached the border and the country around disney hill wei also advised his subordinates that if any of the escapees most of them technicians from oil rigs decided to try to sabotage the line and were successful even in delaying the heavy artillerymounted supply train to the front for a few hours it could prove decisive in the battle against freemans mounting thrust against disney hill and environs but comrade general an eager young division commander pointed out we you have already posted a man along every fifty yards of track yes yes i know this but anyone who is innovative enough to mix his rice with brick mortar to engineer such an escape out of practically nothing he is a dangerous man comrades and so we must not only try to capture as many of the escapees as possible but we must be particularly vigilant along the thirty miles of rail from here to the border i want all railsection commanders to emphasize this to their troops among themselves weis senior officers were convinced that wei was overreacting in their view and they were correct most of the escapees from the pow camp would have only one thing on their mind to get back through enemy lines to safety and to hell with messing around with weis railway oh yes there might be the odd fanatic who would try something like the genius who pulled the rice trick but with a pla soldier every fifty yards what chance did he have nevertheless wei was not to be dissuaded from taking extra precautions and so onlookers saw the strange sight of a regiment of mounted chinese troops an anachronism in modern war heading out in marshland south of the ningmingpingxiang line able to go where armor or any other vehicle could not and they were protected from us tacair by both the foul weather gods response to freemans prayer and by the president of the united states who like truman forbidding macarthur to take action beyond the chinesekorean border had ordered freeman not to launch air strikes over the sinovietnamese border chapter seventyfour shortly before pierre lasalle returned to her tent marte price had found her asbestoslined film box had been opened shed put a hair between the lid and sides before closing it and now the hair wasnt there while she was no military strategist she believed that in matters of sex and blackmail a good defense was the best offense in this instance her offense took the form of insisting that pierre wear a condom youre the only one chérie he said and im marilyn monroe no truly he told her you are the only one not counting your wife you mean of course but this is the grande affaire no its good sex she said if thats what you mean surely its more than that if you say so you are a hard woman youre the one thats hard i still have some illusions about what oh i dont know about honesty among friends loyalty i hope you are not talking about me he sounded offended no she lied just in general he slid his hand between her thighs i love the smell of you she said nothing for a moment then suddenly mellowing from her public persona of tough hardbitten war correspondent having shown she could mix it with the boys she was now the vulnerable soft lover pierre wanted her to be she gently stroked him and as he grew hard she touched a freckle near the base of his penis all but hidden by his pubic hair you always had that yes he said a little birthmark i guess its cute she said stroking him pierre oui do you love your wife he shrugged you know how it is weve been married you dont love her no not really shes more of a how do you say friend confidante then she wouldnt mind you making love to me he gently pushed her down on the army cot i think she would mind he said with studied understatement he laughed she would mind it very much chérie she moaned softly as he entered her after when they had parted marte went to the media pool office and told the officer in charge that if they were ever asked to send a pix of general freeman in action she hesitated with the wounded she would appreciate them telling her may i ask why miss yes she said bluntly its my fucking picture and anyone who tries to send it is stealing it and rest assured ill have the general on my side yes maam she put a hundreddollar bill on the table so you wont forget yes maam chapter seventyfive kacey now forced at gunpoint to lead the khmer rouge column away from the foxtrot ambuscade out toward the valley of dien bien phu could hear the patpatpat sound of the children walking behind him he knew there was nothing he could do about the little girl who lay dead and discarded by pepper by the trail as if she were nothing more than refuse to be consumed by some carnivore during the night in all his years in the army hed never seen anything so wantonly cruel but now he tried to put it out of his mind knowing he had to stay alert kacey had no way of knowing that radio silence had been broken and foxtrot ordered to withdraw to boost the defense of dien bien phu but he did know that even if the prearranged signal spot on the trail told him the column had been ordered to withdraw soon peppers column would be leaving the jungle canopy and entering deltas fire zone in the valley and being the first man in the column he had no desire to be the first blue on blue in operation homecoming then they heard the faint rattle of machine guns and the louder whoomp of mortars it meant that delta and the pla paratroops were already at it hey rangerfrom the side of the trail it was a scout from delta pepper unleashed a burst the scout dropped to the ground and kacey dived off the trail the scout returning fire at pepper kacey moved fast and low fuck the bamboo fuck the brambles fuck the thorns just run man run as pepper and the delta scout continued the duel the terrified children flat on the trail salt at the rear telling them to stay put or shed do them somebody pepper maybe or the delta scout ran out of ammo only one man firing then the two were at it again jesus could they even see one another or was it all bullshit fire then kacey was yelling to his fellow delta buddy delta hes a turncoat theyre salt and pepper two our mias both gone bad heroin the jungle reeked of cordite and decay the delta scout didnt care who the fuck they were salt and pepper oil and vinegar all he knew was that some fucker was trying to kill him back off kacey yelled to his fellow ranger we can pick em up later no one was moving now no birds nothing except in the distance they could hear the thump and thwack of mortar rounds in the timber around the delta perimeter kacey knew it had to be the pla paratroopers harassing the delta perimeter till they had time to set up heavy arty in the hills around the valley the mist was thicker now and ten minutes an eternity passed and who was heading where kacey kept heading east glancing at his watch compass in the gloom only once did he see the trail a rustred strip about a hundred feet off to his right while to his front a half mile off perhaps he could hear the chatter of smallarms fire through it all he felt that something or someone was marking him either his compadre from delta or pepper who would now be eager to meet up with the pla troopers jesus christ kacey stopped he could be walking into his own delta forces ambuscade they were bound to have rigged one up as soon as hed gone forward to try to warn foxtrot shit a brick it was getting all screwed up as usual didnt matter what plans you made something always went he froze a drop of moisture on the trip wire thats all it was he was in the middle of a claymore alley if anyone can hear me he said in funereal tones get me outta here bout time you fucker we were gonna see how far youd go very funny turn right my man and go straight ahead in three minutes he was out on the trail god it felt good wherere all the chinks he asked just north of us ranger man it was the delta scout whod been keeping parallel with him how far north kacey asked his breathing short and fast not far enough the scout said as he passed his canteen to kacey but theyre just probing now wont do any major stuff till they get arty in around us which theyre doing now wheres our tacair kacey asked in this pea soup home where youd be back in hanoi waiting for it to lift only do so much with infrared man scout tells me said deltas co roscoe that you ran into salt and pepper yeah kacey said theyre probably headed north of us for pla sanctuary you get a good look at them pepper but not her a woman yeah kacey said made a real nice couple moving dope a woman roscoe repeated as if it were an offense against nature all right he said i want you and jonson to stay here on the perimeter where the trail exits the canopy make a damn nuisance of yourselves against any chinks who try setting up mortar positions or whateverspecially since you know kacey what this salt and pepper look like they might just come our way ill send a squad out here with you and suddenly there was a horrendous rattle of machinegun fire both m and chinesetype lmgs then more mortar rounds but for the experienced men of delta like kacey roscoe and jonson it all had the sound and feel of probing no one really sure yet of exactly where the other side was wish we could get out of this fucking marsh jonson said i agree roscoe said trouble is if we do that we no longer have an lz when the choppers arrive theyre not going to come in this weather jonson said theyll come in any weather but clear weatherd help jonson shrugged mischievously then maybe we should let the old man to pray for a typhoon yeah incoming they hit the marshy ground as a pla mm mortar exploded twentyfive yards away earth and water erupting in a high dirty column for deltas roscoe there was something wrong he felt it in his bones something peculiarly disconcerting about the almost laissezfaire way in which the pla mortar squads were lobbing their mortar rounds an almost lackadaisical attack filling in time but for what to sucker deltas british and american forces into wasting precious ammunition in return fire but return fire where roscoe concluded it could mean only one thing that the pla paratroopers having landed farther north near dien bien phu had not yet connected up with the pla ground troops on the way to the valley once they connected theyd no doubt ring the whole valley sealing the americans and their allies in the marsh where they could cut them up piecemeal as giap had done to the french in the very same valley in in fact it wasnt as organized as that few battle plans are the hand of chance always in play due to the unusually heavy rains the pla infantry columns over a thousand strong had round it much more difficult much more timeconsuming in the wet to manhandle the bits and pieces of their heavy artillery south from mengzi to dien bien phu it was now hours and the day before wang had ordered the elimination of echo foxtrot and delta forces but the weather and the apparent failure of echo and foxtrot to yet join delta had fouled up the timetable colonel cheng the pla military officer in charge of the destruction of freemans special forces had wanted to attack at hours while delta force was still only thirty strong the political officer however argued forcefully that it would be better to wait till all three echo foxtrot and delta columns had rendezvoused in the valley so that they might be wiped out to a man such a victory he argued the annihilation of an entire usled force would be infinitely better from a political and international point of view than a piecemeal attack on only one section of it in fact the new battle of dien bien phu would not begin with all of freemans special forces in an lz position and the chinese in position around the valley but would start in earnest around with the sixty echo and foxtrot troops making their way back to delta and the chinese having only half their artillery set up in short the situation was what echos leighhastings would refer to as your usual runofthemill cockup two hundred fifty miles to the northeast the winding summit of disney hill was still in american hands due to the bravery of vinhs usvun contingent in handtohand fighting they had finished off many of the chinese troops forced to vacate their warrens because of flash flooding it wasnt that the americans were backward in going forward with a bayonet but most were equipped with the rifle with grenade launcher tube underneath the barrel to which a bayonet could not be attached though it was a battle where each side was looking for a knockout blow both knew it would be a seesaw fight depending as much on the reliability of supplies to the men at the front as on fighting ability the mist had only partially cleared and hung low in the valleys stretching back north into china where a twoengine train over a mile long could be seen safe from us tacair bringing guns food and ammunition to the pla battalions in the smaller hills and revetments cloistered about the base of disney now more us air cavalry troops and supplies were being unloaded at the southern base of disney it wouldnt make up for the awesome tonnage being hauled by what doolittle martinez and dlupo were already calling von weis express but freeman was trying to get bananaschinook choppers with slings to ferry mm howitzers made lighter than the usual field mms because of aluminum parts in behind the southern side of the hill in order to try knocking out the pla storage areas beyond disney but all there was behind disney now was an inland sea following freemans prayer for good weather a prayer he was asked about at a quick but intensive news conference later that evening weather prayer he said face perplexed feigning ignorance i dont petition the good lord for good weather to kill my fellow man the united states army cline whispered in his ear ah began the general again the usvun forces do battle no matter what the weather after the conference it was clines turn to be perplexed ah sir general yes mantoman general all right mantoman sir why did you lie about the weather prayer well in the interests of press accuracy the padre gave the prayer i merely requested it there was a long pause as they walked back to the operations room youre right bob i lied tell you the truth i dont know why guess ive been getting some pretty lousy press lately and i thought well hell i shouldntve done it im sorry ill correct it in my memoirs if i dont get killed here by god how do they expect me to fight without tacair over chinese territory chinese havent got tacair over us general no because our boysd knock em out of the sky thats why well cline said at least we can go in over dien bien phu with tacair when this foul weather clears if it ever does thing im most worried about is that damn nostop supply train wei has at his service like having a damn walmart at his beck and call we cant send troops across the line general no damn it but we can try pushing their butts past it near dien bien phu colonel berrys men were making their way back toward delta when they ran into a squad of pla hauling a wheel for an artillery piece both sides instantly disappeared except for the man with the wheel and he was dead in seconds his body having literally disintegrated on the trail both sides went quickly into defensive positions and froze it looked like it was going to stay that way for quite a while until another pla squad came across the first took their cue from the one downed wheel and evaporated into the mistshrouded jungle each side knowing that come nightfall the other side would be laying trip wires and mines the chinese had the best of this situation because foxtrot had to get past them before they reached the dien bien phu valley on the far side of the valley five to six miles away and high above the valley floor elements of wangs chengdu army had already installed several aa batteries of su twin mm guns each twin capable of firing two thousand rounds a minute should any american aircraft be foolhardy enough to come down into the mistroofed valley along with the summ there were banks of m mm dualpurpose machine guns set in the antiaircraft configuration threatening any chopper that came within three thousand feet with six hundred rounds of flak a minute the chinese paras had brought the dualpurpose mm guns but the much heavier fourcrew mm aa guns whose wheels collapsed in the firing position had been hauled by vehicle as far south as possible from mengzi in china then manhandled by the infantry over torrential rainswollen rivers and poor secondary roads to dien bien phu but for the chinese the piece de la resistance as pierre lasalle reported gleefully was the chinese mm selfpropelled howitzer whose range over meters meant they could pummel as lasalle put it in le monde any americanusvun position in the valley it was also mounted on a pt tank chassis with an inwater speed of ten kilometers and these were only the guns that deltas ranger scouts had pinpointed there was no doubt in freemans mind that the chinese did not merely want to defeat freemans special forces at dien bien phu but were intent on humiliating the americans as the viet minh had the french almost fifty years ago whoever won dien bien phu would eclipse the famous general giap would defeat the white man again for the french an american defeat would not only exonerate france for the loss in but would as pierre lasalle put it cut the americans down to size the only hope the americans might have freeman knew was tacair support and even then it would be touch and go so long as the valley was locked in by foul weather goddamn it freeman said venting his frustration on my northern front at disney ive got clearing conditions though its still raining but i cant send us aircraft across the parallel on my western flank where im allowed to use tacair i have foul weather locking in our flyboys and our ground forces life isnt fair major no sir but there is another alternative you suggest it freeman said and ill cut you off at the waist before cline could say anything freeman said it for him i know there are only about nine thousand of our boys and maybe ten twenty times that many chinese around us but the international political situation wed create if we were to surrender to give up without a fight would be he paused catastrophic the worlds superpower beaten by chinks good god if that happened we might as well give up on any oil claim anywhere in the worlds oceans and not just in the south china sea no one would take us seriously might as well say take the spratlys take the paracels take any damn thing you like no one could rely on us his fist slammed against the map and caused a six on the richter scale from dien bien phu to ningming no bob whatever happens we have to hold at dien bien phu and we have to push the bastards back at disney therere only two points of battle along the whole line i realize that but they are the two plays the whole world is watching if we win them we win them all theyre the two hardass cases besides if you hadnt noticed we havent yet rescued one single mia the general walked back and forth pausing every now and then to thwack his jodhpurs with a riding crop it was an affectation he took from patton as patton had taken his from others abruptly he turned to cline heard some damned sitrep last night saying some of our boys atop disney could see horses through the big binoculars horses cline said horses freeman repeated dont know what that frog reporterll make of it that kind of frenchman would love to see us lose probably say all we have against us is chinese cavalry it was chinese cavalry used largely as packhorses nowadays to subdue minorities such as the tibetans in hardtoget places but this day they were hunting the pows from what official communiqués to the zhongnanhai hq in beijing were calling the breakout at ningming upshut was told bluntly by the ningming divisional commander that he would be executed for gross negligence of duty unless all fortytwo the morning count had found another five missing pows were recovered dead or alive already he had caught seventeen women and mostly older men americans australians and brits exrig foremen beer bellies out of condition and nothing but boiled rice and swill since their captivity seventeen upshut repeated proudly if nervously to the divisional commander good comrade that only leaves twentyfive unaccounted for the horses and riders were getting tired but upshut kept them at it any man who failed to catch a prisoner would be executed of the remaining twentyfive most of them including mike murphy trang shirley fortescue and danny mellin were nearest the railway shivering chilled and hungry but at least the cavalry were not paying the area near the tracks much attention leaving it instead to the guards one posted by wei every fifty yards along the length of the rail line danny mellin and shirley fortescue were ahead of murphy and trang wading in the paddies adjacent to the ningmingxiash road the rain still falling it brought with it a mist that with the turbulence in the paddies caused by the rain would hide them from view unless they were to get too close to the flooded road despite the chill and the slimy leeches they could feel sucking blood from every part of their bodies they did not let up mellin and shirley were now closer to the road than murphy and trang mellin whispering to shirley that he was going out to get them why arent they safer the farther out they are this paddy is giving way to flooded fields where therell be more cover as you mean we have to wade for fourteen miles to the border no sooner we can get onto the unflooded part of the road between ningming and xiash the better but i might need mikes help doing what ill explain later mellin said and nodded to one of the many tree islands about a quarter mile from a long section of road that unlike the elevated rail line above it was well underwater several trucks bogged down wait over there for us rest up a bit wont be long dragging herself to the base of the tree island up through tall slimy elephant grass shirley hoped none of the specks she could see which were guards on the rail line was using binoculars it was something she neednt have worried about for even given the vital role the railway was playing in the battle of disney the peoples liberation army or any other army in the world for that matter wasnt flush enough to provide each soldier with a pair of tenpower field glasses though the day wasnt cold she was shivering from having been so long in the water as the sun climbed higher the entire countryside steamed with moisture evaporating so thick in parts that as if in a mirage some of the chinese cavalry seemed disembodied from their mounts the elephant grass gave way to a patch of brown grass where a deadly black and yellow krait was curled up basking in the early sun it struck out she dodged letting out a yell the snake vanished a cavalryman heard her so did mellin and others almost immediately she heard the sloshing of water against her tiny island she could hear danny mellins voice but couldnt see him though hed barely left her before shed seen the snake shirley one of thems seen you make out youve hurt your leg cant move im sorry danny i no matter just stay where you are within a few minutes a mounted pla trooper his horse making a loud sloshing noise looked down at her imperiously his right hand waving a revolver at her to get up she made a patheticsounding plea my leg she pointed its hurt i cant a stick of wood as thick as a mans arm and about four feet long shot up from the mist and bashed the troopers head he slumped on the frightened horses neck didnt you hear her you bastard shes fallen and she cant get up mike what are you i thought danny im here too danny told her coming around from the blind side of the tree island shirley nodded at trang who had the horse by the bridle talking soothingly to the animal in cantonese maybe he only understands mandarin mike joked he understands love trang said well keep him on this side mike said where they cant see much from the railway trang i hope you can ride of course swap clothes with him mike said no i dont mean the bloody horse they all laughed all on the edge of that hysteria that comes in the wake of near disaster a sense of overwhelming relief that danny mellin knew he had to get on top of lest it make them foolhardy trang changed into the mounted troopers uniform and using the coiled rope on the saddles pommel danny shirley and murphy tied themselves into a line of three prisoners trang danny called take it slow parallel to the rail line but dont go in close till you see a culvert and trang the asian looked down at the american yes make sure you can get that kalashnikov and sling off in a hurry i will who has the malenkov he meant the sovietmade handgun i do murphy said hope it fires after its been wet i hope we dont have to use it danny said so do i shirley echoed but what happens if another rider sees us then murphy said nonchalantly ill hit him with the fucking stick trang spotted a culvert then about a quarter mile west of them it was difficult to tell exactly but mellin figured the culvert itself looked about a quarter mile long for his plan to work a culvert was better than open track keep a watch out for the maintenance sheds along the track he told the others there should be one every couple of miles bout the size of a dunny murphy explained an outhouse despite her fatigue shirley found the australians buoyant mood infectious and she began giggling uncontrollably as one sometimes does when physically and nervously exhausted trang danny said give me his knife shirley suddenly stopped laughing as she realized what had happened to the luckless cavalryman that murphys blow had killed him that they were at war with the chinese soon they were passing more islands on the flooded plain at one point another pla cavalryman waved and trang waved back his three prisoners strung out behind him my god murphysaid i almost waved to him cmon mellin said sternly i know were all dogtired but lets stay with it if we can a horn beeped soldiers by a bogged truck were waving for trang to come on and bring the prisoners in shit murphy said if trang doesnt take us in theyll suspect something weve got no choice danny said now listen heres what we do go in close wave trang but tell them you have to take your pows to the culvert there was more horn blowing shirley was more frightened than shed been the day she was taken from her rig she knew why the soldiers wanted them to come in they had seen her soaking wet and danny mellin knew too everybody did but there was no option chapter seventysix the battle of disney hill was swinging back in favor of the chinese whose supply trains kept bringing up ammunition and more soldiers but once they moved below the nd parallel and into usvun territory they came under devastating tacair support it was provided by one of the oldest aircraft in the us inventory the skyraider capable of carrying more ordnance than its own weight and with a loiter time that made it the sentimental favorite by far of those downed pilots who while waiting for rescue pickup from the relatively slow skyraider would hang around and shoot up anything that tried to get near them before they could be rescued by chopper it was a paradoxical military situation since the more territory freemans army gained by pushing farther north the less it could depend on tacair because of the washingtondecreed inviolability of chinese airspace beyond the chinesevietnamese border in washington the yalu complex was alive and well in the state department from the days of the deepseated american fear of an allout nuclear battle between the united states and china but for dlupo doolittle martinez and all the others in the seesaw battle of disney hill politics was a bullshit land where men in threepiece suits talked diplomatese over café latte while the men on the line were dying for yards and it was now that general freeman gave another controversial order that melbaines battalion was not to seek any ground farther than the ridgeline of disney hill for at least that way if weis forces crossed the nd parallel in force they would be open to unrestricted tacair as well as artillery bombardment fine doolittle growled why dont we just pull back into the rice paddies and let em have the whole fucking lousy hill you don understand man martinez said adopting a tone of mock condescension you just a dirt farmer dont you know how important this hill is to the negotiations testing our will man here and at dien bien phu aint you ever hearda pork chop hill stick it up your ass doolittle replied and rotate mate wish to christ we had more ammo dlupo said half of that last drop is in the fucking drink all on account of that prayer of his meanwhile the chinks are getting resupplied by the fucking

at us oh nice doolittle said aint that fucking lovely low on ammo and were on for another inning can it doolittle there was the high screech of incoming and reply fire from the few air cavalry mms that had been dropped onto the narrow margin between the paddies and the south side of disney everyone save the us arty gunners crouching low as they could in the sloppy mudfilled foxholes as the afternoon wore on mist and low cloud now mingling in a diaphanous veil over the flooded fields along the ningmingxiash line another dozen or so pows had been caught trang led the trio of murphy shirley and danny mellin closer to the bogged truck but told the soldiers he was under orders to take them to the culvert what if there isnt a maintenance shack inside the culvert trang asked mellin there will be danny assured him ive been watching the spacing between them one every couple of miles besides with a culvert you always have the danger of slides have to have something nearby to mend a track all you have to do trang is take us along the track tell the guards if they bother to ask that youve been ordered to take prisoners to the culvert and check the tracks help fix em with your prisoners if need be everyone knows how uptight general wei and his boys have been about this supply line to the border especially now that the rains washed away parts of the road only supply line they have is the railway yeah mike murphy said with more bravado than he felt theyll expect the recaptured prisoners to be used as coolie labor shirley said nothing the lack of sleep and food and the long tense day in the flooded fields were taking their toll but she didnt want to let on particularly in front of murphy then as if hed been reading her thoughts as they sloshed their way through the waisthigh water and mist toward the rail line murphy said hey trang lets stop awhile im feeling a bit whacked murphy looked at her as he said it and winked weary as she was she smiled at murphy thanks suddenly they heard shots and people screaming somewhere a hundred yards or so east behind them this was followed by shouting sounds like upshut murphy said they all stood still in the water shirley frozen in fear something had slithered across her foot in the muddy ooze that squelched beneath her toes for a moment she was paralyzed with fear she wanted to scream murphy sensed it and put his hand on hers were almost at the rail line he said by way of encouragement tracks are elevated well be on dry ground well as dry as it gets round here he could feel her gripping his hand she was shaking cold and fearful got the jimwhimmies myself he said softly trang had turned in toward the rail line as the light began to fade making it particularly dark in the culvert whose appearance now took on the aspect of a long dark tunnel there was a shout from a pla guard a hundred yards off and trang without as murphy would have said batting an eyelid answered loudly his voice carrying across the water as if through an amplifier his tone even to mellin shirley and murphy who didnt understand chinese was so pregnant with authority that it gave them a surge of confidence as his horse took the incline up to the railway lines shirley slipped trang turning on her with a stream of invective waving her impatiently up the embankment the guard they saw in the dying light looked as miserable danny thought as he himself felt it being no joke standing out all day in the rain with only one meal of hot or rather warm rice and fish sauce delivered by the short food train that preceded the one big supply train a day which wei sent through to the disney front every night they were on the standard fourfooteightandahalfinchwide track now walking alongside the wooden sleepers that had been laid in a bed of stones each segment of rail fixed to its tie by a screw bolt and a steel wedge between the rail and the bolt danny had told trang to pretend to be inspecting the ties for any maintenance that might be needed chapter seventyseven the president of the united states was holding an emergency conference in the white house not in the war room but in the oval office and the significance of that was not lost on chief of naval operations admiral reese and the other joint chiefs of staff the president wanted a political assessment of the situation and he was sure not only from the cias reports from agents in beijing but from his own gut feeling as a politician going into an election year that chairman li peng was calling a similar meeting in the zhongnanhai compound on changan avenue before he would give his request to the delegates in the great hall of the people the president and chairman both knew that the military conflict at disney hill on the chinesevietnamese border and at dien bien phu near the laotian border were chess pieces in a game of political will ostensibly between china and the un but in reality between china and the united states of america the president told the assembled chiefs of staff and adviser ellman that his position was very much like trumans situation in the korean war there it had been pork chop hill over which the usled un force and china had to battle it out while both sides were negotiating at panmunjon as far as im concerned the president announced once the chinese agree to withdraw all their forces to their side of the vietnamesechinese border its over the whole reason this started is because they thought they could invade other peoples territory and claim it as their own but he raised a hand to stifle any immediate objection i realize that dien bien phu is another matter the chinese are farther away from their border there yes the army chief of staff said and theyve chosen dien bien phu on purpose because it was there that france the west was defeated humiliated ellman said yes the army chief of staff agreed thats a better word for it just as we were humiliated admiral reese said in saigon in seventyfive two things americans remember vividly where they were when jfk was shot and the photo of the last helicopter on the roof of the american embassy panicstricken people trying to get the last ride out of town and people being pushed off he paused sure that he had everyones attention mr president if we allow that to happen again if we just pull out nobody in asia will trust us ever again i know a lot of our nam veterans feel like that ironic isnt it the president said that were discussing how best to make our point in vietnam that well stand up to bullies the very country we fought historys full of irony mr president we once fought the british and now theyre at our side at dien bien phu the president nodded picked up the silver letter opener and began tapping on the desk blotter well now that jorgensen has got us in dien bien phu how does he propose to get us out the army chief of staff spoke matter of fact sir you might recall it wasnt general jorgensens idea it was douglas freeman who got us in there with rumors about us mia sightings although to tell you the truth i think he was probably looking for a way to protect his left flank the dien bien phu valley is a good staging area for the chinese and its surrounded by mountains admiral reese put in the president put down the letter opener cant we just pull the usvun special forces out of there not now ellman said number one the us public have expectations of possible mia discoveries second and most importantly from the political angle dien bien phu is crucial whether we like it or not its become a litmus test the world media is fixated on both disney and dien bien phu but thanks to press creeps like that frenchman lasalle the whole world is seeing dien bien phu in particular as a test of us will third satint shows us that the pla must have been building up supplies there for at least a month we all thought it started with the pla paratroop drop but they were probably among the last chinese to enter the area theyre all around us the president sat bolt upright are you telling me weve been set up there yes ellman said started with some cockandbull story about one of our officials in ho chi minh city ellman realized it was difficult for the president to recognize ho chi minh city as anything but old saigon anyway jorgensens hq apparently got some story from freeman about mias in the area one or a hundred i dont know i wouldve thought most of them would be dead by now cia chief noyer interjected he didnt like ellmans tone when the aide talked about some cockandbull story noyer had had a friend whod gone missing only people who had lost someone could understand far as i know mr ellman it was no cockandbull story as you i think ineptly put it one of our people a major noyer couldnt recall the mans name now barker baker but anyway hed followed what he believed was a genuine lead up to dalat wheres that the president asked in the central highlands the president nodded not much the wiser well it doesnt matter now whether he was set up with a false lead to get us involved in a vulnerable area or not the fact is now weve got ninety special forces with the enemy ringed all about them the question is what is it going to take to help them out to win admiral reese said douglas freeman has to resupply his special forces trapped in there and drive the pla out from around them there cant be any half measures here mr president or well have nothing at the bargaining table were barely hanging on to disney hill theyre both freemans call think he can do it gentlemen there was silence in the room chapter seventyeight in addition to the battalion of seven hundred pla paratroopers who had arrived in and around dien bien phu village days before and had seized the small airstrip immediately north of the village now four companies over four hundred men of the plas chengdu twelfth army attacked deltas perimeter some pla rushing on the surface but most over three hundred chinese coming in via the old tunnels used by the viet minh communists against the french the tunnels brought back to basic maintenance level not by the north vietnamese but by chinese and local laotian hill tribes who had infiltrated the area the enemy tunnel rats were popping up like jackrabbits all over the place to fire off a burst and throw a few grenades before the american and british defenders had time to get a bead on them but most damaging was the sustained fire of the enemys mortars many of which like the bigger artillery guns were firing from dugouts so deep in the mountainside that their camouflage nets were at ground level the dugouts themselves shored up with logs the fighting had already reached the wire at places where firefights were breaking out even as the mortar rounds tore into the ground inside the perimeter throwing up clouds of dust that drifted ghostlike over the wire which was littered with over thirty pla dead and wounded for pla commander colonel cheng it had merely been a test of the american and british firepower the defenders firepower or rather their accuracy was much better than that of average field troops colonel cheng had expected as much for his own intelligence section had already advised him of the allies special forces training regimen carrying over pound loads and the required ability to burst into a room of hostages identify the hostagetaker and take him out with one shot the final test for the us navy seals was to go six days with only four hours sleep these were crack troops it would take more than a few forays at the wire to unnerve them both sides realized the airstrip would be unusable by the planes of either side and in any event it had been potholed by the chinese using concretesplitting mines and all supply roads mule trails into dien bien phu within a fiftymile radius from north to ban pa haute in the northeast to bang beng in the southeast had been severed andor were covered by ambuscades of pla infantry in short dien bien phu had been cut off the weather was now clearing in the valley but not enough for accurate supply drops and even when or if the weather cleared freeman knew that any drop zone would immediately be pummeled by what was now recognized as a formidable ring of chinese field artillery and triple a dug into the sites of the plas mountainous redoubts at his phu lang thuong hq freeman was pacing like a caged lion well by god freeman proclaimed to major cline im not doing another navarre i dont follow cline said navarre freeman grumbled french c in c in fiftyfour sent in a swashbuckler colonel christian de castries like general navarre castries was a cavalryman a damn fine one too but when the enemy is all around you with arty you cant fight it like a cavalryman cant do a george patton when youre in a bull ring and the stands are thick with guns no freeman both hands on the map table was staring down at dien bien phu cline could hear the heavy rumble of pla howitzers beyond disney as the sky lit up in flashes cline admired freemans ability to focus as if mesmerized on another battle while a different battle was raging so close at hand no bob the general said when youve got this situation the only way is to dig in hold your position until the cavalry can come in is there a chance of them making a fighting withdrawal the major asked the general was slowly shaking his head ninety men even if echo and foxtrot can reach delta my guesstimate is wed be lucky to get out one or two but theres another reason why we cant try a fighting withdrawal with that he thrust his hqs copy of the order from the pentagon adding it went direct to jorgensens hq south in hanoi the message read negotiations for ceasefire make it imperative you hold position hold until relieved pawns cline said disgustedly throwing down the message theyre not here they dont care about our men then freeman the acerbic critic of the us state department stunned cline no theyre right bob we try to run out of this at disney or dien bien phu or show wang a white flag were finished in this part of the world we havent got nearly the size of force here the french had and they lost but we have to hold our will is being tried here just as it was for france in fiftyfour if the enemy busts our balls here like they did the french thats it for the american century in asia chinall rule the roost including japan and everybody else but the general took in a long breath of air we have a cavalry the french didnt have planes oh the french had aircraft not enough but they had em now giap that clever little history teacher made sure that as well as cutting all the trails into dien bien phu he also hit the big airfields to destroy the french air force on the ground but one thing the french didnt have was freeman was interrupted by a signals officer handing him the news that all major usvun airfields within striking distance of dien bien phu were under chinese sabotage attack over half the aircraft most of them heloshad already been destroyed what cline said what didnt the french have a big boat freeman replied called the enterprise freeman knew not to call a ship a boat in military parlance but cline realized that douglas freeman had a churchillian sense of history and was conscious that if his special forces could take a pounding at dien bien phu and could hold then freemans words to him this night would enter military legend we dont have to win major freeman added as if reading the others mind all we have to do is hold yes i know cline said somberly until relieved ive heard that somewhere before i think freeman said focusing on dien bien phu and in what struck cline as a peculiarly jocular tone given the odds well do some gardening a little clear cutting now bob i want you to have signals flash an order to our boys in dien bien phu not to radiate out in patrols to engage the enemy we already know where the enemy is all around us what berry leighhastings and roscoe have to do is dig in interconnecting trenches with zigzags and have the trenches reinforced with whatever they can find i want them to dig deep keep the trenches narrow behind razor wire and machinegun strong points and claymore mines around the whole perimeter and to be ready to cannibalize enemy mortar ammo we cant get heavy artillery to them yet but now that all columns delta echo and foxtrot are in dien bien phu on the vietnamese side of the laotianvietnamese border we can use tacair thats going to be our artillery well drop them the razor wire asap how about the weather cline asked well go in with infrared fighters and bombers were going to lose some if they go in as low as i have to but without them our boys wont be able to hold cline doubted if delta echo and foxtrot could hold even with tacair but he recalled freemans earlier point that there was an enormous difference politically between being wiped out and surrendering quite bluntly being wiped out meant military defeat but not a breaking of will a difference that was critical for washington at the negotiating table of course there was always the possibility that wangs buildup in the high ground above dien bien phu was much less than anyone thought and that the memory of the stunning french defeat at dien bien phu was coloring usvun intelligence reports the writers of these reports might have recalled how before giaps siege of french intelligence had performed so badly assuring navarre that the enemy buildup because of the rugged limestone cliff terrain could not be so substantial as to defeat the french garrison echo foxtrot and delta were now busy digging in the complex of interconnecting trenches leading to and from machinegun strong points in front of which they had cleared fields of interlocking fire in the shape of a triangle later that evening fiftypound spools of razor wire were successfully dropped before the plane was shot down exploding on impact the most optimistic situation report sent to hanoi and phu lang thuong by colonel berry was that he estimated from interdiction of pla radio traffic that his ninetyman special forces were outnumbered by at least twenty to one when everyone knew full well that all other things being equal such as artillery the optimum number of men needed for an attacking force to be victorious over a dugin force was a fivetoone advantage based on this rule of thumb the situation for the americans and british in dien bien phu in pierre lasalles latest report to cnn was hopeless how long do you think they can hold pierre the cnn anchor inquired lasalle gave his usual gallic shrug twentyfour perhaps fortyeight hours at most thank you pierre fortunately for colonel berry major leighhastings and captain roscoe cnn reports were not considered the voice of god and when berry heard the cnn report off satellite feed it inspired rather than depressed him he immediately requested reinforcements although he knew that this depending on what freeman was willing to send him might make it necessary to fight for a drop zone north of the marshes at the old airstrip immediately north of dien bien phu village while he was waiting for freemans reply berry conferred with leighhastings and roscoe drawing up a plan to do something that he thought the pla would not expect from the dugin special forces an attack to take the airstrip utilizing the fact that the nam yum river formed the left flank of his triangle freeman pored over the threedimensional computer mockup of dien bien phu there was no doubt that berry had to be given reinforcements whatever it took to hold the garrison until the negotiations reached a more favorable stage the question was how and what to give him and how for maximum defensive effect for freeman to think in the defensive mode was difficult for he still clung to the axiom that mobility was the best form of defense though in reality he knew such tactics could degenerate as they did for navarre into merely feeding men to the enemys guns any fool could say charge when will our planes from the enterprise reach dien bien phu freeman asked seventeen hundred hours sir fifteen minutes dropping their bombs either side of the valley yes sir weather report mist lifting beautiful freeman said sarcastically we wait for the valley to clear and when it does well be flying into night cline reminded him that with infrared and terrain matching radar the planes should still be able to put the smart bombs just where they wanted well lets hope so wangs bound to have planted the high ground either side of that airstrip with triple a turn the whole valley into a shooting gallery he picked up the weather report no moon well thats something no moon meant not enough light for the pla to attack and brought back memories to freeman of the viet cong moons years before if the brilliant use of camouflage nets by giap had fooled french reconnaissance in then the pilots flying the fighterbombers from enterprise were fully confident their infrared radar would pick out the enemys hot spots even if as giap had done the guns were buried in deep shoredup earth revetments from which they could be pulled and fired as needed as the f tomcats and f hornets peeled off and came into the valley heading north the infrared images were popping up all over whether from the residual heat of weapons having been fired earlier in the day or from collective body heat it didnt matter and the hot spots on the hills told the pilots where to place their fivehundredpound laserguided bombs soon the valley erupted in strings of earthshaking explosions and an intensity of crisscross tracer triple a of a density not seen by veteran pilots since the attacks on baghdad in the pilot of an f had just slid a thousandpound lgb down the beam when his cockpit began rattling violently everything from his caution lights through his backup gauges digital display and headsup display was shot to pieces and his control stick wasnt responding he pulled the eject straps over elbowed in pulled heard the bang of the explosive bolt and he was in a swirling cold wet pitchdark sky illuminated by long gentle arcs of triple a multicolored tracer and by the blossoms of orange light below where bombs had hit he felt the shock waves several minutes later he made a remarkably light landing in a marshy area and had just released his harness and chute when he heard dont move it was a distinctly british voice and the pilot didnt move get to you in a jiff old boy it was leighhastings aware that the american pilot had just landed in a tripwire claymore minefield off strongpoint echo overhead phantoms roared in firing salvoes of inchdiameter rockets and bursts from three mm machinegun pods strafing the jungle at the rate of six thousand rounds a minute then came skyraiders firing their four mm guns each skyraider carrying over eight thousand pounds of ordnance it was all very impressivelooking the multiple explosions lighting up the valley at moments like a string of chinese firecrackers in a long alley it was good for the morale of freemans trapped men but they found via a short but ferocious enemy artillery barrage on the triangle later in the morning mist that few if any of chengs heavy guns had been silenced jesus one englishman opined i thought they walloped them last night so did i kacey replied sounded like the fourth of july arou a cluster of four mm hit the triangle throwing wet mud and dust into the air before the barrage ceased the depressing truth that the raid from the enterprise had not destroyed the enemys dugin arty came via freemans message that morning to the garrison at dien bien phu he said he would reinforce dien bien phu with a battalion of airborne as soon as the reduction in enemy firepower was sufficient to give him confidence to send in troopcarrying helos his message explained how aerial recon had shown hq that what the enterprise pilots had seen as hot spots on the infrared were bogus revetments they were bombing a lot of warm holes hurricane lamps paraffin stove tins anything thatd show up on the infrared in his headquarters two hundred miles to the east at phu lang thuong freeman was feeling far less confident than he had the night before he was unusually tense and for him extraordinarily racked by conscience torn between his overall obligation as field commander and his sense of obligation toward the men hed sent in to dien bien phu it hadnt been a popular decision in either washington with the president his commander in chief or with jorgensen in hanoi and now instead of the hardhitting special forces preemptive strike hed envisioned the ninety men or however many were left were cut off deep in northwest vietnam what had he told bob cline laudace laudace toujours iaudace and now he was sitting on his bum in phu lang thuong with an impending disaster both northward at disney and west at dien bien phu bob im going in where dien bien phu i ought to be there damn it its my responsibility begging the generals pardon an alarmed cline cut in but your responsibility is with disney as well as dien bien phu youd be robbing paul to pay peter look a clearly agitated freeman responded im personally responsible for sending these guys into dien bien phu from first to last it was my idea maybe so general but i dont think its a good idea if you go into dien bien phu youre as much as announcing youve no faith in your commanders there that cant be any good for morale to relegate berry leighhastings and roscoe subordinate to your command not if i go in as commander of the airborne then sir youll undercut the commanding officer of the airborne cline paused general sir no one doubts your courage if thats whats at issue here youve been awarded a string of medals as long as your arm youre right bob he paused all right then lets draw up the reinforcement plans first we have to do some deforestation yes sir are you going to use any herbicide only if i have to why im thinking about the press if they got on to that i mean the herbicide you have in mind hows it compare with agent orange freeman was already drawing up attack plans against the enemys lines of communication beyond the dien bien phu valley already totally immersed in the details of his tacair plan codenamed zebra and walking about a sand table mockup of the echo foxtrot delta triangle like a pool player lining up his shot he quietly responded to clines question about the herbicide compared to the herbicides we have now major you could use agent orange as a douche christ dont worry i wont use it if i dont have to as trang approached the culvert the rainsodden guard forty yards away stepped out from a leanto made of a ground sheet and a collapsible teepee frame of three bamboo sticks and gave him a desultory wave trang waved back and asked when the next supply train was due the guard answered in about a half hour wheres the nearest maintenance shed trang asked ive got orders to check the tracks make sure everythings secure after the rain another hundred yards or so into the culvert the guard said uninterestedly watching shirley walk by her figure in sharp relief under her sodden clothes the guard looked up at trang id like to check out her track eh trang gave an appropriate grunt of agreement and his horses head drooping with fatigue led his three exhaustedlooking prisoners on trang couldnt see the next guard even after going into the culvert for another thirty yards the drizzle of rain no doubt helping to obscure the view soon shirley whispered to mike murphy to tell trang she could smell tobacco smoke you sure murphy whispered are you kidding shirley said im allergic to it i can smell a cig be quiet mellin whispered behind them murphy was about to pass on the information to trang who told them quietly that he could see the red glow of a cigarette bobbing about looking back trang could no longer see the guard theyd passed by now they were well over a hundred yards into the culvert and trang could just barely make out the outhouselike shape of a maintenance shack and now with a surge of relief he realized why shirley couldnt see the red glow of the cigarette although shed smelled it downwind the guard was inside the shed having a quiet smoke the bobbing glow of his cigarette visible only now and then through the slit of the open door comrade trang called out the cigarette disappeared yes comrade came a gruff accommodating voice ive got a few prisoners here were to use them to help check the tracks we need a few tools a rail is loose back there oh all right comrade authorization yes trang said reaching in his top left tunic pocket the guard unslinging his rifle the better to see the authorization you have a flashlight comrade he asked got everything trang said who out of the darkness brought the makarov mm crashing against the others temple the guard dropped with a thud his head bumping the door as he fell the next second murphy had slit his throat cmon he said to shirley hes about your size cmon cmon the rainll wash the blood away quickly in the shed murphy undressed the man handing the clothes into the shack where shirley despite her five feet three inches could hardly stand upright but she was done in a few anxious minutes and murphy gave her the chinese t an ak lookalike its got a full mag in and the safety buttons on feel it his warm hands touched hers yes goes off this way got it yes i think no thinking have you got it yes if you havent got time to pass it to danny or me just tuck the butt under your right arm hold it tight and fire like youre aiming a hose itll jump high on you but dont let it frighten quiet it was danny there was a noise like a faucet turned full on the horse was urinating on the track for chrissake murphy cussed rude bastard nearly crapped myself trang danny said you move up ahead about twentyfive yards shirley back the other they heard the distant whistle of a train and it reminded mellin just how far they were from the border given that the pla engineer on the train could still sound his whistle without announcing it to the enemy soldiers on the border thirteen miles away if we succeed each goes his own way but get away from the line fast remember to head south what if it isnt a supply train murphy asked as he took the makarov pistol and trang and shirley now on foot walked in opposite directions down the track no one had answered him each intent on his or her task danny mellin handed murphy a twofoottall tsocket wrench the top of the t being the handles the bottom of it a socket that fitted over the screw bolt that held down the tie and bracket up against the rail when a screw bolt was taken out the tight steel wedge between the tie bracket and the rail could be knocked out with a sledgehammer we wont use the hammer till weve taken all six screw bolts out mellin explained that way we make all the noise as the train gets closer use its noise to cover our noise bit bloody dicey isnt it dan you got any better suggestions yeah blow the fucker up yknow like the movies a pack of tnt and the little plunger box they heard the whistle coming closer keep working on those screw bolts three to go hurry as danny hit the first wedge and knocked it out it sounded as if itd be heard for miles christ murphy said there was the sudden chatter of a submachine gun danny hit another wedge christ shut up damn it danny said and hit the wedge again before it came out the whistle sounded shriller now and they could see a shape coming at them there was a womans voice shirley what the murphy began the a guard back there was coming up the track i shot him good girl murphy said danny was hitting the fifth wedge not even looking up mike throw those bolts to hell and gone as murphy did so danny hit another wedge and it shot out they heard firing from trangs direction farther on but knew or prayed it wouldnt be heard over the mounting rumble of the train about a half mile off now they heard trang they assumed it was trang firing again danny hit the last wedge and it wouldnt budge he was exhausted they could hear the train coming up the straightaway before the bend that was the culvert mike grabbed the sledgehammer and hit the sixth wedge and it was out run danny gasped run somebody perhaps the engineer or fireman might have seen something wrong up ahead but the yellow sliteyed headlight showed only the shape of trangs horse as it took off down the culvert between the tracks as shirley danny and murphy clawed their way frantically up one side of the embankment they could hear the pained metallic squeal of brakes being applied and see rushes of bright golden sparks but by now the locomotives wheels had reached the loose rail and immediately plowed off the track into the stones the headlight slamming into one side of the culvert even as the locomotives wheels were frantically reversing in a futile effort to stop the train the locomotive was now at a more acute angle to the track the long string of boxcars and wagons telescoping into one another and climbing higher and higher on one another so that the great pile of wrecked cars formed a logjam as it were from one side of the culvert to the other already several cars were alight from the spilled fire of the locomotive the flitting shadows of guards could be seen some approaching the enormous rubble of overturned cars and once they realized the trains cargo was about to cook off turning and running down the culvert as fast as possible there was an enormous orangered fireworkslike display as kalyusha and mm rockets went off followed by a sustained roar made up of tens of thousands of black rhino going off the culvert because of its tunnellike shape a natural conduit for the force of the multiple explosions trang disintegrated in a hail of black rhino splinters his blood vaporized to a fine mist and amid all the noise screams and chaos of pla bodies and supplies toppling out the only thing danny mellin could hear and didnt want to was the distraught neighing of the horse cut down by shrapnel and lying helplessly somewhere on the track if he could have he wouldve gone down to finish it off but by now the area in the culvert was swarming with dazed troops their officers yelling adding to the confusion of the wreckage a parachute flare shot out of the burning culvert and now the full extent of the derailing could be seen to have surpassed mellins wildest expectations it would take the pla days at least to get a rail crane up from ningming and even with the number of troops wei had at his disposal it would take days to clear the culvert let alone get another train through as danny mellin shirley and murphy headed south through the sodden fields they were exhausted their adrenaline used up in stopping the train and weakened by the effort they stopped for a while to rest and shirley searched her baggy sodden pla uniform for any rations but found only a mush of wet tobacco and rice paper dont worry danny advised them dehydrations the problem and we sure arent going to die from thirst you can eat the eucalyptus leaves murphy said you sure it was shirley feeling a lot calmer now in her mind but very shaky and suffering from a stunner of a headache from lack of food eucalyptus leaves murphy said sure im sure koala bears live on em koala bears look pretty dopey she said goodnaturedly then suddenly fell quiet i hope he didnt feel much no murphy said i mean he wouldnt have felt a whole car of ammo going off like that cmon danny said lets try to make as much mileage as we can tonight therell be chinese swarming around here tomorrow once they figure out the line was sabotaged how far south danny as the crow flies ten eleven miles christ murphy said didnt figure we were that close much longer if we kept to the rail tracks were practically home mate thats just the border danny informed him then well have to work through to our lines wherever they are oh ye of little faith murphy joked despite his fatigue he was still high on the rush of stopping the train pipe down danny cautioned right murphy said carrying the pla rifle giving the makarov to shirley now they could see a saffron glow blurred by the rain hanging suspended like an enormous upturned bowl of flames over the culvert chapter seventynine the satpix relayed to freeman wasnt of the best quality but it told him exactly what had happened a massive train wreck on the plas main line of communication he didnt hesitate and like a juggler in midact shifted all his attention from one problem dien bien phu to the other ordering all elements of second army in the disney area to press home a dawn attack preceded by a creeping barrage from the mms and mms on the margin between the southern base of the hill and the flooded paddies even as his artillery began to pulverize the pla positions on the north side of disney freeman like a good political cadre was making damn sure as he put it to his senior commanders that every man in the usvun force on disney would know that the plas logistics line had been severed and that this was the best chance they had as a gray dawn stole upon the hill the usvun troops over ten thousand of them moved from disneys ridgeline to the northern slope it was touch and go for six and a half hours of close combat but like one grain at a time in an hourglass the ratio of mortars between the usvun and the pla moved from to to in the allies favor weis commanders had to give ground not much at first a hundred yards or so but by the usvun had pushed off weis best troops running low on everything because of the train wreck particularly ammunition the pla had to give more ground until it was a rout and freemans forces owned the hill this also allowed the us air cavalry to put down its helos without being fired upon from disneys crest chapter eighty at dien bien phu things were not nearly as upbeat the ninety men of the special forces werent so much depressed by the sense of siege as by the lack of action though they had been welltrained in defensive maneuvers their natural disposition was to go on the offense they also knew that if they went on the offensive now they would be quickly pounded and eaten up by the vastly larger enemy force the big enemy guns the experts had told navarre couldnt be brought through such terrain were there and in fine shape though firing sporadically they forced the men of echo foxtrot and deltas who had turned the first initial of their designations around to form def and defiantly hoisted a makeshift flag above the triangle of deep interlocking trenches and firing bays to scurry for cover def was equipped with mm mortars but overall there was no heavy ordnance freeman knew that his first enterprise raid was a failure and that if he was to avoid a second dien bien phu defeat of the kind meted out to the french in he would have to order in the three companies of airborne to help enemy artillery or not to avoid or at least minimize the massacre that could result because of enemy triple a on both sides of the valley freeman ordered that the airborne go in that night and here american technology in the form of the infrared goggles which led to ferocious headaches after several hours of wear allowed the slick pilots with a fully nightequipped mj pave low helo acting as pathfinder to ferry in the nine hundred men the thousands of pla troops could hear the choppers landing and opened fire with their artillery but however good their gunners were during the daylight using open sight downthebarrel direct fire at night it was a different story even with the help of para flares turning night to flickering daylight they were less effective because of the inferior computer guidance targeting necessary for the kind of deadly vectored indirect fire of the kind provided now by the american airborne gunners the mms and mms were ferried in by the huge dragonflyshaped ch tarhe helos to positions behind the ring of hills that surrounded the valley and were fired without their crews ever seeing the enemy but with devastating results in short the more sophisticated computerfiredirected american guns could shoot from beyond the hills out of sight of the enemy with the chinese guns unable to silence them it meant that while us artillery could fire at any enemy gun position whose flash gave away its position the pla could not fire back with any accuracy worth talking about nevertheless the pla with their hidden dugin guns and their mortars did their best pounding what they could see below on defs triangle the bombardment resulting in over a hundred american airborne casualties during the hectic unloading phase as soon as the hueys unloaded their cargo of men and supplies for the def garrison they began loading up with dead and wounded a pla mm round hit a fully loaded huey and in the ghostly flickering of flare light and gas tank explosions unidentifiable body parts could be seen dangling and dripping with blood from the nearby bushes and trees one of the legless torsos belonging to a soldier who had apparently remembered his drill sergeants advice at fort bragg for the media found his set of dog tags in his boots while this disembarkation was taking place at dien bien phu hundreds of miles eastward in the south china sea elizabeth franks her grape refueler jacket barely visible on the rainslashed flight deck of the uss enterprise fought to keep her footing as the giant carrier came about heading into the wind as soon as gunners mate albright stevens stamping his feet to keep them warm got off his watch he and elizabeth would find some warm hidden place and there all the stress and strain of the flight deck would be released for a split second elizabeth franks was nearly blown overboard as the blast from a phantom its engine moving onto full afterburner was not fully deflected by the watercooled shield someone a yellow shirt grabbed her barely in time the phantoms were punishing the pla at several locations in the spratly islands where wangs troops had defiantly and bravely or stupidly depending on your point of view raised the chinese flag in addition enterprise was also standing by to launch operation landfill drawn up by the commander of the second army general freeman as an alternative strike force now that so many air force bases east of dien bien phu had been struck by pla hitandrun saboteur squads the def triangle now had an extra thousand men in and around it where a circle a quarter mile in diameter ringed the dugin garrisons timber and sandbagreinforced command and hospital bunkers the initial disorganization that besets most airborne for the first few minutes after touchdown provided an opportunity for wang to attack but the mistshrouded valley dissuaded both the pla and def from moving too far from base positions though the chinese still outnumbered the garrisons defenders more than ten to one wang was waiting for when he could best use his dugin artillery flare light had allowed his gunners to get a few deadly salvos by direct fire down at the garrison but the flashes of his guns would also show their positions to freemans forces wang wanted to wait for daylight to make maximum use of his guns son of a bitchll attack at dawn freeman opined to colonel berry over the secure scrambler phone so all you can do al is dig dig like a bastard because the only way they can get that piece of real estate is to take it by handtohand their artilleryll be pounding you and well be pounding them but in the end they have to take the friggin wire like they did with the frogs berry didnt need a history lesson he needed more time to inspect and to exhort his men to shore up their positions against what he was sure would be the coming massive bombardment from the plaowned hills along with the reinforcements freeman had sent in were dozens of the latest heckler koch mm automatic grenade launchers the lightest on the market and constructed so their thirtytworound belt could be fed from either the right or left instead of firing machinegun bullets with the hk theyd be firing machinegun grenades i dont fuckin care doolittle said thoroughly pissed at being relieved on disney only to find himself and his colleagues reassigned as support troops for the airborne freeman had apparently predicted that there might be a lot of massed assaults on the wire and that men already blooded in this kind of combat should be airlifted into either defs triangle or the outer defensive circle i dont fuckin care doolittle repeated as they were digging in i mean weve done our bit havent we time for a bit of friggin s and s whats that dlupo asked not really caring sex and sex doolittle said i wanted to say something to the captain fore they carted us off from disney wanted you to back me up eh and what appens dlupo cant find his tongue and martinez well youre a great fucking disappointment you are martinez yes sir no sir three fucking bags full sir wed love to go to dien bien fuck well youre here now doolittle so make the best of it bsides its pretty important thats right dlupo echoed yeah course doolittle said theyre all bloody important especially when you might buy it the french lost here martinez said oh doolittle said i get the picture wherever the frogs get beat we ave to go in an put it right that the story nah martinez answered you know i mean its important politically oh doolittle said taking a rest from digging a shooting bay i see now weve got henry fucking kissinger here since when did you give a shit about politicians marty i dunno i thought about runnin for congress sometime oh gawd protect us congressman marty doolittle dlupo said why dont you shut up and dig all right all right he started filling sandbags again course yknow christ theres a lot of noise going on round here its called artillery doolittle our guys and their guys remember yeah well you know where theyre gonna hit us across the fuckin river on our left flank all this rain everybody figures they wont try to cross dlupo tossed up another bag as flashes of artillery outlined his arm like a broken tree theyll hit us from all directions at once of course everyone knows that i know where id hit em where martinez asked behind their latrines bullshit nope thats the truth mate pla never post enough guards near their latrines no wonder dlupo said if they smell bad as you oh very droll doolittle commented you guys want some coffee it was a young airborne corporal id kill for coffee doolittle said well you might have to if those gooks have a crack at us in the morning they took the coffee quietly and gratefully the mist was still heavy in the valley and they knew as did everyone in the thousandman defense force spread out from the defs inner triangle to the outer gun ports of the halfmilewide circle that as dawn approached when it was most difficult to distinguish the shape of a man from the shape of a tree an attack must surely come general wang was no doubt just as determined that dien bien phu should fall as was freeman that it should not when the first salvo of chinese mm and mm artillery hit the circle the earth shook violently and a machinegun emplacement was gone two men dead and several more injured as everyone hit the deck hugging the dirt in the trenches the din was earsplitting within fifty seconds american s were answering the flashes and soon the artillery bombardment fell off within thirty seconds wangs first wave of sappers hit the wire with everything from explosive charges strapped to their waists to satchel charges ready to penetrate the perimeters defenses and wipe out command bunkers and strongpoints there were explosions fountains of red earth screaming all around and shadows to the west coming through the mist rubber boats full of pla on the river the boats now in a hail of mortar fire with one direct hit flinging bodies skyward before they fell back and were swept away some clinging to the boats remains mortars still rained down giant spumes of water erupting amid the multiple spouts caused by the americans pouring in m fire as well the initial shock of the sappers wave was now over and though many more explosions were heard along the wire the sappers were paying a terrible price for their initial attack their bodies and bits of them were strewn all along the wire the holes theyd opened already being breached by the second assault this one by pla tujiduistorm troopers heavily armed and moving fast to enter the bunkers and trench system that was the outer circle these were met by a curtain of m machinegun fire and from the def triangle by mortar fire of such concentration that only a handful made it into the circle trench ring followed by earthshattering explosions and the screams of some of the dozen or so airborne troops torn to pieces by the c exploding in such narrow confines over thirty pla storm troopers were inside the circle for about a minute before the airborne cut them down a bugle blared and as suddenly as it had begun the chinese attack ceased beat the bastards one of the airborne proudly announced there must be forty fifty dead chinks out there terrific martinez said that only leaves bout five thousand in fact wangs forces including porters and underground engineers were twice that number and what had depressed martinez doolittle and dlupo as well as berrys special forces contingent was the enemys morale there had been absolutely no hesitation at the wire even from defs triangle it had been at once impressive at least from a strictly military point of view and frightening to see how many of the sapper wave were suicidal berry was anxious for the mist to lift so a striker force of fighterbombers from enterprise could hit the hillsides east and west of dien bien phu and suppress wangs triple a then the air drops could be made within the halfmilewide circle without too much interference wang has a measure of us now leighhastings commented from his bunker at the northern tip of the def triangle he had punched in me numbers on his prc so the message couldnt be intercepted of our outer ring berry replied but theyre not our boys i dont mean any disrespect toward the airborne theyre doing a great job but leighhastings cut in but our chaps are best at offensive operations you think i should be using them now berry asked not necessarily i understand your strategy of the strong control defense but each of our def chaps has a starlight scope and the met report from freemans hq is that the mist and low fog will abate later today tonight itll be a vc moon just enough light for wang to attack by but not enough for us to see them leighhastings also pointed out that starlight scopes which freemans g had confirmed the pla did not have at least not in any substantial numbers would allow the special forces troopers to play havoc with the pla in the dark ill take your suggestion under advisement berry responded ill request more starlight scopes for the airborne good show i think incoming berry shouted and the next moment leighhastings was thrown to the floor of his bunker his radio flying out of his hands and hitting one of the wooden cross beams he heard the high whistle of more artillery theyre at the wire someone shouted and the outer circle defenders opened up with everything they had at least thirty to forty pla were inside the outer wire some of them having played dead outside the wire from the first attack it was chaotic a satchel charge detonating midair killing more pla than americans a screaming bayonet charge by pla into one of the trenches american and british fighting pla handtohand in the trenches an m jammed its quickcharge barrel glove lost and both machine gunner and assistant killed within seconds but the hk automatic grenade launcher was proving its worth as airborne gunners sprayed the breakthrough points with threeto fiveround bursts creating in effect a wall of smallarms artillery the fragmentation grenades cutting the chinese down as narrow breakthrough points forced them to cluster at the openings in the wire running over their dead and dying comrades another artillery duel erupted the pla issuing direct fire inside the circle willing to kill their own as freeman had done on disney to gain ground by forcing the enemy back into the network of trenches had it not been for the z turns built in the trenches there would have been many more american and british casualties the z turns like a traffic island were plonked into the middle of a trench where one man could hold off a whole squad martinezs m overheating jammed and had it not been for doolittle cutting down two chinese with his m martinez would have been dead dlupo out of ammunition threw his rifle at a chinese soldier who ducked and bayoneted the american before being chopped to pieces by an m burst at near pointblank range medic doolittle yelled firing his last grenade from his m launcher at the wire a medic was already at dlupos side stanching the blood flow and yelling for a stretcher the next moment the medic was dead from a burst from a chinese t rpd a gaping bloody hole where his chest had been it seemed like minutes to dlupo but in reality it was only a matter of seconds before a stretcher arrived and he was taken away to a hospital bunker inside the triangle as dlupo hemorrhaging profusely was being prepped for surgery a chinese who miraculously had made it all the way from the outer wire circle into the def triangle without a scratch leapt into the trench through the curtain an artillery round shaking the overhead light violently and began firing he killed two nurses before the surgeon whipped his scalpel across the mans throat immediately returning to his patient while calling for orderlies to take out the dead nurses and telling a wheyfaced medic to get a special forces type from def down here right now tell him to stand outside the prep room yes sir dlupo was dead kacey the ranger who had run into salt and pepper arrived a minute later with a winchester shotgun whose hardened lead slug was guaranteed to stop a train and whose fléchette rounds or darts thirty of them were lethal up to three hundred meters any fucker jumps down here kacey proclaimed to no one in particular his fuckin headll end up in laos a man did jump down but kacey held his fire the soldier one of those who like doolittle had been flown in from disney had his right hand missing was covered in blood and was staring disbelievingly at something he was carrying in his left hand it was his other hand having been sheared off at the wrist jesus kacey yelled medic on the double the bugle sounded again and the chinese most of whom had failed to make it more than fifty yards into the circle began to withdraw this time the airborne raked the bodies with machinegun fire to make sure that no live ones were left waiting for the next attack in the two attacks so far over forty airborne and two of berrys men had been killed and over pla hard hats the hard hats or piss pots as the americans called them were steel khaki helmets a sign that wang was using only strictly professional troops from chengdus fourteenth army that no militia units were being used that beijing was determined to win the battle for dien bien phu directfire artillery opened up again and by now even the dimmest soldier on the battlefield could tell what wangs tactics consisted of to shell the hell out of the allied force now under the thousandman mark and once their position in the circle had been pulverized enough turning dirt to sand and their heads ringing and nerves stretched to the limit send in another wave of sappers and storm troopers the old chinese water torture method only instead of a drip at a time you wore down the enemy by attack after attack after all as wang had told the party chairman himself the americans werent going anywhere and though the americans artillery of sixgun batteries was responding with careful forwardobserverdirected fire it wasnt effective whereas the americans had dug in within a halfmilediameter circle whose now treeless moonscape offered an easily seen target for the pla gunners the pla targets their guns and suspected troop concentrations were spread all over the hills about dien bien phu this amounted to a huge ambuscade around the americans in an area so big that by the time one pla gun was spotted it would be retracted often on wooden rails deep into the cliffside and on a downgrade even if an american mm hit a target zone dead on either side of the valley there would be little if any damage to the chinese wagon one or two pla gunners might die if shrapnel sliced through the camouflaged nets down into the manmade cave or revetment but there were plenty of pla soldiers to replace them the mist had still not risen by noon and the joke passed around between enemy salvos whistling then thundering in was that freeman must have been praying again in fact freeman had now decided to place his faith in what he had briefly referred to as essential deforestation or as his hq staff were soon calling it clear cutting the men in the trenches of dien bien phu called it fuck the forest there was nothing strikingly new about it as freeman had seen it used in nam before but he did go about the preparations for it with a zest that later appalled greenpeace and other conservation groups throughout the world freeman avoiding passion going for reason instead would tell a hastily convened press conference that when it comes to preserving the habitat or saving american lives there is no contest bob cline did whisper to him that he should have mentioned the british and other usvun contingents but before he could rectify the omission lasalle and others were pillorying him for it freeman had told the combat information center aboard enterprise precisely what he wanted and when the mists finally rose and disappeared at the threecomponent strike force from the carrier was on its way entering flak alley between the hills of dien bien phu the first wave guided in by forward air controllers dropped fuel air explosive bombs unlike napalm the fae consisted of dropping a huge blanket of vaporized fuel over the target and detonating it all at one instant this burnt much of the vegetation off in one enormous blanket of intense fire consuming any troops directly beneath it the second wave of fighterbombers then streaked in dropping fivehundredpound snakeye bombs which denuded the target area of any trees still standing the third wave then swept in and with the hillside devoid of vegetation looking from the air like huge patches of mange the fighterbombers dropped laserguided and highangled twothousandpound bombs directly into the gaping holes that were or rather had been the revetments for the chinese guns this as leighhastings put it upset the chinese gunners inside and made a mess of their guns as well which the usvun forces in the circle and def triangle greatly appreciated there was a problem however and to his credit freeman playing devils advocate to his own strategy realized it before anyone else at dien bien phu the problem was that this awesome attack upon the hillsides meant that if wang was not to lose any more men in such clearweather attacks it had either better rain or wang had to speed up his artillery and massedattacks combination tactic to overwhelm the dien bien phu garrison before the gangster arsonist freeman burnt him out driving him out of the hills accordingly freeman his g section telling him of suddenly increased enemy radio traffic after the enterprise attack ordered his def commanders and airborne to prepare for massive tujidui thrusts later that day probably beginning at sundown and possibly going on all night air interdiction would be maintained by the enterprise fliers but the closer the pla got to the dien bien phu garrison before they attacked the less help the garrison could expect as once the chinese began bearhugging closing with the dien bien phu defenders us artillery and airpower would have to cease because of the danger of decimating their own troops then not even spooky the awesome ac festooned with heavycaliber machine guns infrared scopes tv cameras and a mm howitzer could be used for fear of killing the dien bien phu defenders as well as the attacking chinese despite this danger and as a further countermeasure to what freeman believed would be wangs biggest massed attack so far freeman after conferring with berry leighhastings roscoe and with the airborne commander decided that starlight scope patrols would be sent out before sunset and position themselves in the thick vegetation around the halfmilediameter circle their job would be to sniper anything that moved in hopes of first breaking up chinese concentrations massing for attack and second locating and identifying by radio and red flare enemy concentrations which skyraiders the old faithfuls with a loiter time of up to eight and a half hours could then bomb and strafe in addition to the indirect fire from the american batteries behind the hills of dien bien phu but if the present fine weather had given freeman a break and allowed him to launch the deforestation attacks the lack of mist also meant that the american mm and mm batteries positions could be seen by pla patrols and by hours out of ten usvun batteries south behind dien bien phu seven had been overrun by pla storm troopers both sides had paid a price wang having lost over four hundred men in freemans faesnakeye and laserguided bomb attacks and the garrisons defenders losing over fortytwo gunners one small consolation being that all but one of the seven american guns overrun had been spiked before being taken and so were of no use to the pla each commander had now forced the others hand any further delay by one would mean the other would have time to plug the gaps so recently opened at six starlight patrols began edging out from the perimeter east and west of nam yum river immediately there was trouble as over half were engaged by pla snipers some of whom had come right up to the tree line of the perimeter forcing the usvun snipers back into the circle around defs triangle maybe we can try later when its dark leighhastings opined weve got no choice berry answered trouble is theyve still got a lot of vegetation on the valley floor while their artillery has done a real job on ours weve got nothing but a few dead trees and bare earthworks all the better to see em when they rush us colonel leighhastings said you think theyll rush us he asked the englishman feigning surprise mad if they dont old boy there was a screech of incoming and they instinctively ducked even though they were in the hq bunkers roscoe came in through the burlap bag flap colonel what is it berry asked some of those reinforcements freeman has sent in some of vinhs boys among them are worried about old tunnels some of them are saying their kinfolk fought here against the french and they think jesus berry said they think the pla are using them some of em at least colonel thats why therere so many all at once when they come at us from the trees no movement in the trees during the day zilch but come nightfall right berry said send out probe teams bayonets any damn thing you can find ten minutes passed a long time with barely an hour of daylight left before squads ventured out from the trenches to probe the earth about the perimeter almost immediately there was the screech of incoming only this time the bombardment increased the vibration of the he shells shaking the earth so violently that streams of dirt were falling from the roof of berrys bunker some bastards watching us doolittle said in one of the trenches you dont say an sas trooper said i do fucking say and anybody who shows his scalpll fucking well lose it shut up yelled martinez still in shock over dlupos death in colonel berrys bunker the consensus was that the bombardment would not cease till nightfall you think we can stop them someone asked roscoe i dont know i need to get through to freeman for tacair chapter eightyone an army in retreat is never a pretty sight but with the flooding of the plains north of disney and the mangled rail line of the culvert in their way wangs soldiers were in no mood to be merciful to any escaping pow they found and eleven escapees from the camp near ningming were summarily butchered with bayonets their heads and the remainder of their bodies floating aimlessly in the waistdeep flood fields south of xiash with only five miles in a direct line to go to the border shirley fortescue in pla uniform danny mellin and murphy purposely lengthened their route by heading due east instead of south it was harder going but mellin needed no argument to make his case that it was safer after the three of them had seen bloodless torsos and heads float by eyes picked clean why in hell dont they send in tomahawks martinez asked wondering why the enterprise had not weighed in with the wizardry of the terraincontourmatching guided cruise missiles the wonder weapons of the iraqi war the carrier too far out doolittle was about to answer when instead he ducked down in the trench as more incoming slammed into the circle outside defs triangle no doolittle said the carriers close enough in few hundred miles is no trouble for a tomahawk but its got to have a particular target programmed into it in baghdad you had specific buildings but here all there is is fucking jungle well martinez responded brushing off mud and dirt from around his neck i wish to hell theyd drop a big blue he meant the pound gelled slurry of ammonium nitrate aluminum powder and polyethylene soap gotta be careful with that one another sas trooper said drop it too close to us itll suck the air right out of our lungs matey as well as the chinks the tempo of the shelling abruptly increased as the chinese fired time on target the worst form of artillery for the victims as it is concentrated and coordinated so every round hits simultaneously saturating the target in this case the def triangle with high explosive it was bad news all around for it meant that in order to mount such a time on target offensive the chinese must have restored communications between various gun positions in the hills despite the earlier enterprise strikes berry ordered no flares be sent up that starlightscoped ms take the front foxholes on the perimeter hed no sooner given the order than he heard at the wire and the battle of small arms erupted the usvun defenders outnumbered four to one in the first wave the enfilade of fire was deafening the fighting at the outer perimeter already handtohand sacrificial chinese sappers with charges strapped to them hurling themselves at the razor wire blowing up themselves and gaps through the rolls of wire the starlights green blurry images were shot down with impunity but the numbers of attacks seemingly never ended as for every dead man another rose in his place the most effective hole pluggers on the usvun side were the heckler koch automatic grenade launchers throwing a curtain of hot steel at the invaders in three and fiveround bursts from their thirtytworound ammo box the only problem being that a number of agls were picked off because of the hk agls lack of a flash hider some of the gunners fixed the problem with improvised fluted flash extinguishers made from meals ready to eat foiltaped to the end of the barrel at the wire at the wire two oclock through the wire theyre through the wire reports of chinese breaching the wire were streaming into berrys bunker in surges of static audible despite the cacophony of the firelights going on all around the perimeter now the company of gurkhas among the usvun forces having no grenade launchers on their rifles showed their stuff with bayonet and gurkha kukri knife heads literally rolling down in the mud grotesque dantelike figures torsos that kept running spurting blood like a gusher before they fell their blood and mud a greasy mix for all but the surestfooted second line yelled ncos and officers second line as the pla now owned the wire forcing the allies back to the second line of trenches chinese para flares were now descending slowly turning night to flickering day illuminating the masses of men over two thousand fighting and dying advancing withdrawing at pointblank range jesus came one voice out of all the rest streaming into berrys bunker theyre inside the wire inside the fucking the voice stopped short and for a split second berry didnt understand the full import of the message of course he knew they were inside the perimeter wire but then another voice explained they were coming up from inside they had tunneled under the wire and were now coming up well within the circle as well as breaching the wire martinez fired the last of his clip went to reload saw the long stilettolike bayonet of an ak coming at him then a shot so close to him it left his ears ringing the vietnamese soldier having shot the chinese at pointblank range thanks martinez said the two of them advancing momentarily until driven back by the grenade concussion but in that moment when the vietnamese had saved his life for martinez and for all the other americans fighting side by side with vietnamese nam was now not forgotten but was in some strange way resolved and as is often the case the old ferocity between the two onetime enemies now underwent that strange metamorphosis in which old enemies joinin an equally close friendship as only men who have been under fire can understand and feel the gurkhas in particular put a stop to what leighhastings described as this tunnel nonsense by not only slitting throats at the tunnels exits but going down and creating the only mass panic of the whole chinese attack one man in a tunnel a formidable force effectively blocking the way of the long line of chinese troops in the tunnel who in the near pitchdark couldnt shoot forward without killing their own not one of seven gurkhas who went down came up but what they cost the chinese by comparison was huge for the pile of mostly headless bodies jammed the tunnels exits and now a fifteenyearold with a could have kept anyone from coming out the outer perimeter however had collapsed and the three ifor columns and the usvun reserves were stretched in a tight perimeter around the def triangle their concentrated fire hitting the chinese with a veritable curtain of lead that for a full five minutes was a roar like some great waterfall cascading hundreds of feet over a precipice the chinese were driven back only two or three actually reaching the trench leading to berrys command bunker outside of which kacey fired the winchester shotgun twice the sixty darts felling the three wouldbe intruders the chinese began to withdraw the defenders surged after them in a final enfilade of fire that filled the valley with sound what dyou think berry asked leighhastings and roscoe over the telephone theyll hit us again tonight a voice from leighhastingss bunker at echo informed colonel berry that the major was dead a stomach wound from a black rhino bullet had all but blown him apart his entrails covering his men nearby and the bunker wall it was the same kind of story coming in from def all over the perimeter wounds that should not have been critical were of a kind never seen by the two airborne surgeons at defs hospital bunker men with shoulder and thigh wounds normally candidates for recovery were dead because of the enormous blood loss from the wounds colonel berry sir it was a sergeant who had just entered the bunker yes sir we took a few prisoners the vietnamese are seeing if they can get some info ah their methods i mean they dont seem to like the chinese very much cant say i do either berry replied but limit the rough stuff just keep pumping them separately see if we can get a pattern yes sir ah sir weve got a surprise i dont think youre gonna like it with that the sergeant pulled in a prisoner a black prisoner in tigerpattern fatigues different from the chinese greens but wearing a pla helmet what infuriated berry wasnt so much that this was probably the mia gone bad what had kacey called him pepper but the sneering attitude of the man you fools are all dead you know that whats your name berry asked fuck you man berry fumed but held his temper saying only take him away pow cage you all fucking dead man pepper yelled you all it was only now that kacey posted outside realized that the black man was pepper well well big shot whaddya know you dead too you motherfucker oreo wheres the woman kacey inquired fuck you man fuckin oreo kacey wished he could escort pepper to the cage personally but he had three dead pla to drag out of his trench roscoe told berry that he didnt think the chinese would attack until predawn but when they do he didnt get to finish his sentence for the pla artillery started up and to make matters worse fog started to roll in roscoe called from his bunker and reported the capture of a white woman no id tags huh berry said so the chinese gave each one of them a rifle and they gave up first chance they could pla wont like that weve got pepper here no id tags on him yours same here what are we going to do with em roscoe asked same as we do with all the other prisoners take em back with us if we ever get out of here but right now i dont give a damn about those two what i want is some indepth defense im going to get a few skyraiders in here in this fog well use purple smoke at dawn if they wait meanwhile everyone was ordered to dig deeper around the def triangle the last line of defense every man knowing the chinese now had the circle at dawn three of the old warriors of nam propdriven skyraiders came in to answer berrys call for jelly it was not something he wanted to do because of the terrible danger to his own troops but he could see no other way not just of defense but of survival two miles from the border in the earlymorning moonlight where flooded paddies gave way to higher ground mellin murphy and shirley fortescue tried to move cautiously but it was difficult their excitement in anticipation of crossing the border of outlandish dreams of fantastic things such as warmth soap clean clothes good food perhaps even coffee dancing in their heads at odds with their reason which told them that being in the area where chinese troops were most concentrated was inherently dangerous they had no way of knowing the pla had suffered a major defeat at disney they did not even know the hill called disney was only four miles southwest of them all they knew for certain was that earlier that day they had seen thousands of pla troops to the west trudging northward following the rail line they had sabotaged perhaps the chinese had won and frontline troops were being recalled whatever the situation they had every intention of avoiding them after the grisly and unspeakable horrors theyd seen around noon in particular me sight of a severed head having collected flotsam and grass about it in a slimy halo murphy suddenly stopped shirley grabbed his arm danny murphy said in a hushed tone you hear that yeah it sounded like linoleum tearing a machine gun in the distance but whose lets stay put for a while danny said good idea murphy said they were near a grove of trees ill take the first watch shirley eased herself to the sodden muddy ground and felt dizzy from fatigue and hunger after the explosion at the railway trang being killed the horse shed had no appetite but now she was ravenous and reached into the pockets of her pla uniform and remembered that what few rice balls shed managed to save were back at the railway in her jeans pockets she had taken them off and put on the pla uniform forgetting in her hurry about the rice her sigh of disappointment was audible to murphy whats up shirley she told him he gave her his last ration but she refused he insisted saying if she didnt take it hed start swearing again despite her exhaustion she couldnt help a smile which he could barely make out in the moonlight in that case she told him ill eat it when he gave it to her he folded her fingers over it and kissed them she was astounded as far as she knew australians only did that kind of thing when they were blind drunk maybe it was the concussion of the rail wreck the point man on one of freemans unofficial border patrols had them in the green circle of his starlight scope especially the one a woman he thought from the blur that looked like shoulderlength hair who was wearing a pla helmet one of the men had an ak at least thats what it looked like in the moonlight what to do the skyraiders six of them now among the last of their kind were swallowed by ominous soontobestorm clouds seventy miles west of hanoi they went to instrument flying and radio silence they knew the drill go in as low as you could drop the jelly without fuses so that it wouldnt explode then leave colonel berry had thought about requesting a flare ship a plane with a twomillioncandlelight power beam but to illuminate the area for the drop would also have lit it up for the pla enough to encourage them for another rush at the triangle berry called roscoe about the tactical beacon tacbe on berry inquired sending out its signal now sir soon as we hear them i want you to have a squad with purple smoke but dont throw it until i give you the word i dont want any chink throwin it back at us when you throw make sure youve got it right affirmative berry passed the word to listen for the planes but suddenly became alarmed by the fact that all he could hear was a persistent hightoned ringing in his ears drowning all other sounds kacey sir hows your hearing okay sir moment you hear those skyraiders let me know yessir and kacey what was that between you and the brother he aint no brother sir hes an asshole berry nodded and walked down through the foggy darkness past kacey along the trenches of the def triangle anyone here from foxtrot column yo came the response but the two men lying in the trench beside him were dead the other men from foxtrot who were piling up bodies on the trench lip for extra cover hadnt yet reached them berry spoke softly but without alarm he patted the man whod answered him and said take their dog tags son medics mightnt get round to it yessir the soldier replied but he knew that what berry was really telling him was that if the chinese made another attack en masse there wouldnt be time to take out the dead no time even for body bags maybe not even enough time to withdraw to the designated lz south of dien bien phu in what would be a terrible humiliation for the us no matter that such a defeat would be assigned to usvun everyone knew the force majeure was the united states the soldier as others were doing all down the line took off the dead mens tags there was sporadic fire in the gloomy fog from both sides but berry advised roscoe and the ncos to conserve ammo and the men to fire only when they had a definite target men here from echo yessir he went about bolstering morale in what was now the almost uncanny quiet of the battlefield the pla waiting for dawn berry waiting for the skyraiders he shook hands with vietnamese ncos and other troops a smile here and there for the airborne as well and a bracing youll be all right son where needed berry for a moment like freemans double as he was conscious of doing exactly what freeman had done in the battle of skovorodino it was a battle freeman had lost the unfused jelly was also one of freemans littleknown tricks hopefully it would work at hours an sas trooper heard the distant hum of propdriven planes the relative slowness of the old faithfuls the skyraiders would allow greater accuracy for the jelly drop but it would also expose them to much greater danger from any of the plas radarguided triple a flak the fog began to lift but only enough to glimpse enemy positions through the starlight scopes shit theyre everywhere kacey opined like bats in the belfry he checked his winchester for the sixth time in as many minutes and he could feel the fogs dampness seeping into the marrow of his bones it wasnt yet dawn but over disney hill and the surrounding countryside the air had been cleansed by the rain and the predawn light allowed the point man of freemans patrol to discern that it was a caucasian woman in the pla uniform and that the other two were both males dressed in nondescript clothes lightcolored shirts one of them in what looked like jeans the other in baggy shorts the point man by hand signal only ordered the other ten members of the patrol to stay down for it looked as if the three were headed up the knoll toward them the point man didnt want to spook the guy with the ak but who in hell were they they couldnt possibly be some kind of chinese resistance movement or were they the six skyraiders came in v formation and were now peeling off and coming in on the beacon but kacey had already heard them and alerted berry who in turn told roscoe and the co of the airborne show em purple berry ordered and from all around the def triangle violet smoke canisters were fired into the outer perimeters breached wire parts of the wire hidden from view so dense was the outpouring of the smoke firing broke out mainly from the chinese side berry trying to limit the response within thirty seconds of the purple smoke canisters a dozen or so being thrown to form a rough circle a hundred yards or so from defs triangle of trenches at least three were picked up by pla and flung back toward the triangle without hesitation berry rushed out four or five men including a vietnamese immediately followed him into the open where despite the fog pla gunners could see them berry was cut down in the first burst as were an sas and a delta trooper now the triangle opened up in covering fire as the vietnamese trooper and doolittle grabbed the flares and flung them back into the mess of outer razor wire before making their way back to the trenches the first skyraider radio silence now broken guiding the others swooped down out of the cloud to no more than two hundred feet above the ground like some enormous bird of prey in the dawns early light and dropped the silvery tanks of napalm just beyond the purple flares it banked hard left and dropped another tank and like all the others it burst in midair into a giant hoselike spray chinese triple a was filling the air with hot metal and tracer slicing the earlymorning mist the question roscoe was asking himself was would the chinese go for the trap would they attack in me hope of bearhugging the usvun troops getting so close in among the americans mat the two remaining big guns beyond dien bien phu would not fire for fear of hitting the def triangle killing more americans than chinese another skyraider swooped by dropping his jelly beans around the violetsmoking perimeter the plane then suddenly going out of control the pilot slumping in the seat a dull bubble of light in the distant fog as it slammed into the eastern sides of the valley suddenly bugles sounded from beyond the perimeter and the attack en masse began grenades roscoe shouted his order repeated on the three sides of the def triangle and the grenades falling mainly from the agl gunners the first chinese had reached the wire when the first grenades exploded among the jelly and suddenly like scores of christmastree lights coming alight only there the similarity ended the burning fuel air explosive ran like a wildfire through the masses of chinese troops where the jelly tanks had burst releasing an aerosoled fuel air explosive like a fine but dense spray all over the perimeter and the troops around it they were afire to make doubly sure that all the jelly spray was afire the five remaining skyraiders came in with rockets a tongue of flame licking so close to foxtrots position in the def triangle that three americans and two vietnamese caught fire and burned to death anyone touching the victims suffered the same terrible fate because of the mixtures sticky adhesive quality dozens of chinese with either extraordinary bravery or madness kept running toward the def lines only to be cut down by the concentrated cones of fire that issued forth from freemans special forces gurkhas and airborne so as not to waste ammunition each sector of defs three lines had been assigned its own cone or field of fire for which each force alone would be responsible now the five skyraiders came in strafing the wire perimeter to sow further chaos among the pla troops another skyraider downed in the process the sheer volume of fire from ms ms aks aks type s agls and the rest was of a kind roscoe had never even imagined possible the chinese most of them burning to some degree were cut down as though some great arc of scythe had cut through a field of grain the losses were now so high that neither wei nor wang the latter already dispirited by the defeat at disney wanted to persist and as if to underscore their decision the fortythree remaining from echo foxtrot and delta led a running counterattack charge the chinese lines broke and withdrew their sudden panic not something the victors despised them for but rather understood as fellow warriors the combination of us tacatr and the elite corps of commandos had simply held beyond the point the pla had thought possible only now did beijing decide to talk not promise but talk about an armistice a ceasefire to go into effect at noon two hundred fifty miles eastward where the earlymorning light suffused the trees and tall grass in a golden hue the point man now saw that all three were caucasian not that this made them automatically riskfree but everyone had heard about the pla having taken a large number of oil rig workers and the like prisoner freeze he shouted within a few hours mellin murphy and shirley fortescue were the center of attention at a press conference better described as a media feeding frenzy that was making them famous via cnn had they arrived an hour later the rushed news story of their heroism in breaking the plas supply line would have been drowned or at least temporarily shunted aside by the reports coming out of the recently besieged but now victorious garrison at dien bien phu among the reports of heavy losses on both sides there was a rumor of two american mias from nam having been found by either captain roscoes men andor by the us airborne battalion it was difficult to get any more information and an exultant yet sober freeman the press and danny mellin would have to wait until the victors of dien bien phu returned to either freemans hq at phu lang thuong or jorgensens hq in hanoi as the choppers came in to pick up the body bags of the usvun force most of its dead being american and vietnamese kacey was assigned by roscoe to look after the partially burned and now dead white woman the one theyd called salt and the bigmouth mia now pow the black man called pepper his hands now locked behind his back with the serrated plastic zap straps that had replaced regular handcuffs in the army kacey was surprised by peppers postdefeat mood he thought that the death of the white woman would have plunged pepper into the depths of despair on the contrary pepper was elated with the tremendous sense of release that surges through the body after the narrowest of escapes the law of averages dictating that he should have perished with the rest of his pla colleagues as salt had i guess kacey said you were right up front of the charge huh pepper spat contemptuously nah kacey continued youre a shit bag you were in the rear right i mean some charlie sticking a bayonet up your ass to keep you moving otherwise youd be back with your dope right pepper smiled malevolently what were you doin motherfucker jerkin yourself off in a trench he spat again kacey could still see the terrified look on the little girl with the grenade her lying there like some discarded rag doll get on the fuckin slick man he ordered pepper but the chopper was so full of wounded there was no room and they had to wait another half hour until there was a chopper with space for them the more kacey thought about the girl the more he felt like shooting pepper right then and thereaccidental discharge the money and time theyd waste on this son of a bitch didnt bear thinking about finally there was a chopper free and kacey dumping salts body bag in first ordered pepper into the chopper he made him sit on the floor gave the pilot the thumbsup and they were off the ground quickly gaining altitude till they reached a thousand feet pepper was whining loudly about not being able to sit on a seat here kacey yelled turn around you prick ill undo the cord and you can sit up pepper turned his back to kacey who took his knife cut the plastic cord and kicked pepper out prisoner trying to escape fuck im when the chopper landed kacey saw a white guy coming over to him i hear youve got a he stopped and looked at the body bag the rotors had not stopped turning a white woman he called out an mia kacey nodded at the body bag can i danny mellin began and kacey zipped open the bag pretty badly burned the khaki shirt looked as if it had melted into her she smelled like burnt chicken but there was enough of her face visible that with his heart pounding he knew it wasnt her oh jesus he said and walked away tears in his eyes in another piece of identification in hong kong there was considerably more difficulty because while the peoples police were sure that the victim was the rich and powerful owner of the penthouse mr jonas breem head of chical enterprises and south asia industries the killer whoever he or she was had used some new kind of bullet the victim was shot shortly after hed ejaculated and his face had been obliterated so it was doubtful that a positive id could be made by dental records there
