fluke or i know why the winged whale sings by christopher moore for jim darling flip nicklin and meagan jones extraordinary people who do extraordinary work fluke flook a stroke of good luck a chance occurrence an accident a barb or barbed head as on a harpoon either of the two horizontally flattened divisions of the tail of a whale part one the song an ocean without its unnamed monsters would be like a completely dreamless sleep john steinbeck the scientific method is nothing more than a system of rules to keep us from lying to each other ken norris chapter one big and wet next question amy called the whale punkin he was fifty feet long wider than a city bus and weighed eighty thousand pounds one wellplaced slap of his great tail would reduce the boat to fiberglass splinters and its occupants to red stains drifting in the blue hawaiian waters amy leaned over the side of the boat and lowered the hydrophone down on the whale good morning punkin she said nathan quinn shook his head and tried not to upchuck from the cuteness of it of her while surreptitiously sneaking a look at her bottom and feeling a little sleazy about it science can be complex nate was a scientist amy was a scientist too but she looked fantastic in a pair of khaki hiking shorts scientifically speaking below the whale sang on the boat vibrated with each note the stainless rail at the bow began to buzz nate could feel the deeper notes resonate in his rib cage the whale was into a section of the song they called the green themes a long series of whoops that sounded like an ambulance driving through pudding a less trained listener might have thought that the whale was rejoicing celebrating shouting howdy to the world to let everyone and everything know that he was alive and feeling good but nate was a trained listener perhaps the most trained listener in the world and to his expert ears the whale was saying well he had no idea what in the hell the whale was saying did he thats why they were out there floating in that sapphire channel off maui in a small speedboat sloshing their breakfasts around at seven in the morning no one knew why the humpbacks sang nate had been listening to them observing them photographing them and poking them with sticks for twentyfive years and he still had no idea why exactly they sang hes into his ribbits amy said identifying a section of the whales song that usually came right before the animal was about to surface the scientific term for this noise was ribbits because thats what they sounded like science can be simple nate peeked over the side and looked at the whale that was suspended head down in the water about fifty feet below them his flukes and pectoral fins were white and described a crystalblue chevron in the deep blue water so still was the great beast that he might have been floating in space the last beacon of some longdead spacetraveling race except that he was making croaky noises that would have sounded more appropriate coming out of a twoinch tree frog than the archaic remnant of a superrace nate smiled he liked ribbits the whale flicked his tail once and shot out of nates field of vision hes coming up nate said amy tore off her headphones and picked up the motorized nikon with the threehundredmillimeter lens nate quickly pulled up the hydrophone allowing the wet cord to spool into a coil at his feet then turned to the console and started the engine then they waited there was a blast of air from behind them and they both spun around to see the column of water vapor hanging in the air but it was far perhaps three hundred meters behind them too far away to be their whale that was the problem with the channel between maui and lanai where they worked there were so many whales that you often had a hard time distinguishing the one you were studying from the hundreds of others the abundance of animals was a both a blessing and a curse that our guy amy asked all the singers were guys as far as they knew anyway the dna tests had proven that nope there was another blow to their left this one much closer nate could see the white flukes or blades of his tail under the water even from a hundred meters away amy hit the stop button on her watch nate pushed the throttle forward and they were off amy braced a knee against the console to steady herself keeping the camera pointed toward the whale as the boat bounced along he would blow three maybe four times then fluke and dive amy had to be ready when the whale dove to get a clear shot of his flukes so he could be identified and cataloged when they were within thirty yards of the whale nate backed the throttle down and held them in position the whale blew again and they were close enough to catch some of the mist there was none of the dead fish and massive morningmouth smell that they would have encountered in alaska humpbacks didnt feed while they were in hawaii the whale fluked and amy fired off two quick frames with the nikon good boy amy said to the whale she hit the lap timer button on her watch nate cut the engine and the speedboat settled into the gentle swell he threw the hydrophone overboard then hit the record button on the recorder that was bungeecorded to the console amy set the camera on the seat in front of the console then snatched their notebook out of a waterproof pouch hes right on sixteen minutes amy said checking the time and recording it in the notebook she wrote the time and the frame numbers of the film she had just shot nate read her the footage number off the recorder then the longitude and latitude from the portable gps global positioning system device she put down the notebook and they listened they werent right on top of the whale as they had been before but they could hear him singing through the recorders speaker nate put on the headphones and sat back to listen thats how field research was moments of frantic activity followed by long periods of waiting nates first exwife had once commented that their sex life could be described in exactly the same way but that was after they had separated and she was just being snotty actually the wait here in maui wasnt bad ten fifteen minutes at a throw when hed been studying right whales in the north atlantic nate had sometimes waited weeks before he found a whale to study usually he liked to use the downtime literally the time the whale was down to think about how he shouldve gotten a real job one where you made real money and had weekends off or at least gotten into a branch of the field where the results of his work were more palpable like sinking whaling ships a pirate you know security today nate was actively trying not to watch amy put on sunscreen amy was a snowflake in the land of the tanned most whale researchers spent a great deal of time outdoors at sea they were for the most part an intrepid outdoorsy bunch who wore wind and sunburn like battle scars and there were few who didnt sport a semipermanent sunglasses raccoon tan and sunbleached hair or a scaly bald spot amy on the other hand had milkwhite skin and straight short black hair so dark that the highlights appeared blue in the hawaiian sun she was wearing maroon lipstick which was so wildly inappropriate and out of character for this setting that it approached the comical and made her seem like the goth geek of the pacific which was in fact one of the reasons her presence so disturbed nate he reasoned a wellformed bottom hanging in space is just a wellformed bottom but you hook up a wellformed bottom to a whipsmart woman and apply a dash of the awkward and what youve got yourself is well trouble nate did not watch her rub the spf on her legs over her ankles and feet he did not watch her strip to her bikini top and apply the sunscreen over her chest and shoulders tropical sun can fry you even through a shirt nate especially did not notice when she grabbed his hand squirted lotion into it then turned indicating that he should apply it to her back which he did not noticing anything about her in the process professional courtesy he was working he was a scientist he was listening to the song of megaptera novaeangliae big wings of new england a scientist had named the whale thus proving that scientists drink and he was not intrigued by her intriguing bottom because he had encountered and analyzed similar data in the past according to nates analysis research assistants with intriguing bottoms turned into wives percent of the time and wives turned into exwives exactly percent of the time plus or minus percent factored for postdivorce comfort sex want me to do you amy asked holding out her preferred sunscreenslathering hand you just dont go there thought nate not even in a joke one incorrect response to a line like that and you could lose your university position if you had one which nate didnt but still you dont even think about it no thanks this shirt has uv protection woven in he said thinking about what it would be like to have amy do him amy looked suspiciously at his faded we like whales conference tshirt and wiped the remaining sunscreen on her leg kay she said you know i sure wish i could figure out why these guys sing nate said the hummingbird of his mind having tasted all the flowers in the garden to return to that one plastic daisy that would just not give up the nectar no kidding amy said deadpan smiling but if you figure it out what would we do tomorrow show off nate said grinning id be typing all day analyzing research matching photographs filing song tapes bringing us doughnuts nate added trying to help amy continued counting down the list on her fingers picking up blank tapes washing down the trucks and the boats running to the photo lab not so fast nate interrupted what youre going to deprive me the joy of running to the photo lab while you bask in scientific glory no you can still go to the photo lab but clay hired a guy to wash the trucks and boats a delicate hand went to her forehead as she swooned the southern belle in hiking shorts taken with the vapors if i faint and fall overboard dont let me drown you know amy nate said as he undressed the crossbow i dont know how it was at boston doing survey but in behavior research assistants are only supposed to bitch about the humiliating grunt work and lowly status to other research assistants it was that way when i was doing it it was that way going back centuries it has always been that way darwin himself had someone on the beagle to file dead birds and sort index cards he did not ive never read anything about that of course you didnt nobody writes about research assistants nate grinned again celebration for a small victory he realized he wasnt working up to standards on managing this research assistant his partner clay had hired her almost two weeks ago and by now he should have had her terrorized instead she was working him like a starbucks froth slave ten minutes amy said checking the timer on her watch you going to shoot him unless you want to nate notched the arrow into the crossbow he tucked the windbreaker they used to dress the crossbow under the console it was very politically incorrect to carry a weapon for shooting whales through the crowded lahaina harbor so they carried it inside the windbreaker making it appear that they had a jacket on a hanger amy shook her head violently ill drive the boat you should learn to do it ill drive the boat amy said no one drives the boat no one but nate drove the boat granted the constantly baffled was only a twentythreefoot mako speedboat and an agile fouryearold could pilot it on a calm day like today still no one else drove the boat it was a man thing being inherently uncomfortable with the thought of a woman operating a boat or a television remote control up sounds nate said they had a recording of the full sixteenminute cycle of the song now all the way through twice in fact he stopped the recorder and pulled up the hydrophone then started the engine there amy said pointing to the white fins and flukes moving under the water the whale blew only twenty yards off the bow nate buried the throttle amy was wrenched off her feet and just caught herself on the railing next to the wheel console as the boat shot forward nate pulled up on the right side of the whale no more than ten yards away as the whale came up for the second time he steadied the wheel with his hip pulled up the crossbow and fired the bolt bounced off the whales rubbery back the hollow surgical steel arrowhead taking out a cookiecutter plug of skin and blubber the size of a pencil eraser before the wide plastic tip stopped the penetration the whale lifted his tail out of the water and snapped it in the air making a sound like a giant knuckle cracking as the massive tail muscles contracted hes pissed nate said lets go for a measurement now amy questioned normally they would wait for another dive cycle obviously nate thought that because of their taking the skin sample the whale might start traveling they could lose him before getting a measurement now ill shoot you work the rangefinder nate backed off the throttle a bit so he would be able to catch the entire tail fluke in the camera frame when the whale dove amy grabbed the laser rangefinder which looked very much like a pair of binoculars made for a cyclops by taking a distance measurement from the animals tail with the rangefinder and comparing the size of the tail in the frame of the picture they could measure the relative size of the entire animal nate had come up with an algorithm that so far gave them the length of a whale with percent accuracy just a few years ago they wouldve had to have been in an aircraft to measure the length of a whale ready amy said the whale blew and arched its back into a high hump as he readied for the dive the reason whalers had named them humpbacks in the first place amy fixed the rangefinder on the whales back nate trained the cameras telephoto on the same spot and the autofocus motors made tiny adjustments with the movement of the boat the whale fluked raising its tail high in the air and there instead of the distinct pattern of blackandwhite markings by which all humpbacks were identified were spelled out in foothigh black letters across the white the words bite me nate hit the shutter button shocked he fell into the captains chair pulling back the throttle as he slumped he let the nikon sag in his lap holy shit nate said did you see that see what i got seventythree feet amy said pulling down the rangefinder probably seventysix from where you are what were your frame numbers she was reaching for the notebook as she looked back at nate are you okay fine frame twentysix but i missed it he lied his mind was shuffling though a huge stack of index cards searching a million article abstracts he had read to find some explanation for what hed just seen it couldnt possibly have been real the film would show it you didnt see any unusual markings when you did the id photo no did you no never mind dont sweat it nate well get it next time he comes up amy said lets go in you dont want to try again for a measurement to make the data sample complete they needed an id photo a recording of at least a full cycle of the song a skin sample for dna and toxin figures and a measurement the morning was wasted without the measurement lets go back to lahaina nate said staring down at the camera in his lap you drive chapter two maui no ka oi maui is the best at first it was that old trickster maui who cast his fishing line from his canoe and pulled the islands up from the bottom of the sea when he was done fishing he looked at those islands he had pulled up and smack in the middle of the chain was one that was made up of two big volcanoes sitting there together like the friendly lopsided bosoms of the sea between them was a deep valley that maui thought looked very much like cleavage which he very much liked and so to that bumpybits island maui gave his name and its nickname became the cleavage island which it stayed until some missionaries came along and renamed it the valley island because if theres anything missionaries do well its seek out and destroy fun then maui landed his canoe at a calm little beach on the west coast of his new island and said to himself i could do with a few cocktails and some nookie i shall go into lahaina and get some well time passed and some whalers came to the island bringing steel tools and syphilis and other wonders from the west and before anyone knew what was happening they too were thinking that they wouldnt mind a few cocktails and a measure of nookie so rather than sail back around the horn to nantucket to hoist noggins of grog and the skirts of the odd hester millicent or prudence so fast the dear woman would think shed fallen down a chimney and landed on a zucchini they pulled into lahaina drawn by the drunken sex magic of old maui they didnt come to maui for the whales they came for the party and so lahaina became a whaling town the irony of it was that even though the humpbacks had starting coming to birth their calves and sing their songs only a few years earlier and in those days the hawaiian channels were teeming with the bigwinged singers it was not for the humpbacks that the whalers came humpbacks like their other rorqual brothers the streamlined blue fin sei minke and brydes whales were just too fast to catch in sailing ships and manpowered whaling boats no the whalers came to lahaina to rest and recreate along their way to japanese waters where they hunted the great sperm whale who would literally float there like a big dumb log while you rowed up to it and stuck a harpoon in its head it would take the advent of steamships and the decimation of the big floatyfat right whales so named because they did float when dead and therefore were the right whales to kill before the hunters would turn their harpoons on the humpbacks following the whalers came the missionaries the sugar farmers the chinese japanese filipinos and portuguese who all worked the sugar plantations and mark twain mark twain went home everyone else stayed in the meantime king kamehameha i united the islands through the clever application of firearms against wooden spears and moved hawaiis capital to lahaina sometime after that amy came cruising into the lahaina harbor at the wheel of a twentythreefoot mako speedboat with a tall stunnedlooking phd sprawled across the bow seat the radio chirped amy picked it up and keyed the mike go ahead clay something wrong clay demodocus was obviously in the harbor and could see them coming in it wasnt even eight in the morning he was probably still preparing his boat to go out im not sure nate just decided to call it a day ill ask him why to nate she said clay wants to know why anomalous data nate said anomalous data amy repeated into the radio there was a pause then clay said uh right understood that stuff gets into everything the harbor at lahaina is not large only a hundred or so vessels can dock behind her breakwater most are sizable fifty to seventyfoot cruisers and catamarans boats full of sunscreenbasted tourists out on the water for anything from dinner cruises to sport fishing to snorkeling at the halfsunken crater of molokini to of course whale watching jetskiing parasailing and waterskiing were all banned from december until april while the humpbacks were in these waters so many of the smaller boats that would normally be used to terrorize marine life in the name of recreation were leased by whale researchers for the season on any given winter morning down at the harbor at lahaina you couldnt throw a coconut without conking a phd in cetacean biology and you stood a good chance of winging two masters of science working on dissertations with the rebound clay demodocus was engaged in a bit of research liars poker with a phd and a naval officer when amy backed the mako into the slip they shared with three tender zodiacs from sailing yachts anchored outside the breakwater a thirtytwofoot motorsailor and the maui whale research foundations other boat clays boat the always confused a brandnew twentytwofoot grady white fisherman center console slips were hard to come by in lahaina and circumstances this season had dictated that the maui whale research foundation nate and clay perform a nautical dog pile with six other small craft every day you do what you have to do if you want to poke whales shame clay said as amy threw him the stern line nice calm day too we got everything but a measurement on one singer amy said the scientist and the naval officer on the dock behind clay nodded as if they understood completely clifford hyland a grizzled grayhaired whale researcher from iowa stood next to the young razorcreased snowywhiteuniformed captain l j tarwater who was there to see that hyland spent the navys money appropriately hyland looked a little embarrassed at the whole thing and wouldnt make eye contact with amy or nate money was money and a researcher took it where he could get it but navy money it was so so nasty morning amy said tarwater dazzling a perfectly even perfectly white smile he was lean and dark and frighteningly efficientlooking next to him clay and the scientists looked as if theyd been run through the dryer with a bag of lava rock good morning captain morning cliff hey amy cliff hyland said hey nate nathan quinn shook off his confusion like a retriever who had just heard his name uttered in context with food what what oh hi cliff what hyland and quinn had both been part of a group of thirteen scientists who had first come to lahaina in the seventies the killer elite clay still called them as they had all gone on to distinguish themselves as leaders in their fields actually the original intention hadnt been for them to be a group but they nevertheless became one early on when they all realized that the only way they could afford to stay on the island was if they pooled their resources and lived together so for years thirteen of them and sometimes more if they could afford assistants wives or girlfriends lived every season in a twobedroom house they rented in lahaina hyland understood quinns tendency to submerge himself in his research to the point of oblivion so he wasnt surprised that once again the rangy researcher had spaced out anomalous data huh cliff asked figuring that was what had sent nate into the ozone uh nothing i can be sure of i mean actually the recorder isnt working right something dragging probably just needs to be cleaned and everyone including amy looked at quinn for a moment as if to say well you lying satchel of walrus spit that is the weakest story ive ever heard and youre not fooling anyone shame clay said nice day to miss out on the water maybe you can get back with the other recorder and get out again before the wind comes up clay knew something was up with nate but he also trusted his judgment enough not to press it nate would tell him when he thought he should know speaking of that hyland said wed better get going he headed down the dock toward his own boat tarwater stared at nate just long enough to convey disgust before turning on his heel and marching after hyland when they were gone amy said tarwater is a creep hes all right hes got a job to do is all clay said whats with the recorder the recorder is fine nate said then what gives its a perfect day clay liked to state the obvious when it was positive it was sunny calm with no wind and the underwater visibility was two hundred feet it was a perfect day to research whales nate started handing waterproof cases of equipment to clay i dont know i may have seen something out there clay i have to think about it and see the pictures im going to drop some film off at the lab then go back to papa lani and write up some research until the films ready clay flinched just a tad it was amys job to drop off film and write up research okay how bout you kiddo clay said to amy my new guy doesnt look like hes going to show and i need someone topside while im under amy looked to nate for some kind of approval but when he simply kept unloading cases without a reaction she just shrugged sure id love to clay suddenly became selfconscious and shuffled in his flipflops looking for a second more like a fiveyearold kid than a barrelchested fiftyyearold man by calling you kiddo i didnt mean to dimmish you by age or anything you know i know amy said and i wasnt making any sort of comment on your competency either i understand clay clay cleared his throat unnecessarily okay he said okay amy said she grabbed two pelican cases full of equipment stepped up onto the dock and started schlepping the stuff to the parking area so it could be loaded into nates pickup over her shoulder she said you guys both so need to get laid i think thats reverse harassment clay said to nate i may be having hallucinations said nate no she really said that clay said after quinn had left amy climbed into the always confused and began untying the stern line she glanced over her shoulder to look at the fortyfoot cabin cruiser where captain tarwater posed on the bow looking like an advertisement for a particularly rigid laundry detergent bumstick gobebright perhaps clay you ever heard of a uniformed naval officer accompanying a researcher into the field before clay looked up from doing a battery check on the gps not unless the researcher was working from a navy vessel once i was along on a destroyer for a study on the effects of high explosives on resident populations of southern sea lions in the falkland islands they wanted to see what would happen if you set off a tenthousandpound charge in proximity to a sea lion colony there was a uniformed officer in charge of that amy cast the line back to the dock and turned to face clay what was the effect well it blew them the fuck up didnt it i mean thats a lot of explosives they let you film that for national science just stills clay said i dont think they anticipated it going the way it did i got some great shots of it raining seal meat clay started the engine yuck amy untied the bumpers and pulled them into the boat but youve never seen a uniformed officer working here before now i mean nowhere else clay said he pulled down the gear lever there was a thump and the boat began to creep forward amy pushed them away from the surrounding boats with a padded boat hook what do you think theyre doing i was trying to find out this morning when you guys came in they loaded an awfully big case before you got here i asked what it was and tarwater got all sketchy cliff said it was some acoustics stuff directional array amy asked researchers sometimes towed large arrays of hydrophones that could unlike a single hydrophone detect the direction from which sound was traveling could be clay said except they dont have a winch on their boat a wench what are you trying to say clay amy feigned being offended are you calling me a wench clay grinned at her amy i am old and have a girlfriend and therefore i am immune to your hotness please cease your useless attempts to make me uncomfortable lets follow them theyve been working on the lee side of lanai i dont want to take the confused past the wind line so you were trying to find out what theyre up to i fished no bites cliffs not going to say anything with tarwater standing there so lets follow them we actually may get some work done today its a good day after all and we might not get a dozen windless days all season here we cant afford to lose a day amy which reminds me whats up with nate not like him to blow off a good field day you know hes nuts amy said as if it were understood too much time thinking about whales oh right i forgot as they motored out of the harbor clay waved to a group of researchers who had gathered at the fuel station to buy coffee twenty universities and a dozen foundations were represented in that group clay was singlehandedly responsible for making the scientists who worked out of lahaina into a social community he knew them all and he couldnt help it he liked people who worked with whales and he just liked it when people got along hed started weekly meetings and presentations of papers at the pacific whale sanctuary building in kihei which brought all the scientists together to socialize trade information and for some to try to weasel some useful data out of someone without the burden of field research amy waved to the group too as she dug into one of the orange pelican waterproof cases come on clay lets follow tarwater and see what hes up to she pulled a huge pair of twentypower binoculars out of the case and showed them to clay we can watch from a distance you might want to go up in the bow and look for whales amy whales theyre big and wet what else do you need to know you scientists never cease to amaze me clay said come hold the wheel while i get a pencil to write that down lets follow tarwater chapter three a little razor wire around heaven the gate to the papa lani compound was hanging open when nate drove up not good clay was adamant about their always replacing the big masterlock on the gate when they left the compound papa lani was a group of woodframe buildings on two acres northeast of lahaina in the middle of a half dozen sugarcane fields that had been donated to maui whale by a wealthy woman clay and nate affectionately referred to as the old broad the property consisted of six small bungalows that had once been used to board plantation workers but had long since been converted to housing laboratory and office space for clay nate and any assistants researchers or film crews who might be working with them for the season getting the compound had been a godsend for maui whale given the cost of housing and storage in lahaina clay had named the compound papa lani hawaiian for heaven in honor of their good fortune but someone had left the gate to heaven open and from what nate could tell as he drove in the angel shit had hit the fan before he even got out of the truck nate saw a beatup green bmw parked in the compound and a trail of papers leading out of the building they used for an office he snatched a few of them up as he ran across the sand driveway and up the steps into the little bungalow inside was chaos drawers torn out of filing cabinets toppled racks of cassette tape the tapes strewn across the room in great streamers computers overturned the sides of their cases open trailing wires nate stood among the mess not really knowing what to do or even what to look at feeling violated and on the verge of throwing up even if nothing was missing a lifetime of research had been typhooned around the room oh jahs sweet mercy came a voice from behind him this a bit of fuckery most heinous for sure mon nate spun and dropped into a martialarts stance notwithstanding the fact that he didnt know any martial arts and that he had loosed a littlegirl shriek in the process the serpenthaired figure of a gorgon was silhouetted in the doorway and nate would have screamed again if the figure hadnt stepped into the light revealing a lean barechested teenager in surfer shorts and flipflops sporting a giant tangle of blond dreadlocks and about six hundred nose rings cool head main ting brah cool head the kid almost sang there was pot and steel drums in his voice bemusement and youth and two joints worth of separation from the rest of reality nate went from fear to confusion in an instant what the fuck are you talking about relax brah no make lidat kona and i come help out nate thought he might feel better if he strangled this kid just a little frustration strangle to vent some of the shock of the wrecked lab not a full choke but instead he said who are you and what are you doing here kona the kid said dat boss name clay hire me for the boats dat day before youre the kid clay hired to work with us on the boats shoots mon i just said that what you a ninja brah the kid nodded his dreads sweeping around his shoulders and nate was about to scream at him again when he realized that he was still crouched into his pseudo combat stance and probably looked like a total loon he stood up shrugged then pretended to stretch his neck and roll his head in a cocky way hed seen boxers do as if he had just disarmed a very dangerous enemy or something you were supposed to meet clay down at the dock an hour ago some rippin sets north shore they be callin to me this morning the kid shrugged what could he do rippin sets had called to him nate squinted at the surfer realizing that the kid was speaking some mix of rasta talk pidgin surfspeak and well bullshit stop talking that way or youre fired right now so you ichiban big whale kahuna like clay say hey yeah nate said im the numberone whale kahuna youre fired bummah mon the kid said he shrugged again turned and started out the door jahs love to ye brah cool runnings he sang over his shoulder wait nate said the kid spun around his dreads enveloping his face like a furry octopus attacking a crab he sputtered a dreadlock out of his mouth and was about to speak quinn held up a finger to signal silence not a word of pidgin hawaiian or rasta talk or youre done okay the kid waited quinn composed himself and looked around at the mess then at the kid there are papers strewn around all over outside hanging in the fences in the bushes i need you to gather them up and stack them as neatly as you can bring them here can you do that the kid nodded excellent im nathan quinn nate extended his hand to shake the kid moved across the room and caught nates hand in a powerful grip the scientist almost winced but instead returned the pressure and tried to smile pelekekona said the kid call me kona welcome aboard kona the kid looked around now looking as if by giving his name he had relinquished some of his power and was suddenly weak despite the muscles that rippled across his chest and abdomen who did this no idea nate picked up a cassette tape that had been pulled out of the spools and wadded into a birds nest of brown plastic you go get those papers im going to call the police that a problem kona shook his head why would it be no reason grab those papers now nothing is trash until i look at it eh overstood brah kona said grinning back at nate as he headed out into sun once outside he turned and called hey kahuna quinn what how come them humpies sing like dat what do you think nate asked and in the asking there was hope despite the fact that the kid was young and irritating and probably stoned the biologist truly hoped that kona unburdened by too much knowledge would give him the answer he didnt care where it came from or how it came and it would still have to be proved he just wanted to know which is what set him apart from the hacks the wannabes the backstabbers and the ego jockeys in the field nate just wanted to know i think they trying to shout down babylon maybe youll have to explain to me what that means we fix this fuckery then we fire up a spliff and think over it brah five hours later clay came through the door talking we got some amazing stuff today nate some of the best cowcalf stuff ive ever shot clay was still so excited he almost skipped into the room okay nate said with a zombielike lack of enthusiasm he sat in front of his patchedtogether computer at one of the desks the office was mostly put back in order but the open computer case sitting on the desk with wires spread out to a diaspora of refugee drive units told a tale of data gone wild someone broke in tore apart the office clay didnt want to be concerned he had great videotape to edit suddenly looking at the fans and wires it occurred to him that someone might have broken his editing setup he whirled around to see his fortytwoinch flatpanel monitor leaning against the wall a long diagonal crack bisected the glass oh he said oh jeez amy walked in smiling nate you wont believe the she pulled up saw clay staring at his broken monitor the computer scattered over nates desk files stacked here and there where they shouldnt be oh she said someone broke in clay said forlornly she put her hand on clays shoulder today in broad daylight nate swiveled around in his chair they went through our living quarters too the police have already been here he saw clay staring at his monitor oh and that sorry clay you guys have insurance right amy said clay didnt look away from his broken monitor dr quinn did you pay the insurance clay called nate doctor only when he wanted to remind him of just how official and absolutely professional they really ought to be last week went out with the boat insurance well then were okay amy said jostling clay squeezing his shoulder punching his arm pinching his butt we can order a new monitor tonight ya big palooka she chirped looking like a goth version of the bluebird of happiness hey clay grinned yeah were okay he turned to nate smiling anything else broken anything missing nate pointed to the wastebasket where a virtual haystack of audiotape was spilling over in tangles that was spread all over the compound along with all the files we lost most of the tape going back two years amy stopped being cheerful and looked appropriately concerned what about the digitals she elbowed clay who was still grinning and he joined her in gravity they frowned nate recorded all the audio on analog tape then transferred it to the computer for analysis theoretically there should be digital copies of everything these hard drives have been erased i cant pull up anything from them nate took a deep breath sighed then spun back around in his chair and let his forehead fall against the desk with a thud that shook the whole bungalow amy and clay winced there were a lot of screws on that desk clay said well it couldnt have been that bad nate you got it all cleaned up pretty quickly the guy you hired showed up late and helped me nate was speaking into the desk his face right where it had landed kona where is he i sent him to the lab i had some film i want to see right away i knew he wouldnt stand us up on his first day clay i need to talk to you amy could you excuse us a minute please sure amy said ill go see if anythings missing from my cabin she left clay said you going to look up or should i get down on the floor so i can see your face could you grab the firstaid kit while we talk screws embedded in your forehead feels like four maybe five theyre small though those little drivemount screws clay youre always trying to cheer me up its who i am clay said chapter four whale men of maui who clay was was a guy who liked things liked people liked animals liked cars liked boats who had an almost supernatural ability to spot the likability in almost anyone or anything when he walked down the streets of lahaina he would nod and say hello to sunburned tourist couples in matching aloha wear people generally considered to be a waste of humanity by most locals but by the same token he would trade a backhanded hangloose shaka thumb and fingers extended three middle fingers tucked always backhand if youre a local with a crash of native bruddahs in the parking lot of the abc store and get no scowls or pidgin curses as would most haoles people could sense that clay liked them as could animals which was probably why clay was still alive twentyfive years in the water with hunters and giants and the worst hed come out of it was to get a close tailwash from a southern right whale that tumbled him like a cartoon into the idling prop of a zodiac oh there were the two times he was drowned and the hypothermia but that stuff wasnt caused by the animals that was the sea and shell kill you whether you liked her or not which clay did doing what he wanted to do and his boundless affinity for everything made clay demodocus a happy guy but he was also shrewd enough not to be too open about his happiness animals might put up with that smiley shit but people will eventually kill you for it hows the new kid clay said trying to distract from the iodine he was applying to nates forehead while simultaneously calculating the time to ship his new monitor over to maui from the discount house in seattle clay liked gadgets hes a criminal nate said hell come around hes a water guy for clay this said it all you were a water guy or you werent if you werent well you were pretty much useless werent you he was an hour late and he showed up in the wrong place hes a native hell help us deal with the whale cops hes not a native hes blond clay hes more of a haole than you are for christs sake hell come around i was right about amy wasnt i clay said he liked the new kid kona despite the employment interview which had gone like this clay sat with the fortytwoinch monitor at his back his worldfamous photographs of whales and pinnipeds playing in a slide show behind him since he was conducting a job interview he had put on his very best abc store flipflops kona stood in the middle of the office wearing sunglasses his baggies and since he was applying for a job a reddirtdyed shirt your application says that your name is pelke ah pelekekona ke clay threw his hands up in surrender i be called pelekekona keohokalole da warrior kine lion of zion brah can i call you pele kona kona said it says on your drivers license that your name is preston applebaum and youre from new jersey i be one hundred percent hawaiian kona the best boat hand in the island yeah i figga i be numberone good man for to keep track haole science bosss isms and skisms while he out oppressing the native bruddahs and stealing our land and the best wahines sovereignty now but after a bruddah make his rent dont you know clay grinned at the blond kid youre just a mess arent you kona lost his rastafarian laidbackness look i was born here when my parents were on vacation i really am hawaiian kinda and i really need this job im going to lose my place to live if i dont make some money this week i cant live on the beach in paia again all my shit got stolen last time it says here that you last worked as a forensic calligrapher whats that handwriting analysis uh no actually it was a business i started where i would write peoples suicide notes for them not a hint of pidgin in his speech not a skankin smidgen of reggae it didnt do that well no one wants to kill himself in hawaii i think if id started it back in new jersey or maybe portland it would have gone over really well you know business location location location i thought that was real estate clay actually felt a twinge of missed opportunity here for although he had spent his life having adventures doing exactly what he wanted to do and although he often felt like the dumbest guy in the room because hed surrounded himself with scientists now talking to kona he realized that he had never realized his full potential as a selfdeluded blockhead ahhh wistful regrets clay liked this kid look im a water guy kona said i know boats i know tides i know waves i love the ocean you afraid of it clay asked terrified good meet me at the dock tomorrow morning at eightthirty now nate rubbed at the crisscrrossed bandaids on his forehead as clay went through the pelican cases of camera equipment under the table across the room the breakin and subsequent shit storm of activity had sidetracked him from what hed seen this morning it started to settle on him again like a black cloud of selfdoubt and he wondered whether he should even mention what he saw to clay in the world of behavioral biology nothing existed until it was published it didnt matter how much you knew it wasnt real if it didnt appear in a scientific journal but when it came to daytoday life publication was secondary if he told clay what hed seen it would suddenly become real as with his attraction for amy and the realization that years worth of research was gone he wasnt sure he wanted it to be real so why did you need to send amy out clay asked clay i dont see things i dont see right i mean in all the time weve worked together i havent called something before the data backed it up right clay looked up from his inventory to see the expression of consternation on his friends face look nate if the kid bothers you that much we can find someone else its not the kid nate seemed to be weighing what he was going to say not sure if he should say it then blurted out clay i think i saw writing on the tail flukes of that singer this morning what like a pattern of scars that look like letters ive seen that i have a dolphin shot that shows tooth rakings on the animals side that appear to spell out the word zap no it was different not scars it said bite me uhhuh clay said trying not to make it sound as if he thought his friend was nuts well this breakin nate its shaken us all up this was before that oh i dont know look i think its on the film i shot thats why i came in to take the film to the lab then i found this mess so i sent the kid to the lab with my truck even though im pretty sure hes a criminal lets table it until he gets back with the film okay nate turned and stared at the deskful of wires and parts as if hed quickly floated off into his own thoughts clay nodded hed spent whole days in the same twentythreefoot boat with the lanky scientist and nothing more had passed between the two than the exchange of sandwich thanks when nate was ready to tell him more he would in the meantime he would not press you dont hurry a thinker and you dont talk to him when hes thinking its just inconsiderate what are you thinking clay asked okay he could be inconsiderate sometimes his giant monitor was broken and he was traumatized im thinking that were going to have to start over on a lot of these studies every piece of magnetic media in this place has been scrambled but as far as i can tell nothing is missing why would someone do that clay kids clay said inspecting a nikon lens for damage none of my stuff is missing and except for the monitor it seems okay right your stuff yeah my stuff your stuff is worth hundreds of thousands of dollars clay why wouldnt kids take your stuff no one doesnt know that nikon equipment is expensive and no one on the island doesnt know that underwater housings are expensive so who would just destroy the tapes and disks and leave everything clay put down the lens and stood up wrong question how is that the wrong question the question is who could possibly care about our research other than us the old broad and a dozen or so biologists and whale huggers in the entire world face it nate no one gives a damn about singing whales theres no motive the question is who cares nate slumped in his chair clay was right no one did care people the world cared about the numbers of whales so the survey guys the whale counters they actually collected data that people cared about why because if you knew how many whales you had you knew how many you could or could not kill people loved and understood and thought they could prove points and make money with the numbers behavior well behavior was squishy stuff used to entertain fourthgraders on cable in the classroom we were really close clay nate said theres something in the song that were missing but without the tapes clay shrugged you heard one song you heard em all which was also true all the males sang the same song each season the song might change from season to season or even evolve through the season somewhat but in any given population of humpbacks they were all singing the same tune no one had figured out exactly why well get new samples id already cleaned up the spectrographs filtered them analyzed them it was all on the hard disks that work was for specific samples well do it again nate we have time no one is waiting no one cares you dont have to keep saying that well its starting to bother me too now clay said who in the hell cares whether you figure out whats going on with humpback song a kickedoff flipflop flew into the room followed by the singsong rastafarianbruddah pomp of kona returning irie clay me dready i be bringing films and herb for the evening to welcome to jahs mercy mon peace kona stood there an envelope of negatives and contact sheet in one hand a film can held high above his head in the other he was looking up to it as if it held the elixir of life you have any idea what he said nate asked he quickly crossed the room and snatched the negatives away from kona i think its from the jabberwocky clay replied you gave him cash to get the film processed you cant give him cash and this lonely stash can to fill with the sacred herb kona said ill find me papers and we can take the ship home to zion mon you cant give him money and an empty film can nate he sees it as a religious duty to fill it up nate had pulled the contact sheet out of the envelope and was examining it with a loupe he checked it twice counting each frame checking the registry numbers along the edge frame twentysix wasnt there he held the plastic page of negatives up to the light looked through the images twice and the registry numbers on the edges three times before he threw them down checked the earlier frames that amy had shot of the whale tail then crossed the room and grabbed kona by the shoulders wheres frame twentysix goddamn it what did you do with it this just like i get it mon i didnt do nothing hes a criminal clay nate said then he grabbed the phone and called the lab all they could tell him was that the film had been processed normally and picked up from the bin in front a machine cut the negatives before they went into the sleeves perhaps it had snipped off the frame theyd be happy to give nate a fresh roll of film for his trouble two hours later nate sat at the desk holding a pen and looking at a sheet of paper just looking at it the room was dark except for the desk lamp which reached out just far enough to leave darkness in all the corners where the unknown could hide there was a nightstand the desk the chair and a single bed with a trunk set at its end a blanket on top as a cushion nathan quinn was a tall man and his feet hung off the end of the bed he found that if he removed the supporting trunk he dreamed of foundering in bluewater ocean and woke up gasping the trunk was full of books journals and blankets none of which had ever been removed since hed shipped them to the island nine years ago a centipede the size of a pontiac had once lived in the bottomright corner of the trunk but had long since moved on once he realized that no one was ever going to bother him so he could stand up on his hind hundred feet hiss like a pissed cat and deliver a deadly bite to a naked foot there was a small television a clock radio a small kitchenette with two burners and a microwave two full bookshelves under the window that looked out onto the compound and a yellowed print of two of gauguins tahitian girls between the windows over the bed at one time before the plantations had been automated ten people probably slept in this room in grad school at uc santa cruz nathan quinn had lived in quarters about this same size progress the paper on nates desk was empty the bottle of myerss dark rum beside it half empty the door and windows were open and nate could hear the warm trades rattling the fronds of two tall coconut palms out front there was a tap on the door and nate looked up to see amy silhouetted in the doorway she stepped into the light nathan can i come in she was wearing a tshirt dress that hit her about midthigh nate put his hand over the paper embarrassed that there was nothing written on it i was just trying to put a plan together for he looked past the paper to the bottle then back at amy do you want a drink he picked up the bottle looked around for a glass then just held the bottle out to her amy shook her head are you all right i started this work when i was your age i dont know if i have the energy to start it all over again its a lot of work im really sorry this happened why you didnt do it i was close amy theres something that ive been missing but i was close it will still be there you know we have the field notes from the last couple of years ill help you put as much of it back together as i can i know you will but clays right nobody cares i should have gone into biochemistry or become an ecowarrior or something i care nate looked at her feet to avoid looking her in the eye i know you do but without the recordings well then he shrugged and took a sip from the rum bottle you cant drink you know he said now the professor now the phd now the head researcher you cant do anything or have anything in your life that gets in the way of researching whales okay amy said i just wanted to see if you were okay yeah im okay well get started putting it back together tomorrow good night nate she backed out the door night amy nate noticed that she wasnt wearing anything under the tshirt dress and felt sleazy for it he turned his attention back to his blank piece of paper and before he could figure out why he wrote bite me in big block letters and underlined it so hard that he ripped the page chapter five hey buddy why the big brain the next morning the four of them stood in a row on the front of the old pioneer hotel looking across the lahaina harbor at the whitecaps in the channel wind was whipping the palm trees down by the breakwater two little girls were trying to surf waves whose faces were bumpy with wind chop and whose curls blew back over the crests like the hair of a sprinter it could calm down amy said she was standing next to kona thinking this guys pecs are so cut you could stick business cards under them and theyd stay and my is he tan where amy came from no one was tan and she hadnt been in hawaii long enough to realize that a good tan was just a function of showing up supposed to stay like this for the next three days nate said as disappointed as he appeared to be he was extraordinarily relieved that they wouldnt be going out this morning he had a rogue hangover and his eyes were bloodred behind his sunglasses selfloathing had set in and he thought my lifes work is shit and if we went out there today and i didnt spend the morning retching over the side id be tempted to drown myself he would rather have been thinking about whales which is what he usually thought about then he noticed amy sneaking glances at konas bare chest and felt even worse ya mon kona can spark up a spliff and calm down that bumpy brine for all me new science dreadies we can take the boat no matter what the wind be kona said he was thinking i have no idea what the hell im talking about but i really want to get out there with the whales breakfast at longees and then well see how it looks clay said he was thinking well have breakfast at longees and then well see how it looks none of them moved they just stood there looking out at the blowout channel occasionally a whale would blow and the mist would run over the water like a frightened ghost im buying clay said and they all headed up front street to longees restaurant a twostory grayandwhite building done in a new england architecture with shiplap siding and huge open windows that looked across front street over the stone seawall and out onto the au au channel by way of a shirt kona slipped on a tattered nautica windbreaker hed had knotted around his waist you do a lot of sailing amy asked nodding to the nautica logo she intended the remark as dig a return for konas saying and who be this snowy biscuit when theyd first met at the time amy had just introduced herself but in retrospect she realized that she should probably have taken some offense to being called both snowy and a biscuit those things were objectifying right shark bait kit me snowy biscuit kona answered meaning that the windbreaker had come from a tourist the paia surfing community on the north shore from which kona had recently come had an economy based entirely on petty theft mostly smashandgrabs from rental cars as the host led them through the crowded dining room to a table by the windows clay leaned over amys shoulder and whispered a biscuit is a good thing i knew that amy whispered back like a tomato right heads up clay said just as amy plowed into a khaki package of balding ambition known as jon thomas fuller ceo of hawaii whale inc a nonprofit corporation with assets in the tens of millions that disguised itself as a research organization fuller had pushed his chair back to intercept amy jon thomas clay smiled and reached around the flustered amy to shake fullers hand fuller ignored clay and took amy by the waist steadying her hey hey there fuller said if you wanted to meet me all you had to do was introduce yourself amy grabbed his wrists and guided his hands to the table in front of him then stepped back hi im amy earhart i know who you are said fuller standing now he was only a little taller than arny very tan and very lean with a hawk nose and a receding hairline like a knife what i dont know is why you havent come to see me about a job meanwhile nate who had been thinking about whale song had taken his seat opened a menu ordered coffee and completely missed the fact that he was alone at the table he looked up to see jon thomas fuller holding his assistant by the waist he dropped his menu and headed back to the site of the intercept well partly amy smiled at the three young women sitting at fullers table partly because i have some selfrespect she curtsied and partly because youre a louse and a jamoke fullers dazzling grin dropped a level of magnitude the women at his table all dressed in khaki safari wear to approximate the discovery channel ideal of what a scientist should look like made great shows of looking elsewhere wiping their mouths sipping water not noticing their boss getting verbally bitchslapped by a vicious research pixie nate fuller said noticing that nate had joined the group i heard about the breakin at your place nothing important missing i hope were fine lost some recordings nate said ah well good a lot of lowlifes on this island now fuller looked at kona the surfer grinned shoots brah you make me blush fuller grinned how you doing kona all cool runnings brah bwana fuller got his evil on there were necksnapping double takes all around fuller nodded then looked back at quinn anything we can do nate there are a lot of our song recordings for sale in the shops if those will help out you guys get professional discount were all in this together thanks nate said just as fuller sat down then turned his back on all of them and resumed eating his breakfast dismissing them the women at the table looked embarrassed breakfast clay said he herded his team to their table they ordered and drank coffee in silence each looking out across the street to the ocean avoiding eye contact until fuller and his group had left nate turned to amy a jamoke what are you living in a cagney movie who is that guy amy asked she snapped the corner off a piece of toast with more violence than was really necessary whats a jamoke kona asked its a flavor of ice cream right clay said nate looked at kona how do you know fuller nate held up his ringer and shot a cautionary glare the now understood signal for no rastapidginbullshit i worked the jet ski concession for him at kaanapali nate looked to clay as if to say you knew this who is that guy amy asked hes the head of hawaii whale clay said commerce masquerading as science they use their permit to get three sixtyfivefoot tourist boats right up next to the whales that guy is a scientist he has a phd in biology but i wouldnt call him a scientist those women he was with are his naturalists i guess today was even too windy for them to go out hes got shops all over the island sells whale crap nonprofit hawaii whale was the only research group to oppose the jet ski ban during whale season because fuller had money in the jet ski business nate added i made six bucks an hour kona said nates work was instrumental in getting the jet ski parasail ban done clay said fuller doesnt like us the sanctuary may take his research permit next said nate what science they do is bad science and he blames you for that amy asked i we have done the most behavioral stuff as it relates to sound in these waters the sanctuary gave us some money to find out if the highfrequency noise from jet skis and parasail boats affected the behavior of the whales we concluded that it did fuller didnt like it it cost him hes going to build a dolphin swim park up la perouse bay way kona said what nate said what said clay a swimwiththedolphins park said amy ya mon let you come from ohio and get in the water with them bottlenose fellahs for two hundred dollar you guys didnt know about this amy was looking at clay he always seemed to know everything that was going on in the whale world first ive heard of it but theyre not going to let him do it without some studies he looked to nate are they itll never happen if he loses his research permit nate said therell be a review and youll be on the review board asked amy nates name would solidify it clay said theyll ask him not you kona asked im just the photographer clay looked out at the whitecaps in the channel doesnt look like well be getting out today finish your breakfast and then well go pay your rent nate looked at clay quizzically i cant give him money clay said hell just smoke it im going to go pay his rent truth kona nodded you dont still work for fuller do you kona nate asked nate amy admonished well he was there when i found the office ransacked leave him alone amy said hes too cute to be bad truth said kona sistah biscuit speak nothin but the truth i be massive cute clay set a stack of bills on the table by the way nate you have a lecture at the sanctuary on tuesday four days you and amy might want to use the downtime to put something together nate felt as if hed been smacked four days theres nothing there it was all on those hard drives like i said you might want to use the downtime chapter six whale wahine as a biologist nate had a tendency to draw analogies between human behavior and animal behavior probably a little more often than was strictly healthy for instance as he considered his attraction to amy he wondered why it had to be so complex why there had to be so many subtleties to the human mating ritual why cant we be more like common squid he thought the male squid simply swims up to the female squid hands her a neat package of sperm she tucks it under her mantle at her leisure and they go on their separate ways their duty to the species done simple elegant no nuance nate held the paper cup out to amy i poured some coffee for you im all coffeed out thanks said amy nate set the cup down on the desk next to his own he sat in front of the computer amy was perched on a high stool to his left going through the hardbound field journals covering the last four years are you going to be able to put together a lecture out of this she asked nate rubbed his temples despite a handful of aspirin and six cups of coffee his head was still throbbing a lecture about what well what were you planning to do a talk on before the office was ransacked maybe we can reconstruct it from the field notes and memory i dont have that good a memory yes you do you just need some mnemonics which we have here in the field notes her expression was as open and hopeful as a childs she waited for something from him just a word to set her searching for what he needed the problem was what he needed right now was not going to be found in biology field notes he needed answers of another kind it bothered him that fuller had known about the breakin at the compound it was too soon for him to have found out it also bothered him that anyone could hold him in the sort of disdain that fuller obviously did nate had been born and raised in british columbia and canadians hate above all things to offend it was part of the national consciousness be polite was an unwritten unspoken rule but ingrained into the psyche of an entire country of course as with any rule there were exceptions parts of quebec where people maintained the dismissive to the point of confrontation with subsequent surrender mindset of the french and hockey in which any canadian may with impunity slam pummel elbow smack punch bodycheck and beat the shit out of with sticks any other human being punctuated by profanities namecalling questioning parentage and accusations of bestiality usually coincidentally in french nate was neither frenchcanadian nor much of a hockey player so the idea of having invoked enmity enough in someone to have that person ruin his research he was mortified by it amy he said having spaced out and returned to the room in a matter of seconds he hoped is there something that im missing about our work is there something in the data that im not seeing amy assumed the pose of rodins the thinker on her stool her chin teed up on her hand her brow furrowed into moguls of earnest contemplation well dr quinn i would be able to answer that if you had shared the data with me but since i only know what ive collected or what ive analyzed personally id have to say scientifically speaking beats me thanks nate said he smiled in spite of himself you said there was something there that you were close to finding in the song i mean what is it well if i knew that it would be found wouldnt it you must suspect you have to have a theory tell me and lets apply the data to the theory im willing to do the work reconstruct the data but youve got to trust me no theory ever benefited by the application of data amy data kills theories a theory has no better time than when its lying there naked pure unsullied by facts lets just keep it that way for a while so you dont really have a theory clueless you lying bag of fish heads i can fire you you know even if clay was the one that hired you im not totally superfluous to this operation yet im kind of in charge i can fire you then how will you live im not getting paid see right there perfectly good concept ruined by the application of fact so fire me no longer the thinker amy had taken on the aspect of a dark and evil elf i think theyre communicating nate said of course theyre communicating you maroon you think theyre singing because they like the sound of their own voices theres more to it than that well tell me who calls someone a maroon what the hell is maroon its a mook with a phd dont change the subject it doesnt matter without the acoustic data i cant even show you what i was thinking besides im not sure that my cognitive powers arent breaking down meaning what meaning that im starting to see things he thought meaning that despite the fact that youre yelling at me i really want to grab you and kiss you he thought oh i am so fucked he thought meaning im still a little hungover im sorry lets see what we can put together from the notes amy slipped off the stool and gathered the field journals in her arms where are you going nate said had he somehow offended her we have four days to put together a lecture im going to go to my cabin and do it how on what im thinking humpbacks our wet and wondrous pals of the deep theres going to be a lot of researchers there biologists nate interrupted and why we should poke them with sticks better nate said i got it covered she said and she walked out for some reason he felt hopeful excited just for a second then after hed watched her walk out a wave of melancholy swept over him and for the thirtieth time that day he regretted that he hadnt just become a pharmacist or a charter captain or something that made you feel more alive like a pirate the old broad lived on a volcano and believed that the whales talked to her she called about noon and nate knew it was her before he even answered he knew because she always called when it was too windy to go out nathan why arent you out in the channel the old broad said hello elizabeth how are you today dont change the subject they told me that they want to talk to you today why arent you out there you know why im not out there elizabeth its too windy you can see the whitecaps as well as i can from the slope of haleakala the old broad watched the activity in the channel with a twohundredpower celestial telescope and a pair of big eyes binoculars that looked like stereo bazookas on precision mounts that were anchored into a ton of concrete well theyre upset that youre not out there thats why i called and i appreciate your calling elizabeth but im in the middle of something nate hoped he didnt sound too rude the old broad meant well and they in a way were all at the mercy of her generosity for although she had donated the papa lani compound she hadnt exactly signed it over to them they were in a sort of permanent lease situation elizabeth robinson was however very generous and very kindhearted indeed even if she was a total loon nathan i am not a total loon she said oh yes you are he thought i know youre not he said but i really have to get some work done today what are you working on elizabeth asked nate could hear her tapping a pencil on her desk she took notes during their conversations he didnt know what she did with the notes but it bothered him i have a lecture at the sanctuary in four days why why had he told her why now shed rattle down the mountain in her ancient mercedes that looked like a nazi staff car sit in the audience and ask all the questions that she knew in advance he couldnt answer that shouldnt be hard youve done that before what twenty times yes but someone broke in to the compound yesterday elizabeth all my notes the tapes the analysis its all destroyed there was silence on the line for a moment nate could hear the old broad breathing finally im really sorry nathan is everyone all right yes it happened while we were out working is there anything i can do i mean i cant send much but if no were all right its just a lot of work that i have to start over the old broad might have been loaded at one time and she certainly would be again if she sold the land where papa lani stood but nate didnt think that she had a lot of money to spare after the last bear market even if she did this wasnt a problem that could be solved with cash well then you get back to work but try to get out tomorrow theres a big male out there who told me he wants you to bring him a hot pastrami on rye nate grinned and almost snorted into the phone elizabeth you know they dont eat while theyre in these waters im just relaying the message nathan dont you snicker at me hes a big male broad like he just came down from alaska frankly i dont know why hed be hungry hes as big as a house but anyway swiss and hot english mustard he was very clear about that he has very unusual markings on his flukes i couldnt see them from here but he says youll know him nate felt his face go numb with something approximating shock elizabeth call if you need anything nathan my love to clay aloha nathan quinn let the phone slip from his fingers then zombiestumbled out of the office and back to his own cabin where he decided he was going to nap and keep napping until he woke up to a world that wasnt so irritatingly weird right on the edge of a dream where he was gleefully steering a sixtyfoot cabin cruiser up second street in downtown seattle plowing aside slowmoving vehicles while amy clad in a silver bikini and looking uncharacteristically tan stood in the bow and waved to people who had come to the windows of their secondstory offices to marvel at the freedom and power of the mighty quinn right on the edge of a perfect dream clay burst into the room talking konas moving into cabin six get some lines in the water amy nate said from the drears of morpheum opus were coming up on pikes place market and theres fish to be had clay waited not quite smiling not quite not while nate sat up and rubbed sleep from his eyes driving a boat on the street clay said nodding all skippers had that dream seattle said nate the zodiac lives in cabin six we havent used the zodiac in ten years it wont hold air clay went to the closet that acted as a divider between the livingsleeping area and the kitchen he pulled down a stack of sheets then towels you wouldnt believe how they had this kid living nate it was a tin industrial building out by the airport twenty thirty of them in little stalls with cots and not enough room to swing a dead cat the wiring was extension cords draped over the tops of the stalls six hundred a month for that nate shrugged so we lived that way the first couple of years its what you do we might need cabin six for something storage or something nope said clay that place was a sweat box and a fire hazard hes not living there hes our guy but clay hes only been with us for a day hes probably a criminal hes our guy said clay and that was that clay had very strong views on loyalty if clay had decided that kona was their guy he was their guy okay said nate feeling as if he had just invited the medusa in for a sandwich the old broad called how is she still nuts howre you getting there chapter seven sanctuary sanctuary cried the humpback when a visitor first drives into the hawaiian islands humpback whale sanctuary five baby blue shiplap buildings trimmed out in cobalt crouching on the edge of the huge maalaea bay and overlooking the ruins of an ancient saltwater fish pond his first reaction is usually hey not much of a sanctuary you could get maybe three whales in those buildings tops soon however he realizes that these buildings are simply the offices and visitor centers the sanctuary itself covers the channels that run from molokai to the big island of hawaii between maui lanai and kahoolawe as well as the north shores of oahu and kauai in which there is plenty of room for a whole bunch of whales which is why they are kept there there were about a hundred people milling around outside the lecture hall when nate and amy pulled into the parking lot in the pickup looks like a good turnout amy said shed attended only one of the sanctuarys weekly lectures and that one had been given by gilbert box an illtempered biologist doing survey work under a grant for the international whaling commission who droned through numbers and graphs until the ten people in attendance would have killed a whale themselves just to shut him up its about average for us behavior always draws more than survey were the sexy ones nate said with a grin amy snorted oh yeah you guys are the mae wests of the nerd world were action nerds nate said adventure nerds nerds of romance nerds amy said nate could see the skeletal gilbert box standing off to the side of the crowd under a straw hat whose brim was so wide it could have afforded shade for three additional people and behind a pair of enormous wraparound sunglasses suitable for welding or as a shield from nuclear flash his gaunt face was still smeared with residue of the white zinc oxide he used for sun protection when out on the water he wore a longsleeved khaki shirt and trousers and leaned on a white sun umbrella that he was never seen without it was a half hour before sunset a warm breeze was coming off maalaea bay and gilbert box looked like death out for his afterdinner stroll before a busy night of emailing heart attacks and tumors to a few million lucky winners nate had given box the nickname the count after the sesame street vampire with the obsessivecompulsive need to count things nate had been too old for sesame street as a preschooler but hed watched it through grade ten while babysitting his younger brother sam people agreed that the count was the perfect name for a survey guy with an aversion to water and sunlight and the name had caught on even outside nate and clays immediate sphere of influence panic rattled up nates spine theyre going to know were faking it the count will call us on it the first time i say something that we dont have the data to back up hows he going to know you had the data a week ago besides whats this we im just running the projector thanks theres tarwater amy said who are those women hes talking to probably just some whale huggers nate said pretending that all of his mental faculties were required for him to squeeze the pickup into the four adjacent empty parking spaces the women tarwater was talking to were margaret painborne phd and elizabeth libby quinn phd they worked together with a couple of very butch young women studying cowcalf behavior and social vocalizations they were doing good work nate thought even if it appeared to have a genderbased agenda margaret was in her late forties short and round with long gray hair that she kept perpetually tied back in a braid libby was almost a decade younger longlegged and lean blond hair going gray cut short and she had once not too long ago been nathan quinns third wife a second and totally different wave of anxiety swept over quinn this was the first time hed encountered libby since amy joined the team they dont look like whale huggers amy said they look like researchers how is that they look like action nerds amy snorted again and crawled out of the truck thats not very professional nate said that snortinglaugh thing you do but amy had already walked off toward the lecture hall a carousel of slides under her arm nate counted more than thirty researchers in the crowd as he walked up and those were just the ones he was acquainted with new people would be coming back and forth from the mainland all season grad students film crews reporters national fisheries people patrons all hitchhiking on the very few research permits that were issued for the sanctuary for some reason amy made a beeline for cliff hyland and his navy watchdog tarwater who was out of uniform in dockers and a tommy bahama shirt but still out of place because his clothes were ironed to razor creases his topsiders had been spitshined and he stood as if there were a cold length of rebar wired to his spine hey amy cliff said sorry to hear about the breakin bad well be all right amy said nate strolled up behind amy hey cliff captain he nodded to each sorry to hear about the breakin nate cliff said again hope you guys didnt lose anything important were fucked nate said and tarwater smiled for the first time ever nate thought were fine amy grinned and brandished her carousel of slides like a talisman of power im thinking about getting a job at starbucks nate said hey cliff what are you guys working on amy asked having somehow moved close enough into cliff hylands personal space to have to look up at him with big girlyblue eyes and the aspect of a fascinated child nate cringed it was well it was just not done you didnt ask not outright like that just some stuff for the navy cliff said obviously wanting to back away from amy but knowing that if he did somehow hed lose face nate watched while amy grated his friends middleaged irrelevance against his male ego merely by stepping a foot closer there too was a reaction from tarwater as the younger man seemed to be irritated by the fact that amy was paying attention to cliff or maybe he was just irritated with amy because she was irritating sometimes nate had to remind himself not to think like a biologist you know cliff amy said i was looking at a map the other day and i want you to brace yourself because this may come as a shock but theres no coastline in iowa i mean doesnt that get in the way of studying marine mammals sure now you bring that up cliff said where were you ten years ago when i accepted the position middle school amy said whats in the big case on your boat sonar array you guys doing another lfa study tarwater coughed amy nate interrupted wed better get set up right amy said nice seeing you guys she moved on nate grinned just for a second sorry you know how it is yeah cliff hyland smiled weve got two grad students working with us this season but we left our grommets at home to analyze data tarwater added nate and cliff looked at each other like two old brokentoothed lions long driven from the pride tired but secure in the knowledge that if they teamed up they could eat the younger male alive cliff shrugged almost imperceptibly that small gesture communicating sorry nate i know hes an asshole but what am i going to do its funding id better go in nate said patting the notes in his shirt pocket he passed a couple more acquaintances saying hello as he went by then inside the door ran right into a minor nightmare amy talking to his exwife libby and her partner margaret it had been like this theyd met ten years ago summer in alaska a remote lodge on baranof island on the chatham strait where scientists were given access to a couple of rigidhulled zodiacs and all the canned beans smoked salmon and russian vodka they could consume nate had come to observe the feeding behavior of his beloved humpbacks and record social sounds that might help him to interpret the song they sang when in hawaii libby was doing biopsies on the population of resident fisheating killer whales to prove that all the different pods were indeed part of one clan related by blood he was two years divorced from his second wife libby at thirty was two months from finishing her doctoral dissertation in cetacean biology consequently since high school she hadnt had time for anything but research seasonal affairs with boat skippers senior researchers grad students fishermen and the occasional photographer or documentary filmmaker she wasnt particularly promiscuous but there was a sea of men you were set adrift in if you were going to study whales and if you didnt want to spend your life alone you pulled into a convenient if scruffy port from time to time the transience of the work drove a lot of women out of the field on the other hand nate tried to solve the male side of the equation by marrying other whale researchers reasoning that only someone who was equally obsessed distracted and singleminded would be able to tolerate those qualities in a mate that sort of reasoning of course was testament to the victory of romanticism over reason irony over rationality and pure foolishness over common sense the only thing that being married to another scientist had gotten nate was a reprieve from being asked what he was thinking about while lying in bed in a postcoital cuddle they knew what he was thinking about because they were thinking about the same thing whales they were both lean and blond and weatherbeaten and one evening as they were portaging gear from their respective zodiacs libby unzipped her survival suit and tied the sleeves around her waist so she could move more freely nate said you look good in that no one absolutely no one looks good in a survival suit unless a dayglo orange marshmallow man is your idea of a hot date but libby didnt even make the effort to roll her eyes i have vodka and a shower in my cabin she said i have a shower in my cabin too nate said libby just shook her head and trudged up the path to the lodge over her shoulder she called in five minutes theres going to be a naked woman in my shower you got one of those oh said nate they were both still lean but no longer blond nate was completely gray and libby was getting there she smiled when he approached we heard about the breakin nate i meant to call you thats okay he said not much you can do thats what you think amy said she was bouncing on the balls of her feet as if she were going to explode or tigger off across the room any second i think these might mitigate the loss a little libby said she slung her day pack off her shoulder reached in and came out with a handful of cds in paper sleeves you forgot about these ill bet you loaned them to us last season so we could pull off any social noises in the background its all the singer recordings from the last ten years amy said isnt that great nate felt as if he might faint to lose ten years work then reconcile the loss only to have it handed back to him he put his hand on libbys shoulder to steady himself i dont know what to say i thought you gave those back we made copies margaret stepped over to quinn and in doing so got a foot between him and his exwife you said it would be okay we were only using them for comparison to our own samples no its okay nate said he almost patted her shoulder but as he moved in that direction she flinched and he let his hand drop thank you margaret margaret had interposed herself completely between nate and libby making a barrier of her own body behavior shed obviously picked up from her cowcalf studies a humpback mother did the same thing when boats or amorous males approached her calf amy snatched the handful of cds from libby id better go through these i can probably come up with a few relevant samples to play along with the slides if i hurry ill go with you margaret said eyeing amy my handwriting on the catalog numbers leaves something to be desired and off they went toward the projection station in the middle of the hall leaving nate standing with libby wondering exactly what had just transpired she really does have an extraordinary ass nate libby said as she watched amy walk away yep nate said not wanting to have this conversation shes very bright too sometime in the last week a tiny voice in his head had started asking could this get any weirder in two minutes hed gone from anxiety to embarrassment to anxiety to relief to gratitude to scoping chicks with his exwife oh yes little voice it can always get weirder i think margaret may be on a recruiting mission libby said i hope she checked our budget before she left amys working for free nate said libby leaned up on tiptoes and whispered i believe that a starting position on the allgirl team has just opened up then she kissed his cheek you knock em dead tonight nate and she was off after amy and margaret clay and kona arrived just as libby walked away and irritatingly kona was checking out libby from behind irie boss nate whos the biscuit auntie suckin face with ya like many authentic hawaiians kona called any woman a generation older auntie even if he was horning after her you brought him here nate said to clay without turning to face him hes got to learn clay said libby seemed friendly shes chasing amy oh she a blackheart thief that would take a mans snowy biscuit to have a punaani nosh that snowy biscuit belong our tribe libby was nates third wife clay volunteered as if that would somehow immediately illuminate why the blackheart libby was trying to steal the snowy biscuit from their tribe truth kona said shaking his great gorgonation of dreadlocks in ragdoll confusion you married a lesbian whale willies said clay adding neither insight nor illumination i should go over my notes nate said chapter eight a rippin talk biology said the pseudo hawaiian dat bitch make sex puppets of everyone clay had just told him the story the story was this five years into her marriage to nathan quinn libby had gone for the summer to the bering sea to put satellitetracking tags on female right whales she had already begun working with margaret painborne who was at the time trying to find out more about the mating and gestation behavior of right whales the best way to do that was to keep constant tabs on the females now sexing whales can be an incredibly difficult task as their genitalia for hydrodynamic reasons are all internal without a biopsy or without being in the water with the animal which means death in three minutes in the bering sea about the only way to determine sex is to catch a female when she is with her calf or while the animals are mating libby and margaret had decided to tag the animals while they were mating their base ship was an eightyfoot schooner loaned to the project by scripps but to do the actually tagging they used a nimble twelvefoot zodiac with a fortyhorse engine theyd spotted a female trying to evade the advances of two giant males the right whale is one of the few animals in the world that uses a washout strategy for mating that is the females mate with several males but the one who can wash out the others seed most efficiently will pass his genes on to the next generation consequently the guy with the largest tackle often wins and male right whales have the biggest tackle in the world with testes that weigh up to a ton and tenfoot penises that are not only long but prehensile able to reach around a female from the side and introduce themselves on the sly libby took the front of the boat where she braced herself with a fifteenfoot fiberglass pole tipped with a barbed stainless point attached to the satellite unit margaret steered the outboard maneuvering over frigid sevenfoot seas into the position where libby could set the tag right whales are not particularly fast whalers caught them in rowboats for christs sake but they are big and broad and in the frenzy of a mating chase a small zodiac provides about as much protection from their thrashing sixtyton bodies as would wearing aluminumfoil armor to a joust and noble libby actiongirl nerd that she was did look somewhat like a gallant knight in dayglo orange her lance ready to strike as her trusty warhorse evinrude powered her over the waves and as they approached the big female a male on either side of her the two sandwiching her so she could not escape she rolled over onto her back presenting her genitals to the sky at that she slowed and margaret steered between the two tails of the males so libby could set the tag the female stopped then and floated up under the zodiac margaret powered down the motor so as not to rake the animal with the prop shit libby screamed get us off get us off a swipe from the flukes of any of the animals would put them in the water minutes from hypothermia and death libby had rolled her survival suit down so she could maneuver the harpoon shed be pulled under in seconds suddenly out of the water on either side of them came two huge penises the males searching for their mark moving closer to the female producing waves that knocked the two women into the floor of the boat above them the two pink towers curved around looking for their target feeling the edges of the boat running slime across the rubber over the biologists poking beating about and generally abusing the women the female now had the zodiac centered exactly over her genitals using the rubber boat as an ad hoc diaphragm then the two giant whale willies encountered one another in the middle of the zodiac and each evidently thinking that the other had found his target and not wanting to be left out they let loose with great gushing gouts of sticky whale semen filling the boat covering the equipment the scientists washing the gunwales swamping the motor generally leaving everything but the gal whale completely and disgustingly jizzed mission accomplished off they swam to strain a little postcoital krill out of the fray margaret suffered a concussion and a partially detached retina libby a dislocated shoulder and various scrapes and bruises but the real trauma could not be assuaged with snaps slings and betadine several weeks later libby rejoined nate who was down at the chatham strait with clay filming feeding behavior she walked into his cabin hugged him then stepped back and said nate i dont think i want to be married anymore but what she really meant was im done with penises forever nate and pleasant as you are i know that you are still attached to one ive had my fill so to speak im moving on okay nate said he told clay later that for hours he had been feeling hungry and kept telling himself that he should stop working and go eat but after libby showed up then left he realized that he hadnt been hungry at all the emptiness inside was from feeling lonesome and nate had stayed relatively lonesome and mostly heartbroken since that day although he didnt whine about it he just wore it clay didnt tell kona this part confessions made over whiskey and campfires were privileged communication loyalty so said nate since the song appears in most cases to actually draw the attention of other males who often join up with the singer it would seem that the song cannot be directly connected to mating activity other than it happens in the mating season and since no one has actually observed humpbacks mating even this assumption could be in error if indeed the song is the male attempting to define his territory it would seem ineffective since other males tend to join singers even those escorting cowcalf pairs the study recommends that more studies be done to find out if there is as previously thought any direct correlation between humpback song and mating activity thank you ill take your questions hands went up here it came the crystal gazers the whale buggers the hippies the hunters the tourists the developers the wackos the researchers god help us the researchers and the idly curious nate didnt mind the curious they were the only ones without an agenda everyone else was looking for confirmations not answers should he go to a researcher first get it out of the way might as well go right to the dark side yes gilbert he pointed to the count the tall researcher had taken off his sunglasses but had pulled down the brim of his hat as if to conceal the glowing red coals of his eyes or maybe nate was just imagining that the count said so with these small samplings what was it five instances of interactions among singers and others theres no real conclusion that you can reach about the relation to breeding or the robustness of the population correct nate sighed fuckwad he thought he spoke to the strange faces in the audience the nonprofessionals as you know dr box samples for whalebehavior studies are usually very small its understood that we have to extrapolate more from the data with whales than with other animals who are more easily observed small samples are an accepted limitation of the field so what you are saying box continued is that you are trying to extrapolate the behavior of an animal that spends less than three percent of its time on the surface from observing its behavior on the surface isnt that akin to trying to extrapolate all of human civilization from looking at peoples legs underwater at the beach i mean i dont see how you could possibly do it nate looked around the room hoping that one of the other behavior researchers might jump in help him out throw a bone to the podium but apparently they were all finding the displays on the bulletin boards the ceiling fans or the wooden floor planks irresistibly interesting lately weve been spending more and more time observing the animals under the water clay demodocus has over six hundred hours of videotape of humpback behavior underwater but its only recently with digital videotape and rebreather technology that underwater observation has become practical to do to any extent and we still have the problem of propulsion no diver can swim fast enough to keep up with the humpbacks when theyre traveling i think all the researchers in this room understand the value of observing the animals in the water and it goes without saying that any research without consideration of underwater behavior is incomplete you understand that im sure dr box there were a few stifled snickers around the room nathan quinn smiled the count would not go into the water under any circumstances he was either terrified of it or allergic to it but it was obvious from watching him on his boat that he wanted no contact whatsoever with the water still if he was going to get his funding from the international whaling commission he had to get out there and count whales on the water never in it quinn believed that box did bad science and because of that he had gone into consulting the dark side he performed studies and provided data for the highest bidder and nate had no doubt that the data was skewed to the agenda of the funding some nations in the iwc wanted to lift the moratorium on hunting whales but first they had to prove that the populations had recovered enough to sustain hunting gilbert box was getting them their numbers nate was happy to have embarrassed box he waited for the gaunt scientist to nod before he took the next question yes margaret your study seems to focus on the perspective of the male animals without consideration for the females role in the behavior could you speak to that jeez what a surprise thought nate well i think theres good work being done on the cowcalf behavior as well as on surfaceactive groups which we assume is matingrelated activity but since my work concerns singers and as far as we know all singers are males i tend to observe more male behavior there that should do it so you cant say definitively that the females are not the ones controlling the behavior margaret as my research assistant has repeatedly pointed out to me the only thing i can say definitively about humpbacks is that they are big and wet everyone laughed quinn looked at amy and she winked at him then when he looked back to margaret he saw libby beside her winking at him as well but at least the tension among the researchers was broken and quinn noticed that captain tarwater and jon thomas fuller and his entourage were no longer raising their hands to ask questions perhaps they realized that they werent going to learn anything and they certainly didnt want to try to pursue their own agendas in front of a crowd and be slapped down the way gilbert box had quinn took the questions from the nonscientists could they just be saying hi yes if they dont eat here and its not for mating then why do they sing thats a good question do you think they know that weve been contacted by aliens and are trying to contact the mother ship ah always good to hear from the wacko fringe nate thought no i dont think that maybe theyre using their sonar to find other whales as far as we know baleen whales toothless whales like the humpbacks who strain their food from the sea through sheets of baleen dont echolocate the way toothed whales do why do they jump all the time other whales dont jump like that some think that they are sloughing skin or trying to knock off parasites but after years of watching them i think that they just like making a splash the sensation of air on their skin the way you might like to dangle your feet in a fountain i think theyre just goofing off i heard that someone broke into your office and destroyed all of your research who do you think would want to do that nate paused the woman who had asked the question was holding a reporters steno pad maui times he guessed she had stood to ask her question as if she were attending a press conference rather than a casual lecture what you have to ask yourself said nate is who could possibly care about research on singers and who would that be me a few people in this room and perhaps a dozen or so researchers around the world at least for now perhaps as we find out more more people will be interested so youre saying that someone in this room broke into your offices and destroyed all your research no as a biologist one of the things you have to guard against is applying motives where there are none and reading more into a behavior than the data actually support sort of like the answer to the why do they jump question you could say that its part of an incredibly complex system of communication and you might be right but the obvious answer and probably the correct one is that the whales are goofing off i think the breakin was just a random act of vandalism that has the appearance of motive bullshit quinn thought thank you dr quinn said the reporter she sat down thank you all for coming said nate applause nate arranged his notes as people gathered around the podium that was bullshit amy said complete bullshit said libby quinn what a load of crap said cliff hyland rippin talk doc kona said marleys ghost was in ye chapter nine relativity leathery bar girls worked the charter booths at the harbor smoking basic s and talking in voices that sounded like rum poured into hot grease a jigger of friendly to the liter of harsh they were thirtyfive or sixtyfive the color of mahogany skinny and strong from living on boats liquor fish and disappointment theyd come here from a dozen coastal towns some sailing from the mainland in small craft but forgetting to save enough courage for the trip home marooned man to man boat to boat year to year salt and sun and drinking had left them dry enough to cough dust if they lasted a hundred years and some would then one moonless night a great hooded wraith would swoop into the harbor and take them off to their own craggy island uncharted and unseen more than once by any living man and there they would keep the enchantment of the sea alive lure lost sailors to the shore suck out all of their fluids and leave their desiccated husks crumbling on the rocks for the crabs and the black gulls thus were the sea hags born but thats another story today they were just razzing clay for leading two girls down the dock just like outboards clay you gotta have two to make sure ones always running called margie who had once after ten maitais tried to go down on the wooden sea captain who guarded the doorway of the pioneer inn debbie who had a secret source for littleboy pee that she put in the ears of the blackcoral divers when they got ear infections said you give that young one the first watch clay let her rest up a bit morning ladies clay tossed over his shoulder he was grinning and blushing his ears showing red even where they werent sunburned fifty years old hed dived every sea been attacked by sharks survived malaria and malaysian pirates ridden in a titanium ball with a window five miles down into the tonga trench and still he blushed clair clays girlfriend of four years a fortyyearold japanesehawaiian schoolteacher who moved like she was doing the hula to a sousa march strange mix of regal order and island breeze backhanded a hangloose shaka at the cronettes and said grinning she just along to pour buckets on his reels girls keep him from burning up oh you guys are so friggin nautical said amy who was wrestling with a huge pelican case that held the rebreather the case slipped out of her grip and barked her shin before she caught it ouch damn it oh yeah everyone loves your salty friggin charm a chorus of cackles from the charter booths wheezed into coughing fits back to the cats the cauldrons the coconut oil the sacred jimmy buffett songs sung at midnight into the ear of drunken whitebearded hemingway wannabes to make that rumsoaked member rise from the dead just this one last time the leathery bar girls turned back to their business as kona passed by irie sistah amy give up ye burden said kona bounding down the dock to sweep the heavy rebreather out of amys grip and up onto his shoulder amy rubbed her arm thanks wheres nate he go to the fuel dock to get coffee for the whole tribe a lion him yeah hes a good guy youll be going out with him today i have to go along with clay and clair as a safety diver slippers off in the boat clay said to clair for the hundredth time she rolled her eyes and kicked off her flipflops before stepping down into the always confused she offered clay a hand and he steadied her as if escorting a lady from the kings court to the ballroom floor kona handed the rebreather down to clay i can safetydive youll never be able to clear your ears you cant pinch your nostrils shut with those nose rings in they come out look out they come he tossed the rings to amy and she deftly sidestepped letting them plop into the water oops amys a certified diver kid sorry youre with nate today he know that yeah does he know that asked clair he will soon get those lines would you amy i can drive the boat kona was on the edge of pleading no one but me drives the boat said clay im driving the boat corrected clair you have to sleep with clay to drive the boat said amy you just do what nate tells you clay said youll be fine if i sleep with amy can i drive the boat nobody drives the boat clay said i drive the boat clair said nobody sleeps with amy amy said i sleep with amy clair said and everyone stopped and looked at clair who wants cream asked nate arriving at that moment with a paper tray of coffee cups you can do your own sugar thats what im saying said clair sisters are doing it for themselves and nate hung there in space holding a cup and a sugar packet a wooden stir stick a baffled expression clair grinned kidding jeez you guys everyone breathed coffee was distributed gear was loaded clay drove the always confused out of the harbor pausing to wave to the count and his crew who were loading gear into a thirtyfoot rigidhull zodiac normally used for parasailing the count pulled down the brim of his hat and stood in the bow of the zodiac his sun umbrella at port arms looking like a skeletal statue of washington crossing the lethe the crew waved gilbert box scowled i like him clay said hes predictable but amy and clair missed the comment they were applying sunscreen and indulging in girl talk in the bow you can talk like such a floozy sometimes said amy i wish i could be floozish clair poked her in the leg with a long redlacquered fingernail dont sell yourself short pumpkin the ersatz hawaiian stood on the bow rail like he was hanging ten off the twentytwofoot mako waving to the zodiac crew as they passed irie science dreadies we be research jammin now but when the count ignored his greeting kona gave the traditional island response what i owe you money settle kona nate said and get down off of there kona made his way back to the console old white jacket givin you the stinkeye why he think you an agent of babylon he does bad science people come to me to ask me about him i tell them he does bad science and we do the good science we dont change our numbers to please the people who fund us the japanese want numbers that show recovery of the humpback population to levels where the iwc will let them start hunting them again gilbert tries to give them those numbers kill these humpies no yes no why to eat no said the blond rastaman shaking his head as if to clear the evil from his ears his dreads fanning out into nappy spokes quinn smiled to himself the moratorium had been in effect since before kona was born as far as the kid knew whales had been and always would be safe from hunters quinn knew better eating whale is very traditional in japan it sort of has the ritual of our thanksgiving but its dying out then its all good no there are a lot of old men who want to bring back whale hunting as a tradition the japanese whaling industry is subsidized by the government its not even a viable business they serve whale meat in the schoollunch program so kids will develop a taste for it no no one eats the whale the iwc allows them to kill five hundred minke whales a year but they kill more and biologists have found whale meat from half a dozen endangered whale species in japanese markets they try to pass it off as minke whale but the dna doesnt lie minke that devil in the white war paint killing our minke we dont have any minkes here in hawaii course not the count killing them we going to chant down this evil fuckery kona dug into his red gold and green fanny pack out came an extraordinarily complex network of plastic brass and stainlesssteel tubing which in seconds kona had assembled into what quinn thought was either a very small and elegant linear particle accelerator or more likely the most complex bong ever constructed slow de boat brah i got to spark up for freedom chant down babylon go into battle for jahs glory mon slow de boat put that away kona paused his bic lighter poised over the bowl take de ship home to zion brah no we have work to do nate slowed the boat and killed the motor they were about a mile off lahaina chant down babylon kona raised the lighter no put that away ill show you how to drop the hydrophone quinn checked the tape in the recorder on the console save our minkes kona waved the lighter unlit in circles over the bowl did clay show you how to take an id photo nate pulled the hydrophone and the coil of cord out of its case ride jahs herb into the mystic no put that away and get the camera out of that cabinet in the bow kona broke down the bong with a series of whirs and clicks and put it back in his fanny pack all right brah but when they have eated all your minkes will not be jahs fault an hour later after listening and moving and listening again they had found their singer kona stood balanced on the gunwale of the boat staring down in wonder at the big male who was parked under the boat making a sound approximating that of a kidnap victim trying to scream through duct tape kona would look from the whale to nate grin then look back to the whale again the whole time perched and balanced on the gunwale like a gargoyle on the parapet of a building nate guessed that he would be able to hold that position for about two minutes before his knees locked permanently and hed be forced to finish life in a toadish squat still he envied kona the enthusiasm of discovery the fascination and excitement of being around these great animals for the first time he envied him his youth and his strength and listening to the song in the headphones the song that seemed so clearly to be a statement of mating and yet refused to give up any direct evidence that it was nate felt a profound irrelevance sexually socially intellectually fiscally scientifically irrelevant a sack of borrowed atoms lumpily arranged in a nate shape no effect purpose or stability he tried to listen more closely to what the whale was doing to lose himself in analyzing what exactly was going on below but that merely seemed to underscore the suspicion that not only was he getting old he might be going crazy this was the first time hed been out since the bite me incident and since then he had convinced himself that it must have been some sort of hallucination still he cringed a bit every time the whale humped its tail to dive expecting to see a message scrawled across the flukes hes making them up noises boss nate nodded the kid was learning fast get your camera ready kona hell breathe three maybe four times before he dives so be ready abruptly the singing in the headphones stopped nate pulled up the hydrophone and started the engine they waited he went that way boss kona said pointing off to the starboard side nate turned the boat slowly in place and waited they were looking in the direction in which kona had seen the whale moving underwater when he surfaced behind them not ten feet away from the boat the blow making both of them jump the spray wafting across them in a rainbow cloud ho dat buggah up boss thank you captain obvious nate said under his breath he pulled down the throttle and came in behind the whale on its next breath the whale rolled and slapped a long pectoral fin on the surface soaking kona and throwing heavy spray over the console at least the kid had had the sense to use his body to shield the camera from the splash i love this whale kona said his rastaspeak melting leaving behind a middleclass jersey accent i want to take this whale home and put him in a box with grass and rocks buy him squeaky toys get ready for your id shot nate instructed when were done with him can i keep him pleeeeeeeeeeeeze here he goes kona focus the whale humped then fluked and kona fired off four quick frames with the motor drive you get it rippin pics rippin kona put the camera down on the seat in front of the console and covered it with a towel nate pointed the boat toward the last fluke print a twentyfoot lens of smooth water formed on the surface by the turbulence of the whales tail these lenses would hold on the surface sometimes for as long as two minutes serving as windows through which the researchers could watch the whales in the old whaling days the hunters believed that fluke prints had been caused by oil excreted by the whale nate cut the engine and let the boat coast over the fluke print they could hear the whale song coming up from below and could feel the boat vibrating under their feet nate dropped the hydrophones hit the record button and put on the headphones kona was recording the frame numbers and gps coordinates in the notebook as nate had taught him a monkey can do my job nate thought an hours experience and this stoner is already doing it this kid is younger stronger and faster than i am and im not even sure that im smarter as if that matters im totally irrelevant but maybe it did matter maybe it wasnt all about strength culture and language completely screwed up normal biological evolution why would we humans have developed such big brains if mating was always predicated on strength and size women must have chosen their mates based on intelligence as well perhaps early smart guys would say something like there right behind those rocks theres a tasty sloth ripe for the spearing go get him guys then after hed sent the stronger dumber guys running off a cliff after the imaginary sloth hed settle down with the best of the cromagnon cuties to mix some genes thats right bite my brow ridge bite it nate smiled kona was looking over the side at the singer whose tail was only twenty feet below the boat although his head was forty feet deeper he was only a couple of minutes into his song hed be down at least ten minutes more kona we need to get a dna sample how we do that nate pulled a set of flippers out of the console and handed them and an empty coffee cup out to the surfer youre going to need to go get a semen sample the surfer gulped looked at the whale looked at the cup looked over the side at the whale again no lid chapter ten safety clay demodocus drifted silently down past the tail of the breathholder only the quiet hissing of his own breath in his ears breathholders were called such because they hung there in the water for up to forty minutes heads down like a singer just holding their breath not swimming or singing or doing much of anything else just hanging there sometimes three or four of them tails spread out like the points of a compass as if someone had just dropped a handful of sleeping whales and forgotten to pick them up except they werent sleeping whales didnt really sleep as far as they knew well the theory was that they slept with only half of their brain at a time while the other half took care of not drowning for an airbreather sleeping in the water and not drowning is a big problem go ahead try it well wait falling asleep would be so easy with the rebreather clay thought it was very quiet which was why clay was using it instead of using a tank of air that was exhaled through a regulator into the water as bubbles the rebreather sent the divers exhalation back through a scrubber that took out the carbon dioxide past some sensors and a tank that added some oxygen then back to the diver to be rebreathed no bubbles which made the rebreather perfect for studying whales and for sneaking up on enemy ships which is why the navy had developed it in the first place humpbacks used bubble blowing as a means of communication especially the males who threatened one another with bubble displays consequently it was nearly impossible to get close to a whale with scuba gear especially a static animal like a singer or a breathholder by blowing bubbles the diver was babbling away in whalespeak without the slightest idea of what he was saying in the past clay had dropped on breathholders with scuba gear only to watch the animals swim off before he got within fifty feet of them he imagined the whales saying hey its the skinny retarded kid talking nonsense again lets get out of here but this season theyd gotten the rebreather and clay was getting his first ever decent footage of a breathholder as he drifted by the tail he checked his gauges looked up to see amy snorkeling at the surface silhouetted in a sunbeam a small tank strapped on her back ready to come to his rescue should something go wrong the one big drawback to the rebreather rather than a fairly simple hose on a tank as in a scuba setup was that it was a very complex machine and should it break there was a good chance it would kill the diver clays experience had taught him that the one thing you could depend on was that something would break around him except for the whale was a field of clear blue below nothing but blue even with great visibility he couldnt see the bottom some five hundred feet down just past the tail he was at a hundred feet the navy had tested the rebreather to more than a thousand feet and since he could theoretically stay down for sixteen hours if he needed to decompression wasnt a problem but clay was still wary of going too deep the rebreather wasnt set to mix gases for a deep dive so there was still the danger of nitrogen narcosis a sort of intoxication caused by pressurized nitrogen in the bloodstream clay had been narced a couple of times once while under arctic ice filming beluga whales and if he hadnt been tethered to the opening in the ice with a nylon line he would have drowned just a few more feet and hed be able to sex the breathholder something that they hadnt done more than a few times before and then it was by crossbow and dna the question so far was are breathholders all male like singers and if so does the breathholding behavior have something to do with the singing behavior clay and quinn had first come together over the question of sexing singers some seventeen years before when dna testing was so rare as to be nearly nonexistent can you get under the tail nate had asked get photos of the genitals kinky clay had said sure ill give it a try of course except for a few occasions when he was able to hold his breath long enough to get under an animal about a third of the time clay had failed at producing whale porn now with this rebreather as he drifted below the tail so close now that even the wideangle lens could take in only a third of the flukes clay noticed some unusual markings on the tail he looked up from the display just as the whale began to move but it was too late the whale twitched and the massive tail came down on clays head driving him some twenty feet deeper in an instant the wash from the flukes tumbled him backward three times before he settled in a slow drift to the bottom unconscious as he watched the pseudohawaiian try to kick down to the singing whale for the eighth time nathan quinn thought this is a rite of passage similar things were done to me when i was a grad student didnt dr ryder send me out to get closeup blowhole pictures of a gray whale who had a hideous head cold wasnt i hit by a basketballsize gob of whale snot nearly every time the whale surfaced and wasnt i ultimately grateful for the opportunity to get out in the field and do some real research of course i was therefore i am being neither cruel nor unprofessional by sending this young man down again and again to perform a hand job on the singer the radio chirped signaling a call from the always confused nate keyed the mike button on the mobile phonetwoway radio they used to communicate between the two boats go ahead clay nate its clair clay went down about fifteen minutes ago but amy just dove after him with the rescue tank i dont know what to do theyre too deep i cant see them the whale took off and i cant see them where are you clair straight out about two miles off the dump nate grabbed the binoculars and scanned the island found the dump looked out from there he could make out two or three boats in the area six or eight minutes away at full throttle keep looking clair get ready to drop a hang tank if you have one set up in case they need to decompress ill be there as soon as i get the kid out of the water whats he doing in the water just a bad decision on my part keep me apprised clair try to follow amys bubbles if you can find them youll want to be as close to them as you can when they come up nate started the engine just as kona broke the surface spitting out the snorkel and taking in a great gasp of air kona shook his head signifying that he hadnt accomplished the mission too deep boss come come come to the side nate waved him to the boat quinn brought the boat broadside to kona then reached over with both hands come on kona took his hands and quinn jerked the surfer over the gunwale kona landed in a heap in the bottom of the boat boss hang on clays in trouble but boss quinn buried the throttle yanked the boat around and cringed at the bunnyinablender screech as the hydrophone cord wrapped around the prop sheared the prop pin and chopped itself into a whole package of expensive waterproof licorice sticks fuck nate snatched off his baseball cap and whipped it onto the console the hydrophone sank peacefully to the bottom bopping the singer on the back as it went nate killed the engine and grabbed the radio clair are they up yet im not going to be able to get there amy felt as if someone were driving huge ice picks into her eardrums she pinched her nostrils closed and blew to equalize the pressure even as she kicked to go deeper but she was moving too fast to get equalized she was down fifty feet now clay was a hundred feet below her the pressure would triple before she got there she felt as if she were swimming through thick blue honey shed seen the whale tail hit clay and toss him back but the good news was that she hadnt seen a cloud of bubbles come up there was a chance that the regulator had stayed in clays mouth and he was still breathing of course it could also mean that he was dead or that his neck had snapped and he was paralyzed whatever his condition he certainly wasnt moving voluntarily just sinking slowly relentlessly toward the bottom amy fought the pressure the resistance of the water and did math problems as she kicked deeper the rescue tank held only a thousand pounds of air a third of the capacity of a normal tank she guessed that shed be at around a hundred and seventyfive to two hundred feet before she caught clay that would give her just enough air to get him to the surface without stopping to decompress even if clay was unhurt there was a good chance he was going to get decompression sickness the bends and if he lived through that hed spend three or four days in the hyperbaric decompression chamber in honolulu ah the big palooka is probably dead anyway she thought trying to cheer herself up although clay demodocus had lived a life spiced with adventures he was not an adventurer like nate he did not seek danger risk or fulfillment by testing his mettle against nature he sought calm weather gentle seas comfortable accommodations kind and loyal people and safety and it was only for the work that he compromised any of those goals the last to go the least compromised was safety the loss of his father a hardhelmet sponge diver had taught him that the old man was just touching bottom at eight hundred feet when a drunken deck hand dragged his ass across the engine start button causing the prop to cut his fathers air line the pressure immediately drove papa demodocuss entire body into the bronze helmet leaving only his weighted shoes showing and it was in his great helmet that he was lowered into the grave little clay cleandros in those days in greece was only five at the time and that last vision of his father haunted him for years he never did see a marvin the martian cartoon that great goofy helmet body riding cartoon shoes when he did not have to fight a tear and sniffle for papa as clay drifted down into the briny blue he saw a bright light and a dark shape waiting there on the other side out of the light came a short but familiar figure the face was still dark but clay knew the voice even after so many years welcome earth being said the vacuumpacked greek papa said clay clair dragged the heavy tank out of the always confuseds bait well and tried to attach the regulator in order to hang it off a line for amy and clay to breathe from so they could decompress before coming up clay had shown her how to do this a dozen times but she had never paid attention it was his job to put the technothingies together she didnt need to know this stuff it wasnt as if she was ever going to go diving without him shed let him drone on about safety this and lifethreatening that while she applied her attention to putting on sunscreen or braiding her hair so it wouldnt tangle in the equipment now she was blinking back tears and cursing herself for not having listened when she thought she finally might have the regulator screwed on correctly she grabbed it and dragged the tank to the side of the boat the regulator came off in her hands goddamn it she snatched the radio and keyed the mike nate i need some help here go ahead sistah came back he be in the briny blue fixing the propeller kona do you know how a regulator goes on a scuba tank yah mon you got to keep the bowl above the water or your herb get wet and wont take the fire clair took a deep breath and fought back a sob see if you can put nate on back on the constantly baffled nate was in the water with snorkel and fins fighting the weight of half a dozen wrenches and sockets hed put in the pockets of his cargo shorts he almost had the propeller off the boat with luck he could install the shear pin and be up and running in a couple of minutes it wasnt a complex procedure it had just been made a lot trickier when nate found that he couldnt reach the prop to work on it from inside the boat then suddenly his air supply was cut off he kicked up spit the snorkel out of his mouth and found himself staring kona right in the face the fake hawaiian hung over the back of the boat his thumb covering the end of nates snorkel his other hand holding the radio which hed let slip halfway underwater call for you boss nate gasped and snatched the receiver out of konas hand held it up out of the water what in the hell are you doing thats not waterproof he tried to sling the water out of the cell phone and keyed the mike clair can you hear me no sound not even static but its yellow said kona as if that explained everything i can see its yellow what did clair say is clay all right she wanted to know how to put the regulator on the tank you have to keep the bowl above the water i tell her its not a bong you idiot its a real scuba tank help me out nate handed up his fins then stepped on the trim planes on the stern and pulled himself into the boat at the console he turned on the marine radio and started calling clair you listening this is the constantly baffled calling the always confused clair are you there constantly baffled cut in a stern officialsounding male voice this is the department of conservation and resources enforcement are you displaying your permit flag conservation we have an emergency situation a diver in trouble off our other boat im dead in the water with a broken shear pin the other boat is roughly two miles off the dump constantly baffled why are you not displaying your permit flag because i forgot to put the damn thing up we have two divers in the water both possibly in trouble and the woman on board is unable to put together a hang tank nate looked around he could see the whale cops boat about a thousand yards to the west toward lanai they were alongside another boat nate could see the familiar figure of the count standing in the bow looming there like doom in an easter bonnet bastard constantly baffled hold there we are coming to you dont come to me im not going anywhere go to the other boat repeat they have an emergency situation and are not responding to marine radio the conservation enforcement boat lifted up in the water under the power of two horse honda outboards and beelined toward them fuck nate dropped the mike and started to shake a shiver born not of temperature as it was eighty degrees on the channel but out of frustration and fear what had happened to clay to prompt amy to go to his rescue maybe she had misjudged the situation and gone down needlessly she didnt have much experience in the water or at least he didnt think she had but if things were okay then why werent they up kona did clair say whether she could see amy and clay no boss she just wanted to know about the regulator kona sat down in the bottom of the boat and hung his head between his knees im sorry boss i thought if it was yellow it could go in the water i didnt know it slipped nate wanted to tell the kid it was all right but he didnt like lying to people clay put you on the research permit right kona you remember signing a paper with a lot of names on it no mon that fiveoh coming up now yeah whale cops and if clay didnt put you on the permit youre going to be going home with them chapter eleven the mermaid and the martian the depth gauge read two hundred feet by the time amy finally snagged the top of clays rebreather and pulled herself down to where she was looking into his mask if it werent for a small trail of blood streaming from his scalp making him look like he was leaking black motor oil into the blue he might have been sleeping and she smiled in spite of herself the sea dog survives somehow maybe through years of conditioning his reflexes to keep his mouth shut clay had bitten down on the mouthpiece of the rebreather he was breathing steadily she could hear the hiss of the apparatus she wasnt sure that clays mouthpiece would stay in all the way to the surface and if it came out the photographer would surely drown even if she replaced it quickly unlike a normal scuba regulator which was frightfully easy to purge you couldnt let water get into a rebreather or it could foul the carbondioxide scrubbers and render the device useless and shed need both her hands for the swim up one to hold on to clay and one to vent air from his buoyancycontrol vest which would fill with air as they rose causing them both to shoot to the surface and get the bends amy wasnt wearing a bc vest or a wet suit she wasnt supposed to have needed them after wasting a precious thirty seconds of air to consider the problem she took off her bikini top and wrapped it around clays head to secure his mouthpiece then she hooked her hand into his buoyancy vest and started the slow kick to the surface at a hundred and fifty feet she made the mistake of looking up the surface might have been a mile away then she checked her watch and pulled up clays arm so she could see the dive computer on his wrist already the liquidcrystal readout was blinking telling her that clay needed two decompression stops on the way up one at fifty feet and one at twenty from ten to fifteen minutes each with his rebreather hed have plenty of air amy wasnt wearing a dive computer but by ballparking it from her pressure gauge she figured she had between five and ten minutes of air left she was about half an hour short well this is going to be awkward she thought the whale cops wore light blue uniform shirts with shorts and aviatorstyle mirrored sunglasses that looked as if theyd been surgically set into their faces they were both in their thirties and had spent some time in the gym although one was heavier and had rolled up his short sleeves to let his grapefruit biceps breathe the other was thin and wiry they brought their boat alongside nates and threw over a bumper to keep the boats from rubbing together in the waves howzit bruddahs kona said not now nate whispered i need to see your permit said the heavier cop nate had pulled a plastic envelope out from under the console as they approached they went through this several times a year he handed it over to the cop who took out the document and unfolded it ill need both of your ids come on nate said handing over his drivers license you guys know me look weve sheared a pin and theres a diver emergency on our other boat you want us to call the coast guard no i want you to take us over there thats not what we do dr quinn said the thin cop looking up from the permit the coast guard is equipped for emergencies we are not dis haole lolo pela him said kona meaning hes just a dumb white guy dont talk that shit to me said the heavier cop you want to speak hawaiian ill talk to you in hawaiian but dont talk that pidgin shit to me now wheres your id back at my cabin dr quinn your people need to have id at all times on a research vessel you know that hes new whats your name kid pelekekona keohokalole said kona the cop took off his sunglasses for the first time ever nate thought he looked at kona youre not on the permit try preston applebaum said kona are you trying to fuck with me he is said nate just take him in and on the way take me to our other boat i think well tow both of you in and deal with the permit issues when we get into harbor suddenly amid the static of the marine radio on in the background clairs voice nate are you there i lost amys bubbles i cant see her bubbles i need help here nate anyone nate looked at the whale cop who looked at his partner who looked away kona jumped up on the gunwale of the police boat and leaned into the wiry cops face can we do the territorial macho power trip after we get our divers out of the water or do you have to kill two people to show us how big your fucking dicks are clair ran around the boat searching for amys bubble trail hoping she was just missing it had lost it in the waves hoping that it was still there she looked at the hang tank sitting in the floor of the boat still unattached to the regulator then ran back to the radios keying both the marine radio and the cellphone radio and trying not to scream sos here please im a couple of miles off the dump i have divers down in trouble the harbormaster at lahaina came back said hed send someone and then a dive boat who was out at the lava cathedrals at lanai said they had to get their divers out of the water but could be there in thirty minutes then nathan quinn came back clair this is nate im on the way how long ago did the bubbles stop clair checked her watch four five minutes ago can you see them no nothing amy went deep nate i watched her go down until she disappeared do you have hang tanks in the water no i cant get the damn regulators on clay always did it just tie off the tanks and tie the regulators to the tanks and get them over the side amy and clay can hook them up if they get to them how deep i have three tanks ninety sixty and thirty just get them in the water clair well worry about exact depth when i get there just hang them so they can find them tie glow sticks on them if you have any should be there in five minutes we can see you clair started tying the plastic line around the necks of the heavy scuba tanks every few seconds she scanned the waves for signs of amys bubbles but there werent any nate had said if they get to them she blinked away tears and concentrated on her knots if well if clay made it back when he made it back he could damn sure get himself a safer job her man wasnt going to drown hundreds of feet under the ocean because from now on he was going to be taking pictures of weddings or bar mitzvahs or kids at jc penneys or some goddamn thing on dry land across the channel near the shore of kahoolawe the target island libby quinn had been following the exchange between clair and nate over the marine radio without being asked her partner margaret said we dont have any diving equipment on board that deep theres not much we could do clays immortal anyway said libby trying to sound more blasé than she felt hell come up yammering about what great footage he got call them offer our help the older woman said if we deny our instincts as caretakers we deny ourselves as women oh fuck off margaret im calling to offer our help because its the right thing to do meanwhile on the ocean side of kahoolawe cliff hyland was sitting in the makeshift lab belowdecks in the cabin cruiser headphones on watching an oscilloscope readout when one of his grad students came into the cabin and grabbed him by the shoulder sounds like nathan quinns group is in trouble said the girl a sunbaked brunette wearing zincoxide war paint on her nose and cheeks and a hat the size of a garbagecan lid hyland pulled up the headphones what who fire sinking what theyve lost two divers that photographer guy clay and that pale girl where are they about two miles off the dump theyre not asking for help i just thought you should know thats a ways start reeling in the array we can be there in a half hour maybe just then captain tarwater came down the steps into the cabin stay that order grommet stay on mission we have a survey to finish today and a charge to record those guys are friends of mine hyland said ive been monitoring the situation dr hyland our presence has not been requested and frankly there is nothing this vessel could do to help it sounds like theyve lost some divers it happens this isnt war tarwater we dont just lose people stay on mission any setback in quinns operation can only benefit this project you asshole hyland said back in the channel the count stood in the bow of the big zodiac and watched as the conservation and resources enforcement boat towed away the constantly baffled he turned to his three researchers who were trying to look busy in back of the boat let that be a lesson to you all the key to good science is making sure all the paperwork is in order now you can see why im such a stickler for you people having your ids with you every morning yeah in case some other researcher rats us out to the conservation and resources cops one woman said science is a competitive sport ms wextler if youre not willing to compete youre welcome to take your undergrad degree and go babysit seasick tourists on a whalewatching boat nathan quinn has attacked the credibility of this organization in the past its only fair play that i point out when he is not working within the rules of the sanctuary the ocean breeze carried the junior researchers underthebreath whispers of asshole away from the ears of gilbert box over the channel to wash against the cliffs of molokai nate wrapped his arms around clair and held her as she sobbed as the downtime passed the first half hour nate felt a ball of fear dread and nausea forming in his own stomach only by trying to stay busy looking for signs of clay and amy was he able to keep from being ill when amys downtime passed fortyfive minutes clair started to sob clay might have been able to stay down that long with the rebreather but with only the tiny rescue tank there was no way amy could still be breathing two divemasters from a nearby tour boat had already used up a full tank each searching the problem was in blue water it was a threedimensional search rescue searches were usually done on the bottom but not when it was six hundred feet down with the currents in the channel well the search was little more than a gesture anyway being a scientist nate liked true things so after an hour he stopped telling clair that everything was going to be all right he didnt believe it and grief was already descending on him like a flight of black arrows in the past when he had experienced loss or trauma or heartbreak some survival mechanism had kicked in and allowed him to function for months before hed actually begin feeling the pain but this time it was immediate and deep and devastating his best friend was dead the woman that he well he wasnt exactly sure what hed felt about amy but even when he looked past the sexuality the differences in their ages and positions he liked her he liked her a lot and hed become used to her presence after only a few weeks one of the divers came up near the boat and spit out his regulator theres nowhere to look its just blue to fucking infinity yeah nate said i know clay saw bluegreen breasts gently bobbing before his face and was convinced that he had indeed drowned he felt himself being pulled upward and so closed his eyes and surrendered no no no son said papa youre not in heaven the tits are not blue in heaven you are still alive papas face was very much smashed against the glass of his helmet wearing the sort of expression he might have had if hed run full speed into a bulletproof window and someone had snapped a picture at maximum mash yet clay could see that his eyes were smiling my little cleandros you know it is not time for you to join me clay nodded and when it comes time for you to join me it should be because you are old and tired and ready to go not because the sea is wanting to crush you clay nodded again then opened his eyes this time there was a stabbing pain in his head but he squinted through it to see amys face through her dive mask she held his regulator in his mouth and was gripping the back of his head to make him look at her when she was sure that he was conscious and knew where he was she gave him the okay signal and waited until he returned it amy then let go of clays regulator and they swam slowly upward to surface four hundred yards from where theyd first submerged clay immediately looked around for the boat and found nothing where he expected it the closest vessels being a group of boats too far away to be the always confused he checked his dive computer hed been down for an hour and fifteen minutes that couldnt be right thats them amy said she looked down into the water oops let me get my top off of your face okay clay mumbled into the rebreather kona was in tears wailing like bob marley in a bear trap inconsolable clay gone the snowy biscuit gone and i was going to poke squid with her too you were not said nate but the artificial hawaiian didnt hear there kona shouted as he leaped onto the shoulders of the stocky whale cop to get a better view its the white wahine praise to jah thanks be to his imperial majesty haile selassie go there sheriff a saving be needed handcuff this kid said the cop chapter twelve heres my coupon he said singing the redemption song normally if the whale cops found an unauthorized person on a research vessel they would simply record the violation write a ticket then remove the person from the boat and take him back to lahaina harbor a fine was paid and violations were considered the following year when the permit came up for renewal by contrast kona was delivered to the maui county jail with both his wrists and ankles shackled and a swath of duct tape over his mouth nate and amy were waiting in the lobby of the maui county jail in wailuku sitting in metal chairs designed to promote discomfort and waffled butt skin its really okay if he has to stay in overnight said nate or for a week or so if it would be easier amy punched nate in the shoulder you creep i thought it was kona that got them to let you come to us still jail builds character ive heard that it might do him good to be off his herb for a few days kona had slipped his fanny pack full of pot and paraphernalia to nate before hed been taken away character if he starts with his nativesovereignty speech stuff in there the real hawaiians will pound him hell be okay im worried about you dont you want to go get checked clair had taken clay to the hospital to get a cat scan and have his scalp stitched up im fine nate i was only shaken up because i was worried about clay you were down a long time yes and i went by clays dive computer we decompressed completely the worst part was i froze my ass off i cant believe you had the presence of mind to decompress with clay unconscious i dont know if i would have hell i couldnt have id have run out of air in ten minutes how did you manage im small nate i dont use air like you and i could tell that clay was breathing okay i could tell that the cut on his head wasnt that bad either the biggest danger to both of us was decompression sickness so i followed the computer breathed off of clays rescue supply when i ran out and nobody got hurt im really impressed said nate i just did what i was supposed to do no big deal i was really scared i thought you you had me worried he patted her knee in a grandmotherly fashion and she looked at his hand careful ill get all sniffly over here amy said they led the surfer into the holding tank where everyone was wearing the same orange jumpsuit that he was irie bruddahs kona said we all shoutin down sheriff john brown in these great pumpkin suits jah they all looked up a giant samoan who had beaten an oldsmobile to death with a softball bat when it stalled in the middle of the kuihelani freeway an alcoholic white guy who had fallen asleep on the four seasons private beach in wailea and made the mistake of dropping his morning business in one of the cabanas a bass player from lahaina who had been brought in because at any given time a bass player is probably up to no good an angry bruddah who had been caught doing a smashandgrab from a rental car at la perouse bay and two upcountry pig hunters who had tried to back their fourwheeler full of pit bulls down a volcano after huffing two cans of spray paint kona could tell they were huffers by the glazed look in their eyes and the large red rings that covered their mouths and noses from the bag hey brah krylon one of the pig hunters nodded and briefly lost control of the motion of his head nothin like a quality red i hear dat said the pig hunter i hear dat then kona made his way to the corner of the cell the guard locked the door and everyone resumed looking at his shoes except for the samoan guy who was waiting for kona to make eye contact so he could kill him ye know brah kona said to him in a friendly if seriously flawed fake jamaican accent i be learning from my science dreadies to look at tings with the critical eye dont ya know and i think i know what the problem with taking a stand against da man on maui whad dat ask the samoan well its an island aint it mon you got to be stone stupid going outlaw here wid nowhere to escape you callin me stupid haole no mon just speaking the truth an what you in for haole girl failing to give a humpback whale the proper scientific handjob i tink goin ta fuck ya and kill ya now could ya kill me first whadeva said the samoan climbing to his feet and expanding to his full godzilla proportions thanks brah peace in jahs mercy said the doomed surfer fortyfive minutes later after nate had filled out the requisite papers the jailer a compact hawaiian with weightlifter shoulders led kona through the double steel doors into the waiting room the surfer shuffled in head down looking ashamed and a little lopsided amy put her arm around his shoulders and patted his head oh sistah amy twas heinous he put his arm around amy then let his hand slip to the curve of her bottom heinous most true the jailer grinned had a disagreement with a big samoan guy we stopped it before it got too far the holding cells are monitored on closedcircuit video snatched half me dreads out kona pulled a handful of orphaned dreadlocks from the pocket of his surf shorts going to cost some deep monies to hook these boys back up i can feel my strength waning without them the jailer waived a finger under konas nose just so you know kid if it had gone the other way if the samoan had decided to kill you second i wouldnt have stepped in so early you understand yah sheriff you stay out of my jail or next time i tell him which end to start on okay the jailer turned to quinn they arent filing any charges that merit incarceration they just wanted to make a point then he leaned close to nate and whispered their height difference making it appear as if he were talking to the scientists shirt pocket you need to get this kid some help he thinks hes hawaiian i see these suburban rasta boys all the time hell paias crawling with them but this one hes troubled one of my boys goes that way id pay for a shrink hes not my kid i know how you feel his girlfriend is cute though makes you wonder how they pick em doesnt it thanks officer nate said having shared all the paternal camaraderie he could handle he turned and walked out into the blinding maui sun to kona amy said you better now baby kona nodded into her shoulder where hed been pretending to seek comfort in a nuzzle good then move your hand the surfer played his fingers over her bottom like anemones in a tidal wash anchored yet flowing thats it amy said she snatched a handful of his remaining dreads and quickstepped through the double glass doors dragging the bentover surfer behind her ouch ouch ouch kona chanted in perfect fourfour reggae rhythm chapter thirteen spirits in the night nate spent the whole afternoon and most of the evening trying to analyze spectrograms of whalesong recordings correlate behavior patterns and then chart the corresponding patterns of interaction the problem was figuring out what actually defined interaction for an eightythousandpound animal were animals interacting when they were five hundred yards away a thousand a mile ten miles the song was certainly audible for miles the low subsonic frequencies could travel literally thousands of miles in deep ocean basins nate tried to put himself in their world no boundaries no obstacles they lived for the most part in a world of sound yet they had acute eyesight both in and out of the water and special muscles in the eye that allowed them to change focus for either medium you interacted with animals you could both see and not see when nate and clay used satellite tags of which they could afford only a few or rented a helicopter from which they could observe animals from a wide perspective it appeared that the whales were indeed responding to each other from miles apart how do you study an animal that is socializing over a distance of miles the key had to be in the song in the signal somewhere if for no other reason than that was the only way to approach the problem midnight found him sitting alone in the office lit only by the glow of his computer monitor having forgotten to eat drink or relieve himself for four hours when kona came in whats that asked the surfer pointing to the spectrograph that was scrolling across the screen nate nearly jumped out of the chair then caught himself and pulled the headphones down the part thats scrolling is the spectrograph of the humpback song the different colors are frequency or pitch the wiggly line in this box is an oscilloscope it shows frequency too but i can use it to isolate each range by clicking on it kona was eating a banana he handed another one to nate without taking his eyes off the screen so this is what it looks like the song kona had forgotten to affect any of his accents so nate forgot to be sarcastic in reply its a way of looking at it humans are visual animals our brains are better suited to process visual information rather than acoustic information so its easier for us to think about sound by looking at it a whale or a dolphins brain is structured to process acoustics more than visuals what are you looking for im not sure im looking for a signal for some pattern of information in the structure of the song like a message maybe a message and its not in the musical parts kona asked the difference in notes like a song you know the prophet bob marley gave us the wisdom of him in song quinn swiveled in his chair and paused in midbite of his banana him whats that his imperial majesty haile selassie emperor of ethiopia lion of judah jesus christ on earth son of god his blessings upon us jah mon you mean haile selassie the ethiopian king who died in the s that haile selassie yah mon him the direct descendant of david as foretold in isaiah through the divine consort solomon and makeda the queen of sheba and from their sons all the emperors of ethiopia have come so we rastas believe that haile selassie is jesus christ alive on earth but hes dead hows that work it helps to be stoned i see nate said well that did explain a lot anyway to answer your question yes weve looked at the musical transmission but despite bob marley i think the answer is here in this low register but only because it travels the farthest can you freeze this said kona pointing to the oscilloscope a green line dancing on a field of black nate clicked it and froze a jagged line on the screen why those teeth see there are tall ones and not so tall ones theyre called microoscillations you can only see them if you have the wave stopped like this what if the tall one is a one and the short one is a zero whats that binary yah mon what if its computer talk like that nate was stunned not because he thought kona was right but because the kid had actually had the cognitive powers to come up with the question nate wouldnt have been more surprised if hed walked in on a team of squirrels building a toaster oven maybe the kid had run out of pot and this spike in intelligence was just a withdrawal symptom thats not a bad guess kona but the only way the whales would know about this would be if they had oscilloscopes and they dont no they dont oh and that acoustic brain that couldnt see this no said nate not entirely sure that he hadnt just lied hed never thought of it before okay i go for to sleep now you need more grinds no thanks for the banana jahs blessing mon thanks for getting me out for jail this day we going go out next morning maybe not everyone well have to see how clay feels tomorrow he went right to his cabin when clair brought him home from the hospital oh boss clay got cool runnings brah he having sweet agonies with sistah clair i hear them love jams as im coming over well good nate said thinking from konas tone and his smile that whatever he said must have been good good night kona good night boss before the surfer was out the door nate had turned to the monitor and started mapping out peaks in the wave pattern of the low end of the whale song hed need to look up some articles on bluewhale calls the lowest loudest longesttraveling calls on the planet and hed have to see if anyone had done any numerical analysis on dolphin sonar clicks and that was all he could think of right at the moment in the meantime he had to have enough of a sample to see if there was any meaning there it was ridiculous of course it would never be so simple nor could it be so complex of course you could assign values of one or zero to parts of the song that was easy it didnt mean there would be any meaning to it it wouldnt necessarily answer any of their questions but it was a different way of looking at things whalecall binary no two hours later he was still assigning ones and zeroes to different microoscillations in wave patterns of different songs and felt as if he might actually strangely amazingly be learning something when clay came through the door wearing a kneelength pink kimono emblazoned with huge white chrysanthemums there was a small bandage on his forehead and what appeared to be a lipstick smear that ran from his mouth to his right ear any beer in there clay nodded to the kitchen the office cabin like all the others at papa lani had once been living quarters for a whole family so it had a full kitchen in addition to the great room they used for a main office two smaller rooms they used for storage and a bathroom clay padded past and threw open the refrigerator nope water i guess im really dehydrated you okay nate said how was the cat scan im cat free clay came back to the office and fell into the chair in front of his broken monitor thirteen stitches in my scalp maybe a mild concussion ill be okay clair may kill me yet tonight though heart attack stroke affection nothing like a neardeath experience to bring out the passion in a woman you cant believe the stuff that woman is doing to me and shes a schoolteacher its shameful clay grinned and nate noticed a little lipstick on his teeth so thats shame nate gestured for clay to wipe his mouth the photographer took a swipe across his mug came up with a handful of color and examined it no i think thats strawberry lip gloss a woman her age wearing flavored lip gloss the shame is in my heart you really had her worried clay me too if amy hadnt kept her head well i fucked up i know it i started living in the viewfinder and forgot where i was it was an amateurish mistake but you cant believe the footage i was getting using the rebreather its going to be amazing for singers im finally going to be able to get underneath them beside them whatever you need i just need to remember where i am youre unbelievably lucky nate knew that any lecture he might come up with clay had already put himself through a dozen times still he had to say it regardless of the outcome he had endured the loss of his friend even if was for only forty minutes or so unconscious that deep for that long you used up a lot of lives on that one clay the fact that your mouthpiece stayed in is a miracle well that part wasnt an accident i have the hoses tight because the rebreather is so temperamental about getting water in it over the years ive had mouthpieces knocked out of my mouth a hundred times kicked out by another diver camera caught on it hit by a dolphin since you have to keep your head back to film most of the time anyway with the hoses short so the thing stays in your mouth its just a matter of keeping the seal mans only instinct is to suck and you suck is that what youre saying look nate i know youre mad but im okay something was going on with that animal it distracted me it wont happen again i owe it to the kid though we thought wed lost her too shes good nate really good she kept her head she did what needed to be done and damned if i know how she did it but she brought my ancient ass up alive and without the bends situation was reversed i would have never done the decompression stops but it turns out she did the right thing you cant teach that kind of judgment youre just trying to change the subject clay was indeed trying to change the subject howd toronto do against edmonton tonight oh sure thought nate try to appeal to his inherent canadian weakness for hockey like playing the hockey card would distract him from i dont know lets check the score from outside the screen door came clairs voice clay demodocus are you wearing my robe why yes dear i am said clay shooting an embarrassed glance at quinn as if hed only just noticed that he was wearing a womans kimono well that would mean that im wearing nothing wouldnt it said clair she wasnt close enough to the door for him to actually see her through the screen but quinn had no doubt she was naked had her hip cocked and was tapping a foot in the sand i guess said clay we were just going to check the hockey scores sweetheart would you like to come in theres a skinny kid with a half order of dreadlocks and an erection out here staring at me clay and its making me feel a little selfconscious i woke up with it bwana clay kona said no disrespect hes an employee darling clay said reassuringly then to quinn he whispered i had better go you better had said quinn see you in the morning you should take the day off nah ill see you in the morning what are you working on anyway putting the subsonic part of the song in binary ah interesting feeling vulnerable out here clair said vulnerable and angry i had better go said clay night clay an hour later just when nate was getting to the point where he felt he had enough samples marked out in binary to start looking for some sort of pattern the third spirit in the night came through the door amy in a mans tshirt that hung to midthigh yawning and rubbing her eyes the hell you doing up at this hour its three in the morning working amy padded barefoot across the floor and looked at the monitor where quinn was working trying to blink the bleariness out of her eyes that the low end of the song yeah that and some bluewhale calls i had for comparison quinn could smell some kind of berry shampoo smell coming off of amy and he became hyperaware of the warmth of her pressing against his shoulder i dont understand youre digitizing it manually that seems a little primitive the signal is already digitized by virtue of being on the disk isnt it im looking at it a different way it will probably wash out but im looking at the waveform of just the low end theres no behavior for context so its probably a waste of time anyway but still youre up at three in the morning anyway making ones and zeroes on a screen mind if i ask why quinn waited a second before answering trying to figure out what to do he wanted to turn to look at her but she was so close that hed be right in her face if he did this wasnt the time instead he dropped his hands into his lap and sighed heavily as if this were all too tedious he looked at the monitor as he spoke okay amy heres why here it is the whole payoff the whole jazz of what we do okay okay she sensed the unease in his voice and stepped back nate turned and looked her in the eye it might be out on the boat as youre coming in for the day or it might be in the lab at four in the morning after working on the data for five years but there comes a point where youll find something out where youll see something or where something will suddenly come together and youll realize that you know something that no one else in the world knows yet just you no one else you realize that all the value you have is in that one thing and youre only going to have it for a short time until you tell someone else but for that time you are more alive than youll ever be thats the jazz amy thats why people do this put up with low pay and high risk and crap conditions and fuckedup relationships they do it for that singular moment amy stood with her hands clenched in front of her arms straight down like a little girl trying to ignore a lecture she looked at the floor so youre saying that youre about to have one of these moments and im bugging you no no thats not what im saying i dont know what im doing im just telling you why im doing it and thats why youre doing it too you just dont know it yet and what if someone told you that youd never have one of those moments of knowing something again would you keep doing it that wont happen so youre close to something here with this binary thing maybe didnt ryder analyze the song as far as how much information it could carry and come up with something really anemic like point six bits per second thats not really enough to make it meaningful is it growl ryder had been quinns doctoral adviser at uc santa cruz one of the first generation of greats in the field along with ken norris and roger payne a true kahuna his first name was actually gerard but anyone who had known him called him growl because of his perpetually surly nature ten years ago off the aleutians hed gone out alone in a zodiac to record bluewhale calls and had never come back quinn smiled at his memory true but ryder died before he finished that work and he was looking at the musical notes and themes for information im actually looking at waveform just from what ive done tonight it looks like you can get up to fifty sixty bits per second thats a lot of information that cant be right that wont work amy said she seemed to be taking this information a bit more emotionally than nate would have expected if you could move that much information subsonically the navy would be using it for submarines besides how could the whales use waveform theyd need oscilloscopes she was up on her toes now almost shouting calm down im just looking into it dolphins and bats dont need oscilloscopes to image sonically maybe theres something there just because im using a computer to look at this data doesnt mean i think whales are digital its only a model for christs sake he was going to pat her shoulder to comfort her but then remembered her attitude toward that at the jail youre not looking at data nate youre making it up youre wasting your time and im not sure youre not wasting my time this whole job might have been a big mistake amy i dont understand why but she wouldnt give him a chance to defend himself go to bed nate youre delirious we have real work to do tomorrow and youll be worthless if you dont get some sleep she turned and stormed out into the night even as she moved across the courtyard to her cabin nate could hear her ranting to herself the words doofus deluded and pathetic loser rang out above the tirade to settle on nates ego strangely enough a feeling of relief washed over him as he realized that the delusions of romantic grandeur that hed been indulging nay fighting about his research assistant had been just that delusions she thought he was a complete joke at peace with himself for the first time since amy had come on board he saved his work powered down the machine and went off to bed chapter fourteen down to the harbor down to the harbor they went past the condos the cane fields the golf course the burger king the buddhist cemetery with its great green buddha blissed out by the sea past the steak houses the tourist traps the old guy riding down front street on a girls bike with a macaw perched on his head down to the harbor they went they waved to the researchers at the fuel dock nodded to the haglets at the charter booths shakaed the divemasters and the captains and schlepped science stuff down the dock to start their day tako man stood in the back of his boat eating a breakfast of rice and octopus as the maui whale crew clay quinn kona and amy passed by he was a strong compact malaysian with long hair and a stringy soulpatch beard that along with the bone fishhooks he wore in his ears gave him the distinct aspect of a pirate he was one of the blackcoral divers who lived in the harbor and this morning as always he wore his wet suit hey tako clay said the diver glanced up from his bowl his eyes looked as if someone had poured shots of blood into them kona noticed that the small octopus in the divers bowl was still moving and he scampered down the dock feeling a case of the creeps fluttering to life in his spinal cord nightwalkers gray ones on your boat last night i seen them said tako man not the first time good to know said clay patronizing the diver and moving down the dock you had to keep peace with anyone who lived in the harbor especially the blackcoral divers who lived far over the edge of what most people would consider normal life they shot heroin drank heavily spent all day doing bounce dives to two hundred feet looking for the gemstonevaluable black coral then spent their money on weeklong parties that had more than once ended with one of them dead on the dock they lived on their boats and ate rice and whatever they could pull out of the sea tako man had gotten his name because on any given afternoon after the divers came in for the day youd see the grizzled malaysian carrying a net bag full of tako octopus that he had speared on the reef for their supper hi amy said sheepishly to tako man as they passed he glared at her through his bloody haze and his head bobbed as he almost nodded out into his breakfast amy quickened her pace and ran a pelican case she was carrying into the back of quinns thigh jeez amy quinn said having almost lost his footing do those guys dive in that condition amy whispered still sticking to quinn like a shadow worse than that would you back up a little hes scary youre supposed to protect me ya mook how do they keep from getting into trouble they lose one or two a year ironically its usually an overdose that gets them tough job theyre tough guys tako man shouted fuck you whale people youll see fucking nightwalker fuckers fucking fuck you haole motherfuckers he tossed the remains of his breakfast at them it landed overboard and tiny fish broke the water fighting for the scraps rum said kona too much hostility in dat buzz rum come from da cane and cane come from slavin the people and dat oppression all distilled in de bottle and come out a man mean as cat shit on a day yeah said clay to quinn didnt you know that about rum wheres your boat asked quinn my boat your boat clay said amy no said clay he stopped and dropped two cases of camera equipment on the dock the always confused the spiny and powerful twentytwofoot grady white centerconsole fisherman clays pride and joy was gone a life jacket a water bottle and various other familiar flotsam bobbed gently in a rainbow slick of gasoline where the boat had once been everyone thought someone else should say something but for a full minute no one did they just stood there staring at what should have been clays boat but instead was a big boatless gob of tropical air poop amy finally said saying it for all of them we should check with the harbormaster said nate my boat said clay who stood over the empty slip as if it were his recently runover boyhood dog he would have nuzzled it and stroked its little dead doggy ears if he could have but instead he fished the oily life jacket out of the water and sat on the dock rocking it he really liked that boat amy said can i get a duh for the sistah exclaimed the dreaded blond kid i paid the insurance nate said as he moved away headed for the harbormaster tako man had come down the dock from his own boat to stare at the empty water somber now amy backed up into kona for protection but kona had backed up into the next person behind him which turned out to be captain tarwater resplendent in his navy whites and newly konascuffed shoes irie ice cream man youre on my shoes what happened asked cliff hyland coming down the dock behind the captain clays boats gone said amy cliff moved up and put his hand on clays shoulder maybe someone just borrowed it clay nodded acknowledging that cliff was trying to comfort him but comfort fell like sandwiches on the recently bombed by the time quinn returned from the harbormasters office with a maui cop in tow there were a half dozen biologists three blackcoral divers and a couple from minnesota who were taking pictures of the whole thing thinking that this would be something they would want to remember if they ever found out what was happening as the cop approached the blackcoral divers faded to the edges of the crowd and away jon thomas fuller the scientistentrepreneur who was accompanied by three of his cute female naturalists stepped up beside quinn this is just horrible nate just horrible that boat represented a major capital investment for you guys im sure yeah but mainly we liked to think of it as something that floated and moved us around on the water nate actually had a great capacity for sarcasm but he usually reserved it for those things and people he found truly irritating jon thomas fuller was truly irritating going to be tough to replace it well manage it was insured you might want to get something bigger this time i know theres a measure of safety working off of these sixtyfivefooters we have but also with the cabin you can set up computers bow cameras a lot of things that arent really possible on little speedboats a goodsize boat would add a lot of legitimacy to your operation we sort of decided to go with the legitimacy we get from doing credible research jon thomas we didnt make those figures up fuller caught himself raising his voice the cop interviewing clay looked over his shoulder and fuller lowered his tone that was just professional jealousy on the part of our detractors your detractors were the facts what did you expect when your paper concluded that humpbacks actually enjoyed being struck by jet skis some do fuller pushed back his pith helmet and ventured a smile of sincerity which collapsed under its own weight whats your angle jon thomas nate i can get you a boat like ours with all the trimmings and an operating budget and youd just have to do one little project for me one season of work maximum and your operation can keep the boat sell it do whatever you want unless fuller was about to ask him to shove him off the dock into the oily water quinn pretty much knew he was going to turn down the offer but he had to ask those were really nice boats make your proposal i need you to put your name on a study that says that humandolphin interaction facilities are not harmful to the animals and do a study that says that building one at la perouse bay wouldnt have a negative impact on the environment then id need you to stand up at the appropriate meetings and make the case im not your guy jon thomas first im not a dolphin guy and you know that nate avoided adding what he wanted to say which was second you are a feckless weasel out to make a buck without any consideration for science or the animals you study instead he said there are dozens of people doing studies on captive dolphins why dont you go to them i have the animal study you dont have to do the study i just want your name on it wont the people who actually did the study have some objection to that no theyll be fine with it i need your name and your presence nate i dont think so i cant see myself testifying before impact committees and county planning boards okay fair enough clay or amy can do the standups just put your name on the paper and do the environmental impact study i need the credibility of your name which i wont have as soon as i let you use me im sorry but my name is all i really have to show for twentyfive years of work i cant sell it out even for a really nice boat oh right the nobility of starvation fuck that nate and fuck your high ideals im doing more for these animals by exposing the public to them than youll do in a lifetime of graphing out songs and recording behavior and before you retire to your ivory tower on the ethical high ground youd better take a good look at your people that kid is a common thief and no one has ever heard of your precious new assistant fuller turned and signaled to his chorus line of whalettes that they were going to their boat quinn looked for amy saw her on the other side of the cop who was talking to clay helping him fill in details he ran up behind fuller grabbed the smaller mans arm and spun him around what are you talking about amy studied at woods hole with tyack and loughten that right well maybe youd better give them a call and ask them because theyve never heard of her despite what you think i do my research nate do you now get back to your oneboat operation would you if i find out you had anything to do with this fuller wrenched his arm out of quinns grip and grinned right youll what become more irrelevant screw you nate what did you say but fuller ignored him and boarded his milliondollar research vessel while quinn skulked back down the dock to his friends oily flotsam seemed to be losing its allure however and the crowd had dispersed somewhat leaving only amy clay the cop and the couple from minnesota you youre somebody arent you asked the woman as nate walked up honey this guy is someone i remember seeing him on the discovery channel get my picture with him who is he said honey as his wife took nate by the arm and posed like hed just handed her a check i dont know one of those ocean guys she said through a grin acting as if she were posing with one of the carved statues that decorated doorways around lahaina just take the picture are you one of those cousteau fellas oui said nate now i muss speak with my good fren sylvia earle he continued in his frenchbywayofbritishcolumbiaandnortherncalifornia fake accent as he went over to amy i need to talk to you sylvia earle shes a national geographic person get their picture together honey hes lying nathan amy said you can check if you want it was all on the resume i gave to clay she didnt appear angry just hurt betrayed perhaps her eyes were huge and teary and she was starting to look vaguely like one of those creepy keane sadeyedkid pictures quinn felt like hed just smacked a bag of kittens against a truck bumper i know he said im sorry i just well jon thomas is an asshole i let him get to me its okay amy sniffed its just just ive worked so hard i dont need to check amy you do good work my fault for doubting you lets get clay squared away and get to work he tentatively put his arm around her and walked her back to where clay was finishing up his interview with the cop clay saw the tear tracks down amys face and immediately took her in his arms and pressed her head to his shoulder i know honey i know it was a great boat but it was just a boat well get another one wheres kona nate asked he was around here a second ago said clay just then nates cell phone rang he worked it out of his shirt pocket and answered it nathan its me said the old broad nate covered the mouthpiece its the old broad nate said to clay amy you go round up kona while i finish up with the officer okay clay said amy nodded and was off down the dock clay turned back to the officer the old broad went on nathan i spoke to that big male again today and he definitely wants you to take a hot pastrami on rye with you when you go out he said its very important im sure it is elizabeth but im not sure were even going out today somethings happened to clays boat its gone oh my he must be distraught ill come down and look after him but you have to get out in the channel today i just feel its very important i dont think youll need to come down elizabeth clay will manage well if you say so but you have to promise me youll go out today i promise and youll take a pastrami on rye for that big male ill try elizabeth i have to go now clay needs me for something with swiss cheese and hot mustard the old broad said as nate disconnected clay thanked the policeman who nodded to quinn as he walked off even the couple from minnesota had moved on and only clay and quinn were left on the dock where are the kids asked nate cringing at the whole idea he and clay the middleaged couple being responsible and boring while the kids went off to play and have adventures i asked amy to find kona they could be anywhere clay i need to ask you something before they get back shoot did you check any of amys references before you hired her i mean did you call anyone woods hole her undergrad school what was it cornell nope she was smart she was cute she seemed to know what she was talking about and she said shed work for free the bona fides looked good on paper gift horse nate jon thomas fuller said that he checked and that no one at woods hole has heard of her fullers an asshole look i dont really care if she finished high school the kid has proven herself shes got balls still maybe i should call tyack just in case if you need to call him this afternoon when you get back in im sure fuller was just yanking my chain he tried to offer us a boat like his if we backed his dolphinpark project and you turned him down of course but those are really nice boats our armada has been reduced by fifty percent our nautical resources have declined by more than onehalf our boatage is deficient by point five whats up amy said shed come back down the dock and seemed to have shaken off her earlier melancholy clays being scientific fuller offered us a sixtyfoot research vessel like his with operating budget if we back his dolphin project do i have to sleep with him we havent put that on the table clay said but ill bet we could get a sonar array if youre enthusiastic hell nate take it amy said it would mean selling out my credibility said quinn appalled at what total whores his colleagues had become wed be going over to the dark side amy shrugged those are really nice boats the corner of her mouth twitched as if she was trying not to grin and nate realized that she was probably goofing on him yeah said clay nice clay was goofing too hed be all right nate shook his head looking as if he were fighting disbelief but actually he was trying to shake the memory of his dream of driving a big cabin cruiser through the streets of seattle with amy displayed as the bikinied figurehead if youre okay clay we really should get out before the wind comes up go clay said ill get the police report for the insurance company to amy he said you find kona hes down there with that tako guy whats he doing down there it looked like he was building a saxophone i didnt go close quinn strode down the dock and looked to where kona was talking with tako man no thats his bong it breaks down for easy portage whats a bong cute amy help me get the equipment in the boat suddenly kona started shouting and running down the dock toward them bwanas i found the boat clay perked up where right there tako man says its right there he dove down there this morning kona was pointing to a patch of murky jade green water in the center of the harbor jade green because of all the waste flushed from the liveaboards as well as the bait fish guts seasickness and bird poop that went into the water faster than the scavengers could clean it out and so it caused a perpetual algae bloom my boat said clay looking forlornly at the empty water amy stepped up and put her arm around clays shoulders to resume stagetwo comfort he dove in that water the nightwalkers sank it bwana clay tako man saw them skinny bluegray guys he called them nightwalkers i think aliens aliens are always gray arent they inquired quinn thats what i say to him said kona but he say no not with the lightbulb head he say they tall and froggy youre high said clay tako man got dank mystical buds brah was a spiritual duty hes not criticizing you kona quinn explained we just assume that youre high clays just doubting the credibility of your story you dont believe i give a man a mask ill dive down and get a ting off da boat for proof hepatitis thats what youll bring up said amy im going to work said nate my boat said clay nate decided that perhaps he should offer a measure of solace look at the bright side clay at least whales are big how is that the bright side we could be studying viruses you have any idea what it costs to replace a scanning electron microscope my boat said clay chapter fifteen a song for your supper amy picked the whale it had been a stressful morning for her and quinn wanted to convey his complete confidence in her so he handed over the headphones and took directions as they narrowed down which of their whales was actually the singer wait a second amy said shut down the engine and then she did something that quinn had seen no one do for twentyfive years and then it had been his mentor gerard ryder who most people agreed had been eccentric to the point of being fullblown bat shit amy hung over the side by her knees and put her head in the water after about thirty seconds she swung up spraying a great crest of seawater all over the boat then pointed north hes over there that doesnt work you know said quinn it was pretty much accepted that humans didnt have directional hearing underwater he was just gently trying to remind her go that way thats where our whale is okay there may indeed be a singer over there but you didnt locate him by hearing him she just stood there next to him dripping on his feet the console the field notes looking at him okay im going he started the engine and pushed the throttle over tell me when i get there a couple of minutes later amy signaled for him to cut the engine and she was hanging over the side with her head in the water while the boat was still coasting well this is just stupid nate said while amy was submerged amy dedunked long enough to say i heard that looks like youre bobbing for whales is what it looks like shut up said amy up for a breath im trying to listen you look like that cartoon character in bc that used to watch fish all day that way said amy up again pointing and dogshaking the water out of her hair onto the phd about six hundred yards six hundred yards youre sure give or take fifty if were within a half mile of a singer ill buy you dinner kay what do you suppose the freight is to fly a lobster from maine to my plate in lahaina im not going to need to know that drive the boat please over there and she pointed again not unlike babe ruth indicating the wrigley field fence over which he would hit the famous promised home run except amy was thin a girl and alive quinn heard the singer even before they put the hydrophone in the water the whole boat started resonating to the song as they coasted into a drift amy hopped up on the bow and pointed to some white spots dancing below the surface pectoral fins and a tail there he is if there had been a crowd they would have gone wild quinn smiled amy looked back at him and grinned steak and lobster she said something red and french and expensive for the wine something on fire for dessert dont care what it is long as theres flames coming off it then a backrub before i send you back to your cabin alone disappointed and confused ha its a date said quinn no its not a date its a bet which you have lost miserably because you had the audacity to doubt me and for which you shall remain ever sorry ha shall we work now or would you like to gloat a bit longer hmmm let me think about it shes so small yet she contains so much evil quinn thought he threw the field journal at her and read her the longitude and latitude off the gps films in the camera new roll i loaded it this morning i was thinking id gloat some more amy picked up the notebook then paused as she opened it to begin writing singing stopped sometimes i think they just stop singing to freak me out hes moving amy said pointing moving quinn repeated he looked over the side and saw the white pec fins and flukes flash out of sight hold on he started the engine they can hunt these kind as far as im concerned quinn said after theyd been on the whale for two hours theyd recorded three full cycles of the song and gotten a crossbow biopsy but the whale simply would not fluke so they hadnt been able to get an id photo a lot of good it did to have a dna sample when you couldnt identify the animal hunt them and make them into pet food nate continued get their tainted nonfluking genes out of the gene pool maybe you should have a doughnut or something get your blood sugar up amy said use their pathetic nonfluking baleen for corsets and umbrella stays use their vertebrae for footstools use their intestines to make giant nonfluking whale sausages to serve at state fairs remove their putrid unfluking gonads and i thought you liked these animals yeah but not when they wont cooperate the whale had led them five miles out toward molokai and very close to the wind line where the waves were too big and the current too fast to stay on a singer if the whale continued in this direction they would lose him within the next two dive cycles and the day would be wasted what was even more frustrating was that this animal was hanging in the water and singing with his tail only a few feet below the surface typically a singer in the channel would be thirty to fifty feet down this guy was at about seven nate kept having to pull up the hydrophone to keep it from bopping the whale in the noggin as they drifted over it hes coming up amy said she grabbed the camera off the seat and aimed it at a spot twenty yards or so in front of the boat so the autofocus and exposure would already be set nate pulled up the hydrophone with two yanks and started the engine the whale was moving faster this time nate adjusted the throttle to put amy at the right distance for a fullframe tail shot one breath and he was down for ten seconds another breath twelve seconds another breath and the great tail peduncle arched high into the air looks like hes going to do it nate said ready amy said the tail cleared the water by just a foot presenting an edge view instead of a flat horizontal view that would give them all the markings but nate thought he saw something something that looked like black letters on the underside of the tail you get that you get that i got what there was he didnt present very well amy had run the motor drive for the whole cycle of the dive maybe eight frames did you see those markings on the underside the black uh stripes quinn whipped off his sunglasses and wiped them with his tshirt stripes nate i didnt see anything but edge through the camera damn it look he fluked maybe he will again thats not the point its not get up on the bow see if you can find him amy stood on the bow and directed quinn when she dropped her arm he killed the engine and there was the whale hanging there singing his tail not ten feet under the water they werent a hundred yards off the wind line and the boat was drifting away from the whale faster than it had before theyd be over it for only a minute or so this close to the wind line theyd probably lose him the next time he came up nate was not going to finish this day wondering if he was having hallucinations again amy hand me my mask and flippers from the bow cabinet would you youre going in the water yes but you never go in the water im going in the water nate opened a plastic pelican case and pulled out his nikonos iv underwater camera checked to make sure it was loaded youre not a water guy see if theres a weight belt in there too clay says youre not a water guy youre a boat guy im going to get an id photo from under his tail if hes going to be accommodating enough to stay this close to the surface im going to go get the photo can you do that why not she handed him a belt weighted with ten pounds of lead and nate buckled it around his hips he pulled on the mask and fins then sat on the gunwale with his back to the water youre going to drift off of me im not going to try to swim to catch you so come back and get me wait till i wave i dont want you to start the engine until im sure i have the picture keep recording until you come get me kay amys mouth was sort of hanging open as if shed just been slapped this is no big deal right you want me to do it its my fault i didnt get the shot last time not your fault the shot wasnt there see ya quinn put the snorkel in his mouth and rolled backward off the boat at seventyfive degrees the water was still cold enough to knock the breath out of him he floated to the surface and tried to take controlled breaths until his system adjusted the whale was close only a hundred or so feet away the song reverberated in nates ribs as he kicked over to it this had to be the bite me whale even if hed somehow been wrong about there actually being letters there were certainly some strange markings on this animals tail and there was more than that too if he could prove to himself that this was the same animal it would mean that the whale had stayed in the general area of the auau channel for over three weeks which was fairly unusual of course conclusions werent reached from that lack of data it could simply be that they hadnt computerized the catalog of hawaiian id photos the way they had in alaska and without the first picture thered be no proof that this was the same animal but quinn would know he would know that had become the impetus of this silly mission not just proving that he wasnt hallucinating he was a man of science of facts of reason he didnt need to prove he was sane im out of my mind he thought hed never even heard of anyone trying to do an id photo underwater the animal was perfectly motionless a great swath of gray in a field of infinite blue but quinn thought he saw movement on the far side of the whale he lifted his head out of the water and looked back at the boat amy gave him a thumbsup he took a deep breath and made his dive to take the photo if hed been wearing tanks he might have let the weight belt take him down slowly but he knew hed be able to stay down for only forty to sixty seconds so he went headfirst kicking hard until he was down twenty or so feet then he leveled off holding the camera in front of him and looked up at the underside of the whales tail there it was in big sansserif spraypaintlike letters bite me he nearly forgot to take the picture how could this possibly be had the animal somehow been caught in a net when it was younger and marked by a sardonic fisherman before being released was it one of those animals that had swum up a river and got stranded then been rescued by an army of fishandgame people he centered the tail in the viewfinder and hit the shutter advanced the film and shot again then he needed to breathe he turned and kicked to the surface but again he saw the dark shape moving near the whale remora he thought although it looked too big to be one of the parasite fish that often attached themselves to whales at the surface he looked back down at the singer near the left pec where hed seen the movement the animal was doing ribbits quinn smiled around his snorkel took three deep breaths held then dove again this time before he could get the camera up he saw the movement of a dark fin on the far side of the whale and he squinted to see deep into the blue distance bluewater willies was how hed always thought of it the feeling you get when you realize that something big and carnivorous could come at you from any direction then you start looking for gray missiles in the blue like looking for a malevolent face to appear at a dark window then the whale moved the wash of the tail pushed quinn back but he maintained his bearings and started toward the surface trying to keep his eye on the animal the whale turned around in little more than its own length and shot toward nate he kicked laterally trying to move to one side or another then up so hed be tossed over the top of the animal rather than under it as it came up because it was definitely going to bump him he looked back beyond his fins as he kicked and saw the whale adjust its direction to keep coming toward him nate kicked once for the surface then looked back again to see the animals enormous mouth opening beneath him no this cant be happening he thought the panic rising in his chest demanded air but it was as if the entire ocean had opened up a hole behind him and he wasnt going to make it to the surface the whale came halfway out of the water as it scooped him up and nate saw sky and white water and baleen fringing the upper jaw above all of it framed by the huge trapezoid that was the whales open mouth then he felt the whale sinking back and he saw the baleen close over him he rolled into a ball hoping not to be crushed by the jaws hoping to be spit out as a horrible dining mistake but then the great tongue came forward warm and rough driving him against the baleen plates it was like being smashed into a wroughtiron fence by a wet nerf volkswagen he could feel the baleen ripping the skin on his back as the tongue covered him pressing the seawater out around him as it would strain krill then crushing him until the last of the air exploded from his body and he blacked out part two jonahs people men really need sea monsters in their personal oceans for the ocean deep and black in the depths is like the low dark levels of our minds in which the dream symbols incubate and sometimes rise up to sight like the old man of the sea john steinbeck chapter sixteen shoes off in the whale shoes off in the whale a male voice said out of the dark quinn could see nothing his entire body ached like well like it had been chewed he crawled to his hands and knees on what felt like wet latex he reached down and felt for his feet he still had his flippers on and logic protested through his confusion im not wearing shoes these are fins shoes off in the whale and dont try and make a break for the anus two things that if asked about an hour earlier nate might have said with conviction hed never hear in a lifetime of conversation what quinn said squinting into the dark he realized that he was still wearing his dive mask and reached up to push it back ill bet he didnt bring the pastrami on rye i asked for either did he came the voice shapes began to define themselves in the darkness and nate saw a face not a foot away from his he gasped and pulled away from it for although it seemed to be examining him with great interest the face was not human clay demodocus was known throughout the world as one of the calmest most leveltempered most generous and considerate individuals in the entire milieu of marine biology his reputation preceded him when he went on assignment and people took it for granted that he would remain amiable throughout a long voyage in cramped quarters as well as efficient in his own work respectful of the work of others and coolheaded in an emergency because he often had to subjugate himself to the head researcher on any given assignment clay did not indulge in ego battles and testosteroneslinging contests with researchers or crew none of these qualities were evident when he went over the desk of the coast guard commandant and stopped only inches from headbutting the tall athleticlooking officer you call this search off now and ill see to it that your name is remembered for all time in concert with adolf eichmann and vlad the impaler nathan quinn is a legend in his field and every time theres a documentary on whales on the discovery channel or national geographic or animal planet or pbs or the fucking cartoon channel ill see to it that your name is mentioned right after nates as the man who left him out there youll be the official coast guard pariah for the next hundred years this will be the coast guards my lai every time a kid drowns your name will be mentioned nay every time someone gets a soaker the name of commodore whateveryournameis shall be brought forth and your effigy burned in the streets and your head stuck on a pole lipsticked and marched around school yards forever and all because youre too goddamned lamebrained to put a couple of helicopters into the air to find my friend is that what you want clay had strong views on loyalty the commodore had been in the coast guard for most of his adult life spending the majority of his time and energy either rescuing people or training others to do so and as a result he was taken aback more than somewhat by clays tirade he looked across his office to where kona and amy stood by the door looking nearly as haggard as he felt the surfer looked at him and shook his head sadly its been three days mr demodocus in open water with no life preserver youre not a tourist you know the odds if he were alive hed have drifted far out of where were able to patrol by now anyway were doing no fewer than ten rescues a day on maui i cant have our helicopters out to sea when theres just no chance what about tide maps currents clay pleaded cant we try to predict which way he might have drifted narrow the search area the commodore had to look away from clay when he answered the first thing the surfer kid with the uneven dreadlocks had said when theyd come into his office was sucks to be you and right now the commodore couldnt have agreed more hed lost friends at sea he understood im sorry he said clay sighed heavily and his shoulders sagged amy came forward and took him by the arm lets go home clay clay nodded and allowed himself to be led out of the commodores office as they made their way across the parking lot to clays truck kona said that was amazing clay throwing a fit yeah im proud of that especially since it worked so well why didnt you say anything about the whale eating nate in the three days since quinn had disappeared kona had forgotten to speak brophonics and rasta talk almost completely and now he just sounded like a kid from new jersey with a whoa dude surfer accent whales dont eat people kona clay said you know better i know what i saw amy said clay stopped and stepped away from both of them look if youre going to do this stuff you have to be practical i believe that you saw what you say you saw but nothing about it helps first a humpbacks throat is only about a foot in diameter they couldnt swallow a human if they wanted to so if the whale did scoop up nate then theres a good chance he was spit out very quickly second if i told that story to everyone else either theyd think you were being hysterical or if they believed you theyd assume that nate had been drowned immediately and there wouldnt have been a search i believe you kid but dont think anyone else will so what now kona asked clay looked at the two of them standing there like abandoned puppies and he pushed aside his own grief we finish nates work we do this work we carry on right now ive got to go up the mountain and see the old broad nate was like a son to her you havent told her amy asked clay shook his head why would i i havent given up on nate ive seen too much last year they thought theyd lost one of the blackcoral divers the boat came back to where theyd sent him down and he was gone a week later he called from molokai for them to come get him hed swum over and had been so busy partying hed forgotten to call doesnt sound like nate kona said he told me that he hated fun still it would be wrong not to let the old broad know whats happened amy said clay patted them each on the back intrepid he said as he drove up the volcano clay tried to formulate some gentle way of breaking the news to the old broad since his mother had passed away clay had taken the bearing of bad news very seriously so seriously in fact that he usually let someone else do the bearing hed been in antarctica on assignment for national science snowed in at the naval weather station for six months when his mother still in greece had gone missing she was seventyfive and the villagers knew she couldnt have gone far yet search as they might they did not find her for three days finally her location was revealed by her ripening odor they found her dead in an olive tree where she had climbed to do some pruning clays older brothers hektor and sidor would not hold the funeral without clay the baby yet they knew their brother would be completely out of touch for months he is the rich american came the ouzobesotted lament he should take care of mama perhaps he will even fly us to america for the funeral and so the two brothers having inherited their mothers weakness for alcohol and their fathers bad judgment packed the remains of mother demodocus in an olive barrel filled the barrel with the preserving brine and shipped it off to their rich younger brothers house in san diego the problem was in their grief or perhaps it was their stupor they forgot to send a letter leave a message or for that matter put a packing label on the barrel so months later when clay returned to find the barrel on his porch he broke into it thinking he was about to enjoy a delicious snack of kalamata olives from home it was not the way to find out about his mothers death and it engendered in clay very strong views about loyalty and the bearing of bad news i will do this right he thought as he pulled into the old broads driveway theres no reason for this to be a shock there were cats and crystals everywhere the old broad led him through the house and had him sit in a wicker emperors chair that looked out over the channel while she fetched some mango iced tea for them the house could have been designed by gauguin and landscaped by rousseau it was small just five rooms and a carport but it sat on twenty acres of fruitsalad jungle banana trees mango lemon tangerine orange papaya and coconut palm as well as a florists dream of orchids and other tropical flowers the old broad had cultivated a low soft grass under all the trees that was like a golfcourse green over sponge cake the house was made almost entirely of dark koa wood nut brown and with black grain running through it polished to a smooth satin and as hard as ebony there was a highpeaked galvanizedtin roof with a vented tower in the center to draw heat out the top and cool air in from under the wide eaves that surrounded the whole house there were no windows just open sliding walls you could look through any part of the house to the other and see the tropical garden the old broads telescope and bigeye binoculars stood on steel and concrete mountings in front of where clay sat looking very much out of place the artillery of science planted in paradise at clays feet a skinny cat happily crunched the legs off a scorpion the old broad handed clay a tall icy glass and sat in another emperors chair beside him she was barefoot and wore a flowered caftan and a yellowandred hibiscus blossom in her hair that was half the size of her face she had probably been a dish back around the time of lincoln clay thought its so nice to see you clay i dont get many visitors not that im lonely you know i have the cats and the whales to talk to but thats not like having one of my boys to visit with oh jeez clay thought one of her boys oh jeez he had to tell her he knew he had to tell her he had come up here to tell her and he was going to tell her and that was that this is excellent tea elizabeth mango you say thats right just a little bit of mint now what is it you needed to talk to me about and ice i think the coldness makes it gives it a fantastic uh temperature yes ice is an essential ingredient in iced tea clay thus the name sarcasm is so ugly on the aged thought clay no one likes a sarcastic oldster he said iced tea you mean oh this is just going to kill her he thought if this is about a new boat clay dont be shy i know how you loved that boat and well get you another one im just not sure we can go for one quite that nice my investments havent been doing well the last couple of years no no its not the boat the boat was insured its nate and how is nathan i hope hes handling his little infatuation with your new researcher with a bit of dignity he was wearing it on his sleeve that night at the sanctuary youd think a man as smart as nathan would have better control over his impulses nate had a thing for amy clay was going to tell her really he was just working up to it you said had said the old broad you said nate had a thing for amy elizabeth theres been an accident three days ago nate went into the water to get a better look at a singer and well we havent been able to find him clay put down his tea so he could catch the old woman should she faint im very sorry oh that yes i heard about that nates fine clay the whale told me and here clay found himself balancing on another dilemma should he let her have her belief no matter how crazy it might be or should he dash her spirits to earth with the truth although nate had found elizabeths eccentricities irritating clay had always liked her insistence that the whales spoke to her he wished it were true he scooted to the edge of his chair and took her hand in his elizabeth i dont think you understand what im saying he took the pastrami and rye right he said he would um thats not exactly pertinent hes been gone for three days and they were right at the wind line toward molokai when he was lost rough sea hes probably gone elizabeth well of course hes gone clay youll just have to carry on until he gets back now she patted his hand he did take the sandwich right the whale was very specific elizabeth youre not listening to me this is not about the whales singing to you through the trees nate is gone dont you shout at me clay demodocus im trying to comfort you and it wasnt a song through the trees what do you think im some crazy old woman the whale called on the phone oh jesus joseph and mary i dont know how to do this more tea asked the old broad as clay made the long drive down the volcano and back to papa lani he tried to fight letting his spirits rise the old broad was completely convinced that nathan quinn was just fine and dandy although she could give no reason other than to say that the whale after ordering a pastrami on rye had told her that everything would be all right and how did you know it was the whale on the phone asked clay well he told me thats who he was and it was a male voice well it would be hes a singer isnt he shed gone on like that reassuring him encouraging him to go back to work dismissing any guilt or grief until he was almost to the gates of the compound before he remembered shes a total loony he said to himself as if he just needed to hear the words to feel their truth nothing is all right nates dead clair would be sleeping at her house tonight and although it was late clay could not make himself go to sleep instead he went to the office knowing that nothing in the world could eat up time like editing video he attached a digital video camera to his computer and turned on the recently replaced giant monitor blue filled the screen and then he could sense the motion of descent but there was only a faint hiss of his breathing not the usual fusillade of bubbles from a regulator this was the rebreather footage from the day he had almost drowned hed completely forgotten about it the breathholders tail came into frame clays first instincts had been right this was great footage of a breathholder the best theyd ever recorded as he passed the tail the genital slit came into view and he could tell that they were dealing with a male there were black marks on the underside of the tail but the view was still edge on and he couldnt make out their shape he heard a faint kazoo sound in the background and ran back the tape with the sound turned up this time his breath sounded like a bull snorting before a charge the kazoo sound louder now like a voice through wax paper he ran back the tape again and cranked the sound all the way up bringing down the high frequency to kill some of the hiss definitely voices theres someone outside captain does he have my sandwich with him hes close captain really close too close then the tail came down and there was a deafening thud the picture jerked in a half dozen directions then settled as tiny bubbles passed by the lens in a field of blue the lens caught a shot of clays fin as he sank and then it was just blue and the occasional shot of the lanyard that secured the camera to his wrist clay ran the tape back again confirmed the voices then set it to dub onto the computer hard drive so he could manipulate the audio in a waveform the way they did with sound recordings even though he was sure what was on the tape he couldnt figure out how it could possibly have gotten there only five minutes of watching little progress bars move across the monitor and he could stand the suspense no longer he smiled to himself because now was the time he would have gone to nate as he had so many times before to help him figure out exactly what it was they were hearing or looking at but nate was gone he checked his watch and deciding that it wasnt too insanely late he headed across the compound to get amy chapter seventeen jonathan livingston reaper amy wore an oversized tattered im with stupid nightshirt and local motion flipflops her hair was completely flat on one side and splayed out into an improbable sunburst of spikes on the other making it appear that she was getting hit in the side of the head by a tiny hurricane which she wasnt she was however performing the longest sustained yawn clay had ever seen ooo ahee i aya oa a she said in yawnspeak a language not unlike hawaiian known for its paucity of consonants you go ahead im okay she was saying she gestured for clay to continue clay cued the tape and fiddled with the audio a whale tail in a field of blue passed by on the monitor theres someone outside captain does he have my sandwich with him amy stopped yawning and scooted forward on the stool she was perched upon behind clay when the whale tail came down clay stopped the tape and looked back at her well play it again he did can we get a feeling for direction amy asked that housing has stereo microphones right what if we move the speakers far apart can we get a sense where its coming from clay shook his head the mikes are right next to each other you have to separate them by at least a meter to get any spatial information all i can tell you is that its in the water and its not particularly loud in fact if i hadnt been using the rebreather id never have heard it youre the audio person what can you tell me he ran it back and played it again its human speech clay looked at her as if to say uhhuh i woke you up because i needed the obvious pointed out and its military why do you think its military now amy gave clay the same look that he had just finished giving her captain oh right said clay speaker in the water divers with underwater communications what do you think didnt sound like it did it sound like it was coming from small speakers to you nope clay played it again sandwich he said sandwich the old broad said that someone called her claiming to be a whale and asked her to tell nate to bring him a sandwich amy squeezed clays shoulder hes gone clay i know you dont believe what i saw happened but it certainly wasnt about a sandwich conspiracy im not saying that amy damn it im not saying this had anything to do with nates he was going to say drowning and stopped himself accident but it might have to do with the lab getting wrecked the tapes getting stolen and someone trying to mess with the old broad someone is fucking with us amy and it might be whoever is recorded on this tape and theres no way the camera could have pulled a signal out of the air something on the same frequency or something a mobile phone or something through a halfinch of powdercoated aluminum housing and a hundred feet of water no that signal came in through the mike that im sure of amy nodded and looked at the paused picture on the screen so youre looking for two things someone military and someone who has an interest in nates work no one clay stopped himself again remembering what hed said to nate when the lab had been wrecked that no one cared about their work but obviously someone did tarwater amy shrugged hes military maybe leave the tape out ill run a spectrograph on the audio in the morning see if i can tell if its coming through some kind of amplifier ive got nothing left tonight im beat thanks clay said you get some rest kiddo im going to hit it too ill be heading down to the harbor first thing kay oh and hey the kiddo thing i didnt mean amy threw her arms around him and kissed the top of his head you big mook dont worry well get through this she turned and started out the door amy she paused in the doorway yeah can i ask you a personal question kinda shoot the shirt whos stupid she looked down at her shirt then back at him and grinned always seems to apply clay no matter where i am or who im with the smoke clears and the shirt is true you gotta hang on to truth when you find it i like truth clay said night clay night kiddo the next day the weather was blown out with whitecaps frosting the entire channel across to lanai and the coconut palms whipping overhead like epileptic dust mops clay drove by the harbor in his truck noting that the cabin cruiser that cliff hylands group had been using was parked in its slip then he turned around and caught a flash of white out of the corner of his eye as he drove past the hundredyearold pioneer inn captain tarwaters navy whites standing out against the green shiplap he parked his truck by the giant banyan tree next door and humped it over to the restaurant when clay came up to the table the hostess was just seating cliff hyland tarwater and one of their grad students a young blond woman with a raccoon sunburn and strawdry hair hey cliff clay said you got a minute clay how you doing hyland took off his sunglasses and stood to shake hands please join us clay looked at tarwater and the naval officer nodded sorry to hear about your partner he said then he looked back down at his menu the young woman sitting with them was watching the dynamic between the three men as if she might write a paper on it just a second clay said if i could talk to you outside now tarwater glanced up and gave cliff hyland an almost imperceptible shake of the head sure clay cliff said lets walk he looked to the junior researcher when she comes coffee portuguese sausage eggs over easy whole wheat the girl nodded hyland followed clay out to the front of the hotel which overlooked the harbor fueling station and the carthaginian a steelhulled replica of a whaling brig now used as a floating museum they stood side by side watching the harbor each with a foot propped on the seawall whats up clay what are you guys working on cliff you know i cant talk about that i signed a nondisclosure thing you got divers in the water people with underwater coms dont be silly clay youve seen my crew except for tarwater theyre just kids whats this about somebodys fucking with us cliff they sank my boat tore up the office took nates papers and tapes theyre even messing with one of our benefactors im not even sure they dont have something to do with nates and you think its me hyland took his foot off the seawall and turned to clay nate was my friend too ive known you guys what twentytwo twentythree years you cant think id do anything like that im not saying you personally what are you and tarwater working on cliff what would nate know that would interfere with what youre doing hyland stared at his feet scratched his beard i dont know you dont know you know what were doing figure it out listen i know you guys are using a big towable sonar rig right whats tarwater looking at some new kind of active sonar if it didnt have a hinky element he wouldnt be here on site mines damn it clay i cant tell you i can tell you that if i thought it was going to hurt the animals or anyone in the field for that matter i wouldnt be doing the work remember the navys pacific biological ocean science program were you in on that no birds wasnt it yeah seabirds the navy came to a bunch of field biologists with a ton of money wanted seabirds tagged and tracked behavior recorded population information habitat everything everyone thought the heavens had opened up and started raining money thought the navy was doing some sort of secret impact study to preserve the birds do you know what the study was actually for no that was before my time clay they wanted to use the birds as delivery systems for biological weapons wanted to make sure they could predict that theyd fly to the enemy probably fifty scientists helped in that study but it didnt happen clay did it i mean the data was valuable scientifically but the weapons project didnt pan out as far as we know thats the point how would we know until a seagull drops fucking anthrax on us cliff hyland had aged a couple of years in the few minutes theyd been standing there i promise clay if theres any indication that tarwater or the navy or any of the spooky guys that come around from time to time are involved with trying to sabotage you guys ill call you in an instant i promise you but i cant tell you what im working on or why i dont exactly have funding coming out my ears if i lose this im teaching freshmen about dolphin jaws im not ready for that i need to be in the field clay looked at him sideways and saw that there was real concern maybe even a spark of desperation in hylands eyes you know your funding might be a little easier to come by if you werent based in iowa i dont know if youve noticed but theres no ocean in iowa hyland smiled at the old dig thanks for pointing that out clay clay extended his hand you promise youll let me know absolutely clay left feeling totally spent the great head of steam hed built up through a night of fitful sleep had wilted into exhaustion and confusion he got in his truck and sat while sweat rolled down his neck he watched tourists in aloha wear mill around under the great banyan tree like giftwrapped zombies cliff hylands eggs were still steaming when he returned to the table tarwater looked up from his own breakfast and moved his snowwhite hat away from hylands plate as if the rumpled scientist might splash yolk over the gold anchors in a fit of disorganized eating everything all right the young woman at the table fidgeted and tried to look invisible clays still a little shaken up understandably he and nathan quinn have been working together a long time lucky they made it this long without selfdestructing tarwater said slipshod as they run that operation you see that kid that works for them not worth grinding up for chum cliff hyland dropped his fork in his plate nathan quinn was one of the most intuitively brilliant biologists in the field and clay demodocus may very well be the best underwater photographer in the world certainly when it comes to cetaceans you have no right the world turns doc yesterdays alphas are todays betas losers lose isnt that what you biologists teach cliff hyland came very close to burying a fork in tarwaters tanned forehead but instead he slowly climbed to his feet i need to use the restroom excuse me as he walked away hyland could hear tarwater lecturing the junior researcher on how the strong survive cliff dug his mobile phone out of the pocket of his safari shirt and began scrolling through the numbers clay was just dozing off in the drivers seat when his mobile trilled without looking at the display he figured it was clair checking up on him go baby clay its cliff hyland cliff whats up youve got to keep this under your hat clay its my ass i got you what is it cliff its a torpedo range were doing site studies for a torpedo test range not in the sanctuary right in the middle of the sanctuary jeepers cliff thats terrible i dont know if my hat is big enough to hold that you gave me your word clay whats with jeepers who says jeepers amy does shes a little eccentric tell me more does the navy have divers in the water chapter eighteen heinous fuckery most foul jeepers said amy she was at quinns computer streamers of digital videotape were festooned across her lap and over the desk oh thats heinous fuckery most foul said kona he was perched on the high stool behind amy and actually appeared to be trying to learn something when clay came in theyve been simulating explosions on the lee of kahoolawe with a big towable array of underwater speakers measuring the levels the speaker array is whats in that big case weve seen on their boat we have a couple of explosions on the singer tapes but distant amy said nate thought it might be naval exercises out at sea speaking of tapes clay picked up a strand of tape this isnt my rebreather footage is it im sorry clay i didnt get the video but i pulled the audio off before this happened want to see the spectrograph kona asked you think those voices in the water be navy divers clay looked at amy raised an eyebrow he wanted to learn cliff says therere no divers in the water that his operation is it militarily in the sanctuary anyway but he might not even know amy wadded up the videotape and chucked the resulting birds nest into the wastebasket how can they do that clay how can they put a torpedo range in the middle of the humpback sanctuary its not like people wont notice yeah shes a big ocean why here kona said i have no idea maybe they dont want there to be any mistake about whose waters theyre blowing up ordnance in if they blow them up in between a bunch of american islands maybe there cant be any misinterpretation about what theyre doing lost now kona said does not compute danger danger control room needs herb the rastafarian had affected an accent that seemed an excellent approximation of how a stoned robot might sound submarine warfare is all about hide and seek with other submarines clay said the crews are autonomous when theyre underwater they make decisions on whether theyre being attacked and whether to defend maybe if the navy just shot torpedoes off in the middle of the open sea someone might misinterpret the action as an attack its damn unlikely that a russian sub is going to be cruising up to wailea for brunch and misinterpret an attack they cant do that amy said they cant let them set off high explosives around the mothers and calves its just insane theyll go deep and say it doesnt bother them the navy will guarantee they wont blow up anything shallower than say four hundred feet the humpbacks dont dive that deep in this channel yes they do amy said no they dont clay said yes they do theres no data on that amy thats specifically what cliff hyland asked me about he wanted to know if we were doing any research on the depth of humpback dives said that it would be the only thing the navy would care about amy stood up and shoved the wheeled desk chair away it bounced off konas shins causing him to wince ease on up sistah amy this wasnt my idea clay said im just telling you what hyland told me fine amy said she pushed her way past clay and headed for the door where are you going somewhere else she let the screen door slam behind her clay turned to kona who appeared to be studying the ceiling with great concentration what you makin up that submarine war story kind of i read a tom clancy book once look kona im not supposed to know stuff nate knew stuff i just take the pictures you think the navy sink your boat maybe make something bad happen to nate the boat maybe i dont think they could have had anything to do with nate that was just bad luck the snowy biscuit all this getting under her skin mine too ill go put the calm on her thanks clay said he walked to the other side of the office slumped in his chair and pulled his editing tools up on the giant monitor a half hour later he heard a tiny voice coming through the screen door sorry amy said its okay she stepped into the room and stood there not looking as glazed as he would have expected if kona had put the calm on her in an herbal way sorry about your tape too the camera was making crunching noises on playback so i sort of rushed taking it out not a problem it was your big rescue scene it just made me look like an amateur i got most of it on the hard drive i think you did she stepped over to the monitor that it frame stopped the whale tail from the edge black marks barely visible just going through it to see if theres anything else the audio picked up the camera was running the whole time you were saving my bacon why dont you let it rest and let me take you out to lunch its tenthirty what youre mr rigid schedule all of a sudden come out to lunch with me i feel bad dont feel bad amy its a huge loss i im not dealing well myself you know to keep this work going well be needing some academic juice amy just stared at the frozen image of the whale tail and then she caught herself what oh youll get someone you put the word out youll have phds knocking the door down to work with you i was thinking about you me im crap i dont even have a bona fide hair color ink on my masters isnt even dry you read my resume actually i didnt you didnt you seemed intelligent you were willing to work for nothing nate read it though right i told him you were good and if its any consolation he thought the world of you thats how you hire im smart and im cheap thats it what kind of standards do you guys have have you met kona she looked back at the monitor then at clay again i feel so used honored but used look im thrilled you want to keep me on but im not going to bring you funding or legitimacy ill worry about that worry about it after lunch come on ill buy youre poor besides im meeting clair for lunch at one okay can i borrow nates uh the green truck keys are on the counter clay waved over his shoulder toward the kitchen amy took the keys then started out the door caught herself then ran back and threw her arms around the photographer i really appreciate your asking me to stay go take kona with you feed him hose him off nope if youre not coming im going solo tell clair hi for me go he looked back at the computer looked past the window at the brilliant maui sun then shut the computer down feeling very much as if nothing he did mattered or would ever matter again chapter nineteen scooter dont meep the whale tossed like a roller coaster moving through tomato soup great gutflopping waves of muscular motion quinn rolled to his hands and knees and urped his breakfast into a splatter pattern across the rubbery gray floor then heaved in time with the rhythm of the whales swimming until he was empty and exhausted hurl patrol came a voice out of the dark flush and gush boys the doc blew ballast back here came another voice quinn rolled onto his bottom and scooted away from the voices until he came against a bulkhead which was warm and moist and gave at his touch he felt huge muscles moving behind the skin and nearly jumped he scooted away then sat balled up near where hed been sick cold seawater rolled down from the front of the whale and over his feet taking his recently vacated breakfast with it his ears popped with a pressure increase and in a second the water was gone the interior of the whale looked like a bad van conversion done by a latex freak damp rubbery skin over everything lit by a light blue haze coming from the eyes up front the rest dimly lit by bioluminescent strips of green that ran over the top of the teardropshaped chamber at the front of the chamber on either side by the eyes two things sat in seats that wrapped around their bodies quinn didnt know what they were and his mind felt as if it were ripping open trying to grasp the whole of the situation details like nonhuman humanoids decked out in gray skin couldnt register enough space in his consciousness to be examined or analyzed in fact he could keep his eyes open for only a few seconds before the nausea returned inside the whale smelled like fish standing or sort of standing riding was a more appropriate term as everything inside the whale was moving behind the seated creatures were two men one about forty the other twentyfive both barefoot but wearing military khakis without insignias or any badges of rank but the older man was obviously in command quinn had tried for five minutes to ask them the questions coming into his mind but each time he opened his mouth he had to stop himself from throwing up hed always considered himself pretty seaworthy until now what he managed to get out before his gorge rose again it really helps with the incredulity if you accept that youre dead said the older man im dead i didnt say that but if you accept that you are it sort of quells the anxiety yeah if youre already dead what bad can really happen said the younger guy then i am dead nope breathe and go with the motion said the older guy its not going to stop so if you fight it youll lose your lunch added the young guy and then he let loose a giggle at his own joke theres less motion toward the front the head tracks close to level but you knew that quinn hadnt been able to apply any of his analytical powers to the situation because he flat couldnt accept it yes in another world he realized that he knew that the whales head would have less motion than the tail but hed never even considered that he might be thinking about it from the perspective of an internal organ im inside a whale ding ding ding hes gotten the bonus answer the young guy leaned back against the back of the seat where one of the gray creatures was sitting and a chairlike protrusion rose out of the floor to catch him tell him what hes won captain hospitality poe help the doctor up to the front so we can talk without him tossing his cookies the younger guy helped quinn to his feet and across the undulating floor to the chair thing that had risen behind one of the gray creatures facing the back of the ship once close to the creatures quinn couldnt take his eyes off them they were humanoid in that they had two arms two legs a torso and a head but their heads were like that of a pilot whale with a large melon in the front for transmitting and receiving sound underwater quinn guessed and their eyes were set wide to the side so the creatures would see with binocular vision their hands were inserted into consoles that rose out of the floor and appeared to have no instrumentation whatsoever except for some bioluminescent nodules that looked like cloudy eyeballs and emitted different colors of light the creatures appeared as if they had become part of the whale we call them the whaley boys the older man said they pilot the whale the one directly behind you is scooter the other one is skippy say hi guys the creatures turned as far as the chairs would allow them and made clicking and squeaking noises then seemed to smile at quinn while smiling they showed mouthfuls of sharp peglike teeth with the teeth set against their dark gray skins and the melon above the whaley boys put quinn in mind of more cheerful versions of the creature from the alien movies scooter saluted nate with a hand consisting of four very long webbed fingers and only the suggestion of a thumb they say hi said poe im poe this is captain poynter poynter the older man tipped his hat and offered a hand to shake quinn took it and waggled it limply the whaley boys dont speak english as we know it poe said although they have a few squeaks that come out like words theyre tapped directly in to the whales nervous system they steer it control all the processes at any given time we cant do much on the whales without them certainly could never drive one the whales and the whaley boys are made for each other poe pushed against the back of skippys seat and another seat formed out of the floor to cradle him as he leaned back into it i love that poe said poynter backed up to a rubbery bulkhead and a seat formed out of the wall to catch him as well if theyre paying attention theyll never let you fall poe grinned of course almost everything in here is soft child safe dont you know except the spine which runs over the top so you wouldnt be hurt if you did fall but just the same were secured when theyre doing maneuvers you think youre sick now wait until we go for a breach dont freak out poe turned to the whaley boys secure the doc boys the arms of the seat shape wrapped over quinns lap parts came over his shoulders and fused across his chest then around his hips and over his lap quinn freaked out get it off me get it off me i cant breathe prepare for breach said poynter scooter chirped skippy grinned similar restraints extruded from all their seats securing them the attitude of the whale changed going up at a nearly sixtydegree angle and then the angle went sharper as they moved quinn was looking backward at the tail section of the teardrop interior the lurching movement of the luminescent strips was starting to nauseate him he could feel his internal organs shifting with the acceleration and then the whale ship went vertical and airborne at the apex of the motion quinns stomach tried to escape through his diaphragm then shifted as they fell sideways there was an enormous concussion as the ship hit the water slowly the whale came back around and they were horizontal again the whaley boys chirped and clicked gleefully grinning back at quinn then at each other then back at quinn nodding as if to say was that cool or what their necks were nearly as wide as their shoulders and quinn could see heavy muscles moving under the skin they love that said poynter i kind of like it too said poe except when they go overboard and do twenty or thirty breaches in a row even i get sick when they do that and the noise well you heard it quinn shook his head closed his eyes then opened them again the only way to deal with this experience was to accept it at face value he was in a whale one that was somehow being used as a submarine by human and nonhuman sentient creatures everything he knew no longer applied but then again maybe it did what put him on the less loopy side of sanity was noticing the whaley boys thick necks theyre amphibious right quinn asked poynter their necks are thick to take the stress of swimming at high speeds quinn rose in his chair as far as the restraints would allow and saw that scooter did indeed have a blowhole just behind his melon he was a humanoid whale or a dolphin creature scooter was impossible all of this was impossible the details not the big picture quinn reminded himself in the big picture there be madness theyre like a whalehuman hybrid arent they which would be why we call them the whaley boys said poynter wait are you accusing us of something asked poe because these guys are not the love children of us and some whales we dont do that kind of thing well there was that one time said poynter okay yeah just that one time said poe but quinn was studying scooter and scooter was eyeing him right back although they appear to be able to turn their heads like beluga whales their neck vertebrae probably arent fused like most whales the scientist rising quinn was comfortable now his fear taken away by curiosity he was focused on finding out things which was his home turf even in this completely unreal situation if he focused on the details the big picture wouldnt throw him over the edge into drooling lunacy lets ask them said poe scooter are your vertebrae fused together or are you just a big nonecked gray thug scooter turned his head to poe and made a loud raspberry sound spraying whaley spit all down the front of poes khakis and increasing the odor of decaying fish in the cabin by a factor of ten we dont know what they are dr quinn said captain poynter they were here when we got here and we got here just like you did weve all been on this ride meep said skippy i taught him that said poe thats from a warner brothers cartoon quinn said road runner no that would be two meeps skippy only does one therefore its original isnt that right skippy meep for some reason the meep did it some minds particularly those with a scientific bent a love of truth and certainty have limits to how much absurdity they can handle and here quinn found himself well over the limit skippy and scooter and poynter and poe i cant handle it he screamed he felt as if his mind were a rubber band being stretched to breaking and the meep had tweaked it he screamed until he could feel veins pulsing in his forehead you let it out now said captain poynter just go with it then to poe you know i wouldnt have thought the alliteration would have done it you ever hear of that nope i had an uncle who used to get nauseated at readers digest article titles you know terrible truths of toxic toe jam but i thought it was more because he read them in the doctors office than the alliteration you sure it wasnt the meep that did it this cant be happening this cant be happening quinn chanted he was hyperventilating and his vision had gone to a blur his heart pounding like hed been running a sprint across an electrified floor anxiety attack said poynter he put his hand on quinns forehead and spoke softly okay doc heres the skinny you are in a living ship that resembles a whale but is not a whale there are two other guys aboard who have lived through this so you can live through this in addition there are two guys who are not strictly human but they wont hurt you you are going to live and deal with this this is real you are not insane now calm the fuck down and it was then that poynter stepped back and poe threw the bucket of cold seawater in quinns face hey quinn said he sputtered and blinked seawater out of his eyes i told you to go with the dead thing but you didnt listen poe said nothing had changed but things his heart slowed down and quinn looked around where did that bucket come from there was no bucket in here there was nothing but us and where did you get the water poe held the bucket at ready youre sure youre okay i dont want to freak you out again yeah im okay said quinn and actually he was hed decided to go with the idea that he was already dead and that seemed to make everything fall into perspective im dead thats the spirit said poe he held the bucket against a wall and a small portal opened and sucked the bucket in quinn would have sworn there hadnt been any seams in the wall to indicate thered been an opening there hey said poynter taking on the tone of the deeply offended now that youre dead ive got a bone to pick with you about not bringing me my sandwich quinn looked at the sharp features and narrowed eyes of the captain who now seemed genuinely angry and a shiver ran through his body that had nothing to do with the cold seawater running out of his hair sorry he said shrugging as much as he could in the restraints damn it how hard could that have been youve got a phd for christs sake you cant get a fucking pastrami on rye ive got a good mind to chuck you out the anus shhhhhhhh cap poe said that was gonna be a surprise meep said skippy chapter twenty missing biscuit flopping tuna bwana clay you seen the snowy biscuit clay and clair sat on the lanai of clays bungalow drinking maitais and watching smoke roll out the vents of a weber kettle barbecue kona had his long board tucked underneath his arm and was heading for his maui cruiser a lime krylonoverrust bmw with no windows and seats that were covered in ratty blankets clay was two maitais south of lucid but he could still talk she took nates truck into town this morning havent seen her since sistah wanted me to teach her some surfing got some easy sets rolling on west shore good for that sorry said clay were smoking a big hunk of ahi tuna if youd like to join us no said clair tanks but im going down to lahaina town and see if i can find that snowy biscuit we going to work tomorrow maybe said clay trying to think through a rum cloud theyd pulled the always confused up out of the bottom of the harbor and the boatyard had said it would be a week or so before it was ready to float again although even then it would need some major cleaning still they had nates boat he looked at clair youre not sitting home tomorrow whining to me about your hangover clair said you get out there on the water and be sick like a proper man shed revised her thoughts on clays staying off the water he was who he was yeah plan on going out if its not too windy clay said hey we supposed to have wind it occurred to clay that he hadnt checked the weather since nate had disappeared calm morning trades in the afternoon kona said we can work tell amy when you see her okay take my cell phone with you call me when you find her you sure you wont have dinner with us no said clair no said kona grinning at clair auntie you embarrassed that kona seen you naked you look fine yeah clair stood up you go ahead call me auntie again see if i dont snatch out the rest of those dreads and use them to make cat toys ease up im going to find the biscuit and he loped to the beemer slid the long board in through the back window hooked the skeg over the passenger seat to secure it and then drove off to lahaina to look for amy it was two in the morning when the phone in clays bungalow rang tell me youre not in jail clay said not in jail bwana clay but maybe you need to sit down im in bed sleeping kona what the truck bwana nates truck its here at the kayak rental in lahaina they say amy rent a kayak this morning about eleven theyre still there i waked the guy up they dont know where she went they let her go alone he didnt call us when it got dark she said she was just using it to tow behind the boat for research he know she a whale researcher so he didnt think nothing of it sometime they take kayaks two three days you checked shes not on the boat you mean the not sunk one yes that would be the one yeah i check the boat in the slip no kayak stay there ill be down in a few minutes i have to get dressed and call the coast guard this kayak guy says it not on him she signed a wafer that some kind of religious thing waiver kona she signed a waiver are you high yes of course sorry okay ill be right there nate was three days inside the whale before he asked your names arent really poynter and poe are they what said poynter youre eaten by a giant whale ship and youre worried that we might be traveling under assumed names go for it poe give us a flush boys poe said water came gushing down the floor of the whale from the front pantsless ensign poe took three steps and went into a slide toward the tail like he was sliding into third base on a wet rain tarp as he reached the end of the chamber he spread his arms out to his sides at right angles there was a sucking sound and he sank up to his armpits into an orifice that only a second ago had appeared as just an impression in solid skin wow thats cold said poe how deep are we scooter clicked and whistled a couple of times ninety feet said poynter cant be that bad feels colder i think my nads have crawled up inside my body nate simply stared gapejawed at the arms and head of the ensign just above floor level you see doc said poynter most of the time we call it the back orifice instead of the anus you know because otherwise with us moving in and out of it theres implications his lower body is in the sea right now at three atmospheres yet the back orifice is sealed around him and its not crushing his chest its not crushing your chest is it poe no sir its snug for sure but i can breathe how is that possible asked nate youre a diver youve been down what a hundred and twenty hundred and thirty feet a hundred and fifty by accident but what does that have to do with this you never had sphincter failure at that depth did you blow up like a puffer fish no well there you go nate this here is just advanced poopchute technology we dont even understand it ourselves but its the key to sanitation on these small ships and its how we get in and out normally the mouth on these humpback ships doesnt even open which gives us a lot more room but this one was made specially to retrieve dirts thats you people made by whom of course they were made nothing like this could have evolved later said poynter poe you done aye aye captain get back in here mighty cold out here sir im telling you my tackles going to look like im posing for a baby picture im sure the doc will take that into account poe nate could feel a slight change in pressure in his ears and poe oozed back into the whale the orifice sealed behind him leaving almost no water on the floor the ensign sidled crablike to the front of the ship shielding his privates with his hands he retrieved his pants from a storage nook that opened with a flap of skin like the blowhole on a killer whale the whales interior was lined with the storage nooks but you couldnt even see the seams by the dim bioluminescence when they were closed youre going to learn how to do that nate its just the civilized thing to do until we transfer you to the blue cant have you doing your business in the ship when hed had to go to the bathroom theyd sent nate to the back of the whale where hed gone on the floor seconds later the whaley boys had let a bit of water in through a crack in the mouth which washed across the floor and effectively flushed the mess out the back orifice the blue nate asked yeah we cant take you where they want you in this little thing well transfer you to a blue and send you on youll have to go through the poop chutes so theres a bluewhale ship as well ships poynter corrected yeah and other species too right whales are my favorites poe said slower than hell but really wide plenty of room youll see so they the whaley boys can regulate the pressure that precisely they can let in water expel it keep the pressure in here from giving us the bends allow us to transfer from one of these ships to another yep theyre tapped in to the whale directly theyre like his cerebral cortex i guess the whale ships have a brain but that only takes care of autonomic functions allows it to act like a whale for hours on end diving breathing stuff like that but without one of the whaley boys tapped in theyre just dumb machines limited function the pilots control higher functions navigation and such they really show off their stuff in these humpbacks the breaching the singing you know this thing sings nate couldnt help himself he wanted to hear a whale sing from the inside of course it sings you heard it sing since nate had been on the only sound the whale ship had made was the beating of its enormous flukes and the explosive blow every ten minutes or so i hate it when they sing said poe whats the purpose of the song nate asked he didnt care who these guys were or what they were doing he now had the opportunity to get the answer to a question hed pursued for most of his adult life why do they sing because we tell them to said poynter whyd you think no its not right nate buried his face in his hands kidnapped by morons scooter let loose with a series of frantic chirps the whaley boy was staring out the eye into the blue pacific school of tuna outside said poe go scooter said poynter go get some the restraints retracted from around scooters waist and the creature stood up for the first time since nate had come on board he was taller than nate maybe sixsix with lean gray legs that looked like those of a giant bullfrog crossbred with a fullback and terminated in long webbed feet that resembled the rear flippers of a walrus scooter took three quick steps and dove at the floor in the back of the whale there was a whooshing sound and he disappeared headfirst through the back orifice which sealed behind him with a distinct pop poe stepped into the seat that scooter had vacated and looked out through the eye nate check this out watch how these guys hunt nate looked out the whales eye and saw scooters lithe form swim by at incredible speed darting back and forth with astounding agility in pursuit of a twentypound tuna in the water the whaley boys eyes no longer bugged out as they did inside the whale like whales and dolphins nate realized whaley boys possessed muscles that could actually change the shape of the eye for focusing in either air or water scooter did a rapid turn and snatched the tuna in his jaws not ten feet from the eye of the whale nate could hear the snap and saw blood in the water around scooters mouth yes said poe its sashimi tonight nate had eaten nothing but raw fish since hed been on board the whale ship but this was the first time hed seen it caught still he couldnt quite share poes enthusiasm is this all you eat raw fish it beats the alternatives said poe the whale carries a nutrient paste thats like krill puree oh my god said nate poynter leaned in close to nate so he was only inches from the scientists ear thus the somewhat substantial demand for culinary variety as in oh i dont know a pastrami on rye i said i was sorry nate muttered yeah right drop me off anywhere ill go get you one we dont land these things on shore you dont except to paint bite me on the flukes said poe yeah except for that said poynter skippy meeped as scooter scooted in through the poop chute with tuna in hand upon seeing the pilots entrance nate started thinking for the first time since hed been eaten about how to escape this is just stupid amy thought shed been paddling like a madwoman for four hours and was still barely halfway to molokai shed been past the channel wind line for two of those four hours and so battled fourfoot swells and a crosswind that threatened to take her out to sea who gives gps coordinates for a meeting who does business like that shed been shouting into the wind on and off for an hour then checking the little liquidcrystal map on the display of the gps receiver the you are here dot never seemed to move well that wasnt true if she paused from paddling to take a drink of water or apply some sunscreen the dot seemed to jump off course a mile at a time are you guys on drugs she screamed into the wind her shoulders ached and shed drunk nearly all of the twoliter bottle of water shed brought with her she started to regret not having brought along some kind of snack an easy paddle just rent a kayak you wont need a power boat im adrift on a piece of tupperware you nitwits she leaned back on the kayak to catch her breath and watched the direction and speed indicators change on the gps she could rest maybe five minutes without drifting too far she closed her eyes and let the swells rock her into a light doze it was quiet just the white noise of wind and water not even a slap of waves on the kayak she was so light that it rode high in the water and over the tops of the waves without a sound she thought about nate about how frightened he must have been in those last moments about how much shed started to enjoy working with him action nerd she smiled to herself a melancholy smile as she dozed off but then the sound of a fusillade of bubbles breaking the surface near the kayak jolted her to alertness it was a huge expulsion of air as if someone had set off an explosion deep under the water she started paddling away from the eruptions of bubbles but even as she moved the sea began to darken around her the crystal blue turning to shadow in a huge pool under the kayak then something hit the little boat tossing amy into the air twenty feet before she hit the water and the darkness surrounded her chapter twentyone i lick the body electric the maui sunset had set the sky on fire and everything in the bungalow had taken on the glowing pink tone of paradise or hell depending on where you were standing clay dismembered the bird and put the severed pieces on a platter to transport them to the grill youll need something to bring those in on clair said her dress was a purple hibiscusflower print and the orchid she wore in her hair looked like lavender dragonflies humping she was dicing pickles into the macaroni salad whats wrong with this clay held up the plate with the raw chicken you cant use the same plate youll get salmonella fine fuck it clay said tossing the plate into the yard the chicken parts bounced nicely breading themselves with a light coating of sand ants and dried grass when did chicken become like plutonium anyway for christs sake you cant let it touch you or its certain fucking death and eggs and hamburgers kill you unless you cook them to the consistency of limestone and if you turn on your fucking cell phone the plane is going to plunge out of the sky in a ball of flames and kids cant take a dump anymore but they have to have a helmet and pads on make them look like the road warrior right right what the fuck happened to the world when did everything get so goddamn deadly huh ive been going to sea for thirty damned years and nothings killed me ive swum with everything that can bite sting or eat you and ive done every stupid thing at depth that any human can and im still alive fuck clair i was unconscious for an hour underwater less than a week ago and it didnt kill me now youre going to tell me that im going to get whacked by a fucking chicken leg well just fuck it then he didnt know where to go so he came back in and slammed the screen door behind him then opened it and slammed it again goddamn it and he stood there breathing hard not really looking at anything clair put down her knife and pickle then wiped her hands as she came toward clay she pulled a large bobby pin from the back of her hair and her long thick locks cascaded down her back she took clays right hand and kissed each of his fingertips licked his thumb then took his index finger in her mouth and made a show of removing it slowly and with maximum moisture clay looked at the floor shaking baby she said as she placed the bobby pin firmly between clays wet thumb and index finger i need you to go over to that wall and take this bobby pin and insert it ever so firmly into that electrical outlet over there clay looked up at her at last because she continued i know that you arent mad at me and that youre just grieving for your friends but i think you need to be reminded that you arent invulnerable and that you can hurt even more than you do now and i think it would be better if you did it yourself because otherwise ill have to brain you with your own iron skillet that would be wrong clay said it is a cruel world baby clay took her in his arms and buried his face in her hair and just stood there in the doorway for a long time amy had been missing for thirtytwo hours that morning a fisherman had found her kayak washing against some rocks on molokai and had called the rental company in maui a life jacket was still strapped on the front of the boat he said the coast guard had stopped looking already now let me go clair said i have to get that chicken out of the yard and rinse it off i dont think we should eat that please im going to cook it up for kona youre taking me out i am of course after i stick this in the outlet right you can grieve clay thats as it should be but you cant feel guilty for being alive so i dont have to stick this in the outlet you used foul language at me baby i dont see any way around it oh well thats true you go get konas chicken out of the yard ill do this on the second morning after amy was lost at sea clay walked to the seaside a rocky beach between some condos north of lahaina too short for morning runners too shallow for a bathing crowd he stood on an outcropping of rocks with the waves crashing around him and tried to let pure hatred run out of his heart clay demodocus was a guy who liked things and among the things he had liked the most was the sea but this morning he held nothing but disdain for his old friend the sapphire blue was indifferent the waves elitist shed kill you without even learning your name you bitch clay said loud enough for the sea to hear he spit into her face and walked back home that old trickster maui had been sitting on a rock nearby watching and he laughed at clays hubris maui admired a man with more balls than brains even a haole he cast a small blessing at the photographer just a trinket for the laugh a trifling little mango of magic and then he headed off to the great banyan tree to fog the film of japanese tourists back in what was now only his office clay dug amys resume out of his files and made the call he braced himself trying to figure out how exactly he was going to tell these strangers that their daughter was missing and assumed to have drowned he felt sad and alone and his elbow hurt from the jolt of electricity hed taken the night before he didnt want to do this he reached for the phone then stopped and closed his eyes as if he could make the whole thing go away but on the back of his eyelids he saw the face of his mother as he had last seen her looking up at him out of her barrel of brine make the call you pussy if anyone knows how not to get bad news its you part of loyalty is following up you sniveling coward dont be like your brothers ah sweet mama clay thought he dialed the phone a number with a area code tonawanda new york it rang three times and the recorded operator came on saying that the number hed reached was not in service at this time he checked it then dialed the next number down which also turned out not to be working he called tonawanda information for amys parents and the operator told him there was no such listing at a loss he called woods hole oceanographic center where amy had gotten her masters clay knew one of her advisers marcus loughten an irascible brit who had worked at woods hole for twenty years and was famous in the field for his work in underwater acoustics loughten answered on the third ring loughten loughten said marcus this is clay demodocus we worked together on yes clay i bloody know who you are calling from hawaii are you well yes i probably what seventyeight degrees with a breeze its seven below zero fahrenheit here im out installing bloody sound buoys in a monthlong blizzard to keep right whales from getting run over by supertankers right the sound buoys how are those working out theyre not no why not well right whales are stupid as shit arent they its not like a supertanker is quiet if sound was going to deter them then theyd be bloody well deterred by the engine noise wouldnt they they dont make the connection stupid shits oh sorry to hear that uh why keep doing it then we have funding right look marcus i need some information on one of your students who came out here to work with us amy earhart would have been with you guys until fall of last year no i dont know that name sure you do fivefive thin pale dark hair with kind of unnatural blue highlights smart as a whip sorry clay that doesnt fit any of my students clay took a deep breath and trudged on biologists were notorious for treating their grad students as subhuman but clay was surprised that loughten didnt remember amy she was cute and if clay could judge from a night of drinking hed done with loughten at a marine mammal conference in france the brit was more than a bit of a horndog great ass marcus youd remember im sure i would but i dont clay studied the resume what about peter would he no clay i know all of peters grad students as well did you call to confirm her references when you took her on well no good work then abscond with your nikons did she no shes missing at sea im trying to contact her family sorry wish i could be of help ill check the records just to be sure in case ive had a ministroke that killed the part of the brain that remembers fine bottoms thanks good luck clay my best to quinn clay cringed it turned out he really wasnt up for bearing bad news will do marcus goodbye clay hung up and resumed staring at the phone well he thought i knew absolutely nothing about this woman that i thought i knew libby quinn had already called sobbing to say that they should have some kind of joint service at the sanctuary for nate and amy and that clay should speak what was he going to say about amy dearly beloved i think we all knew amy as scientist a colleague a friend a woman who showed up out of nowhere with a completely manufactured history but i think because she saved my life that i came to know her better than anyone here and i can tell you unequivocally she was a smart aleck with a cute butt yeah hed need to work on that damn it he missed them both clay decided to kill the day by editing video timeeating busywork that supplied at least an imaginary escape from the real world the afternoon found him going through the rebreather footage hed taken on the day the whale had conked him for the first time going past the point where he was unconscious just to see if the camera picked up anything usable clay let the video run minutes of blue water the camera tossing around at the end of the wrist lanyard then amys leg as she comes down to stop his descent he cranked the audio hiss of ambient noise then the bubbles from amys regulator the slow hiss of his own breathing through the rebreather as amy starts to swim to the surface the camera catches his fins hanging limply against a field of blue then amys fins kicking in and out of the frame both their breathing is steady on the audio track clay looked at the time signature of the video fifteen minutes when the motion stops amy making her first decompression stop on the audio he hears the chorus of distant singing humpbacks a boat motor not too far off and amys steady bubbles then the bubbles stop the camera settles against his thigh and drifts the lens up catches light from the surface then amys hand holding on to his buoyancy vest reading the data off his dive computer her regulator is out of her mouth on the audio theres only his breathing the camera swings away ten minutes more pass clay listens for amys breathing to resume the motion from her hooking into the rescue tank on the rebreather should move the camera but theres just the same gentle drift they move up clay guesses maybe to seventyfive feet amy is doing another decompression stop doing it by the book despite the emergency except he still can hear only one person breathing she pulls him to more shallow depth the frame lightens up and the camera swings around the wide angle showing clays unconscious form and amy kicking the regulator out of her mouth looking at the surface she hasnt used the bailout tank on clays rebreather and she hasnt taken a breath for as far as clay can tell forty minutes this cant be right he listens watching until the time signature shows sixty and the tape ends the entire thing having been dubbed to the hard drive he rewinds it onscreen slowing down when the camera shows anything but blue listening again no fucking way clay backed away from the monitor watching as the video ran out again and froze on the image of amy holding him steady at twenty or so feet down no regulator in her mouth he ran out the door calling kona kona the surfer came shuffling out of his bungalow in a cloud of smoke just tracking down navy spies boss where did you guys put the rebreather the day they took me to the hospital shes in the storage shed clay made a beeline for the bungalow they used to store dive and boat equipment he waved kona after him come what did you guys refill the oxygen or the bailout tanks we just rinsed it and put it in the case clay pulled the big pelican case off a stack of scuba tanks and popped the latches the rebreather was snug in the foam padding clay wrenched it out onto the wooden floor and turned on the computer that was an integral part of it he hit buttons on the display console and watched the gray liquidcrystal display cycle through the numbers the last dive downtime had been seventyfive minutes fortythree seconds the oxygen cylinder was nearly full the bailout air supply was full full it hadnt been touched somehow amy had stayed underwater for an hour without an air supply clay turned to the surfer do you remember anything that nate showed you about what he was working on i need details i know in general clay wasnt sure what he was looking for but this had to mean something and all he had to fall back on was nates research the surfer scratched the dreadless side of his head something about the whales singing binary come show me clay stormed through the door and back to the office what you looking for i dont know clues mysteries meaning you gone lolo you know chapter twentytwo deep below bernard stirs about the time that nathan quinn had started to master his nausea in the whale ships constant motion four days on board another force started working on his body he felt an uneasiness come over him in waves and for twenty or so seconds he would feel as if he needed to crawl out of his skin then it would pass and leave him feeling a little numb for a few seconds only to start up again poynter and poe were moving around the small cabin looking at different gobs and bumps of bioluminescence as if they were gleaning some meaning from them but try as he might nate couldnt figure out what they were monitoring it would have helped to be able to get out of the seat and take a closer look but poynter had ordered him strapped in after he made his first break for the back orifice hed nearly made it too had dived at it just like hed seen the whaley boys do except that only one arm had gone through and he ended up stuck to the floor of the whale his face against the rubbery skin his hand trailing out in the cold ocean well that was phenomenally stupid said poynter i think ive dislocated my shoulder nate said i should leave you there maybe a remora or two will latch on to your hand and teach you a lesson or a cookiecutter shark said poe nasty bastards the whaley boys turned in their seats and snickered bobbing their heads and blowing the occasional raspberry which could inflict considerable moisture off a fourinchwide tongue evidently quinn was a cetacean laugh riot hed always suspected that actually poynter got down on his hands and knees and looked nate in the eye while youre down there id like you to think on what might have happened if youd been successful at launching yourself through that orifice first were at skippy whats the depth skippy chirped and clicked a number of times a hundred and fifty feet beyond the fact that youd probably have blown out your eardrums almost immediately you might think on how you were going to get to the surface on one breath of air and should you have gotten to the surface what were you going to do then were five hundred miles from the nearest land i hadnt worked out the whole plan nate said so actually i might be looking at success right you just wanted to test the outside water temperature sure said nate thinking it might be best to stay agreeable can you feel your hand its a little chilly but yes oh good and so theyd left him there a couple of hours his hand and about six inches of his arm hanging out in the open sea as the whale ship swam along and when they finally pulled him up they put him in his seat and kept him restrained except to eat and go to the bathroom hed tried to relax and observe learn what he could but then a few minutes ago these waves of uneasiness had started hitting him hes got the sonic willies said poe poynter looked away from skippys console its the subsonics doc youre feeling the sound waves even though you cant hear them weve been communicating with the blue for about ten minutes now you might have said something i just did couple of hours youll be in the blue doc you can stand up again walk around a little have some privacy so youre communicating with it in lowfrequency sound yep just like you thought doc there was meaning in the call yeah but i didnt think this that there were guys and guylike things riding about inside whales how in the hell can this be happening how can i not know about this so youre giving up on the beingdead strategy asked poe what is it space aliens poynter unbuttoned his shirt and showed some chest hair do i look like a space alien well no but them nate nodded toward the whaley boys they looked at each other and snickered a sort of wheezing laughter coming from their blowholes paused looked back at nate then snickered some more maybe on their planet sentient life evolved from whales rather than apes quinn continued i can see how they might have landed here deployed these whale ships and kept under the radar of human detection while they looked around i mean man obviously isnt the most peaceful of creatures that work for you doc asked poynter on their planet they developed an organically based technology rather than one based on combustion and manipulation of minerals like ours oh that is good said poe hes on a roll said poynter unraveling the mystery he is skippy and scooter nodded to each other and grinned so thats it this ship is extraterrestrial quinn felt the small victory rush that one gets from proving a hypothesis even one as bizarre as space aliens riding in whale ships sure said poe that works for me you cap yeah moon men thats what you guys are poynter said to the whaley boys meep said scooter and in a high squeaky littlegirl voice skippy croaked phone home the whaley boys gave each other a high four and collapsed into fits of hysterical wheezing what did he say nate nearly snapped his neck trying to turn around against the restraints they can talk well i guess if you call that talking poe said he exchanged high fives with poynter at the expense of the whaley boys who paused in their own laughter to roll the whale ship in three quick spirals which tossed the unsecured poe and poynter around the soft cabin like a couple of rag dolls poynter came up with a bloody lip from connecting with his own knee poe had barked his shin on one of the whaley boys heads as he went over strapped in nate concentrated on not watching a rerun of his lunch of raw tuna and water bastards said poe that what you expected in your race of superintelligent spacefaring extraterrestrials nate poynter wiped blood from his lower lip and flung it at scooter carl linnaeus an eighteenthcentury swedish doctor who specialized in the treatment of syphilis is credited with inventing the modern system that is used for classifying plants and animals linnaeus is responsible for naming the humpback whale megaptera novaeangliae or big wings of new england and later naming the blue whale balaenoptera musculus or little mouse at feet long over a hundred tons an animal whose tongue alone is larger than a fullgrown african elephant the largest animal to ever live on the planet little mouse some speculated that this ironic misnomer was perpetrated entirely to confuse linnaeuss lab assistants as in run out and bring me back a little mouse sven others think that the pox had gone to carls head quinn was crouched over the back orifice skippy and scooter holding him by either arm poynter and poe crouched before him saluting he could feel the texture of the opening under his bare feet like wet tire tread its been a pleasure doc poynter said have a great trip well see you back at base said poe now just relax youre barely going to contact water hold your nose and blow quinn did poynter counted one two meep nate was sucked out the orifice felt a brief chill and some pressure pushing back against his ears and found himself in a chamber only a little taller than that in the humpback with a fairly amused woman you can stop blowing now she said yet another phrase i didnt think id be hearing in this lifetime nate said he let go of his nostrils and took a deep breath the air seemed fresher than in the humpback welcome to my blue dr quinn im cielle nuñez how do you feel pooped quinn grinned she was about his age hispanic with short dark hair peppered gray and wide brown eyes that caught the bioluminescence off the walls and reflected what looked like laughter she was barefoot and wearing generic khakis like poynter and poe he shook her hand cute she said come forward with me doctor im sure its been a while since you were able to stand up straight she led him down the corridor which reminded nate of when as kids he and his buddies had explored storm drains in vancouver it was tall enough to walk in but not tall enough to stand in comfortably actually cielle im not a doctor i have a phd but the doctor thing i understand im captain of this rig but if you call me captain ill ignore you i wanted to hear the humpback sing before i left you know from the inside you will therell be time the corridor started to widen as they moved forward and nate was actually able to walk normally or as normally as one can walk when barefoot on whaleskin this skin had a mottled appearance whereas on the humpback it had been nearly solid gray he noticed that on this ship there were wide veins of bioluminescence on the floor casting a yellow light up upward that gave everything a sinister green glow nuñez paused by what appeared to be portals on either side of them this is as good a place as any she said now turn sideways and take my hand quinn did as he was asked her hand felt warm but dry she was a small woman but powerfully built he could feel the strength in her grip now were just going to walk as the ship moves dont stop until i say or youll fall on your ass what okay scooter roll it scooter all pilots are called scooter or skippy they didnt tell you they werent very forthcoming with information humpback crews are a bunch of yahoos nuñez smiled you know the type like navy fighter pilots topside all ego and testosterone i got more cretin than yahoo nate said well with that particular bunch yes the whole corridor started to move here we go step step step thats good they were walking across the walls as the ship rolled when they were standing on the ceiling the roll stopped nice scooter nuñez said obviously communicating through some sort of hidden intercom then to nate hes so good we were upside down to make the transfer exactly youre a smart guy look these are cabins she touched a lighted node on the wall and a skin portal folded back on itself again nate was put in mind of the blowhole of a toothed whale but it was so big nearly four feet across it was just unnatural lines of light pumped to life past the portal to reveal a small cabin a bed apparently made of the same skin as the rest of the interior but also a table and a chair nate couldnt make out what material they might be made of but it looked like plastic bone nuñez said noticing him noticing theyre as much a part of the ship as the walls all living tissue there are shelves and cubbyholes for your stuff in the bulkheads closed now obviously everything has to be stowed for little maneuvers like the one we just performed the motion isnt as bad as on the humpbacks youll find youll get used to it and then you can move about just as if you were on land youre right i didnt even notice we were moving that would be because were not said nuñez the sound of whaleyboy snickering wheezed down the corridor toward them you guys are supposed to be working nuñez said to the air prepare to get under way she turned to quinn can i buy you a cup of joe maybe answer some of your questions youre offering quinn felt his heart jump with excitement information without poynter and poes goofing obfuscation he was thrilled that would be fantastic dont pee all over yourself quinn its just coffee the corridor opened up into a large bridge the head of the blue was huge compared to the humpbacks on either side of the entry a whaley boy stood grinning at them as they passed they were both taller than quinn and unlike the scooter and skippy of the humpback their skin was mottled and lighter in color nate paused and grinned back at them let me guess skippy and scooter actually bernard and emily said nuñez you said they all were i said all pilots were named skippy and scooter she gestured to the front of the bridge where two whaley boys sitting at control consoles were turning in their seats and grinning maybe thought nate they always appeared to be grinning much like dolphins hed made an amateur mistake assuming that their facial expressions were the analog of human expressions people often did that with dolphins even though the animals had no facial muscles to facilitate expression even sad dolphins appeared to be smiling what are you two grinning at asked nuñez lets get on the way the pilots frowned and turned back to their consoles well crap nate said what nothing just another theory shot in the ass yeah this operation does that doesnt it nate felt something stirring in his back pocket and spun around to see a thin fourteeninchlong pink penis that was protruding from bernards genital slit it waved at him holy moly bernard nuñez snapped put that away that is not procedure bernards unit drooped noticeably from the scolding he looked at it and chirped contritely away nuñez barked bernards willy snapped back up into his genital slit sorry about that nuñez said to nate ive never gotten used to that its really disconcerting when youre working with one of them and you ask them to hand you a screwdriver or something and his hands are already full coffee she led him to a small white table around which four bone chairs protruded from the floor they looked like oldstyle greek saddle chairs no backs organic curves and the high gloss of living bone but more gaudi than flintstone quinn sat while nuñez touched a node on the wall that opened a meterwide portal that had concealed a sink several canisters and what looked like a percolator nate wondered about the electricity but forced himself to wait before asking while nuñez prepared the coffee quinn looked around the bridge was easily four times the size of the entire cabin in the humpback instead of riding in a minivan it was like being in a goodsize motor home a very curvy dimly lit motor home but about that size blue light filtered in through the eyes illuminating the pilots faces which shone like patent leather nate was starting to realize that even though everything was organic living the whale ship had the same sort of efficiency found on any nautical vessel every spaced used everything stowed against movement everything functional if you need to use the head its back down the corridor fourth hatch on the right emily clicked and squealed and nuñez laughed she had a warm laugh not forced it just rolled out of her smooth and easy emily says it seems as if it would be more logical for the head to be in the head but there goes logic i gave up logic a few days ago you dont have to give it up just adjust anyway facilities in the head are like everything on the ship living but i think youll figure out the analogs pretty quickly its less complicated than an airliner bathroom scooter chirped and the great ship started to move first in a fairly radical wave of motion then smoothing out to a gentle roll it was like being on a large sailing ship in medium seas hey a little more warning scooter huh said nuñez i nearly dumped nathans coffee okay if i call you nathan nates good moving with the roll of the ship she made it back to the table and put down the two steaming mugs of coffee then went back for a sugar bowl spoons and a can of condensed milk nate picked up the can and studied it this is the first thing from the outside that ive seen yeah well thats special request you dont want to try whale milk in your coffee its like krillflavored spray cheese yuck thats what im saying cielle if you dont mind my saying you dont seem very military me no i wasnt my husband and i had a sixtyfoot sailboat we got caught in a hurricane off of costa rica and sank thats when they took me my husband didnt make it im sorry its okay it was a long time ago but no ive never been in the military but the way you order the whaley boys around first we need to clear up a misconception that you are obviously forming nate i we the human beings on these ships are not in charge were just i dont know like ambassadors or something we sound like commanders because these guys would just goof off all day without someone telling them what to do but we have no real authority the colonel gives the orders and the whaley boys run the show scooter and skippy snickered like their counterparts on the humpback ship bernard and emily joined them bernard extending his prehensile willy like a party horn and whaley girls nate nodded toward emily who grinned it was a very big very toothy grin but a little coquettish in the way one might expect from say an ingenue with a bite that could sever an arm just whaley boys its like the term mankind you know alienate the female part of the race at all costs its the same here oldtimers gave them the name whos the colonel hes in charge we dont see him human though im told you said youd been here a long time how long let me get you another cup and ill tell you what i can she turned bernard get that thing out of the coffeepot chapter twentythree clair stirs a brainstorm for all his admiration for the field biologists hed worked with over the years secretly clay harbored one tiny bit of egopreserving superiority over them at the end of the day they were going to have only nicked the surface of the knowledge they were trying to attain but if clay got the pictures he went home a satisfied man even around nathan quinn hed exercised an attitude of rascally smugness teasing about his friends ongoing frustration for clay it was get the pictures and whats for dinner until now now he had his own mysteries to contend with and he couldnt help but think that the powers of irony were flexing their muscles to get back at him for his having lived carefree for so long kona on the other hand had long paid homage to his fear of irony by like many surfers never eating shark meat i dont eat them they dont eat me thats just how it work but now he too was feeling the sawtoothed edge of ironys bite for having spent most of his time from the age of thirteen knocking the edge off his mental acuity by the concerted application of the most epic smokage that jah could provide thanks be unto him he was now being called upon to think and remember with a sharpness that was clearly painful think said clair rapping the surfer in the forehead with the spoon she had only seconds earlier used to stir honey into a cup of calming herbal tea ouch said kona hey thats uncalled for said clay coming to konas aid loyalty being important to him shut up youre next okay they were gathered around clays giant monitor which for all the good it was doing them could have been a giant monitor lizard a spectrogram of whale song from quinns computer was splashed across the screen and for the information they were getting from it it might have been the aftermath of a paintball war which is what it looked like what were they doing kona clair asked spoon steaming with herbal calmness poised to strike as a teacher of fourthgraders in a public school where corporal punishment was not allowed she had years of violence stored up and was truth be told sort of enjoying letting it out on kona who she felt could have been the poster child for the failure of public education nate and amy both went through this with you now you have to remember what they said its not these things its the oscilloscope kona said nate pulled out just the submarine stuff and put it on the spectrum its all submarine clay said you mean subsonic yeah he said there was something in there i said like computer language ones and ohs that doesnt help he was marking them out by hand kona said by freezing the green line then measuring the peaks and troughs he said that the signal could carry a lot more information that way but the whales would have to have oscilloscopes and computers to do it clay and clair both turned to the surfer in amazement and they dont kona said duh it was as if a storm of coherence had come over him they just stared kona shrugged just dont hit me with the spoon again clay pushed his chair back to let the surfer at the keyboard show me late into the night the three of them worked making little marks on printouts of the oscilloscope and recording them on yellow legal pads ones and ohs clair went to bed at am at am they had fifty handwritten legalpad pages of ones and ohs in another time this might have felt to clay like a job well done hed helped analyze data on shipboard before it killed some time and ingratiated him to whatever scientist was leading the project he was there to photograph but hed always been able to hand off the work for someone else to finish it was slowly dawning on him being a scientist sucked this sucks said kona no it doesnt look at all we have said clay gesturing to all they had what is it its a lot thats what it is look at all of it whats it mean no idea what does this have to do with nate and the snowy biscuit just look at all of this said clay looking at all of it kona got up from his chair and rolled his shoulders mon bwana clay jah has given you a big heart im goin to bed what are you saying clay said we got all the heart we need brah we need head scuse me and so in the morning with the promise of a colossal piece of information for barter the torpedo range but without a true indication of what he really needed to know in return everything else clay talked libby quinn into coming to papa lani so let me get this straight said libby quinn as she paced from clays computer to the kitchen and back kona and clay were standing to the side following her movement like dogs watching meatball tennis youve got an old woman who claims that a whale called her and instructed her to have nate take him a pastrami sandwich on rye with swiss and hot mustard kona added not wanting her to miss any pertinent scientific details and you have a recording of voices underwater presumably military asking if someone brought them a sandwich correct said kona no bread or meat or cheese specified libby glared at him and you have the navy setting off simulated explosions in preparation to put a torpedo range in the middle of the humpback whale sanctuary she paused meaningfully and pivoted thoughtfully like hercule poirot in flipflops you have a tape of amy doing a breathhold dive for what appears to be an hour with no ill effects topless kona added science you have amy claiming that nate was eaten by a whale which we all know is simply not possible given the diameter of the humpbacks throat even if one were inclined to bite him which we know they wouldnt she was just a deerstalker a calabash and a cocaine habit short of being sherlock holmes here then you have amy taking a kayak out for no apparent reason and disappearing presumed drowned and you say that nate was working on finding binary in the lower registers of the whale song and you think that means something have i got that right yeah said clay but you have the breakin to our offices to get the sound tapes and you have my boat being sunk too okay it sounded more connected when we were talking about it last night libby quinn stopped pacing and turned to look at both of them she wore cargo shorts tech sandals and a running bra and appeared ready at any moment to just take off and do something outdoorsy and strenuous they both looked down subdued as if they were still under the threat of clairs deadly spoon of calm clay had always had a secret attraction to libby even while shed been married to quinn and it was only within the last year or so hed been able to make eye contact with her at all kona on the other hand had studied dozens of videotapes on the lesbian lifestyle especially as it pertained to having a third party show up in the middle of an intimate moment usually with a pizza so he had long ago assigned a hot rating to libby despite the fact that she was twice his age help us kona said trying to sound pathetic staring at the floor this is what you guys have and you think because i know a little biology i can make something of all this and that said clay pointing at the now arranged and collated pages of ones and ohs on his desk libby walked over and flipped through the pages clay this is nothing i cant do anything with this even if nate was on to something what do you think that even if we recognize a pattern its going to mean something to us look clay i loved nate too you know i did but just tell us where to start kona said and tell me if you see anything in this clay went to his computer and hit a key a still of the edge view of the whale tail from his rebreather dive was on the screen nate said that he had seen some markings on a whale tail libby some writing well i thought there was something on this whale too before it knocked me out but this is the best shot of the tail we have it could mean something like what her voice was kind i dont know what libby if i knew what i wouldnt have called you but theres too much weird stuff going on that almost fits together and we dont know what to do libby studied the tail still there is something there you dont have a better shot no this is something i do know about this is the best i have you know margaret and i were helping a guy from texas am who was designing a software program that would shift perspective of tail shots so edge and badangle views could be shifted and extrapolated into usable id photos you know how many get tossed because of bad angles you have this program yes its still in beta tests but it works i think we can shift this shot and if theres something meaningful there well see it cool runnings kona said as far as this binary thing i think its a shot in the dark but if its going to mean anything youre going to have to get your ones and ohs in the computer kona can you type well on ones and ohs i shred most masterful mon right ill set you up with a simple text file just ones and ohs and well figure out if we can do anything with it later no mistakes okay kona nodded clay finally looked up and smiled thanks libby im not saying its anything clay but i wasnt exactly fair to nate when he was around maybe i owe him one now that hes gone besides its windy fieldwork would have sucked today im going to call margaret have her bring the program over ill help you if you promise that youll put all your weight into stopping this torpedo range and youll sign maui whale on to the petition against lowfrequency active sonar you guys have a problem with that she was giving them the spoon of death look and it occurred to both of them that this might be something that was innate to all women not just clair and that they should be very very afraid nope said kona sounds good to me ill put on a pot of coffee said clay margaret is absolutely going to shit when she hears about the torpedo range said libby quinn as she reached for clays phone chapter twentyfour orientation to the blues a small explosion went off over his head and nate dove under the table when he looked up emily was bent over staring at him with her watery whale eyes and a mild expression of distress and nuñez was crouched at the other end of the table smiling that was the blow nate nuñez said a little more intense than the humpbacks huh these ships act like real whales remember the blowhole is right above our heads vented to the rest of the ship but you know every twenty minutes or so its going to go you get used to it sure i knew that said nate crawling out from under the table hed been out off of santa cruz searching for the blues you usually found them by the sound of their blows which you could hear up to a mile and a half away he looked up expecting to see sky through the blowhole but instead he saw just more smooth whaleskin they behave like whales but the physiology is completely different to allow for the living quarters i dont really understand it but for instance the blowhole is vented down the sides somewhere to some axillary lungs that do the oxygen exchange with the blood i dont know how they got us electricity at all i mean i said i wanted a coffeepot and they put in an outlet there are circuits all over the bridge for our machinery the other bodily functions seem to be handled by smaller versions of liver kidneys and so forth around the outside of the cabins the main spine runs over the top of the ship theres no digestive system the ships digestive system is at the base it hooks up and pumps nutrientrich blood into the ship which stores enough energy in blubber to run it for six months at sea or around the world at least once we can cruise at twenty knots as long as no one is watching what do you mean no one is watching i mean you guys biologists if one of you guys is watching us we have to slow it down after a couple of hours especially if were tagged this ship has been satellitetagged what do you do we go to silent running for a while then we dive and one of the whaley boys goes outside and pulls the tag off weve been tagged twice by that bruce mate guy from oregon state that guys a menace probably has a satellite tag on his wife to track her trips to the can if theyd asked me hed be the one riding with us now you know who he is nate was aghast as a scientist you were always fighting being overwhelmed by what you dont know but the magnitude of this whole operation it was too much of course since commercial whaling backed off cetacean biologists have been the main focus of our intelligence program why do you think youre here okay why am i here i dont know the whole story but its something to do with the song evidently you were a little too close to finding our signal in the song so they yanked you the aliens were that interested in what i was doing what aliens these aliens nate said nodding toward the pilots and bernard and emily who had moved to another table on the other side of the corridor the whaley boys arent aliens who told you that well poynter and poe implied that they were those jerks no theyre not aliens theyre a little weird but not fromanotherplanet weird bernard looked up from what appeared to be a chart of some sort and gave a halfassed signature raspberry they do that a lot nate said if you had a tongue four inches wide youd do that a lot too its sort of a display move with them like the penis waving that bernard was doing like male killer whales do bingo see a guy with your background this is easy to explain i didnt understand squat at first im sorry but i cant believe that this ship the whaley boys the whole perfection of the way they work could possibly be products of natural selection there had to be a design someone made all this cielle nodded smiling ive known a number of scientists in my lifetime nate but im sure this is the first time ive heard one arguing in favor of a grand designer whats that called the watchmaker argument she was right of course it was an accepted premise that intelligent design in nature was not necessarily a product of intelligence but merely the mechanism of natural selection of traits for survival and really really long periods of time for the selections to assert themselves nates lifes work had been built on that assumption but now he was giving darwin the old heaveho simply because his nates mind was too small to adapt to the idea of this craft well yes damn it screw darwin this was too strange im sorry im just having a little trouble getting my head around this i dont know how you take to being a prisoner but i dont care for it on top of that i could barely sleep on the humpback with the blow going off every few minutes and i havent eaten anything but raw fish and water for about five days id be addled even if this didnt seem impossible bernard made a whimpering noise and skippy and scooter followed along in a moment until they sounded like a basketful of hungry puppies and then they all broke out into wheezing snickers emily frowned at them of course i understand nate nuñez said maybe you should finish up your coffee and go to your quarters i have a few sports shakes in my cabin that will get some carbohydrates to your brain and i can get you something to help you sleep the ships doctor has a full stock of pharmaceuticals she patted his hand maternally nate felt a little ashamed for having complained youre not the only human on this ship then no there are four humans and six whaley boys on board the others are in their quarters but theyre all excited to meet you everyones been talking about it for weeks youve known for weeks you were going to take me well sort of we were on standby we just got the goahead the day before we took you and you and the rest of the crew youre prisoners too nate every person on this ship on any whale ship has been pulled out of a sinking or sunken ship a plane crash at sea or some other disaster that would have killed them this is a gift of time and frankly once you accept where you are and what youre doing im going to ask you where youd rather be okay nate searched her face for any sign of sarcasm or malice all he found was a gentle smile okay you go to your quarters now ill send around your supplies in a bit bernard would you show dr quinn to his quarters im not really a doctor nate whispered take whatever respect you can get from them nate bernard waited at the entry to the corridor rubbing his shinysmooth stomach and grinning a white coffee mug stood out in contrast against bernards abdomen suspended as it was in the grasp of his penis ive always wanted to do that said nate deciding that he wasnt going to let the whaley boy get the satisfaction of intimidating him would be really handy for driving nate bowed toward the corridor lead on bernard bernard skulked down the hall in what would have been a full pout posture had he any lips to do the actual pouting he spilled a trail of coffee along the way chapter twentyfive the inner secrets of cetacean sluts nate was just settling into the idea of the organic bunk he was going to be sleeping on before actually settling into the bed he was not a god kind of guy but he found himself thanking one nonetheless for the crisp cotton sheets and pillowcase on a feather pillow he didnt think he really wanted to sleep with his face against whaleskin there was a soft whistle outside the portal and the great flap of skin retracted to open to the corridor emily stood there with a tray that held two cans of protein shake a glass of water and a single small pill she grinned but did not try to step into the cabin the small portal required a bit of a crouching and climbing action for nate to enter so he guessed shed dump the tray trying to get through then again she might just be trying to be polite she waited while nate took the cans from the tray and set them on the low table then swung around to take the pill and water from her emily whistled and gave him a sidelong glance causing her right eye to bulge out at him as hed actually seen humpbacks do when checking out a boat at the surface she gestured for him to take the pill youre not leaving until you see me take my medicine emily nodded well i guess if you guys wanted to get rid of me it would have been a lot easier to kill me without bringing me all the way out here to poison me nate took the pill downed the water and opened his mouth to show that the pill was gone that okay nurse emily whistled and nodded then gently took the empty glass from nates hand she reached up to hit the node and the portal closed between them nate heard her whistle the first few bars of a lullaby shes sweet nate thought in a tall malevolent rubberpuppet sort of way for almost a week the only sleep nate had been able to get was while he was restrained in the chair in the humpback and even then it was restless with the ship blowing every few minutes and the whaley boys whistling communications so despite the blow of the bluewhale ship he fell into a deep sleep filled with vivid dreams he dreamed of himself and amy their naked bodies entwined slick with sweat under soft candlelight strangely even as he dreamed he had the semilucid thought that before whenever hed taken a sleeping pill he didnt remember ever dreaming but that thought was pushed away by the feel of amys smooth skin his fingers softly caressing her muscular legs her four long webbed fingers wrapped lovingly around his hey nate opened his eyes a softly lit fence of spiky teeth smiled over at him steamy fish breath washed over his face uhoh said emily her voice high and rasping verging on duckspeak nate leaped out of bed and bounced off the wall on the other side of the cabin emily pulled the sheet up over her head and burrowed against the wall digging her melon under the pillow then she lay still nate stood trying to catch his breath as soon as hed hit the floor the biolighting had come up to high he pushed back against the flexible wall then suddenly became selfconscious and pulled his tshirt off the back of the chair to cover his erection which was rapidly losing its will to live she was just lying there hello i can see you curled up not moving there under the sheets all whaley you arent fooling anyone youre bigger than i am youre not hidden just the soft sound of her blowhole opening and closing nate realized that it might be easier to hide under the covers if one had a blowhole as one could cover ones mouth and face and still breathe addled by sleep deprivation residual sleep medication two cups of coffee and now a few endorphins he started to speculate on how a creature might adapt for hiding under the covers then shook off the biologist rising up in him come on were different species and stuff thats creepy now a bit of a squeak more like a whimper followed by a tiny uhoh like a small elf had been mashed under the covers with a heavy book and had uhohed its last pathetic gasp well you cant stay here he remembered how hed felt when libby had left him and by way of explanation shed said nate i dont know i dont even feel like were the same species at the time hed felt as if his stomach were being turned inside out it had ruined him socially for more than a year longer than that if he counted the fiasco attraction to amy he stepped over to the bunk emily scrunched into the corner between the wall and the bed nate worked the edge of the sheet loose and cautiously slid one leg under the covers the lump that was emily s head moved as if she was listening you have to stay on your side okay okay wheezed emily in the mashedelf voice nate awoke to the exhultations of killer whales highpitched hunting calls the pod seemed to be gleefully celebrating a hunt or at least calling another pod to come along and help it occurred to him that he was actually riding in a craft that qualified as food for the orcas and the ship might be in danger of attack hed have to ask nuñez about that he swung his feet off the bunk and the lights came up he realized that he was alone and sighed with relief there was a fresh set of khakis hung over the chair and a bottle of water on the table there was a small basin on the wall opposite the bunk no bigger than a cereal bowl and made out of the same skin as the rest of the ship he hadnt even noticed it the night before there were three lit nodules above the basin like those used to activate the portals but nate could see nowhere for the water to come out he pushed one of the nodules and the basin started filling from a sphincter in the bottom he pushed another and the water was sucked out the same orifice he tried to foster scientific detachment toward the whole thing but failed miserably he was creeped out nate desperately needed a shave and a shower but he didnt want to try to wash his whole sixfoottwoinch body in an eightinch bowl with a well a butt hole at the bottom hed had just about enough of advanced poopchute technology thank you he splashed some water on his face and dressed in the khakis wondering as he did if the whale ship could actually grow a mirror for him to shave in if he needed it the whole crew appeared to be up and milling about the bridge when nate came in there were four whaley boys at the table with the charts to the right of the hatch the two pilots at their consoles nuñez stood by the table to the left of the hatch where there were seated a blond woman in her thirties and two men one dark perhaps in his early twenties and one bald and graybearded a healthy fifty maybe not a very militarylooking bunch everyone turned when nate came in all conversations words or whistles stopped abruptly the echo of killerwhale calls bounced around the bridge emily turned away from nates gaze nuñez was leaning against the wall near the nook that housed the coffeepot actively trying not to look at him hi nate said catching eye contact with the bald guy who smiled have a seat said the bald guy gesturing toward the empty seat at the table well get you something to eat im cal burdick he shook nates hand this is jane palovsky and tim milam jane tim nate said shaking hands nuñez smiled at him then looked away quickly as if the coffeepot needed some immediate attention or she was going to crack up or both everyone at the table nodded sort of staring at the spot in front of them like so here we are on a giant bluewhale ship hundreds of feet below the surface of the ocean with killer whales calling about us and nate fucked an alien so nothing happened nate said to the whole bridge what said jane your quarters satisfactory then asked tim an eyebrow raised nothing happened nate repeated and even though nothing had happened from the tone of his voice he wouldnt have believed it either really of course said tim all of the whaley boys except emily were snickering when he looked around all the males were waving their willies back and forth in time in the air as if swaying to a pornographic christmas carol emily put her big whaley head down on the table and covered it with her arms nothing happened nate shouted at them silence again on the bridge just the echo of killerwhale calls are we in danger nate asked nuñez trying desperately to change the subject are they going to attack the ship those are feeding calls right often when killer whales found a whale that was too big to be taken by their family pod or when they happened on to an especially rich school of fish they would call to other pods for help nate recognized the calls from some work hed done with a biologist friend in vancouver no these are residents nuñez said theyre just excited about a bait ball theyve found probably sardines resident killer whales ate only fish transients ate mammals whales and seals over the last few years scientists tended to refer to them as completely different species even though they appeared the same to the layman you know what they are by their call more than that cal said we know what theyre saying the whaley boys can translate all killer whales are named kevin you knew that right said jane she had a slight eastern european accent russian maybe she looked a little amused her blue eyes dark under the yellow cast of the bioluminescence but she didnt appear to be joking she patted the seat next to her indicating that nate should sit down like all the pilots are named scooter and skippy nate said actually they have numbers like emily their choice by the way but since there are never more than one pair of them on a ship we dont bother with the numbers nate suddenly realize that in all his time on both of the whale ships except when one of the pilots had gone outside to catch fish the pilots always seemed to be at the controls dont they ever sleep sure said jane were pretty sure they sleep with half their brain at a time like whales so between two of them the ship always has a full pilot without one of them at the controls its basically a big lump of meat you said that youre pretty sure you dont know well they dont know for sure said jane and theyre not very excited about our doing experiments on them now that youve joined us though maybe youll be able to figure out whats going on with them we sort of play it all by ear the whaley boys and the colonel run things cielle you didnt tell him all this he was pretty beat nuñez said i tried to get him settled in as soon as i could nate wanted to protest the settled in comment after all he was a prisoner here but these people didnt behave at all like captors they immediately impressed him as having the same dynamic that hed seen in research teams a were all in this together lets make the best of it attitude he didnt want to yell at these people still it made him a little uncomfortable that she was so forthcoming with information when your kidnappers showed you their faces they were giving you the message that you werent going home nuñez set a plate down in front of him it had a salad of mixed seaweeds carrots and mushrooms a piece of cooked fish which looked like halibut and what appeared to be rice eat up she said a couple of nutrition drinks arent going to get you back up to speed we do eat a lot of raw fish even on the blue but you need some carbs until you adjust to this diet theres plenty of rice when you finish that thanks nate dug in while the others all but cal excused themselves to work in other parts of the ship the older man had obviously been charged with nates second orientation lecture cal scratched his beard looked around at the pilots then leaned over to nate and spoke in a lowered voice theyre very promiscuous you know how dolphin females will mate with all the males in the pod so no one can be assured of who the father of her calf is they think it keeps the males from murdering her calf when its born thats the theory nate said theyre sort of like that and back at base you have a big pod to deal with you start down that path well youve got a lot of whaley boys to sex up i didnt sex her up nate hissed spraying rice out over the table im not sexing up any whaley boys er girls whatever look theyre very close here on the ship they dont have separate quarters they share one big cabin sex is very casual with them but they understand that were a little more hung up about it some of them seem to affect human shyness we generally dont mix sexually with them its not forbidden but its you know frowned upon its only natural for a guy to be curious nate put down his fork cal i did not have sex with anyone i mean anything right and be careful around the males especially if youre in the water with them theyll bunghole you just to watch you twitch jeez im just telling you for your own good thanks but im not going to be around long enough to worry about it might as well throw it in their faces nate thought the older man laughed almost shooting coffee out his nose when he recovered he said well i hope you mean you plan on dying soon because no one ever leaves nate leaned into cals face doesnt it bother you that youre a prisoner theres not one of us here who wouldnt be dead if the whaley boys hadnt picked us up not me especially you you were always twelve hours from dead since we started watching you certainly it had to occur to you how much easier it would have been just to kill you nate just stared for a second actually it had occurred to him and he didnt see the logic in keeping him alive if all they wanted to do was stop his research he wasnt going to make that argument verbally but still dont overthink it nate if you ever doubted that life was an adventure it definitely is now right nate said but before you ask me where id rather be let me remind you that theres a sphincter in the bottom of my sink you havent seen the shower then just you wait after he ate cal loaned him a copy of treasure island to read but when nate returned to his cabin he could barely concentrate on the book at all funny what you learn about yourself in a short conversation one that he would rather have been accused of having sex with another species than with another male even of another species interesting prejudice two that he actually was grateful not only to be alive but grateful to be having completely new experiences every moment even as a prisoner three that learning was still a high but he burned to share it with someone and finally that he was feeling a little jealous a little less special now that he knew that emily was having sex with all the male whaley boys on board that fickle little slut he dozed off with robert louis stevenson on his chest and the sound of killer whales calling in the distance outside the pod of twenty killer whales most the sons or daughters of the matriarch female were calling frantically to each other as they worried away at a huge bait ball of herring biologists had long speculated on the incredibly complex vocabulary of the killer whale identifying specific linguistic groups that even spoke the same dialect but they had never been able to put meaning to the calls other than to identify them as feeding distress or social noises however had they had the benefit of translation this is what they would have heard hey kevin fish fish i love fish look kevin fish mmmm fish you kevin take a run down that trench fake left go right hit the bait ball nothing but fish did someone say fish yeah fish over here kevin mmmmm fish and it went on like that actually orcas arent quite as complex as scientists imagine most killer whales are just four tons of doofus dressed up like a police car chapter twentysix picking the lock to davy joness locker bite me libby quinn said reading the tail the whale tail slowly twisted in space pixel by pixel as the computer extrapolated the new angle margaret painborne sat at the computer clay and libby stood behind her kona was working across the room on quinns reassembled machine bite me clay repeated that cant be right he thought about what nate had said about seeing a tail just like this and shivered margaret hit a few keys on the keyboard then swiveled in clays chair this some kind of joke clay not mine that was raw footage margaret as attractive as clay found libby he found margaret equally scary maybe the latter because of the former it was complex the tail image before you shifted it is exactly what i saw when i was down there youve all been saying how sophisticated their communication ability was said kona trying to sound scientific but essentially just pissing everyone off how said libby even if you wanted to how would you paint a whales flukes like that margaret and clay just shook their heads rustoleum suggested kona and they all turned and glared at him dont give me the stinkeye youd need the waterproof huh did you finish inputting those pages clay said yah mon well save them and go rake something or mow something or something save as a binary margaret added quickly but kona had already saved the file and the screen was clear margaret wheeled her chair across the office her gray hair trailing out behind her like the flying sorceress of clerical island she pushed kona aside crap she said what asked clay what asked libby you said save it kona said he saved it as an ascii file a text file not a binary crap ill see if its okay she opened the file and text appeared on the screen her hand went to her mouth and she sat back slowly in clays chair oh my god what came the chorus are you sure you put this in just as it came off the graphs she asked kona without looking at him truth said kona what said libby and clay this has got to be some sort of joke said margaret clay and libby ran across the room to look at the screen what its english margaret said pointing to the text how is that possible thats not possible libby said kona what did you do not me i just typed ones and ohs margaret grabbed one of the legal pages with the ones and ohs and began typing the numbers into a new file when she had three lines she saved it then reopened the file as text it read will scuttle second boat to it cant be it is clay jumped into margarets lap and started scrolling through the text from konas transcription look it goes on for a while then its just gobbledygook then it goes on some more margaret looked back at libby with save me in her eyes there is no way that the song is carrying a message in english binary was a stretch but i refuse to believe that humpbacks are using ascii and english to communicate libby looked over to kona you guys took these off of nates tapes exactly the way you showed me kona nodded kids look at this clay said these are all progress reports longitude and latitude times dates there are instructions here to sink my boat these fuckers sank my boat what fuckers margaret said a humpback with bite me on his flukes she was trying to look around clays broad back if this were possible then the navy would have been using it a long time ago now clay jumped up to face kona what tape is this last part from the last one nate and amy made the day nate drown why clay sat back on margarets lap looking stunned he pointed to a line of text on the screen they all leaned in to read quinn on boardwill rendezvous with blueagreed coordinates tuesdayno pastrami the sandwich clay said ominously just then clair home from school stepped into the office to discover an impromptu dog pile of action nerds in front of quinns computer all you bastards want to be part of a sandwich and you dont even know what to do with one woman not the spoon squealed kona his hand going to the goose egg on his forehead nathan quinn awoke feeling as if he needed to crawl out of his skin if he hadnt felt it before he would have thought he had the generic heebiejeebies scientifically speaking but he recognized the feeling as being hit with heavy subsonic sound waves the bluewhale ship was calling just because it was below the frequency of his hearing didnt mean it wasnt loud bluewhale calls could travel ten thousand miles he assumed that the ship was putting out similar sounds nate slipped out of his bunk and nearly fell reaching for his shirt another thing he hadnt noticed immediately the ship wasnt moving and he still had his sea legs on he dressed quickly and headed down the corridor to the bridge there was a large console that spanned the area between the two whaleyboy pilots that hadnt been there before unlike the rest of the ship it appeared to be manmade metal and plastic sonar scopes computers equipment that quinn didnt even recognize nuñez and the blond woman jane were standing at the sonar screens wearing headphones tim was seated beside one of the whaley boys at the center of the console in front of two monitors tim was wearing headphones and typing the whaley boy appeared to be just watching nuñez saw nate come in smiled and motioned for him to come forward these people were completely incompetent as captors nate thought not a measure of terror among them the humans anyway if not for the subsonic heebiejeebies he would have felt right at home where did this come from the electronics looked incredibly crude next to the elegant organic design of the whale ship the whaley boys and for that matter the human crew the idea of comparing designs between humanbuilt devices and biological systems hadnt really occurred to nate before because hed been conditioned never to think of animals as designed the whale ship was putting a deep dent in his darwin these are our toys nuñez said the console stays below the floor unless we need to see it totally unnecessary for the whaley boys since they have direct interface with the ship but it makes us feel like we know whats going on and they cant type for shit said tim tucking his thumbs under and making a slammingthekeys gesture tiny thumbs the whaley boy next to him trumpeted a raspberry all over tims monitor leaving large dots of color magnified in the whaley spit he chirped twice and tim nodded and typed into the computer can they read nate asked read kind of write and most of them understand at least two human languages although as you probably noticed theyre not big talkers no vocal cords said nuñez they have air chambers in their heads that produce the sounds they make but they have a hard time forming the words but they can talk ive heard em i mean them best that you just learn whaleyspeak its basically what they use to talk to each other except they keep it in the range of our hearing its easier to learn if youve learned other tonalsensitive languages like navajo or chinese im afraid not nate said so the ship is calling tim pulled off his headphones and handed them to nate the pitch is raised into our range youll be able to hear it through there nate held a headphone to one ear now that he could hear the signal he could also feel it start and stop more acutely in his chest if anything it relieved the discomfort because he could hear it coming is this a message yep said jane pulling up a headphone just as you suspected we type it in the computer puts the message into peaks and troughs on the waveform we play the waveform for the whaley boys and they make the whale sing that waveform weve calibrated it over the years nate noticed that the whaley boy at the metal console had one hand in an organic socket fitted into the front of the console like a flesh cable that ran to the whale ship through the consoles base similar to the ones on the flesh consoles the pilots used why the computers and stuff at all if the whaley boys do it all by what instinct the whaley boy at the console grinned up at nate squeaked then performed the international signal for a hand job its the only way we can be in the loop jane said believe me for a long time we were just along for the ride the whaley boys have the same navigational sense that the whales themselves do we dont understand it at all its some sort of magnetic vocabulary it wasnt until the dirts thats you developed computers and we got some people who could run them that we became part of the process now we can surface and pull a gps coordinate transmit it communicate with the other crews we have some idea of what were doing you said for a long time how long jane looked nervously at nuñez who looked nervously back nate thought for a moment that they might have to dash off to the bathroom together which in his experience was what women did right before they made any major decisions like about which shoes to buy or whether or not they were ever going to sleep with him again a long time nate were not sure how long before computers okay by which she meant she wasnt going to tell him and if he pressed it shed just lie to him nate suddenly felt more like a prisoner and as a prisoner he felt as though his first obligation was to escape he was sure that was your first obligation as a prisoner hed seen it in a movie although his earlier plan of leaping out the back orifice into the deep ocean now seemed a tad hasty with some perspective he said so how deep are we we usually send at about two thousand feet that puts us pretty squarely in the sofar channel no matter where we are geographically the sofar channel sound fixing and ranging was a natural combination of pressure and temperature at certain depths that cause a path of least resistance in which sound could travel many thousands of miles the theory had been that blues and humpbacks used it to communicate with each other over long distances for navigational purposes evidently whaley boys and the people who worked their ships did too so does this signal replicate a natural bluewhale call yes said tim thats one of the advantages of communicating in english within the waveform when the whaley boys were doing the direct communication there was a lot more variation in the call but our signal is hidden more or less except for a few busybodies who may run across it like me yes like you were a little worried about some of the acoustic people at woods hole and hatfield marine center in oregon people who spend way too much time looking at spectrograms of underwater sound you realize said nate that i might never have found out about your ships i didnt make any sort of intuitive leap to look at a binary signal in the call it was a stoned kid who came up with that yeah said jane if it makes you feel any better you can blame him for your being here we were on hold until you started to look in the signal for binary thats when they called you in so to speak nate sincerely wished he could blame kona but since it appeared that he might never see civilization again having someone to blame didnt seem particularly pertinent right now besides the kid had been right howd you know i didnt exactly put out a press release we have ways said nuñez trying not to sound spooky but failing this evidently amused the whaley boy at the console and the two pilots no end and they nearly wheezed themselves out of their seats oh fuck you guys said nuñez its not like you guys are a bunch of geniuses and you guys were the nightwalkers that tako man was talking about nate said to the pilots you guys sank clays boat the pilots raised their arms over their heads in a menacing scarymonster pose then bared their teeth and made some fake growling noises then collapsed into what nate was starting to think of as whale giggles the whaley boy at the console started clapping and laughing as well franklin were not done here can we get the interface back franklin obviously the whaley boy who had been working the console slumped and put his hand back in the socket sorry came a tiny voice from his blowhole bitch came another tiny voice from one of the pilots followed by whaley snickering lets send one more time i want base to know well be there in the morning nuñez said morales not a problem then asked nate grinning at nuñezs loss of temper oh theyre like fucking children nuñez said theyre like dolphins you dump them in the middle of the ocean with a red ball and theyll just play all day long stopping only long enough to eat and screw im telling you its like babysitting a bunch of horny toddlers franklin squeaked and clicked a response and this time tim and jane joined in the laughter with the whaley boys what what asked nate i do not just need to get laid shouted nuñez jane you got this sure said the blonde im going to quarters she left the bridge to the snickering of the whaley boys tim looked back at nate and nodded toward the sonar screen and headset that nuñez had vacated want to stand in im a prisoner said nate yeah but in a nice way said jane that was true everyone since hed come on board had been very kind to him seeing to his every need even some he didnt want seen to he didnt feel like a prisoner nate wasnt sure that he wasnt experiencing the helsinki syndrome where you sympathized with your captors or was that the stockholm syndrome yeah the helsinki syndrome had something to do with hair loss it was definitely the stockholm syndrome he stepped up to the sonar screen and put on the headset immediately he heard the distant song of a humpback he looked at tim who raised his eyebrows as if to say see so tell me nate said whats the singing mean it was worth a shot we were just going to ask you said jane swell said nate suddenly he didnt feel so well after all this even people who traveled inside whales didnt know what the song meant are you all right nate jane asked you dont look so good i think i have stockholm syndrome dont be silly said tim youve got plenty of hair you want some pepto asked jane the ships doctor yes he thought escape would seem a priority he was pretty sure that if he didnt get away he was going to snap and kill some folks or at least be incredibly stern with them funny he thought how your priorities could change with circumstances you go along for the greater part of your life thinking you want something to understand the humpback song for instance so you pursue that with dogged singlemindedness at the expense of everything else in your life only to be distracted into thinking maybe you want something in addition to that amy for instance and that becomes a diversion up until the time when circumstances make you realize what it is you really want and that is strangely enough to get the fuck out of a whale funny nate thought settle down kona clair said dropping her purse by the door i dont have a spoon clay jumped off margarets lap he and kona watched as clair crossed the room and exchanged hugs with margaret and libby lingering a bit while hugging libby and winking over her shoulder at clay so nice to see you guys clair said im not going out to get the pizza mon no way said kona still looking a bit terrified what are you guys doing clair asked and so margaret took it upon herself to explain what they had discovered over the last few hours with kona filling in the pertinent and personal details meanwhile clay sat down in the kitchen and pondered the facts pondering he felt was called for pondering is a little like considering and a little like thinking but looser to ponder one must let the facts roll around the rim of the minds roulette wheel coming to settle in whichever slot they feel pulled to margaret and libby were scientists used to jamming their facts into the appropriate slots as quickly as possible and kona well a thought rolling around in his mind was rather like a tennis ball in a coffee can it was just a little too fuzzy to make any impact and clair was just catching up no the pondering fell to clay and he sipped a dark beer from a sweating bottle on a high stool in the kitchen and waited for the roulette ball to fall which it did right about the time that margaret painborne was reaching a conclusion to her story this obviously has something to do with defense margaret said no one else would have a reason hell they cant even have a good reason but i say we write our senators tonight and confront captain tarwater in the morning hes got to know something about it and thats where youre completely wrong clay said and they all turned ive been pondering this here he paused for impact and it occurs to me that two of our friends disappeared right about the time they found out about this stuff and that everything from the breakin to the sinking of my boat and here he paused for a moment of silence has had something to do with someone not wanting us to know this stuff so i think it would be reckless of us to run around trying to tell everybody what we know before we know what we know is that cant be right said libby before we know what we know is quoted margaret no thats not right is making perfect sense to me said kona no clay said clair im fine with you and the girlongirl action and im fine with a haole rasta boy preaching sovereignty but im telling you i wont stand for that kind of grammatical abuse i am a schoolteacher after all we cant tell anyone clay screamed better said clair no need to shout libby said margaret was just being a radical hippie reactionist feminist lesbian communist cetacean biologist werent you dear libby quinn grinned at her partner ill have an acronym for that in a second mumbled clair counting off words on her fingers jeez your business card must be the size of a throw rug margaret glared at libby then turned to clay you really think we could be in danger seems that way look i know we wouldnt know this without your help but i just dont want anyone hurt we may already be in trouble we can keep it quiet if you feel thats the way to go said libby making the decision for the pair but i think in the meantime we need to look at a lot more audio files see how far back this goes figure out why sometimes its just noise and sometimes its a message margaret was furiously braiding and unbraiding her hair and staring blankly into the air in front of her as she thought they must use the whale song as camouflage so enemy submarines dont detect the communication we need more data recordings from other populations of humpbacks out of american waters just to see how far theyve gone with this thing and we need to look at blue fin and seiwhale calls said libby if theyre using subsonic then it only makes sense that theyll imitate the big whales ill call chris wolf at oregon state tomorrow he monitors the navys old sonar matrix that they set up to catch russian submarines hell have recordings of everything we need no said clay no one outside this room come on clay youre being paranoid say that again libby he monitors whose old sonar matrix the military still keeps a hand in on that sosus array so you think it is military clay shook his head i dont know im damned if i can think of a reason the navy would paint bite me on the tail of a whale i just know that people who find out about this stuff disappear and someone sent a message saying that nate was safe after we all thought he was dead so what are you going to do find him clay said well thats going to totally screw up the funeral said clair part three the source we are built as gene machines and cultured as meme machines but we have the power to turn against our creators we alone on earth can rebel against the tyranny of selfish replicators richard dawkins the selfish gene ninetyfive percent of all the species that have ever existed are now extinct so dont look so goddamn smug gerard ryder chapter twentyseven the found world the whale ship opened its mouth and nate and the crew spilled out onto the shore like sentient drool which was some coincidence since thats exactly what lay beneath the hard shell of the landing they were met by a group of whaley boys one of whom handed nate a pair of nikes then went off to trade clicks and squeals and greeting rubs with the returning crew it was so bright after nearly ten days in the whale ship that nate couldnt immediately tell what was happening the rest of the human crew were wearing sunglasses as they sat down on the ground to put on their shoes only a few feet from the ships mouth from the rigid feel of the ground nate thought they might be on a dock of some kind but then cal burdick took off his own sunglasses and handed them to nate go ahead ive been looking at all of this for a lot of years but i think youll find it interesting with the dark glasses nate was able to see his eyes were fine but his mind was having a hard time processing what they were telling him it was as light as daylight on an overcast day at least but they were not outdoors they were inside a grotto so immense that nate could not even make out the edges of it a dozen stadiums could have fit inside the space and still left room for a state fair a casino and the vatican if you snipped off a basilica or two the entire ceiling was a source of light cold light it appeared some sections yellow some blue great blotches of light in irregular shapes as if jackson pollock had painted a solar storm across the ceiling half of the grotto was water flat and reflective as a mirror the smoothness broken by small whaley boys porpoising here and there in groups of five and six their blowholes sending up synchronized blasts of steam every few yards whaley kids he thought fifty or so whale ships of different species pulled up to the shore their crews coming and going huge segmented pipes that looked like giant earthworms were attached to each of the ships one on each side of the head and ran off to connections on shore the ground the ground was red and as hard as linoleum polished yet not quite shiny it ran out for hundreds of yards perhaps over a mile and appeared to continue halfway up the walls of the immense grotto nate could see openings in the walls oval passages or doorways or tunnels or something from the size of the people and whaley boys passing in and out he could tell that some of the openings were perhaps thirty feet around while others seemed only the size of normal doors there were windows next to some of the smaller ones or what he guessed were windows their shapes all curves and slopes there wasnt a right angle in the grotto hundreds of people moved about amid as many whaley boys maintaining the ships moving supplies and equipment on what seemed very normal hand trucks and carts where in the hell are we nate said nearly wrenching his neck trying to look at all of it at once i mean what in the hell is this pretty amazing cal said i like to watch people when they see gooville for the first time nate ran his hand over the ground or floor or whatever this surface was they were sitting on what is this stuff it appeared smooth but it had texture pores a hidden roughness like stoneware or its living carapace like a lobster shell this whole place is living nate everything the ceiling the floor the walls the passageway in from the sea our homes its all one huge organism we call it the goo the goo then this is gooville yes cal said with a big smile that revealed perfect teeth and that would make you thats right the goos theres a wonderful seussian logic to it dont you think i cant think cal you know how all your life you hear people talk about things that are mindboggling its just a meaningless cliché a hyperbole like saying that youre wasted or that something is bloodcurdling yep well im boggled im totally boggled you thought the ships were impressive huh yeah but this one living organism shaped itself into this complex what system im boggled imagine how the bacteria who live in your intestinal tract feel about you well right now i think theyre pissed off at me a group of whaley boys was gathering about ten yards away from them pointing at nate and snickering theyre coming down to check out the newcomer dont be surprised if you get rubbed up against in the streets theyre just saying hi streets we call them streets theyre sort of streets now out of the dim yellow light of the whale ships nate realized that there was a wide variety in the whaley boys coloring some were actually mottled blue like the skin of a blue whale while others were black like a pilot whale or light gray like a minke whale some even had the blackonwhite coloring of killers and pacific whitesided dolphins while a few here and there were stark white like a beluga the body shapes of all were very similar differing only in size with the killer whaley boys who were taller by a foot and heavier by perhaps a hundred pounds having jaws twice the width of the others he also noticed in the brighter light that he was the only human who had a tan the people even cal and the crew looked healthy it just appeared that none of them had ever seen the sun like the british nuñez came over and helped cal and then nate to his feet howre the shoes she asked nate theyre strange after not wearing any for so long youll be wobbly for a few hours too youll feel the motion when you stand still for a day or so no different from having been at sea in normal ship ill take you to your new quarters show you around a little get you settled in the colonel will probably send for you before too long people will help you out humans and whaley boys theyll all know youre new how many cielle humans almost five thousand live here whaley boys maybe half that many where is here where are we i told him about gooville said cal nuñez looked up at nate and then pulled her sunglasses down on her nose so he could see her eyes dont freak out on me huh nate shook his head what did she think that whatever she was going to tell him was going to be weirder grander or scarier than what hed seen already the roof above this ceiling which is thick rock although were not exactly sure how thick anyway its around six hundred feet below the surface of the pacific ocean were about two hundred miles off the coast of chile under the continental shelf in fact we came in through a cliff in the continental rise a cliff face were six hundred feet underwater right now the pressure we came in through a very long tunnel a series of pressure locks that pass the ships along until were at surface pressure i would have shown you as we came through but i didnt want to wake you yeah thanks for that lets get you to your new house weve got a long walk ahead of us she headed away from the water motioning for him to follow nate nearly stumbled trying to look back at the whale ships lining the harbor tim caught him by the arm its a lot to take in people really have freaked out you just have to accept that the goo wont let anything bad happen to you the rest is simply a series of surprises like life nate looked into the younger mans dark eyes to see if there was any irony showing there but he was as open and sincere as a bowl of milk the goo will take care of me thats right said tim helping him along toward the grotto wall toward the actual village of gooville with its organically shaped doorways and windows its knobs and nodules its lobstershell pathways its whaleyboy pods working together or playing in the water where was housed an entire village of what nate assumed were all happy human wackjobs after two days of looking for meaning in hash marks on waveforms and ones and ohs on legal pads that were hastily typed into the machine kona found a surferhacker on the north shore named lolo who agreed to write it all into a linux routine in exchange for konas old long board and a half ounce of the dankest nugs marijuana buds of the finest quality wont he just take cash asked clay hes an artist explained kona everyone has cash i dont know what im going to put that under for the accountant nugs dank clay looked forlornly at the legalpad pages piling up on the desk next to where margaret painborne was typing he handed a roll of bills over to kona go buy nugs bring him back bring back my change im throwing in my board for the cause said kona i could use some time in the mystic myself do you want me to tell auntie clair that you tried to extort me clay had taken to using clair as a sort of sword of damoclesassistant principalevil dominatrix threat over kona and it seemed to work swimmingly must blaze brah cool runnings suddenly something sparked in clays head a déjà vu trigger snapping electric with connections wait kona the surfer paused in the doorway turned the first day you came here the day that nate sent you to the lab to get the film did you actually do it kona shook his head nah boss the snowy biscuit see me going she say keep the money and she go to the lab when i come back with my ganja she give me the pictures to give to nate i was sort of afraid of that clay said go blaze be gone get what we need so three days later they all stood watching as lolo hit the return key and the subsonic waveform from a bluewhale call began scrolling across the bottom of the screen while above it letters were transcribed from the data lolo was a year older than kona a japaneseamerican burned nut brown by the sun with duckyyellow minidreads and a tapestry of maori tattoos across his back and shoulders lolo spun in the chair to face them i mixed down a fiftyminute trance track with sixty percussion loops that was way harder than this lolos prior forays into sound processing had been as a computer dj at a dance club in honolulu its not saying anything said libby quinn its just random clay well thats the way its gone so far right but theres been nothing since that first day we knew that might happen that there couldnt be messages on all of them we just have to find the right ones libbys eyes were pleading clay its a short season we have to get out in the field now that you have this program you dont need the manpower margaret and i will bring back more tapes we have them coming in from people we trust but we cant afford to blow off the season and we need to go public with the torpedo range margaret added less sympathetic than libby had been clay nodded and looked at his bare feet against the hardwood floor he took a deep breath and when he looked up he smiled youre right but dont just blow a whistle and hope someone will notice cliff hyland told me that the diving data was the only thing they were worried about youre going to need proof that humpbacks dive close to the bottom of the channel or the navy will claim that youre just being whale buggers and theres no danger to the animals even with the range youre okay if we go public then asked libby people are going to know about the torpedo range soon enough i dont think thats dangerous for you just dont say anything about the rest of this okay the two women looked at each other then nodded we have to go libby said well call you clay were not running out on you i know clay said after they left clay turned to the two surfers thirty years working with the best scientists and divers in the world and this was what it came down to two stoner kids if you guys need to go do things i understand outta here said lolo on his feet and bounding toward the door clay looked at the screen where lolo had been sitting scrolling across it will arrive gv apprx mondayhavesize sneakers waiting for quinnend mssaaaabaxyxabudab get him back clay said to kona we need to know which tape this was libby gave them all to him i know that i need to know where she got it where and when it was recorded call libbys cell phone see if you can get hold of her clay was trying to make the screen print before the message scrolled away how the hell does this thing work how you know im not leaving you woke up this morning kona did you have a reason to get out of bed other than waves or pot yah mon need to find nate howd that feel im calling libby boss loyalty is important son ill go catch lolo confirm which tape it was shut up boss im trying to dial behind them the cryptic message scrolled out of the printer chapter twentyeight singlecelled animal stockholm syndrome or not nate was starting to get tired of the whole hippiecommune everythingiswonderfulandthegoowillprovide attitude nuñez had come by for three days running to take him out on the town and every person he met was just a little too damn satisfied with the whole idea that they were living inside a giant organism six hundred feet under the ocean like this was a normal thing like he just wasnt getting with the program because he continued to ask questions at least the whaley boys would blow wet raspberries at him and snicker as he walked by at least they had some sense of the absurdity of all this despite the fact that they shouldnt even have existed in the first place which did seem to be a large point of denial on their part theyd installed him in what he guessed was a premier apartment or what youd call an apartment on the second floor looking out over the grotto the windows were oval and the glass in them although perfectly clear was flexible it was like looking out on the world through a condom and that was just the beginning of the things that creeped him out about this place he had a kitchen sink a bathroom sink and a shower all of which had big honking sphincters in the bottom of them and the seal on the door around his refrigerator if thats what you called it appeared to be made out of slugs or at least something that left an iridescent slime on you if you brushed up against it there was also a toothed garbage disposal in the kitchen which he wouldnt even go near the worst of it was that the apartment didnt make any attempt to conceal that it was alive his first day there when the human crew from the whale ship had come by for a drink a housewarming there had been a scaly knob on the wall by the front door that when pushed would cause the door to open after the crew left and nate returned from his shower the doorknob had healed over there was a scar there in the shell but that was all nate was locked in there was a tomtom thrumming of stones hitting his front picture window nate went to the window looked out on the vast grotto and harbor then down on the source of his torment a pod of whaleyboy kids was winging stones at his window thump thumpa thump the stones bounced off leaving no mark when nate appeared at the window the thumping became more furious as the whaley kids picked up the pace and aimed right at him as if a wellplaced shot might drop him in a dunking tank theres a reason cetaceans dont have hands in the real world nate screamed at them you are that reason you little freaks thump thumpa thump thump clack occasionally a missed throw hit the shelllike frame of the window sounding like a marble hitting tile i sound like old man spangler yelling at my brother and me for raiding his apple trees nate thought when did i turn into that guy i dont want to be that guy there was a soft knock on the shell of his front door as he turned the door flipped open like shutters two pieces of shell retracting on muscles hidden in the wall nate felt like a surprised box turtle cielle nuñez stood in the doorway with canvas shopping bags folded under her arm she was a pleasant woman attractive competent and nonthreatening nate was sure thats why shed been chosen to be his guide you ready to do some shopping nate i called to tell you i was coming but you didnt answer the apartment had a speaking apparatus a sort of ornate tube thing that whistled and buzzed green metallic beetle wings when there was a call nate was afraid of it cielle can we drop any pretense that we are just buddies out for the day you lock me in here when you leave for your own safety somehow that always seems to be the argument the jailer uses you want to go get some food and clothes or not nate shrugged and followed her out the door they walked along the perimeter of the grotto which seemed a cross between an old english village and an art nouveau hobbit housing project irregularly shaped doors and windows looking into shops that displayed baked goods and other prepared foods evidently the goo wasnt big on having fire around for home cooking all the cooked foods were prepared somewhere else in the complex there was a warming cabinet in nates apartment that looked like a breadbox made out of a giant armadillo shell it worked great you rolled the top open put the food in then promptly lost your appetite lets get you something to wear today cielle said those khakis are on loan only the whaleship crews are supposed to wear them as they walked a half dozen whaley kids followed them chirping and giggling all the way so id get in trouble if i started kicking whaley kids down the street of course cielle laughed we have laws here just like anywhere else evidently not ones that forbid kidnapping and unjustified imprisonment nuñez stopped and grabbed his arm look what are you complaining about this is a good place to be youre not being mistreated everyones been kind to you whats the problem whats the problem the problem is that all you people were yanked out of your lives taken away from your families and friends taken from everything that you knew and you all act like it doesnt bother you in the least well it bothers me cielle it fucking bothers me a lot and i dont understand this whole colony or city or whatever this thing is how does it even exist without anyone knowing about it in all these years why has no one gotten out and spoiled the secret of this place i told you we were all going to drown bullshit i dont buy that for a second that gratitude toward your rescuer only lasts for a short while ive seen it it doesnt take over your life everyone ive met is blissed out you people worship the goo dont you nate you dont want to be locked in you wont be locked in you can have the run of gooville go anywhere you want theres hundreds of miles of passages some of them even i havent seen go leave the grotto and go down any one of those passages but you know what youll be back looking for your apartment tonight you are not a prisoner youre just living in a different place and a different way you didnt answer my question the goo is the source nate youll see the colonel fuck the colonel the colonel is a fucking myth should we get some coffee you seem grumpy damn it cielle my caffeine headache is not relevant actually it was sort of he hadnt had any coffee today besides how do i know its coffee were drinking its probably some mutant sea ottercoffee bean hybrid beverage is that what you want no thats not what i want what i want is a doorknob and not an organic nodule thing i want a dead doorknob one that always has been dead too not something that you used to be friends with cielle nuñez had backed away from him several feet and the whaley kids whod been following them had quieted down and gone into a defensive pod formation the big kids on the outside people who were out walking and who normally made a point of nodding and smiling as they passed took a wide detour around nate there was an inordinate amount of whistling among the milling whaley boys that going to do it for you nuñez asked a doorknob i get you a doorknob youre a happy man why should he be embarrassed because hed scared the kids because hed made his captors uncomfortable nevertheless he was embarrassed i could use some earplugs too if you have them for sleeping for ten hours out of twentyfour the grotto went dark cielle explained that this was for the comfort of the humans to help them keep some semblance of their normal circadian rhythms people needed day and night without the change many people couldnt sleep the problem was the whaley boys didnt sleep they rested but they didnt sleep so when the grotto went dark they went on about their business in the dark however they were all constantly emitting sonar clicks at night the grotto sounded like it was being marched upon by an army of tap dancers consequently so did nates apartment nuñez nodded we can probably do that you want to go get a steaming hot cup of sea otter now what im just kidding lighten up nate i want to go home hed said it before he even realized it thats not going to happen but ill send word i think its time you met with the colonel they spent the day going to shops nate found some cotton slacks that fitted him some socks and underwear and a pile of tshirts from one tiny shop there was no currency exchanged nuñez would just nod to the shopkeeper and nate would take what he needed there was little variety in any of the shops and most of what they carried was goods from the real world clothes fabric books razor blades shoes and small electronics but a few shops carried items that appeared to have been grown or made right there in gooville toothbrushes soaps lotions all the packaging seemed to come out of the seventeenth century the shopkeepers wrapped parcels in a ubiquitous oilcloth that nate thought smelled vaguely of seaweed and indeed had the same olive color as giant kelp patrons brought their own jars to carry oils pickles and other soft goods nate had seen everything from a modern mayonnaise jar to handthrown crockery that had to have been made a hundred years ago how long cielle he asked as he watched a shopkeeper count sugared dates into a handblown glass jar and seal it with wax how long have people been down here she followed his gaze to the jar we get a lot of the surface goods from shipwrecks so dont be impressed if you see antiques the sea is a good preserver we may have salvaged it only a week ago a friend of mine keeps potatoes in a grecian wine amphora thats two thousand years old yeah and im using the holy grail to catch my spare change how long you are so hostile today i dont know how long nate a long time he had dozens hundreds more questions like where the hell did they get potatoes when they didnt have sunlight to grow anything they werent bringing potatoes up from a shipwreck but cielle was letting him get only so far before claiming ignorance they had lunch at a fourstool lunch counter where the proprietor was a striking irishwoman with stunning green eyes and a massive spill of red hair and who like everyone it seemed knew cielle and knew who nate was got you a walkman then dr quinn whaley boys will drive you to drink with that sonar at night were going to get him some earplugs today brennan cielle said music thats the way to wash the whaleyboy whistles the woman said then she was off to her kitchen the walls of the cafe were decorated with a collection of antique beer trays glued in place as nate had learned with an adhesive that was similar to what barnacles secreted to fasten themselves to ships nailing things up was frowned upon as the walls would bleed for a while if injured nate took a bite of his sandwich meatballs and mozzarella on good crusty french bread how he asked cielle blowing crumbs on the counter how does any of this stuff get made if theres no flame cielle shrugged no idea a bakery id guess they make all the prepared food outside the grotto ive never been there you dont know how how can that be cielle nuñez put down her own sandwich and leaned on one elbow smiling at nate she had remarkably kind eyes and nate had to remind himself that she had been ordered to be his friend interesting he thought that theyd choose a woman was she bait you ever read a connecticut yankee in king arthurs court nate of course everybody does and that guy goes back to camelot from the late nineteenth century and dazzles everyone with his scientific knowledge mainly because he can make gunpowder right yes so youre a scientist so you might do better than most but take your average citizen a guy who works at a discount store say drop him in the twelfth century you know what hell achieve make your point death by bacterial infection more than likely and the last words on his lips will probably be theres such a thing as an antibiotic really my point is i dont know how this stuff is made because i havent needed to know nobody knows how to make the things they use i suppose i could find out and get back to you but i promise you im not holding out on you just to be mysterious we do a lot of salvage on the whale ships and we have a trade network into the real world that gets us a lot of our goods when a freighter leaves pallets of goods for the people on remote islands in the pacific all they know is that theyve been paid and theyve delivered to shore they dont stay to see who takes the goods away the oldtimers say that it used to be that the goo provided everything nothing came in from the outside that wasnt on their backs when they got here nate took a bite of his sandwich and nodded as if considering what shed just said since hed arrived in gooville he had spent every waking moment thinking about two things one how this whole place could possibly function and two how to get out of it the goo had to get energy from somewhere the energy to light the huge grotto alone would require tens of millions of calories if it got energy from outside maybe you could use that same pathway to get out so do you guys feed it the goo no well then dont know nate i just dont know how does drycleaning work well i assume that they use solvents that uh look biologists dont have a lot of stuff that needs to be drycleaned im sure its not that complicated a process yeah well right back at you on all of your questions about the goo cielle stood and gathered up her parcels lets go nate im taking you back to your apartment then im going right to the whaleyboy den and find out if they can get the colonel to see you today nate still had a couple bites of his sandwich left hey ive still got a couple of bites of my sandwich left he said really well did you ask yourself where in gooville we got meatballs what sort of meat might be in them nate dropped his sandwich bit of the whining wussy boy arent we said brennan as she came out of the kitchen to take away their plates nate was reading a cheesy lawyer novel that hed found in the small library in his apartment when the whaley boys came for him there were three of them two large males with killerwhale coloring and a smaller female blue only when the blue squeaked hi nate in a mashedelf voice did he recognize it as emily wow hi emily is just emily okay or should i always say the seven nate always felt awkward with someone afterward even if there wasnt anything for the ward to be after she crossed her arms over her chest and bugged out her left eye at him okay nate said moving on i guess well be going then did you see my new doorknob brandnew stainless steel i realize it doesnt go with everything else but you know it feels a little like freedom right nate its a doorknob he thought they led him around the perimeter of the grotto beyond the village and into one of the huge passageways that led away from the grotto they walked for half an hour tracing a labyrinth of passageways that got narrower and narrower the farther off they went the bright red lobstershell surface fading into something that looked like motherofpearl the deeper in they went it glowed faintly just enough so they could see where they were going finally the passageway started to broaden again and open into a large room that looked like some sort of oval amphitheater all of it pearlescent and providing its own light benches lined the walls around the room all in view of a wide ramp that led to a round portal the size of a garage door closed now with an iris of black shell ooooh the great and powerful oz will see you now nate said the whaley boys who normally found practically anything funny just looked away one of the blackandwhites started whistling a soft tune from his blowhole in the hall of the mountain king or a streisand tune something creepy nate thought emily backhanded the whistler in the chest and he stopped abruptly then she put her hand on nates shoulder and gestured for him to go up the steps to the round portal okay i guess this is it nate started backing up the ramp as the whaley boys started backing away from him you guys better not leave me because ill never find my way back emily grinned that lovely hackasalmoninhalf smile of hers and waved him on thanks em you look good you know did i mention shiny he hoped shiny was good the iris opened behind him and the whaley boys fell to their knees and touched their lower jaws to the floor nate turned to see that the pearlescent ramp led into a vibrant red chamber that was pulsing with light and glistening with moisture as the walls appeared to breathe now this looked like a living thing the inside of a living thing really much more what hed expected to see when the whale had eaten him he made his way forward a few steps in the ramp melded into the reddish flesh which nate could now see was shot through with blood vessels and what might be nerves he couldnt get the size of the space he was in it just seemed to expand to receive him and contract behind him as if a bubble were moving along with him inside it when the iris disappeared into the pink goo nate felt a wave of panic go through him he took a deep breath damp fecund air and strangely enough he remembered what poynter and poe had told him back on the humpback ship its easier if you just accept that youre already dead he took another deep breath and ventured forward a few more feet then stopped i feel like a friggin sperm in here he yelled what the hell he was dead anyway im supposed to have a meeting with the colonel on cue the goo began to open in front of him like the view of a flower opening from the inside a brighter light illuminated the newly opened chamber now just large enough to house nate another person and about ten feet of conversational distance reclining in a great pink mass of goo dressed in tropical safari wear and a san francisco giants baseball hat was the colonel nathan quinn good to see you its been a long time he said chapter twentynine talking up the dead nate hadnt seen his old teacher gerard growl ryder in fourteen years but except for the fact that he was very pale the biologist looked exactly the same as nate remembered him short and powerful a jaw like a knife and a long swoop of gray hair that was always threatening to fall into his pale green eyes youre the colonel nate asked ryder had disappeared twelve years ago lost at sea in the aleutians i toyed with the title for a while for a week or so i was manmeat the magnificent but i thought that sounded like i might be compensating for something so i decided to go with something militarysounding it was a tossup between captain nemo from twenty thousand leagues and colonel kurtz from heart of darkness i finally decided to go with just the colonel its more ominous that it is once again reality was taking a contextual tilt for nate and he was trying to keep from falling this once brilliant brilliant man was sitting in a mass of goo talking about choosing his megalomaniacal pseudonym sorry to keep you waiting for so long before i brought you down here but now that youre here hows it feel to stand in the presence of god respectfully sir youre a fucking squirrel this doesnt feel right clay whispered to libby quinn we shouldnt be having a funeral when nates still alive its not a funeral said libby its a service they were all there at the whale sanctuary in the front row clay libby margaret kona clair and the old broad moving back cliff hyland and tarwater with their team the count and his research grommets jon thomas fuller and all of the hawaii whale inc boat crews which constituted about thirty people on back whale cops bartenders and a couple of waitresses from longees from the harbor liveaboards and charter captains the harbormaster booth girls and dive guides boat hands and a guy who worked the coffee counter at the fuel dock also researchers from the university of hawaii and strangely enough two blackcoral divers all crowded into the lecture hall the ceiling fans stirring their smells together into the evening breeze clay had scheduled the service in the evening so the researchers wouldnt miss a day of the research season still said clay he was a lion said kona a tear glistening in his eye a great lion this was the highest compliment a rastafarian can bestow upon a man hes not dead said clay you know that you doof still said kona it was a hawaiian funeral in that everyone was in flipflops and shorts but the men had put on their best aloha shirts the women their crispest flowered dresses and many had brought leis and head garlands which they draped over the wreaths at the front of the room that represented nathan quinn and amy earhart a unity church minister spoke for ten minutes about god and the sea and science and dedication and then he opened up the floor to anyone who had something to say there was a very long pause before the old broad wearing a smilingwhaleprint muumuu and a dozen white orchids in her hair tottered to the podium nathan quinn lives on she said can i get an amen shouted kona clair yanked his remaining dreadlocks all the biologists and grad students looked at each other eyes wide confused wondering if any of them had actually brought an amen that they could give up no one had told them they were going to need an amen or they would have packed one all the harbor people and lahaina citizens were intimidated by the science people and they were not about to give up an amen in front of all of these eggheads no way the whale cops didnt like the fact that kona was not in jail and they werent giving him shit let alone an amen finally one of the blackcoral divers who had that night found the perfect cocktail for grieving in a hit of ecstasy a joint and a forty of malt liquor sighed a feeble amen over the mourners like a sleepy stinky morningbreath kiss and i know continued the old broad that if it were not for his stubbornness in procuring a pastrami on rye for that singer in the channel he would be here with us today but if he were here with us whispered clair shhhhhh shushed margaret painborne dont you shush me or youll be munching carpet through a straw please honey said clay the old broad rambled on about talking to the whales every day for the last twentyfive years about how shed known nate and clay and cliff when they first came to the island and how young and stupid they were then and how that had changed as now they werent that young anymore she talked about what a thoughtful and considerate man nate was but how if he hadnt been so absentminded he might have found a decent woman to love him and how she didnt know where he was but if he didnt get his bottom back to maui soon she would twist his ear off when she saw him and then she sat down to resounding silence and tittering pity and everyone looked at clay who looked at a ceiling fan after a long awkward minute when the unity minister had to headfake to the podium a couple of times as if he would have to call a conclusion to the service gilbert box the count got up he wasnt wearing his hat for once but he still wore his giant wraparound sunglasses and without the balance of the giant hat the glasses atop his angular frame made him appear insectlike a particularly pale praying mantis in khakis he adjusted the microphone cleared his throat with great pomp and said i never liked nathan quinn and everyone waited for the but but it never came gilbert box nodded to the crowd and sat back down gilberts grommets applauded cliff hyland spoke next talking for ten minutes about what a great guy and fine researcher nate was then libby actually went forward and spoke at length about nates canadianness and how he had once defended the great seal of british columbia as being superior to all the other provincial seals in that it depicted a moose and a ram smoking a hookah showing a spirit of cooperation and tolerance while ontarios seal depicted a moose and an elk trying to eat a bear and saskatchewans showed a moose and a lion setting fire to a fondue pot both of which clearly exploited the innate canadian fear of moose and the seal of quebec depicted a woman in a toga flashing one of her boobs at a lion which was just fucking french hed named all the provinces and their seals but those were the ones libby could remember then libby sniffled and sat down thats what you could come up with hissed clay what five years of marriage libby whispered in his ear i had to go with something that wouldnt threaten margaret i dont see you storming the podium im not going to talk about my dead friend when i dont think hes dead and before they knew it jon thomas fuller was at the podium being thankful for nates support for his new project then going on about how much he appreciated how the whaleresearch community had gotten behind his new dolphin interaction center all of which was big news to the whaleresearch community who was listening during the short speech clair had caught clays neck in what appeared to be an embrace of consolation but was in fact a choke hold shed learned from watching cops on the news baby if you try to go after him ill have you unconscious on the floor in three seconds that would be disrespectful to nates memory but her effort left kona unattended on the other side and he managed to cough bullshit as jon thomas took his seat next a grad student who worked for cliff hyland stood and talked about how nates work had inspired her to go into the field then someone from the hawaiian department of conservation and resources talked about how nate had always been at the forefront of conservation and protection of the humpbacks then the harbormaster talked about nates being a competent and conscientious boat pilot all told an hour had passed and when it seemed obvious that no one else was going to stand up the minister moved toward the podium but was beaten to it by kona who had slipped from clairs steely grip and highstepped his way to the front like old auntie say nathan is living on but no one here today say a thing about the snowy biscuit who jahs mercy be on her is feeding fishes in the briny blue about now sniff i know her only short time but i think i can say for all of us that i always want to see her naked truth mon and when i think upon the round firm she will be missed clay said finishing for the faux hawaiian he had clamped a hand over konas mouth and was dragging him out the door she was a bright kid with that the minister jumped to the podium thanked everyone for coming and declared with a prayer all respects paid in full amen well yes mental health can be a problem said growl ryder being gods conscience is a tough job nate looked around and as if following his gaze the goo receded around them until they were in a chamber about fifteen feet in diameter a bubble it was like camping in someones bladder nate thought that better ryder asked nate realized that the colonel was the one controlling the shape of the chamber they were in someplace to sit would be good the goo behind nate shaped itself into a chaise longue nate touched it tentatively expecting to pull his hand back trailing strings of slime but although the goo glistened as if it were wet on the chair it felt dry warm and icky but dry he sat down on the chaise everyone thinks youre dead nate said you too nate hadnt thought about it much but of course the colonel had to be right they would have thought him long dead youve been here since you disappeared what twelve years ago yes they took me with a modified right whale ate my whole zodiac my equipment everything they brought me here in a blue whale i went mad during the trip couldnt handle the whole idea of it they kept me restrained most of the way here im sure that didnt help ryder shrugged i got better once i accepted the way things are down here i understood why they took me and that would be the same reason they took you i was about to figure out their existence from what was hidden in the signal of different whale calls they took both of us to protect the whale ships and ultimately the goo we should be grateful they didnt just kill us nate had wondered about that before why the trouble okay why didnt they well they took me alive because the goo and the people here wanted to know what i knew and by what path i came to suspect the content in the whale calls they took you alive because i ordered it so why what do you mean why because we were colleagues because i taught you because youre bright and intuitive and i liked you and im a decent guy why fuck you why growl you live in a slime lair and maintain an identity as the mysterious overlord of an undersea city you command a fleet of meat dreadnaughts with crews of humanoid whale people and youre currently reclining in a pulsating mass of gelatinous goo that looks like it escaped from hells own jello mold so excuse the fuck out of me if i question your motives okay good point can i get you something to drink like many scientists nate had known ryder had plodded on only to realize midcourse that hed forgotten certain social niceties practiced by other civilized humans but in this case he was completely missing the point no i dont need anything to drink i need to know how this happened what is this stuff youre a biologist growl you have to have been curious about this im still curious but what i do know is that this stuff makes up everything in gooville everything youve seen here the buildings the corridors most of the machinery although i guess youd call it biomachinery all of it is the goo one giant allencompassing organism it can form itself into nearly any organism on earth and it can design new organisms as the need arises the goo made the whale ships and the whaley boys and heres the kicker nate it didnt make them over thirty million years the entire species isnt more than three hundred years old thats not possible nate said there were certain things that you accepted if you were going to be a biologist and one of them was that complex life was a process of evolution by natural selection that you got a new species because the genes that favored survival in a certain environment were replicated in that species selected by being passed on often a process that took millions of years you didnt put in your order and pick up a new species at the window there was no cosmic fry cook there was no watchmaker there was no designer there was only process and time how could you possibly know that anyway i just know things by being in contact with the goo but im not far off it might be less time two hundred years two hundred years the whaley boys are definitely sentient by any definition and i dont even know what the whale ships are but theyre definitely alive too that kind of complexity doesnt happen in that short a time no id say the goo has probably been here as long as three and a half billion years the rocks around these caves are some of the oldest in the world im just saying the whaley boys and the ships are new theyre only a few hundred years old because thats how long ago the goo needed them the goo needed them so it made them to serve it like it has will it does have will its selfaware and it knows a lot in fact id venture to say that the goo is a repository for every bit of biological knowledge on the planet this nate this goo is as close to god as we are ever going to see its the perfect soup as in primordial soup precisely four billion years ago some big organic molecules grouped up probably around some deepsea source of geothermal heat and they learned how to divide how to replicate since replication is the name of lifes game it very quickly probably in the span of less than a hundred million years covered the entire planet big organic molecules that couldnt exist now because there are millions of bacteria that would eat them but back then there were no bacteria at one time the entire oceanic surface of the earth was populated by one single living thing that had learned to replicate itself sure as the replicators were exposed to different conditions they mutated they developed into new species they fed on each other some colonized each other and turned into complex animals and then more complex animals but part of that original living animal pulled back into its original niche by this time chemical information was being exchanged first by una then by dna and as each new species evolved it carried on all the information for making the next species and that information came back to the original animal but it had its safe niche pulling energy from the earths heat sheltered in the deep ocean and by rock it took in all the information from the animals that it came in contact with but it changed only enough to protect itself replicate itself while a million million species lived and died in the sea this original animal evolved very slowly learning always learning think of it nate within the cells of your body is not only the blueprint for every living thing on earth but everything that has ever lived ninetyeight percent of your dna is just hitching a ride just lucky little genes that were smart enough to align themselves to other successful genes like marrying into money if you will but the goo not only does it have all of those genes it has the diagram to turn them on and off that seat youre sitting on may well be three billion years old nate suddenly felt something hed felt before only when waking up in a hotel with the bedspread pulled up around his face a deep and earnest hope motivated by disgust that in all the time it had been there someone had cleaned the castoff genetic material from it he stood up just for safety how could you possibly know this growl it goes against everything we know about evolution no it doesnt it completely fits yes a complex process like life can develop given enough time but we also know that an animal that fits perfectly into its niche isnt pressured to change sharks have remained basically the same for a hundred million years the chambered nautilus for five hundred million well youre just looking at the animal that found its niche first the first animal the source nate shook his head at the magnitude of it you might be able to explain the evolutionary path being preserved but you cant explain consciousness analytical thought processes that require a very complex mechanism to perform you cant pull off that sort of complexity of function with big fluffy organic molecules the molecules have evolved but they remembered the goo is a complex if amorphous life form there are no analogs for it everything is a model of it and nothing is a model of it nate stepped back from the colonel and the goo flexed to make room for him the movement gave him a brief moment of vertigo and he lost his balance the goo caught him the surface moving forward against his shoulder blades just enough to steady him on his feet nate whipped around quickly and the goo pulled back god thats creepy there you go nate aware youd be amazed at what the goo knows at what it can tell us you can have a life here nate youll see things here you would never see youll do things you could never do and in the process you can help me unravel the greatest biological riddle in the history of the world i think youre supposed to laugh manically after saying something like that colonel if you help me ill give you what youve always wanted despite what you think what i want is to go home thats not going to happen nate not ever youre a bright man so i wont insult you by pretending the circumstances are any different than they are you are not ever going to leave these caverns alive so now you have to make the decision of how you want to spend your life you can have everything here that you could have on the surface much more in fact but youre not leaving well in that case colonel see if you can get your giant booger to duplicate you so you can go fuck yourself i know what the whale song means nate i know what its for nate felt as if hed been suckerpunched by his own obsession but he tried not to show the impact doesnt really matter now does it i understand you take a little time to work into the idea nate but there is some urgency this isnt just standing back and collecting data we need to do something i want your help well talk soon the goo came down and seemed to envelop the colonel there was a sound like ripping paper and a long pink tunnel opened behind nate leading all the way to the iris door through which hed entered he took one last look over his shoulder but there was nothing except goo ryder was gone nate was met in the hall by the two big killer whaley boys who took one look at his face then looked at each other then snickered with big toothy grins emily was nowhere to be seen hes a fucking squirrel nate said the whaley boys went into wheezing fits of laughter doubling over as they led nate down the corridor and back to the grotto say what you want nate thought the goo designed these guys to enjoy themselves as soon as nate entered the apartment he knew he wasnt alone there was a smell there and not just the ubiquitous ocean smell that permeated the whole grotto but a sweeter artificial smell he quickly checked the main living rooms and the bathroom when the portal to the bedroom opened he could see a shape under the covers in his double bed the biolighting hadnt come on in the bedroom as usual nate sighed the shape under the covers nuzzled into the corner of the bed exactly the way she had on the whale ship emily you are a lovely ah person really but im he was what he had no idea what he was going to say he was just trying to get to know himself better he needed some space but then he realized that whatever whoever was under the sheets was too small to be the enamored whaley boy nuñez he thought this was going to be worse than emily nuñez was really his only human contact in gooville even if she was working for the cause he didnt want to alienate her he couldnt afford to he moved into the room trying to think of a way that this could possibly not make things worse look i know that weve spent a lot of time together and i like you i really do good said amy throwing back the covers i like you too you coming in chapter thirty motherfluker clay and kona had spent the day cleaning the muck out of the raisedfromthedeep always confused now clay stood on the breakwater at the lahaina harbor watching the sun bubble red into the pacific and throw purple fire over the island he was feeling that particular mix of melancholy and agitation that usually comes with drinking coffee and irish whiskey at the wake of someone you never knew and it usually ends in a fight he felt as if he should do something but he didnt know what he needed to move but he didnt know where libby had confirmed that the last message about nate had been recorded more than a week after hed disappeared and it seemed to be more evidence that nate had survived his ordeal in the channel but where was he how do you rush in to save someone when you dont know where he is all their analysis of the tapes since then had yielded nothing but whale calls clay was lost what you doing kona barefoot and smelling of bleach came up behind him im waiting for the green flash he wasnt really but sometimes just as the sun dipped below the horizon it happened he needed something to happen yeah i seen that what cause that uh well and that was another thing he didnt have enough of a handle on the natural sciences to keep this whole project going i believe as the sun disappears under the horizon the residual spectrum bounces off the mucusphere thus causing the green flash yah mon the mucusphere its science said clay knowing that it wasnt science when the boat clean then we going out record whales and like dat good question clay thought he could collect the data but he didnt have the knowledge necessary to analyze it he had hoped that amy would do that i dont know if we find nate maybe you think he still living then even after all this time yeah i hope i guess we should keep up the work until we can find him yeah nate say them japanese going to kill our minkes if you dont work hard minke whales yeah ive been on one of their ships norwegians too thats some evil fuckery maybe the minke herd is large theyre not endangered the japanese and the norwegians arent really taking enough of them to hurt the population so why shouldnt we let them hunt them i mean whats the argument for stopping them because whales are cute the chinese fry kitties we dont protest them the chinese fry kitties im not saying i agree with killing them but we really dont have a good argument the chinese fry kitties konas voice was getting higher each time he spoke maybe some of the work we do here can prove that these animals have culture that theyre closer to us than they perceive then well have an argument kitties like little meow kitties they just fry them clay was musing watching the sunset and feeling sad and frustrated and words came out of him like a long rambling sigh of course when i was on the whaling ship i saw how the japanese whalers looked at the animals they see them as fish no more or less than a tuna but i was photographing a spermwhale mother and her calf and the calf got separated from the pod the mother came back to get the calf and pushed it away from our zodiac the whalers were visibly moved they recognized that motherchild behavior it wasnt fish behavior so its not a lost cause kitties kona sighed taking on the same tone of resignation that clay had used yeah said clay so how we going to find nate so we can do good work and save them humpies and minkes is that what were doing no not now now we just watching for a green flash i dont know any science kona i made that up about the green flash ah i didnt know science you dont know just looks like magic i dont believe in magic oh brah dont say dat magic come bite you in the ass for sure you going to need my help for sure now clay felt some of the weight of his melancholy lift by sharing a moment with the surfer but his need to act was worrying at him like a flea in the ear lets take a drive upcountry kona they really fry kitties in china kona said his voice so high now that dogs living around the harbor winced amy what how what the lights had come up and nate could see that it was amy in his bed it was a lot of amy that he hadnt seen before they took me nate just like you a few days later it was horrible quick hold me a whale ship ate you too yes just like you hold me im so afraid and they brought you all the way here yes just like you only its worse for a dame i feel so so naked hold me dame no one says dame anymore well africanamerican then you are not africanamerican i cant remember all the politically correct terms christ nate what do you need a diagram crawl in amy flapped the covers threw them back then struck a cheesecake pose grinning but nate backed away you put your head in the water to listen for the whale the only other person i ever saw do that was ryder look at my tan line nate she danced her fingertips over her tan line which to nate looked more like a beige line nevertheless she had his attention ive never had a tan line before amy what you set me up im naked over here havent you thought about that yes but ha you admit it i was your research assistant you had firing power over me yet there you are thinking about me naked you are naked ha i think ive made my point that ha thing is unprofessional amy dont care i no longer work for you and you are not the boss of me anymore and furthermore look at this butt she rolled over he did she looked back over her shoulder and grinned ha stop that he looked at the wall you spied on me you caused all this to happen dont be ridiculous i was just part of it but all that is forgiven look how luscious i am amy did a presentation wave over herself as if nate had just won her in a game show would you stop that nate reached over and pulled the covers up to her chin luscious she said pulling the covers down revealing a breast with each syllable nate walked out of the room put on some clothes and come out here im not going to try to talk to you like that fine dont talk she called after him just crawl in youre just bait he called from the kitchen hey buster im not that young this conversation is over until you come out here fully dressed nate sat down at his little dining table and tried to will away his erection what are you some kind of fruitcake some kind of sissy boy some kind of fairy huh yes thats it nate said for a moment nothing but quiet from the bedroom then oh my god i feel like such a maroon her voice was softer now she came stumbling out of the bedroom the sheet wrapped around her im really sorry nate i had no idea you seemed so interested i wouldnt have ha nate said see how it feels the old broad had given them iced ginger tea and set kona up at one of her telescopes to look at the moon she sat down next to clay on the lanai and they listened to the night for a while its nice up here clay said i dont think ive been up here at night before clay im usually in bed by now so i hope you dont think me dense if i get things clear in my mind of course not elizabeth thank you as i see it for years you and nate have been telling everyone that im a nut job because i said i could communicate with whales now you drive up here in a froth in the middle of the night to deliver the earthshattering news that what ive been telling you all along is possible she leaned her chin on her fist and looked wideeyed at clay that about right we never called you a nut job elizabeth clay said thats an overstatement doesnt matter clay im not mad she sipped her tea and im not angry either ive been in these islands a very long time clay and ive lived on the side of this volcano for most of it ive spent more time looking down on that channel than most people have spent on the planet but not once did you or nate ask me why didnt want to look a gift horse in the mouth i guess easier to think i was just a few bananas short of a bunch than to ask me why i was interested clay felt sweat running down the small of his back hed been uncomfortable around the old broad before but in a totally different way the way one feels when a matron aunt pinches your cheek and starts to ramble inanely about the old days not like this this was like getting sandbagged by a prosecutor i dont think that nate or i could answer that question elizabeth so its not out of order that we didnt ask you thats a load a shark balls old auntie kona said not looking away from the eyepiece of the eightinch mirror telescope hes a sweet boy the old broad said clay you know that mr robinson was in the navy did i ever tell you what it was that he did no maam i just assumed he was an officer i can understand how you might think that but all the money came from my family no sweetheart he was a noncom a chief petty officer a sonar man in fact im told he was the best sonar man in the navy at the time im sure he was elizabeth but shut up clay you came here for help im helping you yes maam clay shut up james that was mr robinsons first name he loved to listen to the humpbacks he said they made his job a damn sight harder but he loved them we were stationed in honolulu then but submarine crews were on and off on hundredday duty shifts so when he would have time in port we would come over to maui rent a boat and go out in the channel he wanted me to be part of the world he lived in all the time the world of sound under the sea you can understand that cant you clay of course but clay was getting a notsogood feeling about this trip down memory lane he had things he needed to know but he wasnt sure that this was part of them thats when i bought papa lani with some of my fathers money we thought wed live there fulltime eventually maybe turn it into a hotel anyway one day james and i decided to rent a little powerboat and camp on the ocean side of lanai it was a calm day and an easy trip on our way over a big humpback came up beside the boat it even seemed to change course when we did james slowed down so we could stay with our new friend there were no rules then about getting close to the whales like there are now we didnt even know we were supposed to save them back then but james loved the humpbacks and i had come to as well there was no one but the pineapplecompany workers on lanai at that time so we found a deserted beach where we thought wed build a fire cook some dinner drink highballs from tin cups swim naked and you know make love on the beach see there ive shocked you no you havent said clay yes i have im sorry no you havent really im fine tell the story old ladies he thought when the trade winds came up that evening we pitched the tent a little ways off the beach in a small canyon sheltered from the wind well i gave james my best hummer and he fell asleep right away clay choked on his iced tea oh my dear did an ice cube go down the wrong pipe kona come here and heimlich clay dear no im fine clay waved the surfer away really im okay tears streamed down his cheeks and he wiped his nose on his shirttail he was suddenly incredibly grateful he hadnt brought clair just need to catch my breath kona sat down crosslegged at their feet having suddenly found that he was interested in history go ahead old auntie well i got a little bit of a headache so i decided to go back to the boat to get an aspirin from the firstaid kit come to think of it it must have been from the tension in my neck i always got a crick in my neck when i did that but james loved it so jesus elizabeth would you get on with the story clay said im sorry dear ive shocked you havent i no im fine im just curious to find out what happened well as long as i didnt shock you i suppose i should be more discreet in front of the boy but it is part of the story no please what happened on the beach you know we could fuck like mad monkeys all night long and it never gave me a headache but one the beach please when i got to the beach there were two men near the boat it looked like they were doing something to the engine i ducked behind a rock before they saw me i watched them in the moonlight a short one and the tall one the tall one seemed to be wearing some sort of helmet or diving suit but then the short one said something and the tall one started laughing snickering really and i saw his face in the moonlight it wasnt a helmet clay it was a face a smooth shiny face with a jaw full of teeth i could see the teeth even from where i was it wasnt human clay well i went back and woke james told him he had to come see i took him back to my hiding place the two men or the man and that thing were still there but behind them right there almost on the beach was also a humpback a big one the water couldnt have been ten feet deep where he was yet he was sitting there calm as could be well all james saw was the two men messing with our boat we had drunk quite a few cocktails i guess and james had his big strong man act to do he told me to stay where i was and not to move for anything then he went after them shouting at the top of his lungs for them to get away the tall one the nonhuman thing dove under the water right away but the man looked around like hed been trapped he started wading out toward the whale and james went right in after him then at last james saw the whale he just stopped there in the surf and looked thats when the thing came up out of the water behind him suddenly it was just there looming behind james i wanted to yell but i was so afraid the thing it hit james with something maybe a rock and he fell forward into the water then i screamed for all i was worth but im not sure they even heard me over the noise of the wind and the surf the man took one of jamess arms the thing the other and they swam to the whale with james in tow then clay as crazy as this sounds this is what happened that whale rolled over and they stuffed james into it back by the genital slit i think then they both crawled into it as well then the whale kicked its tail until it was in deeper water and swam away i never saw my husband again the old broad took clays hand and squeezed it i swear to you thats how it happened clay clay didnt know what to say over the years shed said a lot of crazysounding stuff but this was the mother of all crazy stuff yet she was more serious than hed ever seen her it didnt matter what he believed there was only one thing to say to her i believe you elizabeth thats why clay thats why ive helped finance you over the years its why ive watched the channel all these years its why i own two acres right near the water yet ive lived upcountry for all these years i dont understand elizabeth they came back clay that night the whale came back and the thing came back to the beach but i hid they came back for me the next day i didnt even go back to the boat i hiked my way to the pineapple plantation and got help there they brought me back to lahaina on one of their big freighters i havent been on the water since the closest i ever go near the water is when theres an event at the sanctuary and then there are a lot of people around clay thought about the japanese soldier theyd found on a pacific island whod been hiding from the americans for twenty years after the war was over elizabeth robinson had obviously been hiding from something that wasnt looking for her didnt you tell anyone surely the navy would have wanted to find out what happened to one of their best sonar men they asked i told them they dismissed it they said james went swimming at night he drowned and i was drunk they sent some men over there and so did the maui police they found the boat still on the beach with everything in working order they found our camp and they found an empty bottle of rum that was the end of it why didnt you ever tell me or nate i wanted you to keep doing the work that you do meanwhile i kept watching i read all the scientific journals too you know i look for anything that might make sense of it come with me she got up and went into her house clay and kona following without a word in the bedroom she opened a cedar chest and took out a large scrapbook she laid it on the bed and flipped it open to the last page it was nates obituary nathan was one of the best in the field and that little girl said that a whale ate him then she disappeared at sea she flipped a page twelve years ago this dr gerard ryder disappeared at sea also studying whale calls at the time although blue whales she flipped another page this fellow a russian sonar expert who defected to england disappeared off cornwall in they said it was probably kgb well it probably was kgb im sorry elizabeth but each of these incidents seems to have a perfectly normal explanation and they happen over such a long period of time in different places i dont see what the connection is its underwater sound clay and theyre not normal all these men including my james were experts at listening to the ocean even so are you saying that someone has trained whales that creatures have been abducting sonar guys and shoving them up whales bums dont be crude clay you came to me because you wanted help im trying to give it to you i dont know who they are but what youve told me about there being language hidden in the whale song it just confirms in my mind that they took nate and james and all these other people thats all i know im telling you that im sure that nate is alive too its another piece to the puzzle clay sat down on the bed next to the scrapbook there were articles from scientific journals on cetacean biology on underwater acoustics news items about whale strandings some that didnt seem connected at all it was the search path of someone who didnt know what she was looking for hed gone so long thinking of her as crazy that hed never given her credit for how knowledgeable she really was he was realizing only now what had been driving her he felt like a shit elizabeth what about the call about the sandwich what about the crystals and the whales talking to you all of that i dont understand i did get the call clay and as for the other i have dreams of the whales talking to me and i pay attention to them fifty years of searching i take clues where i can get them given what i was looking for i thought magic and divination as valid a method as any tool in the search see kona said i told you science you dont know magic i guess i was casting my faith around carelessly i just hope i didnt do something awful nah old auntie jahs love on ye anyway even if youre trampin around your faith like a ho kona shut up clay said what do you mean you might have done something awful elizabeth she picked up the scrapbook closed it then sat down on the bed next to clay and hung her head a tear dripped down onto the black pasteboard cover of the book when the call came and the whale said that he wanted a pastrami on rye i recognized the voice clay i recognized the voice and i insisted nathan go out there and take the sandwich with him it was probably a prank elizabeth someone youve met nate was going out that day anyway you didnt cause this no you dont understand clay pastrami on rye was my jamess favorite i always had one waiting for him when he came in from submarine duty the voice on the phone was my james chapter thirtyone booty and the beasts the second time amy came out of the bedroom she was dressed in her familiar hiking shorts flipflops and a whales are our pals tshirt better i dont feel any better if thats what youre asking nate sat at the table with a can of grapefruit juice and a pint of vodka in front of him i mean are you more comfortable now that im dressed because i can be naked again in a flash you want a drink nate needed to forget the whole naked encounter as quickly as possible applying alcohol seemed like the most efficient method at this point sure she said she pulled a glass out of one of the kitchen cubbies the clear door folding back like the protective cover of a frogs eye you want a glass nate had been sipping alternately from the juice can and the vodka bottle until he had enough room in the can to pour in some vodka yeah i dont like reaching into the cupboards youre kind of squeamish for a biologist but i guess it does take some getting used to amy set the glasses in front of him and let him mix the drinks there was no ice you adjust you seem to have adjusted when did they take you you must have been really young me no i was born here ive always been here thats why i was perfect to work for you guys the colonel has been teaching me cetacean biology for years it occurred to nate that he had seen a few human children around and hadnt really thought about growing up in gooville someone had to teach them why not the infamous colonel i should have known when you were trying to locate the whale by listening for it that last day i should have known correction when i did locate the whale by listening for it for which you still owe me dinner i think this is one of those allbetsareoff situations amy you were a spy nate before you get too angry you need to remember the alternative to my spying and finding out what you were working on in detail that would have been to just kill you it would have been much easier you and ryder act like you did me a favor like you saved me from some great danger the only danger i was in was from you in the first place so stop trying to impress me with the quality of your mercy you did it all tore up the lab sank clays boat all of it didnt you no not directly poynter and poe tore up the lab the whaley boys sank clays boat i took the negatives out of the packet at the photo lab i kept them informed and i made sure you were where they needed you to be thats all i never wanted to hurt you nate never i wish i could believe that then you show up here like that trying to convince me that this is a great place to live right after ryder has given me the speech he drained his glass poured himself another drink this one with just a splash of grapefruit juice over the top what are you talking about i havent seen ryder since ive been back i just got in a few hours ago well then its always been a part of the plan let amy lure the biologist into staying nate look at me she took his chin in her hand and looked him right in the eye i came here of my own free will without any instructions from ryder or anyone else in fact no one knows where i am except maybe the goo you can never be sure about that i came here to see you with all the masks and the roleplaying out of the way nate pulled away from her and you didnt think id be mad and what was with the whole look how luscious i am act she looked down hurt nate thought or acting hurt if she cried it wouldnt matter hed be useless i knew youd be mad but i thought you might be able to get over it i was just trying to be floozish im sorry if im not very good at it its not a skill you get to use a lot in an undersea city truth be told the dating pool is sort of shallow here in gooville i was just trying to be sexy i never said i was a good floozy nate reached over and patted her hand no youre a fine floozy thats not what i was saying i wasnt questioning your uh floozishness i was just questioning its sincerity well its sincere i really do like you i really did come here to see you to be with you really what was the biological analog for this a black widow spider male falling for one of her lines knowing innately where it was going knowing right down to his very dna that she was going to kill and eat him right after they mated but he would worry about after so time and again mr black widow passed his dumbass sexenslaved genes on to the next generation of dumbass sexenslaved males who would fall for the same trick spinning a little conversation interesting name black widow howd you come about that tell me all about yourself me nah im a simple guy im doomed by my male nature to follow my little spider libido into oblivion lets talk about you love the red hourglass on your butt really amy said there were tears welling in her eyes and she lifted his hand to her lips and kissed it gently amy i dont want to stay here im not i want im too old for you even if you werent a lying destructive evil okay she held his hand to her cheek what do you mean okay you dont have to stay but can i stay with you tonight he pulled his hand back from her but she held his gaze i need to be way more drunk for this he said me too she went over to the scary fridge thing do you have more vodka theres another bottle over there in that thing that other thing that im afraid of he caught himself watching her bottom while she found the bottle you said okay you mean you know a way out shut up and drink you gonna drink or you gonna talk this isnt healthy nate observed thank you dr insight amy said pour me one nice red hourglass what back at his bungalow at papa lani clay sat on the bed with his head in his hands while clair rubbed the knots out of his shoulders hed told her the old broads story and shed listened quietly asking a few questions as he went along so do you believe her clair asked i dont even know what im admitting to believing but i believe she thinks shes telling the truth she offered us a boat clair a ship she offered to buy us a research vessel hire a crew pay them what for to find nate and her husband james i thought she was broke shes not broke shes loaded i mean the ship will be a used one but its a ship it will still run in the millions she wants me to find one and a crew and could you find nate if you had a ship where do i look she thinks hes on an island somewhere some secret place where these things live hell if shes telling the truth they could be from outer space if shes not well i cant just run a ship around the world stopping at islands and asking them if they happen to have seen people crawling out of a whales butt technically baby whales dont have butts you have to walk upright to have booty this is why we are the dominant species on the planet because we have booty you know what i mean its an important point she slid into his lap her arms around his neck clay smiled despite his anxiety technically man is not the dominant species theres at least a thousand pounds of termites for every person on earth well you can have my termites thanks so man isnt really dominant whether its brains or booty baby i wasnt saying that man was the dominant species i was saying that we are the dominant species woman because you have booty she wiggled on his lap by way of an answer then leaned her forehead against his looked in his eyes good point clay said what about this ship you going to let the old broad buy it for you you going to go look for nate where do i start follow one of these signals find whatever is making it and follow them wed need location for that how do you do that wed need to have someone working the old sonar grid the navy put down all over the oceans during the cold war to track submarines i know people at newport who do it but wed have to tell them what were doing you couldnt just say you were trying to find a certain whale i suppose we could and if you have your ship and that information you can follow the whale or the ship or whatever it is to its source my ship roll over ill rub your back but clay wasnt moving he was thinking i still dont know where to start who has the booty turn over captain clay slipped off his aloha shirt and rolled over onto his stomach my ship he said nate was suddenly cold and when he opened his eyes he was pretty sure that his head was going to explode im pretty sure my head is going to explode he said and someone rudely jostled his bed come on party animal the colonel sent for you we need to go he peeked between the fingers he was using to hold the pieces of his head together and saw the menacing but amused face of cielle nuñez it wasnt what who he expected and he did a quick sweep of the bed with one leg to confirm that he was alone i drank nate said i saw the bottles on the table you drank a lot i didnt get a knob so just anyone could use it anytime they want i noticed your knob it looks out of place about that time nate realized that he was naked and nuñez was standing over his naked body and he was going to have to let the pieces of his head go where they may if he was going to cover himself he felt for a sheet pulled it up as he sat up and threw his legs off the bed im going to need a moment hurry i have to pee that will be fine and throw up also fine okay you go away now brush your teeth and she left the room nate looked around the room for signs of amy but there were none he didnt remember where her clothes were but the last time hed seen them he was pretty sure they werent on her he stumbled into the bathroom and looked into the basin mother of pearl with its little siphon fixtures and the green sphincter drain seeing that pretty much did it for him and he heaved into the sink hi amy said poking her head out of the retracting shower door nate tried to say something something about trapdoor spiders in keeping with an arachnid theme he was developing with regard to amy but it came out more bubbly and moist than he intended you go ahead amy said ill be in here and the door clicked shut like a frightened clam when nate had finished reviewing the contents of his stomach he rinsed his face and the sink emptied his bladder into the thing on which he would not sit then leaned against the sink and moaned for a second while he gathered his thoughts a head popped out of the shower so that went well the waters not running im not showering im hiding i didnt want nuñez to see me the colonel shouldnt know ive been here ill leave after you go brush your teeth and then she was back in her shell he brushed rinsed repeated then said okay out she came grabbed him by the hair kissed him hard nice night she said the shower clicked shut amy inside im too old for this yeah i was going to talk to you about that not now later go shes waiting chapter thirtytwo the replicator versus the imitator nuñez bought him a large cup of coffee at a cafe where whaley boys stood around pouring down lattes the size of fire extinguishers and exchanging clicks and whistles at an irritating volume if ever there was a creature that didnt need caffeine nate said nuñez kept him moving while he kept trying to stop to lean on things dont ever drink with them nuñez said especially the males you know their sense of humor youre as likely as not to get a wet willy in the ear and its a real wet willy i may have to hurl again dont destroy yourself out of spite nate just accept things how they are he wasnt trying to destroy himself and he wasnt spiteful he was just confused hungover and kind of in love or something remotely like love except that the pain was more localized in his temples rather than being the overall liferuining pain it usually caused him can we stop in at the lollipop guild and get a couple aspirins youre late already in the corridors she handed him off to a pair of killer whaley boys you should be honored you know nuñez said he doesnt meet with many people you can take my appointment if you want the colonel had a goo recliner waiting for him when he walked through the iris door nate sat in it and held his coffee cup like a security blanket against his chest well can you see now that life wouldnt be so bad here nates mind raced amy said the colonel didnt know but maybe the goo knew but the colonel was tapped in to the goo so did he know or had he sent her in the first place and this was all a scam just like when hed sent her to hawaii to spy on him shed fooled him for a month there why couldnt she be fooling him now he wanted to trust her but what was ryder getting at whats different growl when i saw you nine hours ago i was a prisoner and im a prisoner now ryder seemed surprised he wiped the lock of gray hair out of his eyes furiously as if it had caused him to make some sort of mistake right nine hours so youve had some time to think he didnt sound sure i got drunk and passed out in the clear lightningbug light of day colonel i still want to go home you know time ryder patted the living chair he was sitting in as if he were petting a dog sending waves of blush through the pink goo outward from where he touched nate shivered at the sight of it time is different down here its relative nate offered its on a different scale what do you want from me colonel what can i possibly offer you that i get the special treatment of being spared and granted multiple audiences with the the grand poohbah nate was going to say with the alpha whacko but he thought of amy and realized that something had changed he no longer felt like he had nothing to lose rider swiped at his hair and clutched at the flesh of his chair with the other hand he began rocking slightly i want someone to tell me im thinking clearly i guess i dream things that the goo knows and i think it knows things that i dream but im not sure im overwhelmed you might have thought about that before you declared yourself wizard you think i chose this i didnt choose this nate the goo chose me i dont know how many people have been brought down here over the years but i was the first biologist i was the first one who had some idea how the goo worked it had the whaley boys bring me to a place like this where there was raw unformed animal and it never let me leave ive tried to make things better for people in gooville but ryders eyes rolled up in his head as if he were starting to have a seizure but then he was back again did you see the electricity on the whale ships i did that but its not its different now than it has been nate suddenly felt bad for the older man ryder was behaving like an early alzheimers patient who is realizing that hes losing recognition of his grandchildrens faces tell me nate said ryder nodded swallowed hard pressed on hardly the picture of the powerful leader hed appeared the night before i think that after the goo found its safe haven here under the sea it needed to have more information more dna sequences to make sure it could protect itself it produced a minute bacterium that could spread throughout the oceans be part of the great world ecosystem but could pass genetic information back to the source we call the bacteria sar its a thousand times smaller than normal bacteria but its in every liter of seawater on the planet that worked fine to transmit information back to the goo for three billion years everything that could be known was in the sea then something happened animals left the water exactly until then everything there was to know every piece of information that could be known was transmitted through dna replicators in creatures that lived in the seas the goo knew everything mind you it might take a million years to learn how to make an arthropods segmented shell it might take two million years to learn to make a gill or say twenty million to make an eye but it had its safe niche so it had the time it didnt have anywhere it needed to be evolution doesnt really have a destination its just dicking around with possibilities the goo is the same way but when life left the water the goo got a blind spot im having a little trouble seeing the immediacy of your story colonel i mean why beyond the obvious that im sitting inside this thing is this supposed to be urgent because four hundred million years later the land creatures came back into the water sophisticated land animals early whales yes when mammals came back to the sea they brought something that even the dinosaurs the reptiles and amphibians that had come back to the water didnt have something the goo didnt know knowledge that didnt replicate itself through dna it replicated through imitation learned knowledge not passed on memes nate knew about memes the information equivalent of a gene a gene existed to replicate itself and required a vehicle an organism in which to do it it was the same with memes except a meme could replicate itself across vehicles across brains a tune you couldnt get out of your head a recipe a bad joke the mona lisa all were memes of sort they were a fun model to think about and computers had made the idea of a selfreplicating piece of information more manifest with computer viruses but what did that have to do with but then it hit him why hed learned about memes in the first place the song nate said humpback song is a meme of course the first culture the first exposure the goo had to something it didnt understand what maybe fifteen million years ago it found out it wasnt the only game in town three billion years is a long time to get used to living in what you think is your private house only to suddenly find out that someone moved into an apartment above you while you were sleeping for a long time the goo didnt perceive that genes and memes were at odds whales were the first carriers big brains because they need to imitate complex behaviors remember complex tasks and because they could get the highprotein food to build the brains the memes needed but the goo came to terms with the whales theyre an elegant mix of genes and memes absolute kings of their realm huge efficient feeders immune from any predation except from each other but then something started killing whales killing them in alarming numbers and it was something from the surface world it wasnt something the goo could find out about from its oceanborne nervous system so thats when i think it created the whale ships or a version of them late seventeen or early eighteen hundreds id guess then i think when it had somehow gotten back enough samples of human dna it made the whaley boys to stay camouflaged but to watch to bring people back here so it could learn watch us i may have been the final link that started the war what war theres a war nate had a quick vision of the paranoid megalomaniacs that the colonel said hed considered for pseudonyms captain nemo and colonel kurtz both complete bedbugs the war between memes and genes between an organism that specializes in the replication of gene machines the goo and one that specializes in the replication of meme machines us human beings i brought electrical and computer technology here i brought the goo the theoretical knowledge of memes and genes and how they work where the goo is now and where it was before i came is the difference between being able to drive one and being able to build a car from lumps of raw steel its realizing the threat its going to figure it out ryder looked at nate expectantly nate looked at him as if he wasnt getting the point when hed studied under ryder the man had been so cogent so clear grumpy but clear okay nate said slowly hoping ryder would jump in so you need me to uh help me figure out a way to kill it didnt see that coming were at war with the goo and we have to find a way to kill it before it knows whats happening then dont you think you should keep your voice down no it doesnt communicate that way the colonel looked perturbed at nates comment so you want me to figure out how to kill your god yes before it wipes out the human race in one fell swoop which would be bad and we have to kill it without killing everyone in gooville oh we can do that nate said completely confident the way hed seen hostage negotiators in cop movies tell the bank robbers that their demands were being met and the helicopter was on the way but im going to need some time the strangest thing was as nate left the colonels chamber after being in direct contact with the goo for only a few minutes his hangover was completely gone chapter thirtythree could be worse could be dog years evidently said nate where we screwed up was killing the whales no way said amy we tipped our hand about being meme machines right yeah are you sure youre not spying for him nope know how you can tell when i was spying did i ever touch you here no no you did not and did i ever let you touch me here she moved his hand for him no you did not especially not in public yeah we should probably go back to your place she had called him on his buzzy bugwinged speaky thing about which he made a mental note to ask what the name of it was at his first convenience theyd met for coffee at a gooville café that catered to whaley boys shed assured him that no one would notice them and strangely enough the whaley boys had completely ignored them maybe he was no longer news if they say anything ill just tell them that were having sex amy said but you said you didnt think i should tell the colonel id seen you yeah but that was before he let you in on his secret plan right although im a little ashamed of how old you are we should talk about that so should i move my hand yeah down and a little to the right lets head back to my place back at his apartment standing in the kitchen he said hey what do you call this thing he pointed to that thing the phone no kidding he nodded as if hed known that all along so where were we killing whales was where we went wrong yes or how old you are so he continued killing whales was a big mistake which you knew because thats what made you want to become a nerd in the first place no thats not right scuse me action nerd you want to know how i got into this field really no i mean sure you can tell me about the destruction of the human race later you have to promise you wont laugh of course she looked incredibly sincere my sophomore year at the university of sasketchewan in the sticks youre kidding its a good school you promised you wouldnt laugh oh you meant even this early in the story im not supposed to laugh sorry i mean im sure it doesnt measure up to gooville community college not fair home of the gooville fighting loogies okay you made your point thank you so a friend and i decided that were going to go to break out of our boring smallcollege lives we were going to take some risks we were going to talk to a girl no we decided to drive all the way to florida for spring break just like american kids where we would then drink beer get sunburned and then talk to a girl girls so you went took almost a week to get there but yes we drove in his dads vista cruiser station wagon and i did indeed meet a girl in fort lauderdale a girl from fort lauderdale and i talked to her you dirty little tramp like hows it going eh among other things we conversed and so she invited me to go see a manatee he shoots he scores but i thought it was an american way of saying matinee i thought we were going to a movie you know you dont think about those things as being real but it was she did volunteer work for a rescue hospital for injured marine mammals mostly manatees that had been hit by boats they had a bottlenose dolphin too we stayed there for hours caring for the animals her teaching me about them i was hooked i hadnt even picked my undergrad major but as soon as i got back to school i went for biology and ive been studying marine mammals ever since oh my god you didnt get laid did you i found a passion for life i found something that drives me i cant believe i fell for such a pathetic loser hey im pretty good at this whale stuff im respected in my field but youre dead yeah before then i mean hey did you say that you fell for me i said i fell for a pathetic loser if the shoe fits he kissed her she kissed him back that went on for a while they both found it excellent then they stopped you said you wanted to talk about our age difference nate said because he always picked women who broke his heart and figuring that his heart was now into this whole thing far enough to be broken he wanted to get on with it yeah we probably should maybe we should sit down couch no at the table you might want a drink no im okay yep heartbreak he thought they sat so she said curling her legs up under her sitting like a little kid making him feel ever more the creepy old guy leching on the young girl you know that the whaley boys have been pulling people in here from shipwrecks and plane crashes for years right thats what cielle said she wants you i can tell but thats beside the point do you know that they pulled whole crews off sunken submarines plus theyve yanked sonar guys out of port for years i didnt know that doesnt matter has nothing to do with what im telling you so you realize that some people who have been lost at sea like the crew of the american sub scorpion that sank back in actually ended up here okay that makes sense more of the goo looking out for itself gaining knowledge yeah but thats not the point i mean those guys helped put together a lot of the technology you saw on the whale ship the human technology but that doesnt matter the important part is that the world thinks that the crew of the scorpion is at the bottom of the atlantic ocean even though theyre not got it okay nate said really slowly the way he had spoken to the colonel when he was losing the point much the way he was waving in the conversational wind right now and you realize that when i applied with you and clay that i gave my real name which is amy earhart and that amy is short for amelia oh my god nate said ha amy said the ship broker found clays ship in the philippines in manila harbor clay bought it based on faxed photographs a spec sheet and a recent hull certification for just under million of the old broads money it was a footlong us coast guard fisheries patrol vessel built in the late fifties it had been refitted several times since then once in the seventies for fishing once in the eighties for ocean survey and finally in the nineties as a liveaboard dive boat for the adventure tourist it had plenty of comfortable cabins as well as compressors dive platforms and cranes to raise and lower support vessels onto the rear deck although except for the lifeboats it came with no support craft clay thought they could use the rear deck as a helicopterlanding pad even if there wasnt a budget for a helicopter but you know someone with a helicopter might want to land there and it helped no end to have a big h painted on the deck there was a budget for painting a big h the ship had efficient if not quite stateoftheart navigation equipment radar autopilot and some old but functioning sonar arrays left over from its days as a fishing ship it had twin twelvehundredhorsepower diesel engines and could distill up to twenty tons of freshwater a day for the crew and passengers there were cabins and support for forty it was also rated a classthree icebreaker which was a feature that clay hoped they wouldnt have to test he really didnt like cold water through another broker clay hired the crew of ten men sight unseen right off the docks of manila a group of brothers cousins and uncles with the last name of mangabay among whom the broker guaranteed that there were no murderers or at least no convicted murderers and only petty thieves the eldest uncle ray mangabay who would be clays first mate would sail the ship to honolulu where clay would meet them hes going to be driving my ship clay said to clair after hed gotten the news that he had a crew and a first mate you have to let your ship go clay clair said if he sinks it it wasnt really yours but its my ship what are you going to call it he was thinking about the intrepid or the merciless or some other bigdick blowshitup kind of name he was thinking about loyal or relentless or the never surrender because he was determined now to find his friend and he didnt mind putting that right on the bow well i was thinking about you were thinking deeply about it werent you clair interrupted yes i thought id call her the beautiful clair just the clair will be fine baby you dont want the bow to look busy right the clair strangely enough on second thought that pretty much encompassed intrepid merciless relentless and loyal plus it had the underlying meaning of keeper of the booty which was sort of a bonus in a ship name he thought yeah thats a good name for her how long before she gets here two weeks shes not fast twelve knots cruising if we have somewhere to go ill send the ship directly there and meet it at a port along the way well now that shes called the clair i hope they bring her in safe my ship clay said anxiously so nate said youre what in your nineties a hundred dont look it do i amy posed a coquettish half curtsy with a betty boop bump at the end indeed it would have been a spry move for a woman in her nineties nate was really glad he was sitting down but he missed the sensation he would have had of needing to sit down your whole attraction was based on my age wasnt it she sat across from him you were working out your male menopause on the fantasy of my young body somehow you were going to try to recapture your youth once again youd feel like more than a footnote to humanity youd be virile and vital and relevant and all alpha male just because a younger and decidedly luscious i might add woman had chosen you right nuhuh nate said she was wrong right wow nate were you on the debate team at moose dirt u i mean your talent sasketchewan in the sticks he corrected so the age thing its a problem youre like a hundred my grandma isnt even a hundred and shes dead no im not really that old she grinned and reached across the table took his hand its okay nate im not amelia earhart youre not nate felt his lungs expand as if a steel band around his chest had broken hed been taking tiny yip breaths but now oxygen was returning to his brain funny he was pretty sure that none of the other women hed been with had been amelia earhart either but he didnt remember feeling quite so relieved about it before well i should have known i mean you dont look anything like the pictures no goggles i was just messin with you im her daughter ha stop it this isnt funny amy if youre trying to make a point youve made it yes youre an attractive young woman and maybe your youths a part of why im attracted to you but thats just biology you cant blame me for that i didnt make a move on you i didnt harass you when we were working together i treated you exactly as i would have treated any research assistant except maybe you got away with more because i liked you you cant ridicule me for responding to you sexually down here when you came on to me the rules had changed im not ridiculing you amelia earhart really is my mother stop it you want to meet her nate searched her face for signs of a grin or a tremble in her throat that might indicate the rise of an amy ha nothing there just that little bit of sweetness that she usually tried to hide so somehow living down here you havent aged your mother we age but not like on the surface i was born in im about the same number of years older than you than you were older than me a half hour ago kinda sorta you going to dump me its so hard to believe why after youve seen all this youve seen what the goo can do why is it so hard to believe that im sixtyfour well for one youre so immature shut up im young at heart but for a second there i was so sure we were doomed nate rubbed his temples trying to stretch them maybe to make his head bigger to hold the whole concept of amys being sixtyfour no its okay we just havent gotten to that yet were still doomed oh thank goodness nate said i was worried later after they had pushed the world away for a while made love and napped in each others arms amy made a move to start another round and nate awoke to an immediate and uncertain anxiety are we really doomed he asked oh goddamn it nate she was straddling him so she was able to get a good windup before thumping him hard in the chest with her fist thats just unfuckingprofessional nate thought about how the praying mantis female will sometimes bite off the males head during copulation and how the males body continues to mate until the act is finished sorry he said she rolled off him and stared up at dim strips of green luminescence on the ceiling its okay i didnt mean to bite your head off pardon yes were probably doomed were doomed for the same reason that i look the way i do that most of the goos look much younger than we really are turn a gene on you age turn it off you dont ive even seen some people down here who seem to get younger flip a switch pancreatic cancer at age twentytwo flip another you can smoke four packs a day and live to be a hundred if the goo thinks that the human race is a danger to it it just has to flip a switch pick a gene make a virus and the human race would blink out i hadnt really thought about it as a threat before my whole life ive worked for the goo service you know it takes care of us its the source he didnt know what to say did he need to actually take the colonels request for help seriously did he need to help find a way to kill this amazing creature in order to save his own species amy i dont know what to do two days ago i just wanted to get out of here now the colonel and you both said i was lucky to be alive has the goo killed people who were close to finding out about it honestly i dont know ive never seen it or heard of it happening but i we each just do our own part down here we dont ask a lot of questions not because were told not to or anything its just that you can live a long time without asking yourself big questions when your needs are looked after for the first time nate could see the experience of years in amys face marked not by wrinkles but by a shadow in her eyes im asking he said do i think the goo is ethically capable of killing the human race i guess i dont even know if the goo has ethics nate according to the colonel its just a vehicle for genes and were just vehicles for memes and nature says that a headon collision is inevitable what if its not this battle has supposedly gone on for millions of years and now the colonel wants to force an endgame what i do know is that youve got to talk him out of trying to kill it but hes your leader yeah but he didnt tell any of us about this i think hes doubting his own judgment so am i but you said that it could kill everyone on the planet at the flick of a switch yeah she rolled over and propped herself up on her elbow you hungry im hungry i could eat chapter thirtyfour necrophiliacs anonymous gooville chapter amy was carrying two stoppered porcelain bottles of beer when she entered the colonels chambers the ruler of gooville came sliding out of the pink wall as if it had given birth to him he extended his arms to hug her but instead of returning his embrace amy held up a beer i brought you a beer amy you know i dont really eat anymore i thought you might like a beer for old times sake why are you here i hadnt seen you since i got back from maui i thought youd want to debrief me or something ive talked to nathan quinn you have dont be cute amy i know whats going on between you two i really dont have any choice colonel i am cute its the burden i have to bear he doesnt know what you are does he drink your beer its getting warm why do you keep it so steamy in here anyway the colonel accepted the beer from her and took a long pull when he came up for air he stared at the beer bottle with a look of surprise as if it had just spoken to him my thats good thats really good id forgotten amy toasted him with her own bottle and took a drink colonel weve known each other a long time youve been like a father to me but you are out of touch im worried about you i think you need to come out of here occasionally like you used to walk around have some interaction with the people in town dont try to get in the way of what im doing amy what are you talking about im just worried about you the colonel looked at the beer bottle in his hand again as if it had just been teleported there then he looked back to amy with a little panic in his eyes nate didnt tell you then tell me what nate doesnt have anything to do with this you have lost touch the colonel nodded then leaned back into the wall of goo behind him it cradled him and formed a chaise longue which he sat down on as he rubbed his temples amy did you ever do anything for a purpose greater than your own ambition did you ever feel a duty to something beyond yourself you mean like persuading people that im something that im not to gain their trust so they could be kidnapped or killed in order to preserve my community yes i have some concept of the idea of serving the greater good i guess you do i guess you do forgive me perhaps i do spend too much time alone you think could you leave me now i do have to think so you want to be alone now thats what youre saying this is how youre going to address the problem of spending too much time alone go amy and please dont interfere with nate not yet what do you mean not yet theres a deposit on that bottle im not leaving without it then nate hes not a problem youre sure here the colonel forced a smile that looked much more like something menacing than an actual smile because i will tell him about you if i must the greater good amy said returning the forced smile with a real one good said the colonel draining the last of his beer come back and bring me another of these you got it amy said then she took the bottle from him and left the chamber thin line between genius and fullblown batshit she thought very thin line for two weeks the colonel didnt send for nate cielle nuñez had stopped by the third morning that amy was at nates apartment well you dont need me anymore cielle had said id just as soon get back to my ship anyway although it doesnt look like were going anywhere soon nate was disappointed that she hadnt been jealous hes afraid of the cupboards the fridge and the garbage disposal cielle told amy as if she were talking to the dog sitter and youll need to take him to get his clothes cleaned you know hes going to be terrified of the washing machines im right here nate said and im not afraid of the appliances im just cautious your mother will be thrilled for you two amy her ship should be back at base soon no shes not due in for another six weeks amy said not anymore the colonels called all the ships back to base all of them why cielle shrugged hes the colonel ours is not to question why well nate its been a pleasure really ill probably see you around youre in good hands she hugged nate quickly and started out the door cielle wait i want to ask you something if you dont mind she turned ask away when did your husbands yacht sink cielle raised an inquisitive eyebrow at amy its okay amy said he knows nineteen twentyseven nate in retrospect it was a blessing of sorts he died doing what he liked doing and two years later he would have been wiped out when the stock market crashed im not sure he would have survived that thanks im sorry dont be cal and i have a really good life cal cal from the ship you didnt tell me that hes my husband the colonel thought you might be more comfortable with a single woman to orient you women down here have never taken their husbands surname nate females run the show in a whale society amy explained you know as it should be cielle nuñez looked from amy to nate and smiled oh nate what have you gotten yourself into and then she snickered like a whaley boy and left she wanted you amy said she hides it really well but i could tell from then on they went out together every morning nate insisted that amy take him far into the catacombs during the day there they found goovilles underground farms tunnels where grains of wheat grew right on the walls no stalks others where you could pick tomatoes from twoinch stems that seemed to grow directly out of rock how does any of this ripen without photosynthesis nate asked handling an apricot that was growing not on a tree but on a broad stem like a mushroom dont know amy shrugged geothermal heat the colonel says the goo extends deep under the continent where it draws heat from the earth ill show you the kitchens where they prepare most of the food its all geothermal the oldtimers say that at first there was only seafood to eat but over the years the goo has provided more and different foods what are these chicken nuggets he plucked one from the ceiling a whaley boy working nearby whistled and clicked harshly he says not to pick them theyre not ripe nate tossed the nugget to the floor of the cave where a softballsize multilegged thing scurried out of a hatch retrieved it and scurried back into its trapdoor ive seen enough here nate said in the afternoon they did errands and shopping but still no one asked nate for any form of payment and hed stopped offering in the evening they usually had dinner in his apartment after they had shared two meals out at gooville cafés amy had insisted that they eat in youre studying them she said meaning the whaley boys no im not im just looking at them who are you kidding you have that look that researcher look that lostinyourtheories look you think i dont know that look i worked with you remember nate shrugged its what i do i study whales hed been trying to learn the whaley boys whistleandclick language emily had come by his apartment a couple of afternoons when amy was away and while he thought she might have come for amorous reasons he managed to channel her energies into lessons on whaleyspeak theyd become friends of sorts he hadnt mentioned the lessons to amy afraid that she might tease him about emily the way the whaleship crew had i observe i collect data and try to find meaning in it amy nodded thinking about it then said so if rescuing manatees and dolphins got you into the field why didnt you do something more active to help the animals veterinary medicine or something i always wonder ive thought about the people at greenpeace and sea shepherd putting themselves in harms way ramming whaling ships running zodiacs in front of harpoon guns to try to protect the animals ive wondered if that was the way to go and you thought you could do more as a scientist studying them no i thought that being a scientist was something that i could do theres a path to becoming a biologist an educational process there isnt for being a pirate no youre wrong there is a school for that i saw it on a matchbook when i was in maui im sure it said you could learn to be a pirate if you passed a simple test thats learn to draw a pirate whatever so you compromised did i i think what we what i do has value so do i im not saying that im just wondering you know now that youre dead do you feel your life was wasted im not dead amy jeez thats an awful thing to say you know effectively dead i mean your life being over jeepers does that make me a necrophiliac when we get out of here maybe ill have to go to a meeting or something do they have those amy im wondering if maybe i dont want to get out of here hed been thinking about it a lot life here really wasnt bad and since hed been looking for a way out on their daily excursions only to be reminded that hed have to go through the miles of pressure locks only to emerge six hundred feet below the sea maybe he and amy could make a future together the whole gooville ecosystem would certainly keep him interested hi my names amy and i hump the dead maybe if i can talk the colonel out of his plan i can stay here with you you know adapt i cant imagine that theyd get up at a meeting and say hi my names soandso and i like to bone the dead its sort of crude although strangely appropriate youre not listening to me amy yes i am were not staying here ill find a way out but we cant stay you have to convince the colonel not to try to hurt the goo but then were leaving as soon as possible nate was a little shocked at how adamant she was she seemed to be staring at nothing concentrating thinking about something she didnt want to share and she didnt seem happy about but then she brightened hey youre going to get to meet my mother a week later it happened well you always said that the jazz of what you do was knowing something that no one else in the world knows amy said you jazzed she took his arm and draped it around her neck as they walked they had just left the gooville apartment of amelia earhart she looks good doesnt she amy asked amelia was a beautiful gracious woman and after sixtyseven years in gooville the aviatrix didnt look a day over fifty shed been just under forty when she disappeared in in her presence nate had felt as if he were fifteen again out on his first date stuttering and stumbling and blushing blushing for christs sake when amy mentioned that shed been spending nights at his place amelia made nate sit next to her on the couch and took his hand as she spoke to him nathan i hope what im about to say to you doesnt sound racist because its not but i want to put your mind at ease i have had a very long time to get used to the idea of my daughters being a sexually active adult and frankly if after all these years you are the one that she has chosen to fall in love with which appears to be the case i can only tell you how relieved i am that you are of the human species so please relax nate had shot a look to amy she shrugged every girl has her adventurous period thank you nate said to amelia earhart now out on the street to amy he said i shouldnt have asked how the flight was shes still a little sensitive about that even after all these years my dad was her navigator he didnt survive the crash but you said you were born in how could that be if your father died in robust sperms three years thats really robust she punched his arm i was rounding up give me a break nate im old you never grilled the old broad for accuracy like this i wasnt sleeping with the old broad but you wanted to didnt you admit it you were hot to get into her muumuu stop nate glanced at some whaleyboy males who were hanging out in front of the bakery they always seemed to be there doing a synchronized display wave with their willies and he was about to defend himself with a comment about amys past but then he decided that there was just no need to watch that little brain movie let alone use it as some kind of weapon against what was essentially just amystyle teasing one of the things he found he adored about her as soon as hed allowed himself to admit that he could adore someone again the whaley boys snickered at him as they passed you guys are all just big squeaky bath toys nate said under his breath knowing they could hear him anyway nate had been insulting them every time he and amy went by for a week or so just to irritate them maybe amy was rubbing off on him the whaley boys blew a collective sputtering raspberry sentient you guys cant even spell sentient nate whispered and then the reward he loved watching creatures with four digits try to flip him the middle finger yeah im the immature one amy said life is good nate thought for the first time in as long as he could remember he was happy kinda in the morning a brace of whaley boys came to take him to the colonel amy wasnt even there to kiss him goodbye chapter thirtyfive yeah but you cant dance to it the colonel was standing in the middle of the motherofpearl amphitheater when the whaley boys led nate in you two go on now the colonel said to the whaley boys nate can find his way back you came out of your lair nate said the colonel looked older more drawn than when nate had seen him before i dont want to be in contact with the goo for what im going to tell you i thought it didnt get information that way nate said the colonel ignored him i was hoping you would have had a brainstorm to solve my problem nate but you havent have you im working on it its more complex youve been distracted im disappointed but i understand shes a piece of work isnt she and i mean that in the best sense of the word never forget that i chose to send her to you nate wondered how much the colonel knew about them and how he knew it reports from the whaley boys from the goo itself through osmosis or some extended nervous system distraction has nothing to do with it ive thought a lot about your problem and im not sure i agree with you what makes you think the goo is going to destroy humanity its a matter of time thats all i need you to carry a message for me nate youll be responsible for saving the human race that should go some measure toward consoling you colonel is there any chance you can be more direct less cryptic and tell me for once what the hell youre talking about i want you to go to the us navy they need to know about the threat of the goo one wellplaced nuclear torpedo should do it its deep enough that they shouldnt have any problem justifying it to other countries there wont be any fallout theyre just going to need someone credible to convince them of the threat you what about the people down here i thought you wanted to save them im afraid theyre going to be a necessary sacrifice nate what are five thousand or so people most of whom have lived longer than they would have on the surface compared with the whole human race six billion you crazy bastard im not going to try to convince the navy to nuke five thousand people and all the whaley boys as well and youre more deluded than i thought if you think theyd do it on my word oh i dont expect that i expect theyll send down their own research team to confirm what you tell them but when they get here ill see to it that they get the message that the goo is a threat in any case youll survive i think youre wrong about the goo finding us dangerous and even if you were right what if it just decides to wait us out on the goos time scale it can just take a nap until were extinct im not doing it im sorry you feel that way nate i guess ill have to find another way nate suddenly realized that hed blown it his chance to escape once he was outside gooville there would have been nothing to force him to do what the colonel wanted or maybe there would be right then he wanted very badly to see amy look colonel maybe i can do something couldnt you just evacuate gooville drop all the people on an island let the whaley boys find somewhere else to live i mean if i reveal the goo to the world its all sort of going to be out of the bag anyway i mean im sorry nate i dont believe you ill take care of it evacuation wouldnt make any difference to the people here anyway and the whaley boys shouldnt exist in the first place theyre an abomination an abomination thats not the scientist i knew talking oh i admit that they are fabulous creatures but they would have never evolved naturally they are a product of this war and their purpose has been served as has mine as has yours im sorry we didnt see eye to eye on this go now just like that this crazy bastard was going to plan b and nate had no idea how to stop him maybe that was what he was really brought here for maybe the colonel was like someone who makes a suicide attempt as a cry for help rather than an earnest attempt to end his life and nate had missed it he started to back away from the colonel desperately trying to think of something he could say to change the situation but nothing was coming to him when he reached the passageway the colonel called out to him from the steps by the giant iris nate i promised you and you deserve to know nate turned and came a few steps back into the room the colonel smiled a sad smile resolved its a prayer nate the humpback song is a prayer to the source to their god the song is in praise of and in thanks to the goo nate considered it a lifes work contemplating a question and this was the answer no way why only male singers then well theyre males theyre praying for sex too arent they the females choose the mates they dont need to ask theres no way to prove that nate said and no one to prove it to nate not down here but its the truth whale song was the first culture the first art on this planet and like most of human art it celebrates that which is greater than the artist and the goo likes it nate it likes it i dont believe it theres no evolutionary pressure for it to be prayer its a meme nate not a gene the song is learned behavior not passed by birth it has its own agenda to be replicated imitated and it was reinforced have you ever seen a starved humpback nate nate thought about it hed seen sick animals and injured animals but hed never seen a starved humpback nor had he ever heard of one the colonel must have seen something in nates reaction theres your reinforcement the goo looks after them nate it likes the song i wouldnt be surprised if all of whale evolution size for instance was accelerated by the goo we should have never started killing them we wouldnt be at this juncture if we hadnt killed them but weve stopped was all that nate could think to say too late the colonel said with a sigh our mistake was getting the goos attention now it has to end the gene has had its three and a half billion years as the driving force of life i suppose now the meme will have its turn you and i will never know goodbye nate the iris opened and the colonel walked into the goo nate ran all the way home not sure how he had navigated through the labyrinth of tunnels but found his way without having to backtrack amy wasnt at his apartment his pulse was throbbing in his temples as he approached the buzzy bugwinged speaky thing to try to call her but he decided instead to go directly to her on foot he checked at her place and then at her mothers then at every place theyd ever been together not only was amy gone but no one had seen her mother either nate slept fitfully tortured by the notion of what the colonel might have done to amy because of his own stubbornness in the morning he went searching for her again asking everyone he encountered including the whaley boys by the bakery but no one had seen her on the second day he went back through the corridors to the colonels motherofpearl amphitheater and pounded on the giant black iris until his fists were bruised there was no response but a dull thud that echoed in the huge empty chamber ill do what you want ryder nate screamed dont hurt her you crazy fuck ill do what you want ill bring the navy down on this place and sterilize it if thats what you want just give her back when at last he gave up he turned and slid down the iris facing the amphitheater there were six killerwhalecolored whaley boys standing in the passageway opposite him watching they werent grinning or snickering for once just watching him the largest of them a female let loose a quick whistle and they crossed the amphitheater walking in a crescentshaped hunting formation toward him short of being a professional surfer or a bong test pilot for the rastafarian air force kona thought he had found the perfect job he sat in a comfortable chair watching sound spectrograms scroll across one computer monitor while on another a program picked out the digital sequence in the subsonic signal and broke it into text all kona had to do was watch for something meaningful to come across the screen strange thing was he really had started to learn about spectrographs and waveforms and all manner of whale behavior and he was meeting the day feeling as if he was really doing something he ran his hand over his scalp and shuddered as he read the nonsense text that was scrolling across the window auntie clair had bought him four forties of old english malt liquor then waited until hed drunk them before persuading him to let her cut his dreads down so they matched on both sides because his true natural state should be one of balance she said she was tricky auntie clair the problem was in jail his dreads had been almost completely torn off on one side so by the time she finished evening things out he was pretty much bald out of deference to his religious beliefs to allow him a reservoir for his abundant strength in jah mon clair had left him a single dread anchored low on the back of his head which made it look as if a fat worm was exiting his skull after a hearty meal of brain cells in ganja sauce and speaking of the sacred herb kona was just on the verge of sparking up a bubbling smoky scuba snack of the dankest and skunkingish nugs when the text scrolling across the screen ceased being nonsense and started being important he took a quick sip of bong water to steady his nerves placed the sacred vessel on the floor at his feet then hit the key that sent the streaming text to the printer he stood and waited bouncing on the balls of his feet for the printer to expectorate three sheets of text then snatched the pages and dashed out the door to clays cabin i must be out of my mind clay said his suitcase was on the bed and he was taking clothes out of the drawers and putting them into the case while clair was taking clothes out of the case grouping them by a precise system he would never understand and replacing them in the suitcase so that he would never find anything until he returned home and she helped him unpack they had done this a lot i must be nuts clay said i cant just go wandering around the oceans randomly looking for a lost friend ill look like that little bird in the book the one that walks around asking everyone are you my mother sartres being and nothingness clair offered right thats the one its ridiculous to even leave port until we have something to go on steaming around burning up fifty gallons of fuel an hour the old broad may have money stashed but she doesnt have that kind of money well maybe something will turn up in the whale calls i hope libby and margaret have a lot of sonic data streaming in from newport but its still like looking for a needle in a haystack clair she saw guys climbing into a whale so baby whats the worst that happens you go to sea and do your best to find nate and you fail how many people ever did their best at anything you can always sell the ship later where is it now anyway just then the screen door fired back on its hinges and smacked against the outside wall with the report of a rifle shot kona came tumbling through the door waving pages of copy paper as if they were white flags and he was surrendering to everyone in the general maui area bwana clay kona threw the pages down on clays suitcase its the snowy biscuit clay picked up the pages looked at them quickly and handed one to clair over and over the message was repeated swclay u r not nutsamy clay looked at kona this was imbedded in the whale song yah mon blue whale i think just came in go back and see if theres more and find the big world map its in the storeroom somewhere aye aye said kona who had begun to speak much more nautically since clay had purchased the ship making his bid to go along on the voyage to search for nate he ran back to the office you think its from amy clair said i think its either from amy or from someone who knows everything about what were doing which means it would have to be someone amy talked to what are the numbers a longitude and a latitude ill have to look at the map but its somewhere in the south pacific i know its a longitude and a latitude clay but whats the minus six hundred and some its where pilots usually express altitude but its a minus yep clay snatched the phone off of his night table and dialed the old broad as clair looked quizzically at him equipment change he whispered to clair covering the receiver with his hand hello elizabeth yes things are going really well yes theyve picked up considerably yes look i hate to ask this i know youve done so much but i may need one other little thing before we go to look for nate and your james clair shook her head at clays blatant playing of the missinghusbandshovedupawhalesbum card yes well it may be a little expensive clay continued but im going to need a submarine no a small submarine will be fine if you want it to be yellow elizabeth well paint it yellow after fifteen minutes of cajoling and consoling the old broad making calls to libby quinn and the ship broker in singapore who offered him a quantity discount if he bought more than three ships in one month clay stood over a world map that was roughly the size of a pingpong table which kona had spread out over the office floor pinning the corners down with coffee cups its right there off the coast of chile clair said she taught fourthgraders and therefore basic world geography so she could read a map like nobodys business kona placed a bottle cap on the spot where clair was pointing well need nautical charts and the ships gps to be exact but basically yep thats where it is he looked at kona nothing else since that message same thing for five minutes then just normal whale gibberish you think the snowy biscuit is with nate i think she knew me well enough to know that id be thinking i was crazy to be looking i also think that even if i believe the old broads story about her husband that doesnt explain how amy was able to stay down for an hour on fifteen minutes worth of air so there was something going on with her that could be connected to this weirdness she obviously knows more than we know but most important we have nowhere else to look kona looked at clair as if maybe she would answer his question she nodded and he resumed drinking his beer clay got down on his hands and knees on the map the ship broker says theres a deepwater threeman sub here in chuuk micronesia thats about to finish up with some filming theyre doing of deep shipwrecks kona put a bottle cap on the atoll of chuuk micronesia the owners will let me lease it for up to two months but then a research team has it reserved for a deepwater survey in the indian ocean the clair is here just north of samoa clay pointed kona put a third bottle cap just north of samoa and did his best to drink off that beer while balancing the other two that hed opened to get the caps so the clair can probably be in chuuk in three days ill fly in and meet them pick up the sub and then we can probably steam to these coordinates in four or five days if we cruise at top speed clay said now were here we cant be we cant be there said kona why not out of beers so you get to that spot then what clair asked then i get in a submarine and see what there is to see six hundred and twentythree feet down so were sure its feet not meters no im not sure well i just want you to know that i am not comfortable with you doing this sort of thing clay but ive always done this sort of thing i sort of do this sort of thing for a living so whats your point clair asked chapter thirtysix black and white and red all over once off the coast of california nate had followed a pod of killer whales as they attacked a mother gray whale and her calf they first approached in formation to separate the calf from the mother and then as one group broke from the pod to keep the mother busy the others took turns leaping upon the calfs back to drown it even as the mother thrashed her great tail and circled back trying to protect her calf the whole hunt had taken more than six hours and when it ended finally the killer whales took turns hitting the exhausted calf keeping in a perfect formation even as they ripped great chunks of flesh from its stillliving body now in the amphitheater as the killer whaley boys approached their teeth flashing the breath from their blowholes puffing like steam engines the biologist thought that he was probably experiencing exactly what that graywhale calf had during that gruesome hunt except of course that nate was wearing sneakers and gray whales almost never did it was a big room he had space to move he just had to get around them his sneakers squeaked on the floor as he came down the steps faked right then went left at a full sprint the whaley boys while amazingly agile in the water were somewhat clumsy on land half of them fell for the fake so badly that theyd need a postcard to tell them how it all came out they stooged into a whaley pile near the steps the remaining three pursuers tried to fan out into a new formation the alpha female coming the closest to getting between nate and the exit nate was running in a wide arc around the amphitheater now and by virtue of sheer speed he could tell hed beat at least two of the remaining killers but the alpha female was going to intersect with him before he got clear she probably weighed three times what he did so there was no going though her with a vicious body check maybe if hed been on skates hed have tried it pit his pure innate canadian skating force against her paltry cetacean hunting instinct and drive that bitch to the mother of pearl but there were no skates no ice so at the very last second as the female was about to slam him in a bonebreaking crunch against one of the benches that lined the walls nate pulled a spin fake a move that was much more boitano than gretzky but nevertheless sent the big female tumbling over a bench in a tangle of blackandwhite and ivory like a flaccid piano botching the vaulting horse nate highstepped the last twenty yards to the door thinking yeah three million years of walking upright not for nothing rookie meat about the third step into his jubilation nate heard the sound of a great expulsion of air from his right then a wet splat suddenly he saw his sneakers waving before his face he felt the freedom of weightlessness the exhilaration of flight and then it was all gone as he slammed to the floor knocking the wind out of himself he slid to a stop in the huge loogie of whale spit that one of the trailing males had expectorated at his feet had he been able to breathe he might have called a foul but instead he struggled to get to his feet as the two males closed on him showing daggertoothed grins as they approached oh my god theyre going to eat me he thought but then he saw that they both had unsheathed their long pink penises and were leading with a sort of a pelvic thrust oh my god theyre going to fuck me he thought but when they got to him one picked him up by the arms and bent him over forward and he felt the great teeth scraping his scalp as his head slipped into the whaley boys mouth no theyre definitely going to eat me nate thought and in that suspension of time right before the final crunch amid the slow motion of an infinite last moment clarity came to him even as he screamed and he thought this is probably not going to go as well as the last time i was eaten theres probably not going to be a girl at the end of this one and then the female whistled shrilly and the male stopped biting down just as his teeth were starting to cut into nates cheeks the biting male pulled back and apologetically wiped saliva and blood from nates face then propped him up and fluffed him a little as if to show that he was good as new nate was still being held fast by the other male but the biter was grinning sheepishly at the alpha female and making a squeaking noise that nate even with his limited understanding of whaleyspeak understood as meaning oops a half hour later they threw him into his apartment and the alpha female grinned at him as she tore the stainlesssteel doorknob out of the wall the wall bled for a while after she left then clotted over and rapidly began to heal nate stumbled into his bathroom and looked at himself in the mirror there were bloody gashes down his forehead and cheeks in another place and time he realized he would have gone to the emergency room to get stitched up his hair was matted with blood and he could feel at least four deep dents in his scalp where the whaley boys teeth had broken the skin there was a large knot at the back of his head where hed hit the floor when he fell and evidently hed hit an elbow too because every time he bent his right arm a sharp biting pain shot all the way down to his fingertips he pulled off his bloodstained clothes and climbed into the shower then ignoring the strange fixtures that usually gave him pause he leaned against the shower walls and let the water run over him until the bloody crust was gone from his hair and his fingers had shriveled with the moisture he dried himself then collapsed into his bed wishing for a last time before he fell asleep that amy was there safe next to him he slept deeply and dreamed of a time when all the oceans were filled with a single living organism wrapped like a cocoon around a single huge land mass and in his dream he could feel the texture of every shore as if it were pressed against his skin nate awoke in the early hours before light came up in the grotto he went into his living room and sat in the dark by the big oval picture window that looked out over the street and ultimately the gooville harbor there were shapes out there moving in the dark every now and then hed catch the reflection of some dim light on a whaley boys skin but mostly he could tell they were out there by the sonar clicks that echoed around the grotto and by the low trilling whistles of whaleyboy conversation after an hour sitting there in the dark he padded to the door and tried to open it there was nothing but a smooth scar where the doorknob had been the seal around the door was so tight it might have been part of the walls that framed it in trying to work his fingers into the doorjamb he realized that his elbow wasnt grating as it had been when he went to bed he reached up to touch the gashes across his forehead and felt the scab flake away as easily and painlessly as dry skin he immediately went to the bathroom and looked at himself in the mirror under the bright yellow bioluminescence the gashes were healed completely healed he brushed away the dried blood that had seeped after his shower to find new healthy skin it was the same with the dents in his scalp and the great goose egg at the base of his skull he didnt even have a sore spot he returned to the living room fell into the chair by the window and watched the light come up in the grotto outside there was a lot of movement in the street and the harbor and watching it nate started to feel sick to his stomach despite his miraculous healing all the movement outside was that of whaley boys there wasnt a single human out there anywhere for two days he didnt see any other humans in gooville and even when he had screwed up his courage to use the buzzy bugwinged speaky thing on the wall he realized that he had no idea how to make it connect by noon on the third day he decided that he had to get out of the apartment not only couldnt he find amy or do anything else while in here but he was rapidly running out of food he reasoned that the best time to make a break for it was in the middle of the day when it seemed that the number of whaley boys out on the street was sparsest because so many of them went down to the water at that time to swim he dressed in long pants and sleeves for protection then made the first attempt at the window he tore one of the bone chairs from the floor in the kitchen wiggling it first as if loosening a baby tooth he cast the chair at the center of the window with all his strength preparing as he did to make the tenfoot leap to the street when it went though but it didnt it bounced back into the room next he looked for something sharp to try to puncture the window but the only thing he could come up with were shards of the mirror in the bathroom and although the mirror spiderwebbed when he struck it his fist wrapped in a towel the shards stayed adhered to the bathroom wall so all hed really done was create a shiny mosaic finally frustrated after three hours of ineffective attacks on the big window he decided to hit it with the heaviest thing in the apartment his body he backed into the bedroom sped through the living room leaped into the air about halfway across curled into a ball and braced for impact the window bulged out about three feet until it appeared to the whaley boys outside that someone inside was trying to blow a giant bubble and then it sprang back trampolining nate across the room into the far wall at the bottom of the wall someone had installed a couch for just such an emergency and nate slid neatly into it with his newly flattened side down well that was just stupid he said aloud boy that was stupid cielle nuñez said she came into the living room and sat in a chair across from where nate was piled onto the couch you want to tell me what in the hell you started how did you get in the knob is gone not on the outside come on nate what did you do every human in gooville has been locked down for the last three days if i werent the captain of a whale ship i wouldnt have been able to come here either i didnt do anything cielle honestly wheres amy no one knows believe me that was the first place they went who who do you think the whaley boys theyve taken over everything humans arent even allowed near the ships ever since some of them heard you yelling about bringing the navy down here i was he has amy cielle i was just trying to get her back him the colonel why would he take amy shes one of the few whove ever even seen him shes a favorite yeah well no one is his favorite now right then nate made a decision he wasnt going to get out of this place on his own and the only person he could even consider an ally was sitting right there in front of him cielle the reason the colonel called your ships back the reason no one is allowed to leave the harbor is that he wants you all here when the place comes down hes got some plan to get the us navy or somebodys navy to attack gooville with a nuclear torpedo he thinks that the goo is going to destroy the human race if he doesnt destroy it first he wanted me to go to the navy he thought i could convince them of the threat because of my scientific credibility but i said no thats when he took amy so all that yelling i heard you doing in the amphitheater that wasnt you talking about bringing the navy here that was just you trying to get amy back yes hes a loon cielle i dont have any interest in bringing this place down he thinks that theres some grand war going on between memes and genes and that humans and the goo are on opposite sides of it the whaleship captain stood and nodded as if confirming something to herself okay then thats what i needed to know thats why he sent me here ill try to get them to send you some food what help me get out of here nate suddenly had a very bad feeling about this whole exchange im sorry nate they have cal the whaley boys have him you know how that feels they told me i had to find out if you were plotting against the colonel thank you for telling me i think theyll let him go now she walked to the door and nate followed her get me out of here cielle at least nate theres nowhere to go the only way out of here is a whale ship and whaleyboy pilots are the only ones who can run them theyve been on notice not to let you on since we got here right now i couldnt leave if i wanted to she pounded on the door open the door clicked open and two allblack whaley boys stood outside waiting they caught nate by the shoulders and threw him back into the apartment as he tried to rush by them my own crew nate cielle said see what youve done hes going to kill you all cielle dont you see that hes crazy i dont believe you nate i think youre the crazy one the door slammed shut back at papa lani clay was doing a final check on the equipment he was taking with him to meet his new ship diving and camera equipment lay spread out across the office floor kona was going through the checklist on the clipboard with a felttip pen so you tink the snowy biscuit going to be there im going i just wish that we could answer her tell her im on my way you mean like put the digital in the whale sound and send it yeah i know we cant do it did you find a canister of soda lime for the rebreathers co scrubbers i can do that kona held up the canister clay was looking for and checked it off the list you can i been looking at it long time she not that hard to put that message back in the call but how you going to send it you need some gigrandious big speakers under the water mon we dont have nothing like dat clay stopped his inventory and pulled konas clipboard down so he could see his eyes you can put a message into the waveform so it would come out the same way weve been taking it out kona nodded show me clay said he went to the computer kona took the chair and pulled up a lowfrequency waveform that looked like a jagged comb and then he hit a button that took a small section and expanded it which smoothed out the jags see this part here we know this a letter b right we just cut it and paste with other letters make a goofy whale call i got the all the letters but a q and a z figured dont explain just do it here clay scribbled a short message in the margin of konas checklist then play it for me i can play but you wont hear it its subsonic brah like i say you going need some thumpin speakers to send it you know where we can steal some we might not have to steal them while kona pieced together the message clay grabbed the phone off his desk and dialed cliff hyland the biologist answered on the second ring cliff clay demodocus i need a favor from you that big sonar rig of yours will it broadcast subsonic frequencies good i need you to take us out on your boat tonight with your rig kona looked at clay clay grinned and raised his eyebrows no it has to be tonight im flying out for chuuk in the morning if i need to send out a signal what can i plug in to it tape disk recorder what anything with a preamp clay covered the receiver with his hand can you put it on an audio disk no problems kona said no problem clay said into the phone well meet you at the harbor at ten okay clay waited he was listening pacing in a little circle behind the surfer yeah well we were just talking about that cliff and we figured that if you said no wed just have to steal your boat and your rig i could probably figure out how the rig works right there was another pause and clay held the phone away from his ear kona could hear an irritated voice coming out of the earpiece because were friends cliff thats why id tell you in advance that i was going to steal your boat jeez you think id just steal it like some stranger all right then well see you at ten oclock he hung up the phone okay kid get this right we have to have it ready and to the harbor by ten but what you gonna do the bad guys get it even if they do only amy will know what it means clay said cool runnings brah kona was concentrating on putting the message together his tongue curled out the corner of his mouth as an antenna for focus clay leaned over his shoulder and watched the waveform come together on the screen how did you figure this out kid i mean it doesnt seem like you hows a man supposed to work his science dub wid you yammerin like a rummedup monkey sorry clay said making a mental note to give the kid a raise if any of this actually worked chapter thirtyseven a whaley death nate was five more days alone in the apartment before they came for him it started at dawn on the sixth day when he noticed a group of whaley boys gathering around below his window there had been humans out on the streets since the day hed told cielle about the colonels plan but gooville hadnt quite returned to normal given that normal in gooville was still extraordinarily weird to begin with he could tell that the humans and whaley boys alike were on edge today there were no humans in the streets and all the whaley boys were emitting a shrill call that he was sure hed heard before but strangely enough it hadnt been in the city under the sea hearing the hunting call in these circumstances made him shudder he watch them gather rubbing up against one another as if to strengthen the bond among them milling around in small walking pods as if working off nervous energy each of them raising his head occasionally and letting go the hunting call flashing teeth jaws snapping like bear traps he knew they were coming nate was dressed and waiting for them when they came through the door four of them took him lifted him in the air by his legs and shoulders and carried him over their heads down the stairs to the street then on into the passageways the whole crowd moved into the passageways their calls becoming more frequent and deafeningly shrill in the smaller confines even as his captors long fingers dug into his flesh a calm resolve came over nate an almost trancelike state the acceptance that it was all going to be over soon he looked to either side only to have mouthfuls of teeth snarl at him and even among the frenzy here and there he heard the characteristic hissing snicker of a whaleyboy laugh well they do know how to have a good time he thought he soon recognized the path they were taking him down he could hear the calls of hundreds of them echoing through the caverns from the motherofpearl amphitheater maybe the entire whaleyboy population was waiting there as they entered the amphitheater and the calls reached a crescendo nate stretched his neck and saw two big killerwhalecolored females holding the colonel in the middle of the floor the whaley boys holding nate lowered him to his feet and then two of them pulled him back against the benches to watch with the others one of the big females holding the colonel shrieked a long high call and the crowd calmed down not quite silent but the hunting calls stopped the colonels eyes were wide and nate wouldnt have been surprised if the old man had started to bark and foam at the mouth when things quieted down enough for him to be heard he started shouting the big female who was holding him clamped a hand over his mouth nate could see the colonel fighting for breath and he struggled against his own captors in empathy then the female started to speak in their whistling clicking language and the crowd stopped even snickering their eyes bulged and they turned their heads to the side to better hear her nate couldnt understand much of what she was saying but you didnt have to know the language to understand what she was doing she was listing the colonels crimes and pronouncing a sentence it was no small irony nate thought that the whaley boys who saw to justice were colored like the killer whales the most intelligent most organized most glorious and horrible of all the marine mammals the only animal other than man that had exhibited both cruelty and mercy for one was not possible without potential for the other maybe memes were triumphing over genes after all when she finished speaking she handed the colonels arm to the other female so that he was bent over forward his hands held together high behind him then the female let out another extended shrill call and the whole ceiling of the amphitheater dimmed until it was completely dark when she finished her call the light came back up again the colonel was screaming at the top of his lungs random curses and mad pronouncements calling the whaley boys abominations monsters freaks railing like some mad prophet his brain fried by gods fingerprint but when the light was full again he caught nates eye just for a second and he was quiet there was something there the depth and wisdom that nate had once known the man to possess or maybe it was just sadness but before nate could decide the big female bent over and bit off the colonels head nate felt himself start to pass out his vision tunneled down to a pinpoint and he fought to stay conscious to concentrate on his breathing which he realized had stopped momentarily his vision came back as did his breath harsh and panicked through his gritted teeth as he watched the killer spit the head across the amphitheater to a group of whaley kids who picked it up and tore at it with their teeth then the female started tearing great chunks of meat out of the colonels body with her teeth even as it twitched in the hands of her cohort throwing the chunks to the crowd who shrilled the hunting calls even more frantically than before nate couldnt tell how long it went on but when it was finally done and the colonel was gone there was a large red circle in the middle of the amphitheater floor and all around him he saw bloody teeth flashing in whaley grins even the two whaley boys who held nates arms had partaken in the communion grabbing chunks of meat and eating them with their free hands one had hissed and sprayed blood in nates face then they dragged nate to the middle of the amphitheater he felt faint the pulse banging away in his ears drowning out all other sound everywhere he looked he saw bloody teeth and bulging eyes but he felt strangely detached as the big female began another oration he remembered a thought hed had right after the humpback whale had eaten him it came through to him like a malicious déjà vu what an incredibly stupid way to die then there was another long whistling call and nate closed his eyes waiting for the death blow but it didnt come the crowd had gone quiet again he squinted through one eyelid almost regretful that the moment had been delayed and he saw teeth before him but not the bloody teeth of the killers the shrill whistle went on and on made by the mottled blue whaleyboy female that had come out of the passageway and was striding across the amphitheater toward nate at her side was a very determined petite brunette with unnatural maroon highlights wearing hiking shorts and a tank top the whaley boys holding nate seemed confused the female who had killed the colonel was looking for some sort of guidance from the one holding nate when amy pulled the stun gun from her pocket and blasted her in the chest knocking her back five feet to convulse on the bloody floor let him go amy commanded the one who was holding nate and for some reason maybe just because it sounded so definitive she let go of nates arms and he fell at which time amy pulled up a second stun gun and pressed it to the big killers chest knocking her to the floor to twitch with her companion through it all emily had continued to whistle you okay amy asked nate he looked around at the situation not sure at all if he was okay but he nodded okay em amy said and emily stopped whistling before the crowd could react or a murmur of whaleyspeak start amy shouted hey shut up and they did nate didnt do anything she continued the whole thing was the colonels idea and none of us knew anything about it he brought nate here to help him destroy our city and nate said no thats all you need to know you all know me this is my home too you know me i wouldnt lie to you just then the first big female started to recover and amy leaped in front of nate to stand over the killer you get up bitch ill knock you on your ass again your choice the female froze oh fuck it amy said and she zapped the big female on the nose with both stun guns at once then wheeled on the other one who was getting up but quickly dropped and played dead under amys gaze good amy said so we clear amy shouted to the crowd there was whaleyspeak murmuring and amy screamed are we fucking clear people yeah clear came a dozen little mashedelf voices in english sure sure sure you know it said one little voice clear as a window came another just kidding said an elfonhelium voice good amy said lets go nate nate was still trying to find his feet his knees had gone a little rubbery when he thought his head was going to be bitten off emily caught him by the arm and steadied him amy started to lead them out of the amphitheater then stopped just a second she went back to where the lead killer female was just climbing to her feet and zapped her in the chest with the stun gun which knocked her flat on her back again as amy strutted past nate and emily she said okay now we can go where are we going nate asked em says you slept with her nate looked at emily who grinned big and toothy and snickered yeah slept just slept thats all tell her emily emily whistled actually a tune this time and rolled her eyes really nate said i know amy said oh nate heard squeaks coming from behind them in the corridor wasnt that a little risky taking on a thousand whaley boys with a couple of stun guns i love these things amy said clicking the buttons to make miniature blue lightning arc across the contacts no i didnt take on a thousand whaley boys i took on one an alpha female know what that makes me she smiled and then without even breaking stride threw her arms around his neck and kissed him and never forget it i wont then that last weeks anxiety about losing her came tumbling back over him hey where did you go i thought the colonel had taken you i went out on my mothers ship to send a message what message i was calling our ride all the whaley boys had been put on notice no pilot was going to take his ship out of here with you on board still wont but i could go so i went out with my mother to pick up some supplies and i called a ride what emily cant pilot a ship uhuh squeaked emily only pilots can pilot a ship duh anyway amy checked her watch your ride should be in the harbor soon i have to go by my place and grab something i want to take an hour later they stood at the waters edge in the harbor and amy was checking her watch again i am so pissed she said tapping her foot frantically it seemed as if every thirty seconds they had been cornered by some human resident of gooville and amy had to tell the story again emily was the only one of the whaley boys other than the crew of amys mothers ship that was still in the grotto you think theyll revolt hurt humans nate asked no theyll be fine that was a first its not every day you find out that your messiah is plotting to kill you give em a day or two to get over the embarrassment everything will be back to normal i guess its just as well that were getting out of here you dont want to face those two females you zapped bring it on amy said patting the pockets of her shorts besides im sort of special here nate i dont want to sound egotistical but they really all do know me know who i am what i am no one will bother me just then nate spotted a light coming from deep in the mirrorcalm water thats him amy said him clay coming to take you home me you mean us em can i get a minute amy said kay said emily skulking away from the shore toward town when emily was out of hearing range amy put her arms around nate and leaned back to look at him i cant go with you nate im staying what do you mean why i cant go theres something about me you dont know something i should have told you before but i thought you wouldnt well you know i thought you wouldnt love me please amy please dont tell me youre a lesbian because ive been through that once and i dont think i could survive it again please no nothing like that its about my parents well my father really the navigator uh no not really actually nate this is my father she pulled a small specimen jar out of her pocket and held it up there was a pink jellylike substance in it that looks like it is nate its the goo my mother was never intimate with her navigator or with anyone in the first three years she was here but one morning she woke up pregnant and youre sure it was the goo not just that she had way too many maitais at the gooville cabana club she knows it and i know it nate im sort of not normal you feel normal he pulled her closer im not for one thing i dont just look a lot younger than i really am but im also a lot stronger than i look especially as a swimmer remember that day i found the humpback ship by sound i really can hear directional sound underwater and my muscle tissue is different it stores oxygen the way a whales tissue does i can stay underwater without breathing for over an hour longer if i dont exert myself im the only one like me nate im not really you know human nate listened trying to weigh what it really meant in the bigger picture but he couldnt think of anything except that he wanted her to go with him wanted her to be with him no matter what she said she was i dont care amy it doesnt matter look i got over all this he gestured to all that and the fact that youre sixtyfour years old and your mother is a famous dead aviatrix as long as you dont start liking girls ill be fine thats not the point nate i cant leave here not for long anyway none of us can even the ones who werent born here the goo becomes part of you it takes care of you but you become attached to it almost literally like an addiction it gets in your tissues by contact thats how my mother had me ive been gone a lot already this year if i left now or if i left for longer that a few months at a time id get sick id probably die at that moment a yellow research submersible bubbled up to the surface of the lagoon a dozen headlights blazing into the grotto around a great plexiglas bubble in the front thats it then ill stay i dont mind amy ill stay here we can live here i could spend a lifetime learning about this place the goo you cant do that either it will become part of you too if you stay too long you wont be able to leave either you had to have noticed that first night we got drunk together how fast you recovered from the hangover nate thought about how quickly his wounds had healed too weeks maybe months of healing overnight there was no other explanation he thought about spending his life with only fleeting glimpses of sunlight and he said i dont care ill stay no you wont i wont let you you have things to do she shoved the specimen jar in his pocket then kissed him hard he kissed her back for a long time the hatch at the top of the dry exit tower on the sub opened and clay popped up to see nate and amy for the first time since theyd both disappeared well thats unprofessional clay said amy broke the kiss and whispered you go take that with you she patted his pocket then she turned to clay as she checked her watch again youre late hey missy i set a time when id be at the coordinates you sent six hundred and twentythree feet below sea level and i was there you didnt mention that i had another mile of submarine cave with some of the scariestlooking rock formations ive ever seen he glanced at nate they looked alive they are alive amy said are we close to the surface the pressure is ill explain on the way nate said wed better go nate stepped onto the sub as clay slipped down inside the hatch to allow him to pass nate crawled into the hatch and looked back to amy before he closed it ill stay amy i dont care for you ill stay i love you you know that right she nodded and brushed tears out of her eyes yeah she said then she spun around quickly and started walking away you take care of yourself nathan quinn she shouted over her shoulder and nate heard her voice break when she said his name he climbed down into the sub and secured the hatch above him clay had watched amy walk away from the big halfsubmerged plexiglas bubble in the front of the sub wheres amy going she cant come home clay shes okay though shes okay you okay ive been better they were quiet for the long ride through the pressure locks to the outside ocean just the sound of the electric motors and the low hum of instruments all around them the lights of the sub barely reached out to the walls of the cave but every hundred yards or so they would come to a large pink disk of living tissue like a giant sea anemone which would fold back to let them pass then expand to fill the passageway once they had gone through nate watched the pressure gauge rise one atmosphere every time they passed through one of the gates and it was then that he realized he wasnt escaping at all the goo knew exactly where and what they were and it was letting him go youre going to explain what all this is right clay said not even looking away from the controls nate was startled out of his reverie clay i cant believe i mean i believe it but thanks for coming to get me i never told you you know its not really appropriate or anything but i have pretty strong feelings about loyalty well i respect that clay and i appreciate it yeah well dont mention it then they were both a bit embarrassed and both pretended that something was irritating their throats and they had to cough and pay attention to their breathing for a while even though the air in the little submarine was filtered and humidified and perfectly clean chapter thirtyeight pirates nate was standing with clay on the flying bridge of the clair as she steamed into the auau channel youd better put on some sunscreen nate nate looked down at his forearms hed lost most of his color while in gooville and he could feel the sun cooking him even through his tshirt yeah he looked off toward lahaina the harbor hed piloted into a thousand times theyd have to anchor far outside the breakwater with a ship this size but it still had the feeling of coming home the wind was warm and sweet the water the heartbreak blue of a newborns eyes a humpback fluked about eight hundred yards to the north of them its tail glistening in the sun as if it were covered with sequins theres still a month left of the season clay said we can still get some work done clay ive been thinking maybe we can be a little more purposeful in what were doing maybe a little more active conservationwise i could go for that i like whales i mean we have the resources now and even if i could prove the meaning of the song somehow decipher the vocabulary of it i could never prove the purpose you know without compromising gooville not a good idea during the trip home nate had explained it all i mean theres no reason we cant do good science and still you know kick some ass well yeah clay affected an exaggerated greek accent sometimes boss you just got to unbuckle your pants and go looking for trouble zorba yeah clay grinned great book nate said is that the always confused clay pulled up a pair of binoculars and focused on a speedboat that was rounding the lahaina breakwater showing more wake than she should in the harbor kona was driving the always confused my boat clay said somewhat distressed you need to get over that clay the speedboat came around to a parallel course with the clair as the ship cut her engines in preparation to drop anchor kona was waving and screaming like a madman irie bwana nate irie the lion come home praise jahs mercy irie nate came down the steps from the flying bridge to the deck whatever resentment he might have had for the surfer at one time was gone whatever threat he might have felt from the boy had melted away whatever irrelevancy konas youth and strength might have underscored in his own character was irrelevant maybe it was time to be an example instead of a competitor besides he was genuinely glad to see the kid hey kid how you doing jammin now dont you know thats good howd you like to go be a pirate because the navy didnt maintain permanent offices on maui captain l j tarwater had been given a small office that the navy sublet for him in the coast guard building which meant that unlike on a naval base here the public could pretty much come and go as they wished so tarwater wasnt that surprised to see someone come strolling through his office door what he was surprised by was that it was nathan quinn whom he thought quite drowned and who was carrying a fourgallon glass jar full of some clear liquid quinn i thought you were lost at sea i was im found now we need to have a chat he set the jar on tarwaters desk leaving a wet ring on some papers there then went back and shut the door to the outer offices look quinn if this is some kind of stunt like spraypainting fur youre wasting your time you guys act like the military is the great satan im here to study these animals i grew up in the same generation you did and so did most of the people in the navy who do what i do we dont want to hurt these animals okay nate said we only have two things to talk about here then ill show you something whats in the jar that better not be kerosene or anything its seawater i got it at the beach about ten minutes ago dont worry about it look first youre going to finish your study and youre going to strongly recommend that the navys torpedo range not be moved into the sanctuary you will not let that happen the animals do dive to depths where they can be hurt by the explosions and they will be hurt by the explosions which youll be setting off not to defend the country but just so you guys can practice theres no evidence that they ever dive deeper than two hundred feet there will be ive got data tags coming in from the mainland ill have data in a month still shut up nate said then thought better of it and added please then he continued second you need to do everything in your power to back off of testing lowfrequency active sonar we know that it kills deepwater hunters like beaked whales and theres probably some chance that it also injures the humpbacks and under no circumstances do you want to do that and why would that be you know what my work has been for the last twentyfive years right youve been studying the humpback song what trying to figure its purpose i found it tarwater its a prayer the singers are praying thats preposterous theres no way you could know that im positive of it absolutely positive i know its a prayer and that the torpedo base and lfa will harm a godfearing animal nate paused to let it sink in but tarwater just looked at him like he was an annoying rodent that had crawled in from the cane fields how could you possibly know that quinn because their prayers are answered nate took a portable tape recorder out of his shirt pocket and set it on the desk next to the seawater into which hed already mixed part of the goo that amy had given him he pushed the play button and the sound of humpbackwhale song filled the office this is ridiculous tarwater said watch nate said pointing to the water which began to swirl a tiny pink vortex forming in the middle get out of here im not impressed with your mr wizard tricks quinn watch nate said again as they watched the pink vortex expanded while the whale song played until half the jar was filled with a moving pink stain then nate turned off the tape so what tarwater said look more closely nate opened the jar reached in strained out some of the pink and threw it on tarwaters desk tiny shrimp each only an inch long flipped about on the blotter krill nate said tarwater didnt say anything he just looked at the krill then scraped a couple into his hand and examined them more closely they are krill uhhuh what its like sea monkees right you had brineshrimp eggs in there no captain tarwater i did not the humpbacks are praying and god is answering them giving them food we could run this little experiment a hundred times and that water would be clear when we started and full of krill when we ended trust me ive done it and he had the little bit of goo in the water created the krill out of the other life in there the ubiquitous sar bacteria that existed in every liter of seawater on the planet tarwater held up the krill but i thought they didnt eat when they were here youre thinking on too small a scale they dont feed for four months and then they do nothing but feed theyre thinking in advance the way you might think about breakfast before you go to bed at night doesnt matter really what you need to do captain is everything in your power and influence to stop the range and the lfa testing tarwater looked stunned now im just a captain but youre an ambitious captain i can have a jar of seawater on the secretary of the navys desk in ten hours do you really want to be the one to explain to this administration that youre hurting an animal that prays to god particularly this administration no sir i do not said tarwater looking decidedly more frightened than he had been just a second before i thought you were an intelligent man i trust youll handle this and this will be the last anyone will hear of my jar yes sir tarwater said more out of habit than respect nate took his tape recorder and his jar and walked out grinning to himself thinking about the praying humpbacks of course its not your particular god he thought but they do pray and their god does feed them he headed back to papa lani to make the calls and write the paper that would torpedo any hope of jon thomas fullers ever building a captive dolphin petting zoo on maui a pirates work is never done three months later the clair cruised into the cold coastal waters off chile on her way to antarctica to intercept stop harass and generally make business difficult for the japanese whaling ship kyo maru clay was at the helm and when the ship reached a precise point on the gps receiver he ordered the engines cut it was a sunny day unusually calm for this part of the pacific the water was so dark blue it almost appeared black clair was below in their cabin shed been seasick for most of the voyage but she had insisted on coming along despite the nausea using her saberedged persuasive skills on the captain whos got the pirate booty all right then help me pack nate stood on the deck at the bow his arm around elizabeth robinson above them swung an eighteenfoot rigidhull zodiac on a crane ready to drop into the water whenever it was needed there was another one on the stern where once the submarine had been stowed up on the flying bridge kona scanned the sea around them with a pair of bigeye binoculars on a heavy iron mount that was welded to the railing theres one a thousand yards clay came out onto the walkway beside kona they all looked to starboard where the residual cloud of a whale blow was hanging over the calm water another one clay shouted pointing to a second blow closer to the ship off the port bow then they started firing into the air as if triggered by a chained fuse whale blows of different shapes heights and angles great explosions of spray erupting so close to the ship now that the decks started to glisten with the moisture then the backs of the great whales rolled in the water around them gray and black and blue hills of slick flesh on all sides moving slowly then lying in the water nate and elizabeth moved up to the bow railing and watched a group of sperm whales lolling in the water like logs just a few feet off the bow next to them a wide right whale floated bobbing gently in the swell only a slow wave of the tail revealing that the creature was alive it rolled to one side and its eye bulged as it looked at them you okay nate asked elizabeth squeezing her shoulder this was the first time shed been out on the water in over forty years in her hands she clutched a brown paper lunch bag theyre still amazing up close id forgotten just wait there were probably a hundred animals of different species around the ship now most rolled on their side one eye bulged out to focus in the air their blows settled into a syncopated rhythm like cylinders of some great engine firing in succession kona jumped up and down next to clay praising jah and laughing as each animal breathed or flicked a tail irie my whaley friends he shouted waving to the animals close to the boat clay desperately resisted the urge to grab up cameras and start blasting film or digital video it felt like he had to pee really badly from his eyes nate clay called and he pointed to a bubble net forming just outside the ring of floating whales theyd seen them dozens of times in alaska and canada one humpback circling and releasing a stream of bubbles to corral a school of fish while others plunged up through the middle to catch them the circle of bubbles became more pronounced on the surface as if the water were boiling and then a single humpback breached through the ring cleared the water completely and landed on its side in white crater of splash and spray oh my goodness elizabeth said flustered she pressed her face into nates jacket then looked back quickly lest she miss something theyre showing off clay said the lolling whales lazily paddled out of the way opening a corridor to the ship the humpback motorboated toward the bow its knobby face riding on top of the water when it was only ten yards from the bow the animal rose up in the water and opened its mouth amy stood up and next to her stood james poynter robinson hey can we get a ladder down here amy shouted praise jahs mercy kona said the snowy biscuit has come home nate threw a cargo net over the side then climbed halfway down and pulled amy up onto the net he held her there as the ship moved in the swell and she tried to kiss him and nearly chipped a tooth help me with elizabeth nate said together they got the old broad down the cargo net and handed her to her husband who stood on the tongue of a whale and hugged his bride after not seeing her for four decades you look so young elizabeth said we can fix that he said youll get old nope he looked back to nate and saluted nate could hear whaleyboy pilots snickering inside the whale i brought you a pastrami on rye she said poynter took the paper bag from her as if he were accepting the holy grail nate and amy scrambled up the cargo net and stood at the bow as the whale drifted away from the bow thank you nate the old broad said waving thank you clay nate smiled well see you soon elizabeth we will you know amy said as the whale ship closed and sank back into the waves i know i have to come back here every few months you know i know forever yeah i know im the new colonel now im sort of in charge down there you know since im sort of the daughter of their god so well have to spend time down there do i have to call you colonel what you have a problem with that no im okay with that you realize that the goo really could decide to wipe out the human species at any minute yep same as its always been and you know if i live out here im not always going to you know look like this i know but i will always be luscious and you you will always be a hopeless nerd action nerd nate corrected ha amy said author notes science and magic the science you dont know looks like magic kona says in chapter i have generally come down on the side of magic simply because it involves less math but with fluke it was necessary to learn a little science because so much of fluke does fall into the realm of magic though i thought it only fair to give you gentle reader some idea of whats fact and whats not the body of knowledge on cetacean biology especially as it relates to behavior is growing at such a staggering rate that its hard to be sure of what you know from one day to the next this happens to be exactly the way i live my life so that worked out nicely scientists have been studying humpback song for fewer than forty years and its only in the last decade that studies have been undertaken to try to relate the song to social behavior and interaction and a challenging question there what constitutes interaction in an animal whose voice can carry a thousand miles as i write this september much about the humpback song is still unknown although scientists do know that it tends to be found in the new age music section as well as in tropical waters there is no reasonable explanation for this but as of yet no tagged humpbacks have been tracked to the new age section at sam goodys at this point no one has ever seen or filmed the mating of humpbacks so while it would appear that the song has something to do with mating because it is performed only by males and because it is sung only during the mating season no one has drawn a direct correlation between the song and mating theories abound the males are marking territory sonically they are showing their fitness and size by singing they are calling mates they are just saying howdy all of the above none of the above the fact remains that regardless of its purpose the humpbackwhale song is the most complex piece of nonhuman composition on earth whether its art prayer or a booty call the humpback song is an amazing thing to experience firsthand and i suspect that even once the science of it is put to bed it will remain as long as they sing magic beyond the song much of the whale behavior and biology described in fluke is accurate or as accurate as i could keep it and not overburden the story excepting the whale ships the whaley boys and every killer whales being named kevin all of which i made up killer whales are actually all named sam duh the acoustic data and the analysis thereof is generally balderdash while scientists do indeed collect data in the manner described much of the analysis process came from my imagination for the record though lowfrequency whale calls can and do travel thousands of miles under the sea while the lahaina harbor is indeed inundated with whale researchers every winter and while there are indeed lectures given periodically at the whale sanctuary visitor center the acrimony competition and tension described among the researchers is completely of my own creation as are the individual descriptions and personalities of the characters tension among a bunch of neurotics is just more interesting for a story than is a description of dedicated professionals doing their work and getting along which is the case in reality when in doubt assume i made it up conservation the reason we shouldnt kill whales is because they fire the imagination james darling phd hey i thought they were saved already no one likes the were glad you enjoyed this story about the rainforest with all its cute little animals and charming native people because it will all be a charred desert next week approach and i hate to do it to you but you should know that much of the conservation information in fluke is accurate they arent quite saved the japanese and the norwegians continue to practice whaling each taking up to five hundred minke whales a year under scientific research permits the meat ends up in markets in europe and asia despite free market arguments to the contrary whaling is not a profitable business in japan it is subsidized by the government and to bolster consumer demand they have introduced whale meat into the school lunch program so children will develop a taste for it good thinking there dont we all crave the cafeteria cuisine of our youth mmmm mashed peas biologists working undercover in japanese markets spy nerds by running dna tests have found endangered whale species including blue whale in cans of whale meat labeled as minke whale meat so someone is still killing them except for scientific whaling the international whaling commissions moratorium on hunting great whales is still in effect but several whaling nations are rallying hard to have the moratorium lifted and finance survey studies to prove that greatwhale populations including humpbacks and grays have recovered enough for them to resume hunting the us antiwhaling position in the iwc is severely compromised by the fact that they support aboriginal whaling that is subsistence hunting by indigenous people the argument for aboriginal whaling by the actual indigenous people is seldom made on a basis of subsistence but more often because hunting whales is a cultural tradition of their people that must be preserved this of course is utter bullshit its a tradition of americans of european descent to commit genocide on indigenous people but that doesnt mean we ought to start doing it again even some old ideas are still bad ideas while it is true that many whale species seem to be recovering like the gray and the humpback other populations still struggle and some like the north atlantic right whale may yet disappear from the planet not due to hunting but as one researcher whom i wont name said because theyre stupid as shit and wont get out of the way when they hear a ship coming hell i almost wreck when a squirrel runs in front of my car and therere millions of them i cant imagine trying to keep a supertanker from going in the ditch while swerving to avoid one of the last remaining right whales recent surveys estimate and they can only estimate because scientists cant find enough of the animals to actually count i guess when you find one you just have to count the bejeezus out of him then extrapolate with algorithms and computer projections that there may be fewer than three hundred north atlantic right whales left in the world but on a happier note some of the populations are recovering and although the japanese government appears to be a bunch of nimrods and who are we to talk the japanese people seem more interested in watching whales than eating them so the pressure to extend the hunt may relent the kicker to all this is probably that habitat loss and pollution not hunting present the greatest threat to marine mammals wha habitat loss dont they have the whole ocean for the most part our oceans are great wet deserts with millions of square miles in which life is very sparse predictably human populations have started to compete with marine mammals for the food sources and under increased demand and improved fishing methods many once rich fishing grounds are becoming as barren as a clearcut forest hydroelectric dams that restrict the migration of salmon and other species to their freshwater breeding grounds are already having an impact on the populations of marine mammals that feed on the adult salmon as industrial pollution and agricultural runoff take toxic chemicals to the ocean it would seem that the enormous volume of seawater would dilute these chemicals to harmless levels and thats what happens until the chemicals are gathered up by a mechanism called the food chain recent studies of tissue samples of some toothed whales killer whales and dolphins who feed fairly high up on the food chain show levels of manmade toxins so high that the animals blubber actually qualifies as toxic waste studies are now going on to determine if declining marine mammal populations on the west coast of north america may not be caused by the lower birth rates and the compromised immune systems of animals who feed on toxic fish oh yeah guess who else is at the top of the seafood chain you want to help pay attention caring about the condition of our oceans does not make you a psycho treehugging bleedingheart liberal it just makes you smart the health of all life on this planet depends on the health of the oceans its just good business even a supplysider has to admit that if you fish a population to extinction there will be no supply so there will be no demand its bad economics from the right or the left so watch what you eat and dont eat fish that are being overfished like chilean sea bass for instance and dont pour the used oil from your oil change down the storm drain unless you want your next shrimp platter to taste like quaker state and you sort of like the idea of having your own children born with flippers and go look at some whales not captive ones wild ones it all comes down to economics and as long as its more profitable to have whales around to look at well have them around to look at if you dont live near water and cant get to any rent a whale video it all comes around barring that just yell at people randomly to stop killing whales it could catch on really would you like fries with that shut up and stop killing whales thank you drive through please acknowledgments first my thanks to the home team to charlie rodgers as usual for thoughtful reads and cogent comments to my editor jennifer brehl and to my agent nicholas ellison who a couple of years ago said hey how about a book about whale song i dont know like theres meaning in it or something you figure it out blame or credit goes to nick for that as always thanks to dee dee leichtfuss for being my reader without an agenda thanks too to galen and lynn rathbun for taking time away from studying the hosenose shrew to fill me in on the home life of the field biologist and for putting me in touch with the people at noaa my thanks also to kurt preston for geological information to dr david kirkpatrick for information on genetics to mark joseph for my introduction to sonar phone lecture and to bret huffman for rastapidgin tutoring much of the background on genes evolution and memes came from the work of richard dawkins the selfish gene the blind watchmaker the extended phenotype and others also from daniel dennetts darwins dangerous idea and from susan blakemores excellent book the meme machine i recommend them all for further reading but when youre finished you may have to read several of my books and watch a lot of tv just to get stupid enough again to function in the modern world again fortunately i am gifted in this respect and have recovered nicely thank you the lasermeasurement algorithm described in chapter was formulated by dr john calambokidis of the cascadia research collective he should get credit for that as well as for many other contributions to the field many of the research anecdotes i used in fluke were fashioned out of stories told to me by the researchers themselves the story of the japanese whalers being affected by seeing a mother sperm whale and her calf chapter was told to me by bob pittman of the southwest fisheries science center the story of the pacific biological research project where the military funded a feasibility study to use seabirds as a biologicalwarfare vector was told to me by lisa ballance bobs wife who also works at noaas southwest fisheries science center thanks too to dr wayne ferryman also from noaa who shared many hours of stories providing me with information about the lifestyles of researchers my thanks to dr ferryman as well for inviting me to observe the california gray whale survey in person and not insisting that i always bring the pizza thanks to jay barlow from noaas southwest fisheries science center for information on navy research projects and the relationship between researchers and the navy much of which i blew off so i could put captain tarwater in maui but still thanks jay my thanks too to carol delancey of oregon state universitys marine mammal program who told me the great story of the female right whale using a researchers zodiac as a diaphragm while the researchers were assaulted by a pair of prehensile whale willies chapter something that happened directly to dr bruce mate but which i embellished in that i dont believe that the whales ejaculated in the boat and dr mate did not become a lesbian for information on underwater acoustics and the nature and range of bluewhale calls much of which i totally ignored many thanks to dr christopher g fox of the hatfield marine science center in newport oregon it was chriss description of an unidentified persistent throbbing noise coming from deep under the pacific ocean somewhere off the coast of chile that first inspired the undersea city of gooville for the inside story on harbor life in lahaina and the dating life of the female researcher my thanks to rachel cartwright and captain amy miller who study humpback cowcalf behavior and biology in maui in the winter and alaska in the summer my thanks too to kevin keyes for whale and dolphin stories as well as for his infinite patience in teaching me ocean kayaking and providing the coldwater discipline safety training that probably kept me from drowning while trying to get out among the animals finally my deepest thanks to dr jim darling flip nicklin and meagan jones who for two seasons allowed me to ride along and observe their research in maui as well as for giving generously of their time to answer my questions both in person and by email while most of the information about humpbacks and humpback song in fluke came out of these trips the inaccuracies and liberties taken with the information are my own the anecdotes and science i learned from these folks all of whom have spent their lives working in the field were enough to fill two books and were certainly too voluminous to list here simply put this book would not have been possible without their help kinder more intelligent more dedicated people than these do not the face of this earth walk to support their ongoing research on humpback song and behavior send your taxdeductible donations to whale trust paani place paia hi
