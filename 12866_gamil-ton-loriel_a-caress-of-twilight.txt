laurell k hamilton a caress of twilight the nd book in merry gentry series this ones for j who brought me endless cups of chai and for the first time watched the process from beginning to end he loves me still and for all of you married to us artistic types you know just how much that says about both of us acknowledgments for shauna summers my new editor thanks for the professionalism darla cook who helped proof this book when there wasnt time to send it around to my longsuffering writing group tom drennan rhett macpherson deborah millitello marella sands sharon shinn and mark sumner thanks for having patience with me while my world fell apart and remade itself chapter moonlight silvered the room painting the bed in a hundred shades of grey white and black the two men in the bed were deeply asleep so deeply that when id crawled out from between them theyd barely stirred my skin glowed white with the kiss of moonlight the pure bloodred of my hair looked black id pulled on a silk robe because it was chilly people can talk about sunny california but in the wee hours of the night when dawn is but a distant dream its still chilly the night that fell like a soft blessing through my window was a december night if id been home in illinois there would have been the smell of snow crisp enough almost to melt along the tongue cold enough to sear the lungs so cold it was like breathing icy fire that was the way air was supposed to taste in early december the breeze crawling through the window at my back held the dry tang of eucalyptus and the distant smell of the sea salt water and something else that indefinable scent that says ocean not lake nothing usable nothing drinkable you can die of thirst on the shores of an ocean for three years id stood on the shores of this particular ocean and died a little bit every day not literally id have survived but mere survival can get pretty lonely id been born princess meredith nicessus a member of the high court of faerie i was a reallife faerie princess the only one ever born on american soil when i vanished from sight about three years ago the media had gone crazy sightings of the missing elven american princess had rivaled elvis sightings id been spotted all around the world in reality id been in los angeles the entire time id hidden myself been just plain meredith gentry merry to my friends just another human with fey ancestry working for the grey detective agency where we specialized in supernatural problems magical solutions legend says that a fey exiled from faerie will wither and fade die thats both true and untrue i have enough human blood in my background that being surrounded by metal and technology doesnt bother me some of the lesser fey would literally wither and die in a manmade city but most fey can manage in a city they may not be happy but they can survive but part of them does wither that part that knows that not all the butterflies you see are actually butterflies that part that has seen the night sky filled with a rushing of wings like a hurricane wind wings of flesh and scale to make humans whisper of dragons and demons that part that has seen the sidhe ride by on horses made of starlight and dreams that part begins to die i hadnt been exiled id fled because i couldnt survive the assassination attempts i just didnt have the magic or the political clout to protect myself id saved my life but lost something else id lost the touch of faerie id lost my home now leaning on my windowsill with the smell of the pacific ocean on the air i looked down at the two men and knew i was home they were both highcourt sidhe unseelie sidhe part of that darkling throng that i might someday rule if i could stay ahead of the assassins rhys lay on his stomach one hand hanging off the bed the other lost under his pillow even in repose that one visible arm was muscled his hair was a shining fall of white curls caressing his bare shoulders trailing down the strong line of his back the right side of his face was pressed to the pillow and so i couldnt see the scars where his eye had been taken his cupidbow mouth was turned upward half smiling in his sleep he was boyishly handsome and would be forever nicca lay curled on his side awake his face was handsome bordering on pretty asleep he had the face of an angelic child innocent he looked fragile even his body was softer less muscled his hands were still rough from sword practice and there was muscle under the velvet smoothness of his skin but he was soft compared to the other guards more courtier than mercenary the face did and did not match the body he was just over six feet most of it long long legs his slender waist and long graceful arms balanced all that length most of nicca was shades of brown his skin was the color of pale milk chocolate and the hair that fell in a straight fall to his knees was a rich dark true brown not brunette but the color of fresh turned leaves that had lain a long long time on the forest floor until when stirred they were a rich moist brown something you could plunge your hands into and come away wet and smelling of new life in the moonlit dark i couldnt see his back or even the tops of his shoulders clearly most of him was lost under the sheet it was his back that held the biggest surprise his father had been something with butterfly wings something not sidhe but still fey genetics had traced his back with wings like a giant tattoo except more vibrant more alive than any ink or paint could make it from his upper shoulders down his back across his buttocks flowing over his thighs to touch the backs of his knees was a play of color buff brown yellow tans circles of blue and pink and black like eyespots on the wings of a moth he rested in the dark drained of color so that he and rhys were like two shadows wrapped in the bed one pale one dark though there were darker things to be had than nicca much darker the bedroom door opened soundlessly and as if id conjured him by my thoughts doyle eased into the room he shut the door behind him as soundlessly as hed opened it i never understood how he did that if id opened the door it would have made noise but when doyle wanted to he moved like the fall of night itself soundless weightless undetectable until you realized the light was gone and you were alone in the dark with something you couldnt see his nickname was the queens darkness or simply darkness the queen would say where is my darkness bring me my darkness and this meant that soon someone would bleed or die but now strangely he was my darkness nicca was brown but doyle was black not the black of human skin but the complete blackness of a midnight sky he didnt vanish in the darkened room because he was darker than the moonlit shadows a dark shape gliding toward me his black jeans and black tshirt fit his body like a second skin id never seen him wear anything that wasnt monochromatic except jewelry and blades even his shoulder holster and gun were black i pushed away from the window to stand as he moved toward me he had to stop gliding at the foot of the kingsize bed because there was barely room to squeeze between the bed and the closet doors it was impressive simply to watch doyle slide along the wall without brushing the bed he was over a foot taller than i was and probably outweighed me by a hundred pounds most of it muscle id have bumped into the bed a halfdozen times at least he eased through the narrow space as if anybody should have been able to do it the bed took up most of the bedroom so when doyle finally reached me we were forced to stand nearly touching he managed to keep a fraction of distance so that not even our clothing brushed it was an artificial distance it would have been more natural to touch and the very fact that he worked so hard not to touch me made it the more awkward it bothered me but id stopped arguing with doyle about his distance when questioned he only said i want to be special to you not just one of the mob at first it had seemed noble now it was just irritating the light was stronger here by the window and i could see some of that delicate curve of his high cheekbones the toosharp chin the curved points to his ears and the silver gleam of earrings that traced the cartilage all the way to the small hoops in the very pointed tops only the pointed ears betrayed that he was a mixedblood like myself like nicca he could have hidden the ears with all that hair but he almost never did his raven black hair was as it usually was in a tight braid that made his hair looked clipped and short from the front but the braids tip hung to his ankles he whispered i heard something his voice was always low and dark like thick candied liqueur for the ear instead of the tongue i stared up at him something or me moving around his lips gave that twitch that was the closest he usually came to a smile you i shook my head hands crossed over my stomach i have two guards in bed with me and thats not protection enough i whispered back they are good men but they are not me i frowned at him are you saying you dont trust anyone but you to keep me safe our voices sounded quiet peaceful almost like the voices of parents whispering over sleeping children it was comforting to know that doyle was this alert he was one of the greatest warriors of all the sidhe it was good to have him on my side frost perhaps he said i shook my head my hair had grown out just enough to tickle the tops of my shoulders the queens ravens are the finest warriors that faerie has to offer and you say no one is your equal you arrogant he didnt so much step closer we were standing too close for that he merely moved pressing close enough that the hem of my robe brushed his legs the moonlight glinted off the short necklace he always wore a tiny jeweled spider hanging from the delicate silver chain he bent his face down so that his breath pushed against my face i could kill you before either of them knew what had happened the threat sped my pulse faster i knew he wouldnt harm me i knew it and yet and yet id seen doyle kill with his hands before empty of weapons only his strength of flesh and magic standing touching in the intimate darkness i knew beyond certainty that if he wished me dead he could do it and not i or the two sleeping guards behind me would be able to stop him i couldnt win a fight but there were other things to do when pressed together in the dark things that could distract or disarm as well or better than a blade i turned minutely toward him so that my face was pressed into the curve of his neck my lips moved against his skin as i spoke i felt his pulse speed pressed against my cheek you dont want to hurt me doyle his lower lip brushed the curve of my ear almost but not quite a kiss i could kill all three of you there was a sharp mechanical sound from behind us the sound of a gun being cocked it was loud enough in the stillness that i jumped i dont think you could kill all three of us rhys said his voice was clear precise no hint of sleep in it he was simply awake pointing a gun at doyles back or at least i assumed thats what he was doing i couldnt see around the bulk of doyles body and doyle as far as i knew didnt have eyes in the back of his head so he had to guess what rhys was doing too a doubleaction handgun doesnt need to be cocked to fire rhys doyle said voice calm even amused but i couldnt see his face to see if his expression matched his tone wed both frozen in our almost embrace i know rhys said a little melodramatic but you know what they say one scary sound is worth a thousand threats i spoke my mouth still touching the warm skin of doyles neck they dont say that doyle hadnt moved and i was afraid to afraid to set something in motion that i couldnt stop i didnt want any accidents tonight they should rhys said the bed creaked behind us i have a gun pointed at your head doyle it was niccas voice but not calm no a definite thread of anxiety wove his words together rhyss voice had held no fear niccas held enough for both of them but i didnt have to see nicca to know the gun was trained nice and steady the finger already on the trigger after all doyle had trained him i felt the tension leave doyles body and he raised his face just enough so that he was no longer speaking into my skin perhaps i couldnt slay you all but i could kill the princess before you could kill me and then your lives would mean nothing the queen would hurt you much more than i ever could for allowing her heir to be slaughtered i could see his face now even by moonlight he was relaxed his eyes distant not really looking at me anymore he was too intent on the lesson he was teaching his men to care about me i braced my back against the wall but he paid no attention to the small movement i put a hand in the middle of his chest and pushed it made him stand up straighter but there really wasnt room for him to go anywhere but on the bed stop it all of you i said and i made sure my voice rang in the room i glared up at doyle get away from me he gave a small bow using just his neck for there wasnt room for anything more formal then he backed up hands out to his sides to show himself emptyhanded to the other guards he ended between the bed and the wall with no room to maneuver rhys was half on his back gun pointed onehanded as he followed doyles movement around the room nicca was standing on the far side of the bed gun held twohanded in a standard shooters stance they were still treating doyle like a threat and i was tired of it i am tired of these little games doyle either you trust your men to keep me safe or you dont if you dont then find other men or make sure you or frost are always with me but stop this if i had been one of our enemies your guards would have slept through your death i was awake said rhys but truthfully i thought youd finally come to your senses and were going to do her up against the wall doyle frowned at him you would think something that crude if you want her doyle then just say so tomorrow night can be your turn i think wed all step aside for an evening if youd break your fast the moonlight softened rhyss scars like a white gauzy patch where his right eye should have been put up your guns i said they looked at doyle for confirmation i shouted at them put up the guns i am the princess here heir to the throne hes the captain of my guard and when i tell you to do something you will by goddess do it they still looked at doyle he gave the smallest of nods get out i said all of you get out doyle shook his head i dont think that would be wise princess usually i tried to get them all to call me meredith but i had invoked my status i couldnt take it back in the next sentence so my direct orders dont mean anything is that it doyles expression was neutral careful rhys and nicca had put up their guns but neither one was meeting my eyes princess you must have at least one of us with you at all times our enemies are persistent prince cel will be executed if his people try to kill me while hes still being punished for the last time he tried to kill me we have six months reprieve doyle shook his head i looked at the three of them all handsome even beautiful in their own ways and suddenly i wanted to be alone alone to think alone to figure out exactly whose orders they were taking mine or queen andaiss id thought it was mine but suddenly i wasnt so sure i looked at them each in turn rhys met my gaze but nicca still wouldnt you wont take my orders will you our first duty is to keep you safe princess and only second to keep you happy doyle said what do you want from me doyle ive offered you my bed and youve refused he opened his mouth started to speak but i held a hand up no i dont want to hear any more of your excuses i believed the one about wanting to be the last of my men not the first but if one of the others gets me with child according to sidhe tradition that person will be my husband ill be monogamous after that youll have missed your chance to break a thousand years of forced celibacy you havent given me a single reason good enough for that kind of risk i folded my arms across my stomach cradling my breasts speak truth to me doyle or stay out of my bedroom his face was almost neutral but an edge of anger showed through fine you want truth then look at your window i frowned at him but turned to look at the window with its gauzy white drapes moving ever so gently in the breeze i shrugged arms still held tight so you are a princess of the sidhe look with more than your eyes i took a deep breath let it out slowly and tried not to respond to the heat in his words getting angry at doyle never seemed to accomplish anything i was a princess but that didnt give me much clout it never had i didnt so much call my magic as drop the shields i had to put in place so that i wouldnt travel through my day seeing mystical sights human psychics and even witches usually have to work at seeing magic other beings other realities i was a part of faerie and that meant i spent a great deal of energy not seeing magic not noticing the passing rush of other beings other realities that had very little to do with my world my purpose but magic calls to magic and without shields in place i could have drowned in the everyday rush of the supernatural that plays over the earth every day i dropped the shields and looked with that part of the brain that sees visions and allows you to see dreams strangely it wasnt that big a change in perception but suddenly i could see better in the dark and i could see the glowing power of the wards on the window the walls and in all that glowing power i saw something through the white drapes something small pressed against the window when i moved the drapes aside nothing was on the window but the play of pale color from the wards i looked to one side using the edge of my sight my peripheral vision to look at the glass there a small handprint smaller than the palm of my hand was etched into the wards on the window i tried to look closer at it and it vanished from sight i forced myself to look sideways at it again but closer the handprint was clawed and humanoid but not human i let the drape fall shut and spoke without turning around something tried the wards while we slept yes doyle said i didnt feel anything rhys said nicca said me either rhys sighed we have failed you princess doyles right we could have gotten you killed i turned and looked at them all then i stared at doyle when did you sense the testing of the wards i came in here to check on you i shook my head no thats not what i asked when did you sense that something had tested the wards he faced me bold ive told you princess only i can keep you safe i shook my head again no good doyle the sidhe never lie not outright and youve avoided answering my question twice answer me now for the third time when did you sense something had tested the wards he looked halfuncomfortable halfangry when i was whispering in your ear you saw it through the drapes i said yes one clipped angry word rhys said you didnt know that anything tried to get in you just came through because you heard merry moving around doyle didnt answer but he didnt need to the silence was answer enough these wards are my doing doyle i put them up when i moved in to this apartment and i redo them periodically it was my magic my power that kept this thing out my power that burned it so that we have its fingerprints your wards held because it was a small power doyle said something large would still get through any ward you could put in place maybe but the point is that you didnt know any more than we did you were just as in the dark as we were youre not infallible rhys said nice to know is it doyle said is it really then think on this tonight none of us knew that some creature of faerie crept to this window and tried to get in none of us sensed it it may have been a small power but it had big help to hide this completely i stared at him you think cels people risked his life tonight by trying to take mine again princess dont you understand the unseelie court by now cel was the queens darling her only heir for centuries once she made you coheir with him he fell out of favor whichever one of you produces a child first will rule the court but what happens if both of you die what happens if you are assassinated by cels people and the queen is forced to execute cel for his treachery shes suddenly without heir the queen is immortal rhys said shes agreed to step down only for merry or cel and if someone can plot the death of both prince cel and princess meredith do you really think they will stop at the death of a queen we all stared at him it was nicca who spoke voice soft no one would risk the queens anger they would if they thought they wouldnt get caught doyle said who would be that arrogant rhys asked doyle laughed a surprised bray of sound that startled us all who would be arrogant enough rhys you are a noble of the sidhe courts the better question would be who would not be arrogant enough say what you like doyle nicca said most of the nobles fear the queen fear her greatly fear her much more than they fear cel you have been her champion for eons you dont know whats it like to be at her mercy i do i said they all turned to me i agree with nicca i dont know anyone but cel who would risk his mothers anger we are immortal princess we have the luxury of biding our time who knows what tricksy serpent has been waiting centuries until the queen was weak if she is forced to kill her only son she will be weak im not immortal doyle so i cant speak for that kind of patience or cunning all we know for certain is that something tried the wards tonight and it will bear a burn on its hand or paw or whatever a mark it can be matched just like fingerprints ive seen wards set up to harm something that tries to break them or even mark the intruder with a scar or burn but ive never seen anyone take imprints before rhys said it was clever doyle said which from him was a great compliment thank you i frowned at him if youve never seen anyone do something like this with a ward how did you know what you were seeing through the drapes rhys said that he had never seen anything like it i did not say that where else did you see it i am an assassin a hunter princess tracks are a very good thing to have the print on its hand will match this but it wont leave tracks as it travels doyle gave a small shrug a pity it would have been useful you can make a creature of faerie leave magical tracks i asked yes but they would see them with their own magic and ruin the spell he shrugged ive never found the world big enough to hide quarry that i tracked youre always so perfect i said he glanced past me at the window no my princess i fear i am not perfect and our enemies whoever they may be know that now the breeze had become a wind billowing out the white drapes i could see the smallclawed print frozen in the glittering magic i was half a continent away from the nearest faerie stronghold id thought la was far enough away to keep us safe but i guess if someone really wants you dead theyll catch a plane or something with wings after years of exile i finally had a little slice of home with me home never really changed it had always been lovely erotic and very very dangerous chapter the windows of my office showed a nearly faultless sky like somebody had taken a single blue cornflower petal and stretched it to fill the air above us it was one of the most perfect skies id ever seen over los angeles the buildings of downtown sparkled in the sunlight today was one of those rare days that allows people to pretend that la sits in an eternal summer where the sun shines constantly the water is always blue and warm and everyone is beautiful and smiling truth is that not everyone is beautiful some people are downright grumpy la still has one of the highest homicide rates in the country which is pretty grumpy if you think about it the ocean is more grey than blue and the water is always cold the only people who go into southern california waters without a wetsuit in december are tourists we actually do get rain occasionally and the smog is worse than any cloud cover ive ever seen in fact this was the prettiest most truly summery day id seen in over three years it must happen more often than that for the myth to survive or maybe people just need some magical golden place to believe in and southern california seems to be that for some people easier to get to and less dangerous than faerie i guess i actually hated to waste such a beautiful day inside i mean i was a princess didnt that mean i didnt have to work nope but i was a faerie princess didnt that mean i could just wish for gold and it would magically appear i wish the title like so many royal titles came with very little in the way of money land or power if i actually became queen that would change until then i was on my own well not exactly on my own doyle sat in a chair by the windows almost directly behind me as i sat at my desk he was dressed as hed been last night except hed added a black leather jacket over the tshirt and a pair of black wraparound sunglasses the brilliant sunlight sparkled in all those silver hoops and made the diamond studs in his earlobes positively dance sending tiny rainbows across my desk most bodyguards would have worried more about the door than the windows we were twentythree stories up after all but the things doyle guarded me against were as likely to fly as to walk the creature that had left its tiny pawprint on my window had either crawled like a spider or flown i sat at my desk with sunlight pressing warm against my back a rainbow from doyles diamond sat on my clasped hands bringing out the green in my fingernail polish the polish matched my jacket and the short skirt that was hidden under the desk the sunlight and the emerald green cloth brought out the red in my hair so that it looked like spun rubies the color also brought out the green and gold of my tricolored irises and id chosen eye shadow to bring out more of the green and gold the lipstick was red i was all color and joyous light one of the good things about not having to pretend to be human was i didnt have to hide the hair the eyes the luminous skin i was so tired my eyes burned and we still had no clue what or who had come to my window last night so id dressed up for the office just a little extra makeup a little extra sparkle if i died today at least id look good id also added a small fourinch knife it was strapped to my upper thigh so the metal hilt touched my bare skin just the touch of steel or iron could make it harder for any fey to do magic against me after last night doyle had thought it wise and i hadnt argued i had my legs politely crossed not because of the client sitting across from me but because a man was under my desk hiding in the cave that it made well not man goblin his skin was moonlight white as pale as my own or rhyss or frosts for that matter the thick softly curling black hair cut short was the perfect blackness of doyles hair he was only four feet tall a perfect male doll except for the stripe of iridescent scales down his back and the huge almondshaped eyes a blue as perfect as the days sky but with striped elliptical pupils like a snakes inside his perfect cupidbow mouth were retractable fangs and a long forked tongue that made him lisp unless he concentrated kitto wasnt doing well in the big city he seemed to feel best when he could touch me huddle at my feet sit in my lap curl against me while i slept hed been banished from my bedroom last night because rhys wouldnt tolerate him goblins had taken rhyss eye a few thousand years ago and hed never forgiven them for it rhys tolerated kitto outside the bedroom but that was about all rhys stood in the far corner near the door where doyle had ordered him to stand his clothing was almost completely hidden under an expensive white trench coat just like humphrey bogart used to wear except that it was made out of silk and was more for looking at than keeping off the weather rhys loved the fact that we were private detectives and he usually wore either the trench coat or one of his growing collection of fedoras to work hed added his daywear eye patch this one was white to match his clothes and his hair with a pattern of tiny seed pearls sewn into it kitto smoothed a hand over my hoseclad ankle he wasnt trying to be overly friendly he just needed the comfort of touching me my first client of the day sat across from me from us jeffery maison was just under six feet tall broad shouldered narrow waisted and designer suited with bluntfingered hands manicured and brown hair perfectly coifed his smile was that bright perfect whiteness that only expensive dental work can create he was handsome but in an unremarkable bland sort of way if hed paid for surgery hed wasted his money because it was the kind of face you recognized as attractive but youd never remember it two minutes after he walked out the door youd have a hard time remembering any one feature if hed been wearing lessexpensive clothing id have said he was a wannabe actor but wannabes couldnt afford perfectly tailored designername suits the perfect smile never faltered but his eyes flicked behind me and the eyes werent smiling the eyes were worried his gaze kept flicking to doyle and it seemed an effort not to look behind him at rhys jeffery maison was very unhappy about the two guards being in the room it wasnt just the feeling that most men got around my guards the feeling that if it came to a fight theyd lose badly no mr maison talked about privacy after all i was a private detective not a public one hed been so unhappy that it was tempting to have kitto bounce out from the beneath the desk and yell boo i didnt do it it wouldnt have been professional but i amused myself with the thought while i tried to get jeffery maison to stop harping on the guards and actually mention something that might be job related only when doyle had said in his deep rolling voice that it was an interview with either all of us or none of us had maison gone quiet too quiet hed sat and smiled but told me nothing oh hed talked ive never seen anyone whose true hair color was sidhe scarlet its like your hair is made of rubies id smiled nodded tried to get down to business thank you mr maison but what brings you to the grey detective agency he opened that perfectly detailed mouth and tried one last time i was instructed to speak with you in private ms nicessus i prefer ms gentry nicessus means daughter of essus its more a title than a name the smile was nervous and the eyes looked selfdeprecating golly shucks maam it had the feel of a look he practiced in the mirror sorry im not accustomed to dealing with faerie princesses he flashed me the full smile the one that filled his eyes with good clean humor and a deeper flash of something else something i could pursue or ignore that one look was enough i was pretty sure how jeffery was paying for the designer suits princesses are rather rare these days i said smiling trying to be pleasant but truth was i hadnt gotten much sleep and i was tired if we could just get jeffery to go away maybe we could have a coffee break the green of your jacket brings out the green and gold in your eyes ive never seen anyone with tricolored irises before he said and the smile warmed rhys laughed from his corner not even bothering to try to turn it into a cough rhys was as versed in surviving at court as i was ive got a tricolored iris but you havent told me how pretty i am rhys was right it was time to stop being polite i didnt know i was supposed to he looked confused a genuine unpracticed look at last i uncrossed my legs and leaned forward hands clasped on my desk kittos hand slid up my calf but he stopped at my knee wed had a talk about what the limits were if he hid under the desk and the limits were my knees above that line and he had to go home mr maison weve delayed our day and rearranged a number of appointments to accommodate you we have been polite and professional and complimenting me on my beauty is neither polite nor professional he looked uncertain but his eyes were probably the most sincere theyd been since he stepped through the door i thought it was considered polite to compliment the fey on their appearance i was told that it was a deadly insult to ignore a fey when they are obviously trying to be attractive i stared at him hed finally done something truly interesting most people dont know that much about fey culture mr maison how is it that you know my employer wanted to be sure that i would give no offense was i supposed to compliment the men as well she didnt tell me i was supposed to do that she i knew his employer was female it was the most information id gotten from him the entire time hed been sitting across from me who is she i asked he looked at rhys at me eyes flicking to doyle and then finally back to me i am under express orders to tell only you ms gentry i i dont know what to do well that was honest i felt a little sorry for him jeffery was obviously not good at thinking on his feet and that was being charitable why dont you call your employer doyle said jeffery jumped at the sound of that deep rich voice i didnt jump i shivered his voice was tremblingly low a sound that made my insides quiver i let out a low breath as doyle said tell your employer whats happened and maybe she can come up with a solution rhys laughed again doyle gave him a lessthanfriendly look and rhys stopped laughing though he had to cover his face with his hand and cough i didnt care i had the feeling that if we made fun of jeffery wed be here all damn day i turned the desk phone around to face him i pressed the code to get him an outside line and handed the buzzing receiver to him call your boss jeffery we all want to get on with our day right id used his first name deliberately some people respond to the respect of titles mr and ms but some people need bullying to get them moving and one way to bully is to use their first name he took the receiver and punched buttons he said hi marie yes i need to talk to her a few seconds of silence then he sat a little straighter and said im sitting across from her right now she has two bodyguards with her and they refuse to leave do i talk in front of them or just leave we all waited as he made small hmm noises yes no finally he hung the phone back up he sat back in his chair hands folded in his lap a slightly worried look on his handsome face my employer says i may tell you her request but not her name not yet anyway i raised eyebrows and made a helpful face tell us he gave one last nervous glance at doyle then let out a long breath my employer is in a rather delicate situation she wishes to talk with you but says that your he frowned groping for an appropriate word it looked like it might take a while so i helped him my guards he smiled obviously relieved yes yes your guards would have to know sooner or later so sooner it is he seemed inordinately pleased with himself for that one small sentence no thinking wasnt jefferys forte why doesnt she just come into the office and speak with us the happy smile faded and he looked perplexed again puzzling jeffery slowed things down i wanted to speed things up the trouble was he was so easily puzzled i couldnt figure out how to avoid it my employer is afraid of the publicity surrounding you ms gentry i didnt have to ask him what he meant at that very moment a pack of reporters both print and film was camped out in front of the office building we kept the drapes closed at the apartment for fear of telephoto lenses how could the media resist a royal prodigal daughter coming home after being given up for dead that alone would have earned some uncomfortable scrutiny but add a huge dose of romance and the media couldnt get enough of me or should i say us the public story was id come out of hiding to find a husband among the royal court the traditional way for a royal of the high court to find a spouse was to sleep with them then if she became pregnant she married if not she didnt the fey dont have many children the royals have even fewer so a pairing even a love match that doesnt produce children isnt good enough if you dont breed you dont get to martyr andais had ruled the unseelie court for over a thousand years my father had once said that being queen meant more to her than anything else in the world yet shed promised to step down if either cel or i would just produce an heir like i said children are very important to the sidhe that was the public story it hid a lot like the fact that cel had tried to kill me and was even now being punished for it there was lots the media didnt know and the queen wanted it kept that way so we kept it that way my aunt told me that she wanted an heir of her own bloodline even if that blood was tainted like mine she once tried to drown me as a child because i wasnt magic enough and thus to her i wasnt really sidhe though i wasnt really human either it was good to keep my aunt happy her happy meant fewer people died i can understand your employer not wanting to get caught up in the media circus outside i said jeffery gave me that brilliant smile again but his eyes were relieved not lustful then youll agree to meet with my employer someplace more private the princess will not meet your employer alone anywhere doyle said jeffery shook his head no i understand that now my employer simply wants to avoid the media short of using spells that are illegal against the media i said i dont see how we could possibly avoid them all jeffery was back to frowning again i sighed i just wanted jeffery to go away at this point surely the next client of the day would be less confusing goddess willing my boss jeremy grey had a nonrefundable retainer we had more business than we knew what to do with maybe i could just tell jeffery maison to go home im not allowed to say my employers name out loud she said that would mean something to you i shrugged im sorry mr maison but it doesnt his frown deepened she was very sure that it would i shook my head i am sorry mr maison i stood up kittos hand slid down my leg so that he could hide himself completely in the little cave that my desk made he didnt melt in sunlight contrary to folklore but he was agoraphobic please jeffrey said please im sure its because im not saying it right i crossed my arms under my breasts and did not sit back down im sorry mr maison but weve all had a long morning too long a morning to play twenty questions either tell us something concrete about your employers problem or find another private detective firm he put his hand out almost touching the desk then let his hand fall back to his welltailored lap my employer wishes to see people of her own kind again he stared at me as if willing me to finally catch on i frowned at him what do you mean people of her own kind he frowned clearly out of his depth but doggedly trying my employer isnt human ms gentry shes very aware of what highcourt fey are capable of his voice was hushed but sort of pleading as if hed given me the biggest hint he was allowed to give me and he hoped id figure it out fortunately or unfortunately i had figured it out there were other fey in los angeles but other than myself and my guards there was only one high royal maeve reed the golden goddess of hollywood shed been the golden goddess of hollywood for fifty years now and since she was immortal and would never age she might be the golden goddess of hollywood a hundred years from now once upon a time shed been the goddess conchenn until king taranis the king of light and illusion had exiled her from the seelie court exiled her from faerie and forbidden any other fey to speak with her ever again she was to be shunned treated as if she had died king taranis was my greatuncle and technically i was fifth in line to his throne in reality i wasnt welcome among the glittering throng theyd made it clear at an early age that my pedigree was a little less than ideal and that no amount of royal seelie blood could overcome being half unseelie so be it i had a court to call home now i didnt need them anymore thered been a time when i was younger that it had meant something to me but id had to put away that particular pain years ago my mother was a part of the seelie court and she had abandoned me to the unseelie to further her own political ambitions i had no mother dont misunderstand queen andais didnt like me much either even now i wasnt completely sure why shed chosen me as heir perhaps she was just running out of blood relatives that tends to happen if enough of them die i opened my mouth to say maeve reeds name but stopped myself my aunt was the queen of air and darkness anything said in the dark would eventually travel back to her i didnt think king taranis had an equivalent power but i wasnt percent sure caution was better the queen didnt care about maeve reed but she did care about having things to negotiate with or hold against king taranis no one knew why maeve had been exiled but taranis had taken it personally it might be worth something to him to know that maeve had done the forbidden shed contacted a member of the courts theres an unspoken rule that if one court banishes someone from faerie the other court respects the punishment i should have sent jeffery maison running back to maeve reed i should have said no but i didnt once when i was young i asked one of the royals about conchenns fate taranis overheard he beat me nearly to death beat me the way youd strike a dog that got in your way and that beautiful glittering throng had all stood and watched him do it and no one not even my mother had tried to help me i agreed to meet with maeve reed later that day because for the first time i had enough clout to defy taranis to harm me now would mean war between the courts taranis might be an egomaniac but even his pride wasnt worth allout war of course knowing my aunt it might not be war at first i was under the queens protection which meant that anyone who harmed me had to answer to her personally taranis might prefer a war to the queens personal vengeance after all hed be a king in the war and kings rarely see frontline action if he pissed off queen andais enough taranis would be the front line all by his little lonesome i was trying to stay alive and they dont say knowledge is power for nothing chapter when the door closed behind jeffery maison i expected the two guards to argue with me i was halfright far be it from me to question the princess rhys said but what if the king objects to you breaking maeve reeds exile i winced at the mention of the name out loud does the king have the ability to hear everything said in daylight the way the queen hears after dark rhys looked puzzled at me i dont know then lets not help him find out what were doing by saying her name out loud i have never heard that taranis has such a power doyle said i turned in my chair to stare at him well lets hope not when youve just said his name out loud i have plotted against the king of light and illusion for millennia princess and much of that plotting was done in broad daylight many of our human allies over the centuries have flatly refused to meet with the unseelie after dark they seemed to think that agreeing to meet during the day was a sign we trusted them and that they could trust us taranis never seemed to know what we were doing day or night doyle said head to one side sending rainbows dancing through the room from the diamonds in his ears i believe that he does not have our queens gift andais may hear everything spoken in the dark but i believe that the king is as deaf as any human anyone else i would have asked if he was sure but doyle never spoke unless he was certain if he didnt know something hed say so there was no false pride in him so the king cant hear us talking thousands of miles away rhys said fine but please tell merry what a bad idea this is what is a bad idea doyle asked helping maeve rhys glanced at me then finished with the actress doyle frowned i dont remember anyone by that name ever being exiled from either court i turned around in my chair and stared at him his face was dark and unreadable against the bright sunlight the glasses hid a great deal of his expression but i was betting glasses or no he would have looked puzzled i heard rhyss silk coat whispering as he walked across the floor toward us i glanced at him he raised his eyebrows at me we both looked at doyle you dont know who she is do you i asked the name you mentioned maeve something should i recognize it shes been the reigning queen of hollywood for over fifty years rhys said doyle just looked at us people from this hollywood have approached the queen and the court over the years to come and make movies or allow them to film movies of their lives have you ever actually seen a movie i asked i have seen movies at your apartment he said i glanced at rhys we have got to get all of them out to a movie rhys half leaned half sat on my desk we could all use a night out kitto plucked at the hem of my short skirt and i moved my chair so i could look down into his face a bar of sunlight fell full across his face for a second the light filled his almondshaped eyes turning the solid sapphire blue orbs paler as if they were water and i could see down down into the sparkling blue depths to a place where white light danced then he closed his eyes wincing against the brightness he buried his face against my thigh one small hand wrapped around my calf he spoke without looking up i dont want to sssee a movie he was slurring his ss badly which meant he was upset kitto worked very hard to talk normally when you have a forked tongue thats not easy i touched his head his black curls were so soft soft the way that a sidhes hair is soft not the roughness of goblin hair its dark in the theater i said stroking his hair you could curl up on the floor beside me and never look at the screen he rubbed his head against my thigh like some giant cat truly he asked truly i said youll like it rhys said its dark and sometimes the floor is so dirty that it sticks to your feet when you walk on it ill get my clothessss dirty kitto said i wouldnt think a goblin would worry about staying clean the goblin mound is full of bones and rotting meat hes only half goblin rhys i said yeah his father raped one of our women he was staring down at kitto though all he could have seen was perhaps a pale hand or arm his mother was seelie not unseelie i said what does it matter his father forced himself on a sidhe woman his voice held heat enough to scald and how many of our sidhe warriors took their pleasure on unwilling women even goblins during the wars doyle asked i glanced at doyle and could see nothing through the dark glasses i looked quickly at rhys and saw a pale blush chase up his cheeks he glared at doyle i have never touched a woman who did not invite my attentions of course not you are a member of the queens guard her ravens and it is death by torture for one of her ravens to touch any woman except for the queen herself but what of the warriors who are not members of the personal guards rhys looked away his blush darkening to a bright deep red yes look away as weve all had to look away over the centuries doyle said rhyss neck turned slowly as if every muscle had gone suddenly tight with anger last night hed had a gun in his hands and he hadnt been frightening now just sitting on the edge of my desk he was frightening he did nothing even his hands were loose in his lap just that terrible tension in his back the set of his shoulders the way he held himself as if he were a blink away from some terrible physical action something that would rip the room apart and paint the sparkling glass with blood and thicker things rhys had done nothing nothing yet violence rode the air like a kiss just above the skin something to make you shiver with anticipation even though nothing had happened not yet not yet i wanted to look behind me at doyle but i couldnt turn away from rhys it was as if only my gaze kept him in check i knew that wasnt true but i felt that if i looked away even for a moment something very very bad would happen kitto was pressed so close to my legs that i could feel a fine trembling all along his body my hand was still on his curls but i dont think it was a comforting touch anymore because i could feel the tension in my arm my hand rhyss face turned milky as if something white and luminous moved under his skin like soft glowing clouds moved not across his face but underneath the skin of his face the brilliant cornflower blue around his pupil glowed like neon the sky blue that circled it was a match for the sunny sky outside and the last circle of winter sky shimmered like blue heat the eye only glowed the colors didnt swirl and i knew they could his hair was still just white curls the glow hadnt spread to them id seen rhys when his power was full upon him and this wasnt one of those times but it was close too close for the bright office and the man behind me i both wanted to turn and see doyles face and didnt i really didnt want a fullout duel here and now especially over something this stupid rhys i said softly he didnt look at me that one glowing orb was set on the man behind me as if nothing else existed rhys i said again voice more urgent he blinked looked down at me having the full weight of all that anger directed at me made me scoot the chair back the moment i realized what id done i stopped myself couldnt take the movement back but i could pretend id meant to do it i stood up and that was my biggest mistake standing up made kitto scoot out from under the desk trying to keep himself huddled around my legs the moment the little goblin was visible rhyss angry gaze dropped down to that pale figure dropped down and hardened kitto seemed to feel that gaze because he wrapped his arms around my legs so tightly that i almost fell i had to recover my balance a hand on the desktop and rhys threw himself across the desk glowing hands scrambling for kitto i felt doyle stand behind me but there was no time id seen rhys kill with a touch i grabbed the front and back of his coat and used his own momentum to slide him off the desk and into the wall past doyles legs the wall shuddered with the impact and i had a second to wonder what would have happened if hed hit the windows instead i saw from the corner of my eye that doyles gun was out but i was still moving still carried along on my own momentum i drew the knife at my thigh and as rhys came up on his hands and knees shaking his head i pressed the tip of the black against the side of his neck it would have been better if i could have pinned him or done anything to make sure he couldnt simply turn and take my legs out from under me but it was the best i could do in the time i had i knew how quickly the guards recovered and id had only seconds to do anything rhys froze head down breathing ragged i could feel the line of his body tense against my legs i was too close so too close but the blade was firm against the side of his neck i could feel the skin give a little under the blade tip and knew id bloodied him i hadnt meant to i was just too rushed to be careful but he didnt know it was an accident and nothing convinces people you mean business like their own blood id hoped you would grow more tolerant of kitto as time ran on but you seem to be getting worse my voice was soft almost a whisper each word spoken very carefully as though i didnt trust what i might do if i yelled in truth i could barely speak past the pulse in my throat rhys shifted his head and i kept the point where it was letting him put a little more flesh on the blade if he thought id move back he was wrong he stopped moving understand this rhys kitto is mine as you are all mine i wont let your prejudices endanger him his voice squeezed out as if he was finally aware that i might use the blade as it was meant to be used youd kill me over a goblin id kill you for harming what is mine to protect by attacking him like this youve shown me no respect none last night doyle showed me no respect if ive learned anything from my aunt and my father its that a leader who is not respected by her people is just a figurehead i will not be something you fuck and cuddle i will be queen or i will be nothing to you my voice had dropped down even lower so that the last words were said in a hoarse whisper and i knew in that moment that i meant it that if spilling rhyss blood would gain me the power i needed id kill him id known rhys my entire life he was my lover and on some level my friend yet i could kill him id miss him and id regret the necessity of having to do it but i knew now that i had to make the guards respect me i lusted after the guards i liked the ones i was sleeping with i even half loved one or two but there were precious few id want to see on the throne absolute power true life and death who would you trust with that kind of power which of the guards was incorruptible answer none everyone has their blind spots the place where they are so sure of themselves that they see only their own tightness i trusted myself yet there were days when i doubted me i was hoping that doubt would keep me honest maybe i was fooling myself maybe no one can be given that kind of power and stay fair and just maybe that old saying is true power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely id do my best but i knew one thing for certain if i didnt get a handle on the situation now the guards would ride over me i might gain the throne but id lose everything else i didnt even really want the throne but i wanted to rule to rule and try to make things better and of course that very desire was probably my blind spot and the beginnings of corruption to think i knew what would be better for all the unseelie how terribly arrogant i started to laugh i laughed so hard i had to sit down on the floor i held the bloody knife and watched the two guards gaze down at me worried looks on their faces rhys wasnt glowing anymore kitto touched my arm gently as if afraid of what id do i wrapped my arms around him hugged him to me and the tears streaming down my face stopped behind laughter and i simply cried i held kitto and the bloody knife and cried i was no better than the others power corrupts of course it does thats what its for i huddled on the floor and let kitto rock me and i didnt fight when doyle took the knife very gently from my hand chapter i ended up huddled in one of my own client chairs with a mug of hot mint tea and my boss jeremy grey i dont know what had alerted him to the trouble but hed come through the door like a small neat storm hed ordered everyone out and doyle of course had argued that jeremy couldnt guarantee my safety jeremy had countered with neither can any of you the silence in the room had been profound and doyle had gone without another word rhys had followed with a handkerchief pressed to his neck trying to keep any more blood spots off his white coat kitto had stayed because i was clinging to him but i was calmer now kitto merely sat at my feet one arm across my knees the other running up and down the front of my leg it was a sign of nervousness when a fey touched someone too intimately and too often but i was stroking kittos hair in endless circles with my free hand so it was all right we were even jeremy leaned against my desk watching me he was dressed as always in a designer suit perfectly tailored to his fourfeet eleveninch frame he was an inch shorter than me strong and slender with a masculine swell of shoulders the suit was charcoal grey about five shades darker than his own skin his short immaculate barbered hair was lighter grey than his skin but not by much even his eyes were grey his smile was a brilliant white the best caps money could buy and matched the white dress shirt hed chosen for the day the only thing that truly ruined his perfect modern profile was the nose hed spent loads on his teeth but left the rather long and beaky nose alone id never questioned it but teresa had she was only human after all and didnt understand that among the fey a personal question is the worst insult to imply in the same breath that something about their physique is not appealing well it just wasnt done jeremy had explained that a large nose among the trow was like large feet among humans teresa had blushed and not asked any more questions id gone over and rubbed his nose with my fingertips and said ooh it had made him laugh he crossed his arms over his chest flashing the gold of his rolex and looked at me among the fey it was impolite to ask why a person was having hysterics hell sometimes it was considered impolite to notice they were having hysterics at all usually that was for ruling royalty though everyone had to pretend that the king or queen wasnt bug nuts mustnt admit that centuries of inbreeding had done any damage he took a deep breath let it out and then sighed as your boss i need to know if youre up to the rest of your appointments today it was a nicely circular way of asking what was wrong without actually asking i nodded raising the tea up to my face not to drink but just to breathe in the sweet scent of peppermint and spearmint intermingled ill be okay jeremy he raised eyebrows that i happened to know he had plucked and shaped apparently trow have that bushyeyebrowacrosstheentirehead thing going the beetlebrowed neanderthal look just doesnt go with armani suits and gucci loafers i could have just left it at that and by our culture hed have had to accept my word and let it go but jeremy had been my boss and friend for years long before he knew i was princess anything hed given me a job on my own merits not because the publicity of having a real live faerie princess on staff brought in business galore in fact the massive media coverage had made me useless for undercover work unless i used major personal glamour to change my appearance most of the reporters who specialized in tracking the fey had some magical ability if they spotted the glamour then it dissolved sometimes just for that reporter but sometimes if they were psychically talented enough the glamour failed for everyone in sight that was a very very bad thing in the middle of an undercover operation id been out among the humans long enough to think i owed jeremy an explanation i dont exactly know what happened jeremy rhys started ranting about goblins then he made a grab for kitto and i threw him into the wall jeremy looked surprised which wasnt very flattering or polite i frowned at him i may not be in the same weight class as they are jeremy but i can put my fist through a car door and not break a bone your guards could probably lift the car up and drop it on somebody i took a sip of tea yeah theyre stronger than they look he gave a small laugh you my dainty beauty do not look anywhere near as tough as you are i return the compliment i said toasting him with the mug he smiled flashing that expensive smile yes i have surprised a few humans in my day the smile faded around the edges if you had just told me to mind my own business id have done it but you volunteered information so im going to ask some questions just tell me if you dont want to answer i nodded i started it jeremy go ahead rhys didnt get blood on his coat from you throwing him into a wall thats not a question i said he shrugged how did he get bloodied a knife doyle i shook my head i cut rhys because he tried to hurt kitto i nodded but i met jeremys direct gaze with one of my own they wouldnt obey my orders last night if i dont gain their respect jeremy i may gain the throne but i will be queen in name only i dont want to risk my life and the lives of people i care about just to be some sort of figurehead so you cut rhys up to prove a point partly and partly i just reacted didnt think he was trying to hurt kitto over some stupid thing that happened centuries ago kitto has never given rhys any reason to hate him like this our fairhaired guard hates goblins merry kitto is a goblin jeremy he cant change that jeremy nodded no he cant we looked at each other what am i going to do you dont mean just with rhys do you we exchanged another long look and i had to look down but that meant staring into kittos searching blue gaze everywhere i looked people were expecting something of me kitto wanted me to take care of him jeremy well he just wanted me to be happy i think i thought i had their respect back in illinois but its as if somethings changed over the last three months what he asked i shook my head i dont know kitto raised his head which slid my hand to the warm curve of his neck doyle he said softly i looked down at him what about doyle he half lowered his eyes as if afraid to look directly at me he wasnt being coy it was a habitual gesture a subservient gesture doyle says you made a good start but you have made no use of your treaty with the goblins he raised his eyes a little you have the goblins as your allies for only three more months merry for three more months if the unseelie go to battle it is you who the queen must come to for the goblins aid not our king kurag doyle fears you are simply going to fuck everyone and make no move on your enemies whats he want me to do declare war on someone kitto hid his face against my knee i do not know mistress but i do know that the others follow doyles lead it is he who you must win over not the others jeremy pushed away from my desk came closer to the two of us i find it a little strange that sidhe warriors would speak so freely in front of you no offense kitto but you are a goblin why would they confide in you they did not as you say confide in me but sometimes they talk over me like i am not there like you just did jeremy frowned i am talking to you not over you kitto he looked up at both of us but before you were talking as if i were something that couldnt understand you like a dog or a chair all of you do it i blinked down at him staring into that innocent face i wanted to deny it but i held my tongue and thought about what hed said was he right the conversation that id just had with jeremy had been private sort of kitto had just been there i hadnt wanted his opinion or his help truthfully i hadnt thought he could be of any help i saw him as someone to be taken care of a duty not a friend not truthfully a person i sighed and let my hand fall away from him so that he was touching me but i wasnt touching him his eyes widened frantically and he grabbed my hand put it back on his head please dont be angry with me please im not angry kitto but i think youre right i treat you like youre a pet not a person i would never just sit and pet one of the other men ive been taking liberties im sorry he rose to his knees no no thats not what i meant i love that you touch me it makes me feel safe its the only thing that makes me feel safe here in this place the look on his face was distant lost i offered the tea mug to jeremy who took it and put it on the edge of my desk i cupped kittos face in my hands moved his gaze back to mine you tell me i treat you like a dog a chair and i try to treat you like a person and you dont want that either i dont understand what you want of me kitto he put his warm hands against mine pressed my flesh firm against his face his hands were so small he was the only man id ever met with hands smaller than mine i always want you to touch me merry dont stop i dont mind that people talk over me it lets me hear things know things kitto i said softly he clambered into my lap like a child forcing my hands to encircle him to keep him from falling my right hand slid over the slickness of the scales on his back my left cupped the smooth hairless curve of his thigh the sidhe didnt have much body hair and snake goblins had none the mixed heritage had left kitto smooth and perfect like hed been waxed from neck to toe it added to the dolllike image and made him seem perpetually childlike hed been a product of the last sidhegoblin war which meant kitto was a little over two thousand years old i knew my history i knew the date but holding him in my arms like an oversize doll it was hard to really believe it almost impossible to grasp that the man curled in my lap had been born not long before the death of christ doyle was even older and frost too rhys under a different name which he would never tell me had been worshipped as a death deity nicca was only a few hundred years old young by comparison galen was only seventy years older than me in the courts it was almost the same thing as being raised together id grown up seeing them all remain the same they were immortal i wasnt i was aging a little slower than a pure human but not by much i was about a decade or two behind where i should have been twenty extra years was great but it wasnt forever i looked up at jeremy for a hint of what to do with the goblin he spread his hands wide dont look at me ive never had an employee crawl into my lap and want to be petted he doesnt exactly want to be petted i said he wants to be reassured if you have all the answers merry then why dont you reassure him jeremy said a little privacy maybe i said the moment i asked for privacy i felt kittos body begin to relax against me he slid his arm underneath my suit jacket to curve at the small of my back his knees unclenched enough so that he tucked them underneath my arm sending my hand on his thigh sliding downward to the very edge of his shorts since kitto never saw clients he got to dress like it was casual day every day jeremy straightened his tie smoothed the edges of his jacket nervous gestures all ill leave you two alone though i think that once doyle finds out youre alone except for kitto hell be in here we dont need much time i said my condolences jeremy said he opened his mouth like he was going to add to that then shook his head tugged on the sleeves of his suit jacket and went very firmly for the door the door shut behind him and i looked down at the goblin we werent going to do what jeremy obviously thought we were going to do id never had intercourse with kitto and didnt plan to start now id had to share flesh with one of the goblins to cement the treaty between them and me but sharing flesh can mean a lot of things to a goblin technically once id let kitto leave a perfect imprint of his teeth in my shoulder wed shared flesh and it was done but what should have been a scar had faded then vanished from my skin id shown king kurag the bite mark when it was fresh and neither kitto nor i had mentioned that it had faded without the scar there was no proof that i belonged to kitto the pain of kittos bite had been lost somewhere in the middle of sex with someone else lost when my body had gone forward into that place where pleasure and pain are blurred from a dead start with no foreplay getting a piece bitten out of you just hurts kitto was within his rights by goblin culture to expect reassurance in the form of sharing flesh whatever that meant for us i was very lucky with my little goblin he was subservient to me and liked it that way my father had made sure i understood all the cultures of the unseelie court and i knew what was true reassurance and what wasnt for kittos world i had to play him fair not cheat i suspected strongly that kurag would be upset that i had no visible mark of goblin on my body and insult to injury kitto wasnt getting intercourse either so i was trying to be very careful about all the other cultural rules and taboos i needed to reassure kitto and continue the days business there were two other clients to see before we could go off to visit maeve reed ms reed through jeffery maison had been most insistent that we see her this afternoon not this evening if we couldnt make it this afternoon then tomorrow morning would be next best kitto cuddled against me his small hands kneading along my back and waist it was a gentle reminder that he was still there waiting the door opened rhys hesitated just inside the door staying at us a spurt of anger flashed through me come in rhys join us my voice was cold distant angry he shook his head ill get doyle for you no i said he stopped in the doorway and finally looked at me met my eyes you know i dont share you with the he caught himself before he could saygoblin and finished awkwardly him and what if i say you will share me with him i came in here to apologize merry if i had injured kitto it could have jeopardized your treaty with the goblins im sorry i lost my temper if this had been the first incident id accept the apology but its not the first its not even the fifteenth words arent enough anymore what do you want from me merry he was looking angry and sullen again distract me while i reassure kitto he shook his head hard enough to send his white curls flying he winced and put a hand up to his neck there was a bandage on it but apparently it still hurt the wound wouldnt last long a couple of hours and hed be healed i vowed never again to let goblin flesh touch mine merry you know that hes going to be touching me rhys not you no merry no then pack your bags and go his eye widened what do you mean i mean that i cant risk you hurting kitto and screwing up the treaty with the goblins i said i was sorry about that but not sorry enough to make friends with kitto not sorry enough to behave like a bodyguard instead of a spoiled bigoted child he stood in the halfopen doorway staring at me you cant mean that youd kick me out in preference to this goblin i shook my head my enemies are the goblins enemies for three more months that has kept me safer than any of you have managed to do no one wants to risk facing the entire goblin army the fact that you cant see past your own prejudices to how important this is means youre too flawed to be my guard i ran my hand down kittos arm pressed his head more firmly into my shoulder forced rhys to look at him the rage in his face was raw they he pointed at kitto made me flawed he tore his eye patch off and stalked into the room they did this to me he kept his finger pointed at kitto as he advanced toward us he did this kitto raised his face enough to say i have never harmed you rhyss hands trembled as he balled them into fists he stood above us looming trembling with rage with the need to strike out at something at someone dont rhys i said my voice low calm i was afraid if i raised my voice it would set him off i really didnt want to lose him but i didnt want kitto hurt either i heard a sound behind us though i couldnt see the doorway through rhys doyles voice came clear and deep is there a problem thanks to rhys i need to renew my vows with kitto so i told him he needed to distract me while we did it i would be happy to distract you princess doyle said oh yeah youre great at foreplay as long as theres no followthrough and let me just say that thats really beginning to get on my nerves too i said frost should be back from his assignment very soon hes told the starlet that shell have to find someone else to guard her from her wouldbe fans we were still speaking around rhyss body i thought frosts bodyguarding gig lasted until the end of the week at least i thought it prudent after last nights attempt that we have him with us ive sent him on ahead to scout ms reeds home scout i made it a question she is after all full seelie court sidhe once a goddess but yet no longer of either court she might feel she is beyond the limits of our laws i would be a poor guard indeed to simply allow you to walk into her home without some preparation so you just pulled frost off a job for our agency and reassigned him without asking jeremy or me silence ill take that as a yes i frowned up at rhys move to one side rhys the threat display is getting a little old rhys looked a little surprised as if i was supposed to be quaking in my boots of course maybe the show wasnt for me kitto looked pale and very frightened move i said do as the princess bids doyle said only then did rhys move reluctantly to one side i stared past him at doyle who was just inside the door either rhys helps distract me while kitto gets reassured or he packs his bags and goes back to illinois doyle looked completely surprised you didnt see that response too often in the queens darkness it made me just a little happy i thought you enjoyed rhyss attentions i love having rhys in my bed but that doesnt matter if he cant control himself around kitto then eventually hes going to blow up and hurt him you know kurag didnt want to join a treaty with me doyle he tried to weasel out of it from the beginning i forced an alliance on him but if kitto is injured or worse killed then kurag could use it as an excuse to break the alliance i stroked the side of kittos face turning him from staring at rhys and do you really think that if kurag has to send us a second goblin it will be anyone as pleasant as kitto its my flesh and blood being offered up not rhyss not yours that is true enough princess doyle said but if you send rhys home our queen will also send a new guard to replace him and there are many less pleasant guards she could send than rhys it doesnt matter either rhys does this or hes out im tired of the histrionics doyle took a deep enough breath that i could see the rise and fall of his chest from across the room then i will stay and guard everyones safety rhys turned toward him you dont mean that i have to do this princess meredith nicessus wielder of the hand of flesh has given you a direct order if you do not obey it then the princess has already told you the penalty rhys walked toward doyle the anger fading you would cast me aside for this i am one of your best guards i would hate to lose you in this fight doyle said but i cannot go against the princesss wishes thats not what you said last night rhys said she is right rhys you have endangered our alliance with the goblins if you cannot control your rage at kitto then you are a hazard to us all she is right to make you face this fear i am not afraid of him rhys said pointing again kitto cowered back against me at rhyss anger all mindless hatred comes from a root of fear doyle said the goblins hurt you long ago and you fear ending up in their hands again you can hate them if you like and you can fear them if you must but they are our allies and you must treat them as such i will not help that thing sink its fangs into an unseelie princess if you had behaved yourself i said i wouldnt be forced to do this again so soon youre about to cause me pain rhys and if im willing to endure it then the least you can do is make it not completely unpleasant rhys went to the window gazing out he spoke without turning around i dont know if i can do this just try i said but really try you cant just put a toe in declare the water cold and run home you have to stay with it if you truly cant bear it well talk but first you have to try he leaned his head against the window glass he finally raised his head squared his shoulders and turned to face the room ill do my best just make sure he doesnt touch me i looked down at the little goblins pale face and frightened eyes rhys i hate to break it to you but i dont think kitto wants to touch you any more than you want to touch him rhys gave a small nod all right then lets do this weve got clients waiting he managed a faint smile mysteries to solve bad guys to catch i smiled at him thats the spirit doyle closed the door behind him and leaned against it i will not interfere unless there is danger for the first time doyle was protecting me not from any outside force but from one of my own guards i watched rhys as he walked toward kitto and me the bandage on his neck was almost as big as my palm maybe doyle wasnt around just to keep kitto and me safe from rhys maybe just maybe he was also here to keep rhys safe from me chapter rhys laid his silk trench coat across my desk and came to stand in front of us kitto curled into a tight ball in my lap eyes staring up at rhys the way small mammals watch cats as though the cat wont see them if they stay still enough the shoulder holster was stylishly white against rhyss buttondown shirt the butt of the gun was like a black imperfection among all that cream and white give your gun to doyle rhys please he glanced at doyle who had gone back to his chair against the windows i believe you are making the little one nervous rhys well isnt that just a pity he said and his voice was cruel i glared up at him and felt the first stirrings of power i didnt fight the anger or the magic i let it fill my eyes knew there was a glimmer in my eyes of colors and light nowhere in the room but in my eyes be careful rhys or you can leave now without your second chance my voice was low and careful again i was holding on to my magic the way you hold your breath controlled or you start yelling i must have looked like i meant it because he turned without another word and walked to doyle he handed the gun butt first to the dark man then he stood there for a few seconds shoulders squared hands in fists at his sides it was almost as if he felt more insecure without the gun if hed been facing true mortal danger i could have understood it but kitto wasnt that kind of threat to rhys he didnt need the gun he turned toward us with a shaky breath which i heard clearly from feet away some of the anger had been stripped away and what was left was barely disguised fear doyle was right rhys feared kitto or rather goblins it was like a phobia for him a phobia with a basis in reality those are the kind that are almost impossible to cure he stopped just in front of us again staring down at me face diffident but underneath was a vulnerability that made me want to say no you dont have to do this but i would have been lying he did have to do this if something wasnt done rhys would lose his temper once too often and kitto would get hurt or worse we couldnt risk the treaty and kitto was mine to take care of i wasnt sure where my duties would lie if rhys killed him in a fit of panic i didnt want to have to order an execution of someone id known all my life i wanted to reassure rhys tell him it was all right but i didnt want to appear weak either so i sat there with a very tense kitto curled tight in my lap and said nothing ive always left the room when you deal with it him rhys said what happens now id had enough and i suddenly didnt feel sorry for rhys i looked down at kitto i offer you small flesh or weak blood small flesh was goblin slang for light foreplay weak blood meant barely breaking the skin or even just raising welts there was every possibility that kitto would choose something i wouldnt need any distraction for id slowly been teaching kitto new definitions of petting and foreplay definitions that were a lot less stressful to all concerned he looked down not meeting anyones eyes and whispered small flesh done i said rhys frowned what just happened i looked up at him you always negotiate with goblins before sex rhys if you dont you end up hurt he frowned down at me i was a prisoner for a night i had no ability to negotiate i sighed and shook my head most sidhe seelie or unseelie knew very little about cultures outside their own it was a type of prejudice that believed nothing but sidhe culture was worth knowing actually according to goblin law you did if theyd tortured you then no youd have simply had to endure what they did to you though truthfully there is some room for negotiation even in torture for sex though you always have room to negotiate its custom among them the frown deepened that single eye was so confused so painfilled i spilled the small goblin to his feet and stood in front of rhys putting kitto almost between us for once rhys didnt seem to notice how close the goblin was to him the goblins will rape and theres no saving yourself from it but you can dictate terms things that can be done and cannot be done his hand rose slowly toward his scars then stopped before he touched them his hand just hanging in midair you mean and he left the rest of the sentence unfinished that you could have forbidden them from permanently disfiguring you yes my voice was very very soft as i said it id been half wanting to tell rhys and half dreading since i found out a few months ago how hed lost his eye he turned to me with such horror in his face i touched his cheeks rose on tiptoe and leaned his face down toward me i laid a gentle kiss on his lips a bare touch from my mouth to his then stretched until my body leaned full against his stretching as tall as i could my hands still on his face bringing him closer to me i laid the same gentle kiss on his scar he jerked back making me stumble only kittos arm around my waist kept me from falling no rhys said no i held my hands out to him come to me rhys he just kept backing away doyle had moved up behind him without either of us noticing rhys stopped backing away when he smacked into his captains body if you fail her here rhys then you must go back to faerie he glanced at doyle then at me i havent failed i just i didnt know most sidhe dont know anything about goblin culture i said its one of the reasons that the goblins are such feared warriors because no one understands them we might have won the goblin wars centuries sooner if anyone had taken time to study them and i dont mean torture them you dont learn a persons culture by torture doyle put a hand on either of rhyss shoulders and began walking him back toward us rhys didnt look afraid anymore more shellshocked as if a piece of his world had broken away and left him hanging with his feet on thin air doyle walked him back to us and i touched his face gently rhys blinked startled as if hed forgotten i was there youre not ruined rhys youre beautiful i lowered his face toward me but the six inches of difference hampered my intentions i could kiss his mouth but not his eye i went back on tiptoe which stretched my body along the length of rhyss kittos arm had still been around my waist and now his arm was pressed between our bodies trapped with the pressure of our flesh rhys didnt scream about it so i let it go i would finish what id started i kissed slowly up the edge of his face until i touched the edge of the scar he jerked and i think only doyles hands on his shoulders kept him from running again he closed his eye tight like a condemned man who didnt want to see the bullet coming i kissed my way across the scars until i felt the rough slickened skin under my lips i laid a gentle kiss over the empty socket where the other beautiful eye should have been he was so tense under my hands almost shaking i kissed more firmly over the thickened skin letting my lips open and close loosely over the spot rhys made a small sound i licked very gently over the scar another small sound came from his throat and it wasnt a pain sound i licked slowly carefully over the slick skin his breath came in short sharp gasps the fists at his side were shaking but not with anger i ran tongue and lips over the scar until his knees buckled and it was kitto who caught him around the waist the small man held him as if he weighed nothing i kissed rhys on the mouth and he kissed me back like he was drowning and would find the breath of life in my mouth we ended on our knees on the floor with doyle standing above us and kitto still wound around rhyss waist rhys put his arms behind my back and pressed me against him hard enough that even with kittos arm between us i knew rhys was hard and firm some buckle or strap must have bruised into kittos skin because he made a small sound that one tiny sound brought rhys up for air made him look around and when he saw the little goblins arms around his waist he gave something very like a scream and scrambled away from both of us i was about to open my mouth and say that rhys had done enough to satisfy me but kitto spoke first i declare myself satisfied i stared at him youve had nothing for yourself yet he shook his head blinking those drowning blue eyes i am satisfied he seemed about to add more appeared to think better of it and just shook his head again it was rhys who said you havent had your bit of flesh yet no the goblin said but i am within my rights to forgo it why would you do that rhys asked he was still crouched on the floor face wild panicked merry needs all her guards to be safe i would not have her lose one of them over me rhys stared at him you would give up your bit of flesh and blood so that i can stay kitto blinked then looked at the floor yes rhys frowned are you feeling sorry for me and a tiny edge of anger crept into his voice kitto looked up clearly surprised sorry for you why you are beautiful and share merrys body as well as her bed you have a chance to be king the scars that you think ruin you are a mark of great beauty among the goblins and a mark of great valor showing you have survived great pain he shook his head you are a sidhe warrior no one bullies you but the queen herself look at me warrior look at me he held out his small hands i have no claws precious little fang i am like a human among the goblins for the first time there was a bitterness in kittos voice a bitterness of years of abuse of being in a culture where violence and physical prowess is prized of being trapped in a body that was soft by their standards hed been born a victim among the goblins he held those tiny hands out to rhys and there was anger in that small delicate face anger and a helplessness born of truth kitto knew very well what he was and what he wasnt among the goblins he was anyones meat no wonder he wanted to stay at my side even in the big bad city chapter ask most people especially tourists where the rich and famous live in southern california and theyll say beverly hills but holmby hills is full of money and fame and land land with high fences that block the view of the peons driving by straining for a look at the rich and famous holmby hills is not the fashionable address it once was not the place for the young rising stars to make their home but one thing hasnt changed you need money for those walls and gates lots of money come to think of it maybe thats why the newly famous dont move to holmby hills much they cant afford it maeve reed could afford it she was a major star but lucky for us not in the top percent if shed been say julia roberts wed have had to evade her media hounds as well as mine one set of rabid reporters was more than enough for one day there were ways around the media that didnt need magic for instance a white van with rust spots that sat unused in the parking garage most of the time the grey detective agency used it for surveillance when the usual van would stand out too much if it was a nice neighborhood we used the nice van if it was a bad neighborhood we used this van the media had started following the nice van every time it went out on the theory that it could be hiding the princess and her entourage that left us with the old van even though it stood out like a sore thumb in holmby hills one of the back windows was covered with cardboard and tape rust decorated the white paint like wounds both the cardboard and the rust held places to hide cameras and other equipment the hideyholes could even be used as gunsights in an emergency rhys drove the rest of us hid in the back hed piled all that white hair under a billed cap a highquality fake beard and mustache hid all those boyish good looks the cap and the facial hair even covered most of the scars the guards had become almost as camera recognizable as i was so it had to be a good disguise and rhys loved playing detective hed dressed up as if the day was any day and all the emotional turmoil had been a dream kitto was literally hiding under my legs in the floorboard doyle sat on the far side of the seats away from me frost took up the center seat sitting beside each other the two men were almost exactly the same height standing frost was the taller by a couple of inches his shoulders were a little wider and his body slightly bulkier it wasnt a large difference and not one you usually noticed when they had clothes on but it was a difference all the same queen andais treated them almost as if they were just two sides of the same coin her darkness and her killing frost doyle had a name aside from the queens nickname frost did not he was simply frost or killing frost and that was all frost was dressed in charcoal grey dress slacks cut long enough that they covered the tops of his charcoal gray loafers the shoes were polished to a mirror sheen his shirt was white with a ribbed front and a banded collar that encircled the smooth firm line of his neck a pale grey jacket hid his shoulder holster and shiny nickelplated the gun was so big that i could barely hold it onehanded let alone shoot it his silver christmastinsel hair was pulled back in a firm ponytail that left his face strong clean and almost too handsome to look at the tail of silver hair had spilled mostly over the backseat and half across his shoulder a few strands trailed over my shoulder and arm as he gave his report to doyle i touched those shining strands feeling the spiderweb softness of them the hair looked metallic like it should feel harsh but it was wonderfully soft id had all this silken grace spill over my naked body there was a part of me that thought that a mans hair should be at least to his knees highcourt sidhe took great pride in their hair among other things frosts hip pressed against mine hard to avoid in the close confines of the seat but his thigh pressed the length of mine and that he could have avoided i had raised a lock of his hair in front of my face letting the strands fall down while i watched the world through a lace of his hair when doyle said are you listening to us princess meredith i startled and let frosts hair fall away yes i was listening the look on his face said clearly he didnt believe me then repeat it back to us if you can i could have told him i was a princess and i didnt have to repeat anything but that would have been childish and besides i really had been listening to some of it frost saw some of kane and harts people behind the walls which means that they are doing some sort of job for her either bodyguarding or something that needs psychic talent the kane and hart agency was the only real competition that the grey detective agency had in la kane was a psychic and a martialarts expert the hart brothers were two of the most powerful human magicians that id ever met the agency did more bodyguard work than we did or had until my guards showed up doyle looked at me and and what i asked frost laughed a purely masculine sound that said more than words that he was pleased i knew what had pleased him without having to ask he was pleased that id been so distracted by just having him near me i found frost the most distracting of the guards that i was sleeping with he turned to me with his storm grey eyes laughter still shining in them the laughter softened the perfection of his face made him seem more human i touched my fingertips to his cheek the lightest of touches the laughter melted slowly from his face leaving his eyes serious and full of a tender weight of words unspoken things not yet done i stared up into his eyes they were just grey not tricolored like mine or rhyss but of course they werent just grey they were the color of clouds on a rainy day and like clouds the colors changed and swirled not with the wind but with his moods they were a soft grey like the breast of a dove as he lowered his head to kiss me my pulse filled my throat so that i couldnt breathe his lips brushed mine laying a gentle kiss that trembled against my flesh he raised back from that one tender movement and we looked into each others eyes from inches away and there was a moment of knowing wed shared a bed for three months hed guarded my safety id introduced him to the twentyfirst century id watched the solemn frost relearn how to smile and laugh wed shared a hundred intimacies dozens of jokes a thousand new discoveries about the world in general and none of it had been enough to push either one of us over the edge then suddenly a look in his eyes and a gentle kiss and it was as if my feelings for him reached critical mass as if it had only been waiting for one last touch one last lingering glance before i knew i loved frost and from the startled look on his face as he stared down at me i think he felt it too doyles voice cut across the moment making us both jump what you didnt hear meredith is that maeve reeds land is warded warded as only a goddess who has lived on the same piece of land for over forty years could bespell i blinked up at frosts face trying to shift the gears in my head to listen to doyle and to care about what he was saying i had heard him but i wasnt sure i cared not yet if frost and i had been alone we would have talked about it but we werent alone and really being in love with each other didnt change much i mean it changed everything and nothing loving anyone changes you but royalty seldom marries for love we marry to cement treaties to stop or prevent wars or to forge new alliances in the case of the sidhe we marry to breed id been sleeping with rhys nicca and frost for over three months and i wasnt pregnant unless one of them could get me with child i wouldnt be permitted to marry any of them it had been only three months and it typically took a year or more for a sidhe to conceive i hadnt been worried until now and i wasnt worried that i wasnt pregnant i was worried that i wasnt pregnant and that it might mean i lost frost in the moment i finished the thought i knew i couldnt afford to think that way i would have to give my body to the man whose seed made me pregnant my heart could go wherever it wanted but my body was spoken for if cel became king hed have the power of life and death over the court hed have to kill me and anyone he saw as a threat to his power frost and doyle would never survive i wasnt sure about rhys or nicca cel didnt seem as afraid of their power he might let them live he might not i drew back from frost shaking my head whats wrong meredith he asked he grabbed my hand as i moved it away from his face he held my hand in his pressing it almost painfully as if hed seen some of my thoughts on my face if i couldnt talk about love in front of the others i certainly couldnt talk about the price of being a princess in front of them i had to get pregnant i had to be the next queen of the unseelie court or we were all dead princess doyle said softly i looked past frosts shoulder to meet doyles dark eyes and something in those eyes said that he at least had followed my thinking which meant hed also realized how i felt about frost i didnt like that it was so apparent to others love like pain should be private until you want to share it yes doyle i said and my voice sounded hoarse like i needed to clear my throat wards of such power prevent another fey from seeing all the magic inside a place frost scouted it as best he could but the strength of the wards means we do not know what mystical surprises might await us inside the walls of ms reeds estate he talked of normal things but his voice still held that edge of softness in anyone else i would have said it was pity are you saying we shouldnt go in i asked i drew my hand back from frosts grip no i agree that i find her desire to meet with you with all of us intriguing the van pulled to a stop outside a tall gate rhys turned in the seat as much as his seat belt would allow i vote we go home if king taranis finds out weve talked to her hell be pissed what could we possible learn that would be worth the risk her banishment was a great mystery when it happened doyle said yes frost said he slid back in his seat eyes distant as if he was shutting himself away from me id pulled away and frost didnt react well to that the rumor was that she would be the seelies next queen then suddenly she was exiled he moved his leg away from mine putting physical distance between us i watched his face grow cold and hard and arrogant the old mask hed worn in the court for all those years and i couldnt bear it i took his hand in mine he frowned at me clearly puzzled i raised his knuckles to my lips and kissed them one by one until his breath caught in his throat for the second time today i had tears in my eyes i kept my eyes very wide and very still and managed not to cry frost was smiling again visibly relieved i was glad he was happy you should always want the people you love to be happy rhys just looked at us his face neutral hed had his turn last night tonight was frosts turn and rhys had no problem with that doyle caught my gaze and his face was not neutral but worried kitto stared up from the floorboard and there was nothing i could understand on his face for all that he looked so sidhe he was other and there were times when i had no idea what he was thinking or feeling frost held my hand and was happy with that happy that i hadnt turned away of all of them only doyle seemed to understand exactly what i was feeling and thinking what does it matter why she was exiled rhys said perhaps it doesnt matter doyle said or perhaps it matters very much we wont know until we ask i blinked at him ask ask outright without an invitation to ask something so personal he nodded you are sidhe but you are also part human you can ask where we cannot meredith i have better manners than to ask such a personal question right out of the bag i said we know you have better manners than that but maeve reed does not i stared at him frosts fingers rubbed along my knuckles over and over are you saying i should pretend to not know any better i am saying we should use all the weapons in our arsenal your mixed heritage could be a decided advantage today it would be almost the same thing as lying doyle i said almost he agreed then that small smile of his curled his lips the sidhe never lie meredith but shading the truth is a longhonored pastime among us im very well aware of that i said my voice held enough sarcasm to fill the van his smile flashed suddenly white in the darkness of his face as are we all princess as are we all i dont think its worth the risk rhys said i shook my head we had this conversation once rhys i do think its worth the risk i looked up at frost how about you he turned to doyle what do you think i would not risk merediths safety for anything but we are badly in need of allies and a sidhe that has been exiled from faerie for a century might be willing to risk much to come back youre suggesting that maeve wants to help meredith to be queen doyle made it half question half statement if meredith is queen then she could offer maeve a return to faerie i do not think that taranis would risk allout war for one returned exile you really think a royal of the seelie court would be willing to come to the unseelie court i asked frost looked down at me whatever prejudices maeve reed might once have had against the unseelie she has been without the touch of fey hands for a century he raised my hand to his mouth kissed my fingertips blowing his breath along each of them before he touched me it brought shivers up and down my skin he spoke with his mouth just above my skin i know what it is to want the touch of another sidhe and be denied i at least had the court and the rest of faerie to comfort me i cannot imagine her loneliness all these years the last was said in a whisper his eyes had gone solid raincloud grey it took effort but i drew my attention away from frost to look at doyle do you think hes right do you think shes looking for a way back into faerie he shrugged making the leather of his jacket creak with the movement who can say but i know that after a century of isolation i certainly would be i nodded all right then were agreed we go in we are not agreed rhys said im going in under protest fine protest all you want but youre outvoted if something really awful happens to us in there i get to say i told you so i nodded if were alive long enough for you to say it knock yourself out sweet goddess if we die that quickly ill just have to come back and haunt you if theres anything in there that can kill you rhys ill have died long before you he frowned at me even through the beard i could see it that isnt comforting merry that isnt comforting at all but he turned around to face the big gates and leaned out his open window to press the intercom and announce our presence though i was betting that she knew we were there shed had forty years to bespell this land conchenn goddess of beauty and charisma knew we were here chapter ethan kane wasnt as tall as he seemed he actually was about rhyss height but always seemed bigger as if he took up more room in some way that had nothing to do with physical size his short hair was a dark brunette almost but not quite black he wore glasses with no frames so they were almost invisible on his face ethan should have been handsome he was broad shouldered athletically built square jawed with a deep dimple in his chin the eyes behind the glasses were longlashed and hazel his clothes were tailored to his body so hed fit in with the stars he usually ran with he had everything going for him but personality he always seemed to be disapproving of something a perpetual sour expression stole all his charm he stood with one hand gripping the other wrist feet wide apart balanced he frowned down at us from just outside maeve reeds large double doors we were all standing at the foot of the marble steps that led up to those doors ethans men were ranged among the graceful sweep of white pillars that supported the roof of maeve reeds narrow porch it was huge and imposing but there was no room to put out chairs and have iced tea on hot summer nights it was a porch for looking at not for enjoying four men obviously hired muscle ranged on the steps between us and ethan and the door i recognized one of them max corbin was nearing fifty hed been a bodyguard in hollywood most of his adult life he was an inch shy of six feet and built like a box all angles squares including huge knuckled hands his grey hair was cut in a long butch cut which made it look stylish and cutting edge but max had had the same haircut for forty years his nose had been badly broken enough times that it was crooked and just a little squashed he probably could have traded his designer suit for a nose job and fixed it but max thought it made him look tough it did hi max i said he nodded at me ms gentry or should i say princess meredith ms gentry is just fine he smiled a quick flash of humor before ethans voice cut across us both and maxs face went back to blank bodyguard stare that stare says we see nothing and will remember nothing and we see everything and will react at the blink of an eye your secrets are safe with us and so is your body bodyguards do not work in hollywood if they get a reputation for tattling to the press or anyone else what are you doing here meredith ethan and i didnt know each other well enough to use first names but that was okay because i was going to do the same to him were here at ms reeds invitation ethan why are you here he blinked at me the slightest flexing of shoulders letting me know that something was bothering him or his shoulder holster didnt fit quite right were ms reeds bodyguards i nodded smiled i figured that you must not have been on the job long what makes you say that i felt the smile widen youve got most of your muscle here if kane and hart were all booked up wed be getting more referrals his frown deepened ive got a lot more than just four employees meredith and you know it he said my name like it was a bad word i nodded i did know it is there a reason youre keeping us out here ethan ms reed was very concerned that we see her today not tonight but today i glanced up at the sun sinking behind a stand of eucalyptus trees near the distant sweep of wall its late afternoon ethan if you keep us out here much longer itll be night it was an exaggeration we had hours of daylight left but i was tired of standing around state your business and maybe well let you in ethan said i sighed i was about to be blunt even for a human being it was beyond blunt for a fey but i just didnt care i wanted to go away someplace quiet and think frost was standing a little back and to one side and doyle mirrored him but they both stood so that they were somehow clearly facing off with the bodyguards on the steps rhys was standing nearly in front of max grinning at him max was almost as big a humphrey bogart fan as rhys theyd spent one long afternoon trapped together on a long bodyguard job different clients trading film noir trivia theyd been friends ever since kitto did not face off with the last bodyguard he stood just a little behind me almost but not quite hiding he looked oddly out of place in his shortshorts tank top and childsize nikes hed put on black wraparound sunglasses but aside from that he could have passed for someones nephew the kind that usually isnt a nephew at all but a boy toy kitto always managed to give off the vibe that he was subservient someones toy or victim i had no idea how hed survived among the goblins i looked at everyone facing off ethan standing on the steps like some slightly taller version of napoleon and shook my head ethan you want to know why ms reed called us when shes already hired you youre wondering if youre all about to be replaced he started to protest i said ethan please save it for someone who cares ill save you all the power plays ms reed hasnt told us exactly why she wants us here but she wanted to talk to me not my guards so i think were all safe in assuming she doesnt want us for bodyguard duty if his frown deepened any more it looked like it might actually hurt his forehead we dont do just bodyguard work meredith were detectives too why does she need you the unsaid part when she has us hung in the air between us i shrugged i dont know ethan truly i dont but if you let us inside we can all find out together the frown smoothed slowly away leaving his face younger and puzzled thats almost nice of you meredith then he looked suspicious as if wondering what i was up to i can be very nice if people give me the chance ethan max spoke low so that ethan couldnt hear him and how nice can you be rhys answered voice low very very nice the two of them shared one of those masculine laughs that women never seem to be able to participate in but are always the subject of is something funny ethan asked the sour look back in place his voice whip sharp max shook his head as if he didnt trust himself to speak rhys actually answered just passing the time of day mr kane were not paid to pass the time of day were paid to keep our clients safe he gave a look that somehow took all of us in one big sweep wed be pisspoor bodyguards if we let all of you inside the house especially armed i shook my head you know that doyle wont let me go anywhere without bodyguards and you also know that they wont give up their guns he smiled an unpleasant smile then you dont get in standing on the hard driveway in my threeinch heels under the sun that was beginning to make sweat bead on my skin i just didnt want to mess with it i did probably the most unprofessional thing ive ever done i started yelling at the top of my voice maeve reed maeve reed come out to play its princess meredith and her entourage i kept yelling the first part maeve reed maeve reed come out to play ethan tried to yell me down a few times but id had voice training years of public speaking i was louder none of ethans people knew what to do i wasnt hurting anyone i was just yelling five minutes of confusion and a young woman opened the door she was marie ms reeds personal assistant would we like to come inside yes we would it took another ten minutes to get us through the door because ethan wanted to take our weapons it took marie hinting that ms reed would fire them all before he backed down max and rhys were laughing so hard that we had to leave them outside hanging on to each other like a couple of drunks at least someone was enjoying themselves chapter maeve reeds living room was larger than my entire apartment offwhite carpet stretched like a vanilla sea down the steps to the sunken living room and a fireplace big enough to roast small elephants the mantel alone took up most of one white stuccoed wall with red and tan bricks punctuating the rough whiteness of the wall a white sectional sofa big enough to seat twenty curved in front of the fireplace tan gold and white pillows were thrown around artfully there was a grouping of white chairs with a small pale wood table between them a chessboard with oversize pieces sat between the two chairs and a curving tiffany floor lamp provided a splash of color in the otherwise monochrome room a painting to one side of the fireplace echoed the lamps colors and a second conversational group of white chairs and cushions was set on the raised edge of the room opposite the entrance a large white christmas tree stood in the center of the chairs the tree was covered in white lights with gold and silver ornaments that should have livened the room but didnt the tree was just another decoration without life or feeling to it a table was pushed to one side to make room for the christmas tree with what looked like lemonade and iced tea in tall pitchers a few more paintings were scattered throughout the room most of them matching the color scheme of the lamp the room screamed interior decorator and probably said nothing about maeve reed except that she had money and let other people decorate her home when a person doesnt have a single mismatched thing in a room down to the last light on the christmas tree then its not real its just for show marie was tall slender dressed in a sleek oysterwhite pantsuit that did not flatter her olive complexion or her short brunette hair in her highheeled boots she was a touch over six feet a tall smiling twentysomething ms reed will be joining us presently would anyone like refreshments she motioned toward the table set with tea and lemonade actually it would have been nice but it was a rule that you never took any food or drink from a fellow fey until you were sure they meant you no harm it wasnt poison you had to worry about but spells a little potion mixed in with the lemons thank you marie is it were fine i said she smiled nodded then please sit down make yourselves comfortable while i tell ms reed youre here she moved at a graceful stride down the steps and across to the far opening that led into a white hallway that vanished somewhere deep within the house i glanced at ethan and his two muscle men hed left one of his people outside with max and rhys marie hadnt offered them refreshments since i guess you didnt have to entertain the hired help which begged the question if we werent going to be hired help then what were we going to be did maeve reed really just want to visit with other highcourt sidhe would she risk breaking a century of taboo to have small talk i didnt think so but id seen royals of the high courts do sillier things for less reason i went down the steps to the large sectional sofa kitto followed me like a shadow i glanced back at the men come on boys lets all sit down and pretend that we like each other i moved about seven feet from the end of the couch and sat down adjusting the tan and gold pillows smoothing my skirt in place kitto curled at my feet though goddess knew there were enough couches for everyone i didnt make him get up because even through the dark glasses i could see his nervousness the big white living room seemed to have triggered his agoraphobia he sat pressed up against my legs one small arm encircling them like i was his teddy bear the men were still standing in the large open archway eyeing one another gentlemen i said lets all sit down a good bodyguard doesnt relax on the job ethan said you know we arent a threat to ms reed ethan i dont know who youre supposed to be protecting her from but it isnt us they may clean up for the press but i know what they are meredith ethan said and what would that be doyles deep voice rumbled through the room causing echoes in the archway ethan actually jumped i had to turn my face away to hide the smile youre unseelie ethan stretched that last word out made it hiss i looked back at them doyle stood facing him his back to me i couldnt tell what he was thinking and i probably couldnt have told even if id seen his face doyle did better blank face than anyone id ever met frost was standing closer to the unknown muscle man his face the arrogant mask he wore in court even the new muscle was keeping pretty blank except for a certain nervous flicker around the eyes but ethan ethan had a fine angry tremble to his hands he was staring at doyle as if he hated him youre just jealous ethan jealous that most of the major stars prefer a sidhe warrior at their back instead of you youve bewitched them he said i raised an eyebrow at that me personally he made a small angry gesture toward the two warriors i think it would have been a large angry gesture but he was worried about how doyle would take it they have ethan ethan another male voice called from across the room ive told you before that that is simply not true i knew at a glance that it was one of the hart brothers he was walking down the steps toward me before i was certain it was julian hart jordon and julian were identical twins both with medium brown hair cut very short on the sides and left just a little long on top so that they could gel it into short spikes very hip very now they were both six feet both handsome enough to model which they had done briefly in their early twenties to raise startup money for their detective agency julians jacket was a deep burgundy satin over a pair of ordinary but designer burgundybrown pinstriped pants he wore shiny black loafers with no socks so that you got flashes of his tanned feet as he moved gracefully through the room his eyes were hidden behind yellow tinted glasses that on anyone else would have clashed with the clothes but on julian they looked just right i started to rise to greet him but he said no no my fair merry stay seated ill come to you he walked around the couch eyes flicking to the four men still standing in the archway ethan darling ive told you time and again that the sidhe warriors are not doing a thing to attract our business away from us they are merely more exotic more beautiful than anything we have on staff he took my hand and gave it a negligent kiss before flopping gracefully down beside me one arm flung across my shoulders so that we sat like a couple he spoke back over his shoulder you know what hollywood is like ethan any star guarded by a warrior is guaranteed publicity i think some people are making things up just so they can be escorted that has been my experience frost said the unnamed muscle standing closest to him flinched what stories had ethan been telling the others about the unseelie and who wouldnt wish to be accompanied by you frost julian said frost just looked at him grey eyes very still julian laughed and hugged me you are the luckiest girl i know merry are you sure you wont share hows adam julian laughed adam is purrrfectly wonderful and he laughed again adam kane was ethans older brother and julians lover theyd been a couple for at least five years now when they were in private where they didnt get hostile comments from strangers they still acted like newlyweds julian fluttered his hand in the air come gentlemen come and sit down i glanced back no one had moved doyle and frost wont move until ethan and the new man do julian turned around to look at them all frank julian said our newest recruit the man was tall lanky and looked young freshfaced wetbehindtheears young he did not look like a frank a cody maybe or a josh nice to meet you frank i said frank looked from me to the stillscowling ethan finally he gave a small nod he looked as if he wasnt sure that being friendly to us would help his chances of staying employed ethan julian said all the senior partners discussed your views on the sidhe warriors you were outvoted his voice had lost all of that teasing quality and was now low and serious and full of something very like a threat i wondered what the threat was ethan kane was one of the founding partners of their firm could you fire a founding partner ethan julian said sit down his voice held a note of command id never heard before for just a second i wondered if id gotten the wrong twin jordon was more likely to turn to force while julian was more the joking diplomat i studied his profile and no the dimple was just a touch deeper at the corner of his mouth the cheeks a fraction less sculpted it was julian what had been happening behind the scenes of kane and hart to put such hardness in his voice whatever it was it was enough because ethan started moving down the steps frank followed him doyle and frost watched them for a moment then slowly followed them around the room ethan sat on the section opposite me frank sat down like he wasnt sure he was allowed he placed himself far enough away from ethan not to crowd him doyle sat on the other side of me opposite julian hed made a point of sitting there and forcing frost one seat over hed murmured meredith needs to concentrate it hit me suddenly that hed been calling me meredith for a little while i was usually the princess or princess meredith although hed called me meredith at the beginning when he first got to la hed distanced himself with language about the time he distanced himself physically frost was clearly not happy about the seating arrangements but i doubted that anyone but one of us noticed the slight stiffness to his shoulders spoke volumes if you knew what book you were reading id spent a lot of time learning to read this book doyle knew all his mens moods like any good leader kitto might have been oblivious but it was hard to know what the little goblin noticed and what he didnt julian stayed pressed to my side a lot closer to me than doyle was sitting though he moved his hand to let doyles shoulder touch mine it also put julians hand on the back of the couch touching doyles back julian was in love with adam i knew that but i also knew that he wasnt entirely kidding about me sharing my men maybe he and adam had a special arrangement or maybe no one could be around the sidhe and not wonder maybe julian was stiffer quieter beside me now as if he were concentrating on not moving his hand too much doyle would tolerate the touch but not if it was too much doyle had the same rules for uninvited men as for uninvited women a thousand years of forced celibacy had made doyle and many of the guards make very unfeylike rules about casual touching if you couldnt complete the act then teasing was too much like torture rhys had always had different rules as had galen they preferred something to nothing ethan looked at the two guards his scowl deepening his eyes flicked to kitto and disgust showed on his face whats your problem ethan i asked he blinked and glared at me i just dont like monsters no matter how pretty they are julian took his arm off the couch and sat forward leaning toward the other man am i going to have to send you home youre not my father or my brother that last was said with a lot of heat did ethan have a problem with julian dating his brother julian leaned back a little his head to one side as though hed just thought of something new were not going to air our private business in front of anyone no matter how charming but if you cant deal with this assignment then ill call adam and the two of you can change jobs he wont have a problem with meredith being here he doesnt have a problem with a lot of things ethan said and the heat was very clearly directed toward julian ill call adam and tell him youll be heading his way julian took a small cell phone from an inner jacket pocket im in charge of this operation julian youre just here in case we need magical backup julian sighed gazing at the phone in his hand if youre in charge ethan then act like it because right now youre embarrassing yourself in front of these good people people ethan stood doing his best to tower over us these arent people theyre nonhumans a clear ringing voice came from behind ethan well if thats how you feel mr kane perhaps i was in error when i employed your agency maeve reed was standing in the hallway on the edge of the vanilla carpet sea she didnt look happy chapter maeve reed was using magic to appear more human she was tall slender with a bare swell of hips to rum the line of her tan slacks her longsleeved blouse was pale harvest gold unbuttoned to midchest giving tantalizing glimpses of tanned flesh and the edge of small firm breasts if id tried wearing something like that id have fallen out all over the place she was built like most of the top fashion models except she didnt have to starve or exercise to look like this it was just the way she looked a thin brown headband kept her long blond hair in place the hair hung straight and fine to her waist her skin was a nice medium tan after all the immortal dont have to sweat skin cancer her makeup was so light and so artful that at first i thought she wasnt wearing any the bones of her face were sculpted and lovely and the eyes were a startling drowning blue she was beautiful as she came toward us but it was a human beauty she was hiding herself from us maybe it was habit by now or maybe she had her reasons julian was on his feet meeting her before she got to the couch he murmured to her probably apologizing for ethan and his unfortunate nonhuman comment she shook her head making her tiny gold earrings shiver if this is how he really feels about the fey then i think he would be more comfortable working elsewhere ethan walked around the couch too i have no problem with you ms reed youre seelie court the bringers of beauty and wishes he pointed at us a little dramatically i thought they are the stuff of nightmares and should not be allowed in this house they are a danger to you and to everyone around them how much business are you losing to us i asked and for some reason my voice carried into the sudden silence ethan turned on me probably to say something else unfortunate julian grabbed his arm it looked like a firm grip from where i was sitting ethans body reacted as if hed been hit and for a second i thought wed get to see a fight just go ethan julian said voice low ethan yanked free of julian he gave a stiff little bow to ms reed ill go but i just want you to understand that i know the seelie are different from what the unseelie are i have not set foot in the seelie court for over a century mr kane i will never be a member of it again ethan frowned i think hed thought ms reed would agree with him normally he was sullen and unpleasant but not to this degree we must have really been cutting into their business ethan fumbled over some more apologies then stomped out after the door slammed behind us i said is he like that often julian shrugged ethan isnt fond of a lot of people im feeling terribly neglected here julian with ethan gone and all maeve said i blinked at her smiling carefully beautiful face she looked so sincere even her blueblue eyes sparkled with the force of it she was working just a little hard at being charming and human it would have been a whole lot easier to be charming if shed dropped the glamour she was wasting in order to appear humanly rather than inhumanly beautiful julian glanced at me then turned his full smiling self on maeve reed in his own way julian was turning on the charm too i realized with a start that he had his own personal glamour it might have been actual conscious magic but i doubted it most personal glamour that bolsters charisma is accidental for humans most of the time i watched them doing a minor job of shining at each other and realized that the charm wasnt for our benefit i glanced behind me at frank he was staring at her as if hed never really seen a woman before or at least not one like this maeve reed was trying to be inhumanly charming but still humanly beautiful for the benefit of her human bodyguards not us she would have used more special effects if the show had been for us ms reed julian gushed moving in to take her elbow steering her away from us we would never neglect you youre not only our client but one of the most precious objects weve ever been asked to guard we would lay our lives down for you what more can men do when they worship a woman i thought he was laying it on a bit thick but i hadnt spent any time around maeve reed maybe she liked the compliments thick she managed a delicate blush that i knew was magic and not real i could feel it in the air sometimes the most simple physical changes take the most magic she slid her arm through his and lowered her voice enough that we couldnt hear what was said oh we could have eavesdropped but that would have been rude and she would probably have sensed the spell we didnt want to antagonize the goddess not yet anyway they turned back to face us both smiling both charming her grip on his arm very firm something in julians eyes was trying to give me a message but i couldnt quite read it behind his hip yellow tinted glasses ms reed has persuaded me to remain at her side for the duration of your visit he raised an eyebrow as he spoke and finally i got the message ms reed had hired kane and hart to protect her from us she was afraid of the unseelie court enough that she wouldnt be alone with us without backup both magical and physical although her magic thrummed through this house this land these walls she still feared us youd think the fey wouldnt be so superstitious especially about other fey but they often are my father said it came from knowing almost nothing about any other fey culture but the one we were born into ignorance breeds fear thered been so much magic inside maeves walls that almost from the moment wed driven through the gates id begun to not hear it it was a skill you learned if you spent too much time in and around majorbrouhaha magic you had to deaden its touch or you spent all your time sensing the constant magic around you and it deadened you to newer spells more immediate dangers it was like being bombarded by a hundred radio stations at once if you tried to listen to all of them you heard nothing i looked into maeve reeds smiling unreadable face and shook my head i turned to look at doyle i tried to ask with my eyes and face how rude and how human i was allowed to be today he seemed to understand because he gave a tiny nod i took it to mean i could be as rude and human as i wanted i hoped that was what it meant because i was just about to pay several mortal insults to the golden goddess of hollywood chapter i walked around the couch to greet the goddess kitto followed me and i had to make him stayby the couch left to his own devices hed have stayed glued to my side like an overly devoted puppy i smiled toward maeve and julian i cant tell you what an honor it is to meet you ms reed i held out my hand and she took one hand off of julians arm long enough to shake she gave me just the tips of her fingers it wasnt so much a handshake as a touch id seen a lot of women who didnt know how to shake hands but maeve hadnt even really tried maybe i was supposed to take her hand and kneel but if she was waiting for genuflecting she was in for a long wait i had one queen and one queen only maeve reed may have been a queen of hollywood but that just wasnt the same thing i knew my face looked puzzled but i couldnt decide what was going on behind that lovely face of hers we needed to know you really did hire kane and hart to protect you from us didnt you maeve turned a perfect look on me pleasant bemused incredulous eyes wide beautifully lipsticked mouth open in a small o it was a look for a camera for a screen that would make her face twenty feet tall it was a face to win over audiences and the heads of studios it was a great face but it wasnt that great a simple yes or no will suffice ms reed im sorry she said voice apologetic face soft eyes a little confused her grip on julians arm was too tight it gave a lie to that casual confused act did you hire kane and hart to protect you from us she gave the laugh that people magazine had once called the fivemilliondollar laugh the one where her eyes crinkled and her face shone and her mouth was just a little open what a strange idea i assure you ms gentry i am not afraid of you shed avoided a direct answer she wasnt afraid of me that much had to be true because it is taboo among us to truly lie if doyle hadnt suggested in the van that i be rude id have let it go because pursuing it relentlessly would have been more than rude it would have been insulting and duels had started over less but only among highborn sidhe could one be expected to know the rules we were counting on maeve assuming id been raised by savages unseelies and humans are you afraid of my guards then i asked the laughter was still making her face shine her eyes sparkle as she looked at me whatever gave you such an absurd idea you did she shook her head sending that long yellow sheet of hair sliding around her body the glow of the laughter still shone in her face and her eyes were just a little more blue i realized suddenly that it wasnt the glow of laughter which should have faded but a very subtle type of glamour she was purposefully making herself glow just a little and if she was glowing she was using magic to try to persuade me to believe her i frowned because i couldnt feel magic being used against me usually when another sidhe uses magic you know it i glanced behind me at the guards doyle and frost were standing but they were unreadable now imperious even kitto was still standing beside the couch where id left him one small hand had a death grip on the white back as if touching anything was better than standing untouched i wondered if he was feeling things i couldnt i was only part fey i was always willing to believe that id missed parts by that mixed heritage id gained things too being able to do major magic surrounded by metal for instance but with every gain there can be a loss ms reed ill ask you one more time did you hire kane and hart to protect you from my guards what i told julian and his men was that i had some overzealous fans i didnt bother to look at julian for confirmation i believe thats what you told julian ms reed now whats the real reason that you hired them she stared at me with mock horror or maybe it was real she glanced at frost and doyle and said have you taught her no manners she has what manners she needs doyle said a look flickered through maeves eyes fear i think she looked back to me and down in those softly glowing blue eyes that flicker remained she was afraid very very afraid but of what did you really hire julian and his people because of some overzealous fan stop this she whispered do you really believe that we will harm you i asked no she said and she said it too quickly as if she was relieved to finally be able to give a straightforward answer then why are you afraid of us why are you doing this to me she asked and her voice held all the sorrow of every maiden who had ever asked that question of a lover gone astray it tightened my throat to hear it julian looked stricken i think youve asked enough questions meredith i shook my head no i havent i met those painfilled blue eyes and said ms reed you dont have to hide yourself from us i dont know what you mean that is entirely too close to a lie i said softly her eyes suddenly looked like blue crystal and i realized i was seeing those blueblue eyes through the shine of unshed tears then the tears slid slowly down her golden cheeks and as they fell the blue of her eyes blurred changed still blue but tricolored like my own there was a wide outer edge of rich deep blue like a bright sapphire then a much thinner ring of melted copper and an equally thin circle of liquid gold around the dark point of her pupil but what set her eyes apart even among the sidhe was that the gold and copper trailed out across her iris like streaks of color in a good piece of lapis lazuli so that metallic glints shone out from that ring of faultless deep blue her eyes were like a stormy blue sky shattered by colored lightning in the forty years shed been a movie star no camera had ever seen these eyes her real eyes im sure some agent or studio head had long ago convinced her to hide the least human of her features id hidden what i was and what i looked like for only three years and it had killed parts of me to do it maeve reed had done it for decades she kept her eyes averted from julian as if she didnt want him to see them i took her hand from julians arm she tried to fight me and i didnt tug on her i just kept a light pressure on her wrist until she raised the hand of her own accord then i took her hand full in mine cradling it i knelt in front of her and brought her hand to my lips i laid the lightest of touches on that golden hand and said you have the most beautiful eyes i have ever seen maeve reed she took her other hand from julians grip and just stood there staring down at me tears streaming like crystal drops down her cheeks slowly she let the rest of the glamour go the tan began to fade or change until she was no longer honey brown but an overall soft gold her hair grew paler blond and blonder until it was almost a white blond i could not imagine why shed changed her hair to the more standard yellow blond either color was well within human standards i held both her hands in mine while she stripped away a century of lies and stood before me a shining thing suddenly there seemed to be more colors in the room a breath of sweet scented flowers that grew thousands of miles away from this desert place she gripped my hands as if they were her only anchor as if she might vanish into the light and sweetness if i let her go she threw back her head eyes closed and her golden glow filled the room as if a small sun had suddenly risen before me she glowed and she cried and she held my hands so hard it hurt somewhere during all of it i found i was crying too and her glow had called my own so that my skin looked as if it were filled with moonlight she came to her knees beside me looking wonderingly at my hands and hers one glow pressed against the other she began to laugh joyously a little hysterically somewhere in all the laughter i could make out her words and i thought the men were the danger she leaned into me suddenly and pressed her lips to mine i was so startled by the kiss that i simply froze for a second what i would have done if shed given me time to think i dont know because she jerked away from me and ran back out the way shed come chapter julian had gone after maeve it left young frank standing by the exit looking lost his eyes were too large in his pale startled face i doubted frank had ever seen a sidhe in her full power i was still kneeling the glow beginning to fade from my skin when doyle came to stand beside me princess are you well i looked up at him and realized i must have looked a little startled myself i could feel the heat on my mouth where her lips had touched mine it was like id taken a sip of spring sunshine princess i nodded im all right but my voice came out hoarse and i had to clear my throat before i said ive just never i tried to put it into words she tasted like sunshine and until this second i didnt know that sunshine tasted like anything doyle knelt beside me and spoke softly it is always difficult to be touched by those who hold such elemental powers i frowned at him she said she thought it was the men she needed to be afraid of what did she mean by that think how you were after just a few years alone out here and magnify that by a human century i felt my eyes widen you mean shes attracted to me i shook my head before he could say anything shes attracted to the first sidhe shes touched in a hundred years do not underestimate yourself meredith but i have never heard it said that conchenn was a lover of women so yes it is the touch of sidhe flesh that she craves i sighed i cannot blame her and then another thought occurred to me you dont think shes invited us here to ask if ill share one of you with her doyles dark eyebrows raised over the top of his sunglasses i had not thought of such a thing he seemed to be thinking about what id said i suppose it is possible he frowned but it would be the height of rudeness to ask such a thing we are not merely your lovers but potential husbands it is not casual you said it yourself doyle shes been alone for a century a hundred years might wear down anyones sense of politeness there was movement behind us we turned to find frost already on his feet facing the entrance it was rhys what have you guys been doing in here what do you mean i asked he gestured at doyle and me kneeling on the floor there was still the faintest of glows to my skin like a memory of moonlight i let doyle help me to my feet i was strangely unsteady maeve had caught me off guard true but id been touched a great deal more by other sidhe and not been this shaken i spoke maeve reed dropped her glamour rhyss eye widened i felt it outside youre telling me that all she did was drop her glamour i nodded he gave a low whistle sweet goddess and that is the point doyle said rhys looked at him what do you mean we have all been worshipped in the past but for most of us it is in the long past for conchenn it has been less than three hundred years she was still being worshipped in europe when we were asked to leave so youre saying that shes got more power because she was being worshipped rhys asked not more power doyle said but more oomph i suggested i am unfamiliar with the word he said more jazz more bite more crack to the whip i waved my hands in the air i dont know rhys knows what i mean he came down the three steps to the living room yeah i know what you mean shes got more of a charge to her magic doyle finally nodded i will accept that frost came to stand with us doyle looked at him from behind dark glasses and the bigger man hesitated frowning i have an insight to add my captain the two men carefully measured each other i interrupted whats wrong with you two if frost has something to add then let him say it frost continued to look at doyle as if waiting finally doyle gave one quick nod frost gave a small bow i have watched movies on merediths television set i have seen how humans react to these movie stars their adoration of the actors is a type of worship we all looked at him it was rhys who whispered lord and lady if anyone could prove that shes been worshipped he let his voice trail off doyle finished the thought for him then there would be grounds to exile us all from this country the one thing we were forbidden to do was set ourselves up to be worshipped as gods i shook my head she did not set herself up to be worshipped as a deity she was just trying to earn a living the men thought about that for a few seconds then finally doyle nodded the princess is correct by law i dont think maeve intended to get around the law i said he shook his head i do not mean to imply otherwise but whatever her intent she has the added benefit of having been worshipped by humans for the last forty years a human movie star cannot take advantage of that kind of energy exchange but maeve is sidhe and she will know exactly how to use such energy what does that say about the models and actors in europe that have sidhe blood in them i asked or even the royal families of europe sidhe had to marry into all the royal houses of europe to cement the last great treaty are they all taking extra benefit from their human admirers it is not something i can speak to doyle said ill take a guess at it rhys said doyle frowned at him and the look was clear even through the dark glasses we are not paid to guess rhys grinned through his fake beard think of it as an extra plus when you hire me doyle lowered the glasses enough for rhys to see his eyes ooh rhys said then laughing he said ill bet that anyone with enough sidhe blood in them can gain power from all that human adoration they may not be aware of it but how else do you explain the successful reigns of the royal houses with the highest percentage of sidhe blood all are still active while the houses that took the sidhe only once treated it like a plague and stopped and they have died out julian came back into the room ms reed has requested that this meeting continue out by the pool unless there is some strong objection against it i dont see a problem with taking this outside on such a beautiful day i said nor i doyle said the others agreed everyone but kitto he was still huddled by the couch i finally had to go to him and take his hand he whispered it will be very open and very bright out there kitto had spent centuries inside the dark cramped tunnels of the goblin mound id always wondered why in the old stories the goblins always fought under a dark sky as if they brought the darkness of the ground with them if they were all as bothered by openness and light as kitto maybe they couldnt have fought without their darkness or maybe it was just kitto i shouldnt make such a wide assumption based on only one goblin i took his hand in mine and led him like a child you can stay by me if it gets to be too much frost can take you back to the van is there some problem julian asked hes agoraphobic oh my julian said if he wishes to remain here in la hes got to work on it i said julian gave a small nod of his head almost a bow as you like he is your employee kitto was one of the few guards who did not work for the agency he just wasnt suited for that kind of work i wasnt sure what kind of work he was suited for but it wasnt bodyguard work and it wasnt detecting but i didnt correct julian about kittos status if youre sure julian made it a question i gripped kittos hand more firmly im sure then follow me princess gentlemen he started down the hallway that maeve had fled down and we followed doyle insisted on walking first and insisted that frost go last i ended up in the middle with rhys on one side and kitto on the other rhys took my other hand and tried to get me to skip down the hallway while he hummed were off to see the wizard under his breath chapter julian led us through one expensive room after another until we ended up at the pool it was blue and flashed light like a broken mirror maeve sat in the shadow of a big umbrella she was wrapped tightly in a white silk robe shed given us the briefest glimpse of a gold and white bathing suit before tying the robe tightly in place so that only her perfectly pedicured feet showed she was smoking taking furious puffs and grinding out the cigarette before it was halfway done julian had been granted the unenviable task of lighting the cigarettes for her with a gold lighter from the small tray that held the cigarette box lighting the cigs wasnt the unenviable part of the job trying to calm maeve down was the hard part she had put her glamour back on like a wellworn shirt she was still beautiful but she looked like maeve reed the movie star again though a very stressed version anxiety flowed off of her in waves the other bodyguards including young frank and max had come back to stand around the pool and look menacing some of the menacing seemed to be directed at us but we didnt take it personally or at least i didnt i wasnt percent sure about my men whatever they felt they were keeping it to themselves maeve insisted on all of us sitting in full sun i wasnt sure why but i could guess superstition said that the unseelie court couldnt abide sunlight in truth some could not but no one with me had that problem kittos eyes were light sensitive but nothing he couldnt handle with dark glasses i didnt burst maeves bubble she was still obviously shaken making sure all that lovely body was covered by the silk robe and shed moved from smoking to drinking while we got arranged in chairs at least the alcohol didnt invade my stomach without my consent so personally i found it a step up if maeve got drunk i might change my mind julian sat on a much smaller chair pulled up beside her lounge chair shed insisted on him being close enough that his shoulder touched the back of her chair the rest of the kane and hart bodyguards stood at her back like three ladiesinwaiting albeit muscular wellarmed ladiesinwaiting maeve had also insisted that i have my own lounge chair i was a little too short and so was my skirt for a lounge chair but i took it graciously i just had to pay attention that i didnt flash too much leg and underwear if it had just been other fey i wouldnt have cared so much but with more humans than fey standing around wed try to stay polite by human standards besides id found years ago that if i let a bunch of strange human men see my underwear they tended to get the wrong idea fey males would have enjoyed the show and never remarked on it doyle and frost stood at my back like good bodyguards rhys had gone with the personal assistant marie to take off his disguise maeve had seemed fascinated by the fact that hed used a human disguise instead of glamour to escape the presss attention either her glamour was better than ours or reporters simply didnt see her as anything but maeve reed movie star the word glamorous comes from the idea of faerie glamour maybe seeing the truth behind a movie stars facade just wasnt what the press wanted to see kitto sat beside me in his own little chair but he did everything but perch on the arm of my lounge chair julian tried to keep a distance between himself and maeve kitto made sure that he touched some part of my body continuously a human woman in her sixties came out of a nearby pool house she wore a maids outfit complete with apron though the skirt was suitably long and the shoes suitably sensible she offered us all drinks which we refused only maeve kept drinking winedark scotch shed started with ice but when it melted she didnt replace it although she finished off a fifth of scotch while we watched there was no change in her she was fey and we could drink a lot without getting even the least bit tipsy but a fifth of scotch is a fifth of scotch and i hoped shed drunk enough to quiet her nerves and would stop there she didnt im going to have rum and coke would anyone else care for anything no thank you i said i know that the men are working yours and mine so they shouldnt drink it might spoil their reflexes she put a little bit of the old maeve reed purr into her voice a pale imitation of her usual suggestiveness apparently i hadnt broken her completely but you and i can indulge im fine but thank you for offering a small frown appeared between those perfect brows i really do hate to drink alone im not much for scotch or rum we have an extensive wine cellar im sure we could find you something to suit your tastes she smiled not the dazzling smile shed started the visit with but a smile nonetheless it was an encouraging sign but i shook my head im sorry maeve but i really dont drink this early in the day early she said perfectly plucked eyebrow arching honey this isnt early by la standards if its after lunch its perfectly acceptable to be drinking i smiled gave a small shrug thanks but really im fine she frowned at that but nodded at the maid who went off toward the house to fetch maeves drink i assumed i really do hate to drink alone she said again im sure youve got a husband around here somewhere youll be meeting gordon later after weve finished our business there was no teasing now and what business would that be i asked its private i shook my head we went over this with your flunky earlier in our office where i go my bodyguards go i glanced at her own personal wall of muscle im sure you understand that she nodded impatiently of course i understand but could they all sit just a little farther back so we could have some girl talk i raised my eyebrows at the girl talk but let it go i glanced at doyle and frost what do you guys think i suppose we could sit at the table in the shade while you and ms reed have your girl talk doyle managed to put a lot of disbelief in that last phrase i hid my smile by turning my head and looking at kitto he wasnt going to want to be in the shade of the umbrella i didnt even bother to ask doyle and frost will sit at the table but kitto has to stay with me maeve shook her head that is not acceptable i shrugged its the best youre going to get if you insist on being outside in the open like this she cocked her head to one side that is awfully blunt for a princess of the sidhe in fact youve been very blunt nay rude for a princess of the blood i fought an urge to look back at doyle i could say i was raised out among the humans you could but i dont think ill believe you her voice was very quiet almost angry no one that human would be so favored by the lady and the lord as you were just moments ago she shivered pulling her robe tighter around her shoulders it was eighty and the sun was warm and soft if she was cold it wasnt the kind of cold that a robe could help i did the best bow i could sitting in the lounge chair thank you she shook her head sending her long yellow hair sliding around her body do not thank me for i shall not thank you for what you have done to me i started to tell her that it had been an accident but stopped maeve had deliberately used magic to try to persuade me it was a grave insult between one sidhe noble to another we never used wiles to that degree against another noble it showed clearly that she considered me a lesser fey so the rules of sidhe chivalry didnt apply to me she was looking at me curiously and i realized id been quiet for too long i managed a smile the sidhe have been speculating for centuries about why you left us i did not leave meredith i was cast out here at last was something i wanted to know your exile was the bogeyman for all the younger sidhe in the seelie court if you dont please the king youll end as conchenn did is that what they believed that i was exiled for not pleasing the king when pressed that is what the king says that you did not please him she laughed and it held derision so thick that it was almost painful to hear i suppose i didnt please him but didnt anyone question that such strict exile was a harsh punishment for merely not pleasing the king i nodded im told that some did question the severity of the punishment you had many friends at court i had allies at court no one truly has friends there i gave her credit for that as you like you had many allies at court i am told they did question your fate and there was a little too much eagerness to that one word she seemed to really want to know i wanted to say you answer my questions and ill answer yours but that was a little too crass subtlety that was what was needed subtle had never been my natural bent but i had learned eventually i was beaten for asking about your fate i said she blinked at me what as a child i asked why you were exiled and the king himself beat me for asking she looked puzzled had no one asked before they asked i said the expression on her face was enough to urge me on but i didnt finish the thought i avoided letting her turn around the conversation because i wanted to know why shed been exiled if shed kept her silence for a hundred years then i couldnt trust that shed easily break it now by the time i came along people had stopped asking what happened to my allies at court it was a very direct question and i couldnt pretend not to understand anymore the king killed emrys i said after that everyone was afraid to ask after your fate it was hard to tell but i think she paled under that golden tan her eyes went wide before she dropped her gaze to her lap she started to take a drink and found the tumbler empty she yelled nancy the maid appeared almost but not quite as if by magic she had a tray with a tall dark glass of rum a pair of whiterimmed sunglasses folded beside the drink shed also brought three swimsuits draped on her arm they were all expensive lovely and tiny most of the underwear i owned covered more than those suits and i owned a lot of lingerie they looked like ordinary if elegant swimsuits but appearance could be deceiving things can be done to clothes so the spell takes over only when the garment is worn nasty spells some of them for the first time i wondered not if maeve wanted to join our court but if there were people at the seelie court who wanted me dead would my death be enough to undo her exile only if the king himself wanted my death to my knowledge taranis didnt like me but he didnt fear me so my death should mean nothing to him maeve had stopped talking she was staring out at the pool but i dont think she truly saw it she was quiet for so long that i filled the silence why the swimsuits ms reed i said to call me maeve but she never looked at me and the phrase had a rehearsed quality as if she wasnt truly listening to her own words i smiled fine why the swimsuits maeve i thought you might want to get more comfortable thats all her voice still sounded flat like dialogue that shed planned to say but no longer cared about thank you but im fine as i am im sure i can find suits for your gentlemen too she finally looked at me while she spoke but her voice was still muted no thank you and i put enough force into the thank you that i thought shed take the hint maeve set the empty glass on the tray slipped the sunglasses on and only then took the new drink in hand she drained a quarter of it in one long swallow then looked at me the glasses were large and round with fat white rims and they were mirrored so that i could see a distorted reflection of myself as she moved her head her eyes and a large part of her face were completely hidden she didnt need glamour now she had something else to hide behind she pulled the robe closer to her neck and sipped the black rum even taranis would not dare to have emrys executed her voice was low but clear i think she was working on not believing me shed given herself enough time with her rehearsed bit about the swimsuits that shed thought about what id said she didnt like it so she was going to try to make it not true he wasnt executed i said and again i watched her waited for her to ask for more you often learned more by saying less she looked up from her drink making those mirrored glasses glint in the sun but you said taranis had had him killed no i said he killed emrys it was hard to tell behind the large sunglasses but i think she frowned you are playing word games with me meredith emrys was one of the few among the courts that i might truly have called friend if he was not executed then what are you hinting at assassination i shook my head not at all the king challenged him to a personal duel she jumped as if id struck her sloshing some of the rum over the white of the robe the maid offered her a linen napkin maeve handed the drink to the woman and began to wipe at her hand but not like she was paying attention to what she was doing the king does not take personal challenges he is too valuable to the court to risk on a duel i shrugged watching my image imitate me in her glasses i just report the news i dont explain it she put the napkin on the tray but refused the return of her drink she leaned forward still holding the robe closed at neck and thigh swear to me your solemn oath that the king slew emrys in a duel i give you my oath that this is true she leaned back suddenly as if all the energy had drained from her her hands were still feebly clutching at the robe but she looked halfswooned the maid asked are you all right is there anything you need maeve gave a weak wave no im fine shed answered the questions in reverse order a bit of a slip because she was obviously not all right so i was right her voice was very soft as she said the last you were right about what i asked voice equally soft i eased down to the foot of my own lounge chair so she would be sure to hear me she smiled then but it was weak and not at all humorous no you wont get my secret that easily i frowned and it was genuine i dont know what you mean her voice was more solid more certain of itself as she spoke why did you come here today meredith i sat back a little i came because you asked me she sighed loud and long not for effect this time but i think just because she needed to you risked taraniss anger simply to visit with another sidhe i think not i am heir to the unseelie throne do you really think taranis would risk harming me he challenged emrys to a personal duel for merely asking why i had been exiled you yourself were beaten as a child for asking about my fate now here you sit speaking with me he will never believe that i have not told you the reason for my exile but youve told me nothing i said and i tried to keep the eagerness out of my body language though i think i failed she gave another slight smile he will never believe that i have not shared my secret with you he can think what he likes to harm me would mean war between the courts i dont believe that any secret you have is worth that she laughed derisive again i think the king would risk war between the courts for this fine the king might risk a war where he could sit safely behind the front lines but queen andais would be within her rights to challenge him to oneonone combat i dont believe taranis would risk that you are the heir to the dark throne meredith you have no idea what power resides in the light ive seen the seelie court maeve and i agree that once youve fallen afoul of it youre afraid of the light but everyone fears the dark maeve everyone are you saying that the high king of the seelie court is afraid of the unseelie court her voice held an amazing amount of outraged disbelief i know everyone at the seelie court fears the sluagh maeve sat back in her chair everyone fears them meredith at both courts she was right if the unseelie court was all that was dark and frightening then the sluagh was worse the sluagh was home even to the things that the unseelie feared it was a dumping ground for nightmares too terrible to contemplate and who holds the reins of the sluagh i asked she looked uncertain but said at last the queen the sluagh can be sent to punish certain crimes without a trial or a warning one of those crimes is kin slaying that is not often enforced she said but if taranis killed the queens heir dont you think shed remember that little law even andais would not dare send the sluagh after the king and i say again that even the king would not dare slay andaiss heir i think you are wrong on that meredith for this he might dare and for that crime andais might loose the sluagh on him even the king of light and illusion would have no choice but to run from them she took the drink off the tray that the maid still held near at hand she took a deep drink before saying i do not believe that the king would think that clearly about this i i would not be the cause of war between the courts she took another drink i have wished for taraniss arrogance to be punished over the years but not by the sluagh i would not wish that on anyone not even him having been chased by the sluagh myself i could agree that they were terrible but they werent as bad as all that at least the sluagh would simply kill you maybe eat you alive but youd be dead there would be no torture no long slow death there were worse deaths than to fall to the sluagh and i knew something that maeve could not know the sluaghs king sholto lord of that which passes between called shadowspawn but never to his face had no great loyalty to andais or to anyone else for that matter he kept his word but andais had let her politics slide for a few years and now she depended heavily too heavily on the threat of the sluagh theyd been meant to be the threat of last resort id learned in talking with doyle and frost that the sluagh had become a muchused weapon that was not what they were meant for and it showed great weakness on andaiss part that she used them too often but maeve did not know this no one at the seelie court knew unless there were spies which come to think upon it there probably were but maeve didnt know it do you really think that the king will learn that we spoke together i asked i dont know for certain but he is a god or was once i fear he will discover us fine i want to know why you were exiled but you want something from me as well you want something that you would risk your very life for what could that be maeve what could be that important to you she leaned forward robe still closed tight she leaned forward until i could smell the cocoa butter from her skin and the harsh rum on her breath she whispered against my ear i want a child chapter i stayed leaning in shoulders almost touching with maeve because i didnt want her to see my face a child she wanted a child why tell me id thought of a lot of things maeve reed could want a baby had not been on the list i finally looked at her what would you have of me maeve that was the question she sat back in her chair settling with a small wriggling movement that reminded me of her old teasing i have told you what i would have of you meredith i stared at her frowning i know what you said maeve but i dont see i tried again i dont know how i can help you i put a little emphasis on the i because i had thought of one thing i had that she might need i had the men she looked around at the men all the men her bodyguards included you can understand now why i would want privacy for this discussion cant you there was a small thread of pleading in her voice i sighed i wanted to be politically savvy i wanted to be cautious but i did understand why she desired privacy some things supersede politics your side my side and one of those is the plea of womantowoman maeve had given that plea silently but it was still there mother help me but i couldnt pretend ignorance all right i said maeve put her head to one side all right to what privacy i felt both doyle and frost move behind me they didnt truly move not a step but they tensed so hard it was almost a jump princess doyle began its all right doyle you and the rest of the men can sit under the umbrella while we have our girl talk maeve frowned her pale pink lipsticked mouth pouting prettily she was definitely regaining her composure or maybe shed spent so many years as maeve reed sex goddess that she didnt know how else to behave i was hoping for a little more privacy than a few yards i smiled at her no pouting no pretense youve shown that youre willing to persuade me with magic it would be stupid of me to trust you completely the pout vanished replaced by thin almost angry lips youve proven you can best me at magic meredith i am not so stupid as to try my luck for a second time again i was pretty certain that i had not bested maeve at magic it was more that shed thrown her magic in my metaphysical face and my natural abilities had been awakened it hadnt been deliberate on my part in fact i wasnt percent certain that i could have duplicated it if id tried but maeve believed that i could do it at will and i wasnt going to dissuade her let her believe that i was wonderfully powerful and paranoid because i wasnt going anywhere completely out of sight of the men powerful and paranoid it was a recipe for royalty my guards can sit in the shade while we talk out here that is as much privacy as im willing to give you even for girl talk you dont trust me she said why should i she smiled you shouldnt you most certainly shouldnt she shook her head and sipped her rum then gazed at me over the rim of her glass youve refused all refreshment you fear poison or magic i nodded she laughed a delighted burst of sound id heard that selfsame laugh on the movie screen more than once i give you my most solemn oath nothing here shall harm you apurpose adding that last bit was nicely tricky it meant that if i did come to harm it wouldnt be her fault but it also meant that i could come to harm i had to smile such doubletalk was so much a part of the court where your word of honor was something youd fight to the death to defend i want your word of honor that no thing no person no animal no being of any kind will harm me while i am here the pout was back now meredith such a solemn oath i will give my word to protect your safety to the best of my ability i shook my head your word that no thing no person no animal no being of any kind will harm me while you are here she added i nodded while i am here if you had left that last little bit off id have been responsible for you always everywhere you go she shivered and i dont think it was pretense you go to the unseelie court and that is not a place i would wish to have to guarantee your safety everyone seems to feel that way maeve dont feel bad she frowned and again i think it was real i do not feel bad meredith it is not within my purview to guard your safety within those dark shadowed corridors i shrugged there is light and laughter within the darkling throng just as there is darkness and sorrow among the glittering throng i will not believe that the unseelie court holds the joyous wonders that await one at the seelie court i looked over my shoulder at doyle and frost i made it a long look then turned slowly back to maeve allowing their beauty to fill my eyes oh i dont know maeve there are joys to be had at the dark court i have heard tales of the debauchery that exists at queen andaiss court that made me laugh you have lived too long among the humans if you say debauchery with such distaste the joys of the flesh are a blessing to be shared not a curse to be guarded against as your wayward guard and my sweet marie should know she looked past me smiling rhys and marie were walking toward us rhyss white curls fell free to his waist again his boyishly handsome face was its usual cleanshaven self the pearlstudded eye patch was back in place he was smiling pleased with himself to the point of nearly laughing as if he knew some new joke marie trailed behind him her hair was a little less than perfect and her white shirt was untucked but she didnt look happy if maeves hint was true then marie would be smiling rhys had his faults but not putting a smile on a girls face was not one of them you couldnt really take him as seriously in or out of bed as some of the other guards but he was a lot of fun in bed i found myself frowning again if he had done something sexual with marie how did i feel about that he was after all mine exclusively mine according to the queen i tried to be hurt jealous or even miffed that he might have been playing slap and tickle with marie and i just wasnt maybe it was because i was sleeping with the other men maybe to be truly jealous you have to have some pretense of monogamy i didnt know why but it simply didnt bother me if hed had intercourse with her that would bother me because i was the one that we needed pregnant not some assistant to some star other than that i didnt seem to care rhys dropped to one knee in front of me which crowded kitto a little but the fact that he was willing to touch the little goblin was actually a very good sign he raised my hand to his lips grinning the lovely marie offered me her favors i raised my eyebrows and and it would have been rude to have ignored such an offer by fey standards he was right shes human not fey i said jealous he asked i shook my head smiling no he came to his feet in one smooth movement planting a quick kiss on my cheek i knew you were more fey than human marie was kneeling by maeve she kept her face turned away from us but shook her head and maeve turned a very frowny face to us marie said you refused her advances guard i made it clear that i found her lovely rhys said but you did not take advantage of her i am princess merediths lover why should i look elsewhere i showed your assistant the amount of attention she deserved no more no less the humor was gone from his face now and he seemed almost angry maeve petted the womans hand and sent her into the house marie very carefully avoided looking at rhys i think she was embarrassed maybe she didnt get turned down often or maybe maeve told her it was a sure thing i stood ive had enough games maeve she reached toward me but i was out of reach please meredith i meant no offense you sent your servant to seduce my lover you tried to seduce me not out of plain desire but out of a desire to gain control over me she stood in one swift motion that last is not true but you do not deny sending your servant to seduce my lover she took off the big sunglasses so i could see how confused she was i was betting it was an act you are unseelie court and all manner of temptations are open to you it was my turn to be confused what does my court have to do with anything you have insulted me and mine you are unseelie court she said again i shook my head what does that have to do with anything you would not try on the swimsuits she said voice soft eyes downcast what i asked if marie had seen him nude then she would have known his body was pure except for the scars i frowned harder what in the name of the lord and lady are you babbling about you are all unseelie court meredith i have to be sure you are not unclean you mean deformed i said and i didnt even try to keep the anger out of my voice she gave a small nod why should our bodies whatever they look like make any difference to you i told you what i want meredith i nodded and i was nice enough not to blurt out her secret in front of everyone though heaven knows she hadnt earned the courtesy if anyone who aids me in such an endeavor is impure then she sort of nodded at me trying to get me to finish the sentence in my head i leaned into her and hissed more than whispered the child will be deformed no amount of glamour could hide the smell of cocoa butter liquor and cigarette smoke in her hair and skin a sudden wave of nausea rushed over me i backed away from her and would have fallen if rhys hadnt caught me steadied me whats wrong he whispered i shook my head im tired of being here with this woman then we leave doyle said i shook my head again not yet i half clutched rhyss arm and turned back to maeve you tell me why you were exiled you tell me the whole truth here and now or we walk away from you forever if he knew i told anyone he would kill me if he finds out i was here talking to you do you really believe hell wait to find out if you told me she looked frightened now but i didnt care tell me maeve tell me or we walk and youll never find anyone else outside of faerie who can help you meredith please no i said the great pure seelie court how they look down on us if a child is born deformed then it is killed or was until you all stopped having children then even the monsters were precious do you know what happened to the babies after a while maeve do you know what happened in the last four hundred years or so to deformed seelie children because make no mistake inbreeding catches up even with the immortal i dont know yes you do all that bright shining throng know my own cousin was kept because she was part brownie you didnt throw her out because brownies are seelie not court but creatures of light but when the sidhe themselves breed monsters the pure shining seelie sidhe breed deformities monstrosities then what happens where do they go she was crying now soft silver tears i dont know yes you do the babies go to the unseelie court we take in the monsters those pure seelie monsters we take them in because we welcome everyone no one no one is turned away from the unseelie court especially not tiny newborn babies whose only crime was to be born to parents who cant study a genealogical chart well enough to avoid marrying their own fucking siblings i was crying too now but it was anger not sorrow i give you my oath that i and frost and rhys are pure of body does that make it easier does that help if you just wanted to sleep with the men you wouldnt have cared if you saw me in a swimsuit but you did care you want a fertility rite maeve you need me and at least one man i was too angry to know if anyone besides maeve had heard what i said or understood what id said i just didnt care i pushed away from rhys my anger carrying me forward to spit the words in her face tell me why you were exiled maeve tell me now or we leave you as we found you alone she nodded still crying all right all right lady guard me but all right ill tell you what you want to know if you swear to me that youll help me have a child you swear first i said i swear that i will tell you the truth about why i was exiled from the seelie court and i swear that after you have told me why you were exiled from the seelie court i and my men will do our best to see that you have a child she rubbed at her eyes with the heels of her hands it was a childs gesture she seemed thoroughly shaken and i wondered had one of those poor unfortunate babies belonged to conchenn goddess of beauty and spring and had the thought of giving up the only child she might ever have haunted her i hoped so chapter a hundred years ago the high king of faerie taranis was ready to put aside his wife conan of cuala theyd been a couple for a hundred years and had no children her voice had fallen automatically into the singsong of the storyteller so he was putting her aside i loved a good story told in the old ways but i wanted out of the sun and i wanted not to be here forever so i interrupted he did put her away i said maeve smiled but not like it made her happy he asked me to take her place as his bride i refused him she was just talking to me now the singsong lost it might not have been as pretty but straight conversation would be quicker thats not a reason to be exiled maeve at least one other has turned down taraniss offer before and shes still a part of the glittering throng i sipped my lemonade and watched her but edain was in love with another my reason was different she wasnt looking at me or kitto or anyone i think she seemed to be staring off into space maybe looking at the memories in her own head and that reason was i asked conan was the kings second wife he had been a hundred years with this new wife yet there was no child and i took another long drink of lemonade she took a long swallow of rum and looked back at me i told taranis no because i believe he is sterile it isnt the women but the king who is incapable of making an heir i spit lemonade all over myself and kitto he seemed frozen with the lemonade running down his arm and sunglasses the maid appeared with napkins i took a handful then waved her off we were talking about something that no one should hear when i could talk without sputtering and kitto and i were both relatively dry i said you told taranis this to his face yes she said youre braver than you seem or stupider i added in my head he demanded i tell him why i would not have him as husband i said i wished to have a child and i didnt believe that he could give me one i just stared at her trying to think about the implications of what shed said if what you say is true then the royals could demand the king make the ultimate sacrifice they could demand he allow himself to be killed as part of one of the great holy days yes maeve said he forced me out that same night for fear that you would tell someone i said surely i am not the only one to have suspicions she said adaria went on to have children with two others but she was barren for centuries with our king i understood now why id been beaten for asking about maeve my uncles very life hung in the balance he could just step down from the throne i said maeve lowered her glasses enough to give me a withering look do not be naive meredith it does not become you i nodded sorry youre right taranis would never believe it he would have to be forced to accept that he was sterile and the only way to do so would be to bring him up before the nobles which means youd have to find a way to convince enough of them to vote your way she shook her head no meredith i cannot be the only one who suspects his death would restore fertility to our people all our power descends from our king or queen i believe that taraniss inability to father children has doomed the rest of us to be childless there are still children at court i said but how many of them are pure seelie blood i thought for a second im not sure most of them were bornlong before i came along i am sure she said she leaned forward her entire body language suddenly very serious no flirting involved none all the children born to us in the last six hundred years have been mixed blood either rapes during the wars of unseelie warriors or ones like yourself that are very mixed indeed mixed blood stronger blood meredith our king has doomed us to die as a people because he is too proud to step down from the throne if he stepped down because he was infertile the other royals could still demand he be killed to ensure the fertility of the rest and they would maeve said if they discovered that i told him of his little problem a century ago she was right if taranis had simply not known then they might have forgiven him and allowed him to step down but to have known for a century and have done nothing they would see his blood sprinkled over the fields for that the murmur of voices made me turn around a new man was speaking pleasantries to the men around the umbrella table he turned toward us smiling flashing very white teeth the rest of him was so unhealthy that the artificially bright smile seemed to emphasize the sallowness of his skin the sunken eyes he was so eaten away by illness that it took me a few seconds to recognize gordon reed hed been the director who took maeve from small parts to stardom i had a sudden image of his body rotted away and those teeth the only thing left untouched in his grave i knew in that instant that the macabre vision was a true seeing and he was dying the question was did they know maeve held out her hand to him he took her smooth golden hand in his withered one laying a kiss on the back of that perfect skin how must he feel to watch his own youth fade to feel his body die while she remained untouched he turned to me still holding her hand princess meredith so good of you to join us today the words were very civil very ordinary as if this were just another afternoon by the pool maeve patted his hand sit down gordon she moved to give him the lounge chair while she knelt on the pool edge much like kitto had earlier he sat down heavily and a momentary flinching around his eyes was the only outward sign that he hurt maeve took off her sunglasses and kept looking at him she studied what was left of the tall handsome man that shed married she studied him as if every line of bone under that sallow skin was precious that one look was enough she loved him she really loved him and they both knew that he was dying she laid her face on that withered hand and looked at me with wide blue eyes that shimmered just a little too much in the light it wasnt glamour it was unshed tears her voice was low but clear gordon and i want a child meredith how i stopped i couldnt ask it not in front of both of them how long does gordon have maeve asked for me i nodded six maeves voice broke she tried to regain herself but finally gordon answered six weeks maybe three months at the outside his voice was calm accepting he stroked maeves silky hair maeve rolled her face to stare at me the look in her eyes wasnt accepting or calm it was frantic i knew now why after a hundred years maeve had been willing to risk taraniss anger to seek help from another sidhe conchenn goddess of beauty and spring was running out of time chapter it was dark by the time we arrived back at my apartment i would have said home but it wasnt that it had never been home it was a onebedroom apartment originally intended for only one person i wasnt even supposed to have a roommate in it i was trying to share it with five people to say we were a little cramped for space was a terrifying understatement strangely we hadnt talked much on the drive back to work to exchange the van for my car or afterwards during the drive to the apartment i dont know what was bothering everyone else but seeing gordon reed dying practically before my eyes had dampened my enthusiasm truth was it wasnt really gordons dying but the way maeve had looked at him an immortal in true love with a mortal it always ended badly id threaded my way through the traffic almost automatically the trip livened only by doyles soft gasps he was not a good passenger but since hed never had a license he didnt have much choice usually i enjoyed doyles little panic attacks it was one of the few times that i saw him completely unglued it was strangely comforting usually today when we stepped into the pale pink walls of my living room i didnt think anything could comfort me i was as usual lately wrong first there was the rich smell of stew and fresh baked bread the kind of stew that simmers all day and just gets better and there is no such thing as bad homemade bread second galen walked around the only corner in the main room from my tiny kitchen to the even tinier dining area usually i notice galens smile first he has a great smile or maybe the pale green hair that curls just below his ears tonight i noticed his clothes he was not wearing a shirt he was wearing a white lacy apron that was sheer enough that i could see the darker skin of his nipples the curl of darker green hair that decorated his upper chest the thin line of hair that traced the edge of his belly button and vanished inside his jeans he turned his back to finish setting the table and his skin was flawless pearlescent white with the faintest tinge of green the seethrough straps of the apron did nothing to hide his strong back and broad shoulders the perfect length of arm the one thin braid of hair that still fell past his waist curved over his skin like a caress i hadnt realized that i had stopped dead just past the door until rhys said if you move a little bit farther into the room the rest of us can get past i felt my skin burn as i blushed but i moved and let the others come past me galen continued coming and going out of the kitchen as if he hadnt noticed my reaction and maybe he hadnt it was sometimes hard to tell with galen he never seemed to understand how beautiful he was which come to think of it might have been part of his appeal humility was a very rare commodity in a sidhe nobleman stews ready but the bread needs to cool a bit before we cut it he went back into the kitchen without really looking at any of us there had been a time when i would have given and gotten a hello kiss from him but there was a little problem galen had been injured during one of the court punishments just before samhain halloween i could still see the scene in my minds eye galen chained to the rock his body almost lost to sight under the slowly fanning butterfly wings of the demifey they looked like true butterflies on the edge of a puddle sipping liquid wings moving slowly to the rhythm of their feeding but they werent sipping water they were drinking his blood they had taken bites of his flesh with the blood and for reasons that only prince cel knew hed ordered them to pay particular attention to galens groin cel had made certain that i would not be able to take galen to my bed until he healed but he was sidhe and sidhe healed while you watched their bodies absorbing the wounds like flowers blooming in reverse every dainty bite had vanished into that flawless skin except the wounds on his groin he was for all intents and purposes unmanned wed been to every healer we could find both medical and metaphysical the medical doctors had been baffled the witches had only been able to say it was something magical twentyfirstcentury witches hesitate to use the word curse no one did curses they were too bad for your karma you do a curse and it comes back on you always you can never do truly evil magic the kind that has no intent but to harm without paying a price no one is exempt from that rule not even the immortal its one of the reasons that a true curse is so rare i watched galen bustling about the kitchen in his peekaboo apron careful not to look at me and my heart hurt i went to him wrapping my arms around his waist pressing my body against the warmth of his back he went very still under my touch then slowly his hands came up to slide along my arms he hugged my arms against his body i cuddled my cheek against the smooth warmth of his back it was the closest to a hug that id gotten from him in weeks hed found any interaction painful in more than one way he began to pull away and i tightened my grip he could have forced me away from him but he didnt he just stood there and dropped his hands from mine merry please his voice was so soft no i said holding him tight tight against me let me contact queen niceven he shook his head sending his braid spilling against my face the scent of his hair was sweet and clean i remembered when his hair had draped to his knees like most of the highcourt sidhe id mourned when he cut it i will not let you put yourself in that creatures debt he said and his voice held a solemnity that was so unlike him please galen please no merry no he tried to push me away again but i wouldnt let go and what if there is no cure without nicevens help he put his hands on my arms not to caress this time but to pry them apart so he could move away galen was a sidhe warrior he could punch holes through the sides of buildings i could not hold him if he would not be held he moved into the mouth of the narrow kitchen out of my reach he would not look at me with his pale green eyes he studied the painting on the dining room wall a picture of butterflies in a grassy meadow did the butterflies remind him of the demifey or did he even see the painting or was it simply better to look anywhere than at me id been begging galens permission to go to queen niceven and find out what shed done to him hed forbidden it he didnt want me to put myself in her debt just to help him id tried pleading crying which i think on anyone else would have worked but he had held firm he would not be responsible for me owing niceven and her demifey a debt i stood there staring at him that beautiful body that i had loved since i was a child galen had been my first crush if he was healed we could cool the heat that had been between us since i hit puberty i realized suddenly that id been going about this all wrong kitto had told me that doyle thought i was just going to fuck everyone and not use the power id gained he wasnt just referring to the goblins was i the future queen of the unseelie or not if i was to be queen what was i doing asking anyones permission for anything who i put myself in debt to was none of galens business not really i turned away from galen back into the room the rest of the men were watching us if theyd been human they would have pretended not to watch been reading magazines or pretending to but they were fey if you did something in front of the fey they watched if you wanted privacy you wouldnt be doing it where they could see you that was our culture only kitto was missing and i knew where he was in his oversize fully covered cloth dog bed it was like a small snug tent it sat in the far corner of the living room positioned so he could watch the television which was one of the few technological wonders that kitto seemed to appreciate doyle i said yes princess his voice was neutral contact queen niceven for me he simply bowed and went for the bedroom it was the largest mirror in the apartment he would try to contact the demifey first through the mirror as you would contact another sidhe it might work it might not the demifey didnt stay inside the faerie mounds very much they liked the open air if they werent near a reflective surface the mirror spell wouldnt work there were other spells to try but he would start with the mirror we might get lucky and catch the little queen flying by a still pool of water no galen said he took two quick strides not to me but to doyle he caught the other guards arm no i wont let her do this doyle met galens eyes for a second and galen didnt flinch id seen gods flinch from that look on doyles face either galen was braver than id thought or stupider i was betting on the latter galen simply didnt understand politics personal or otherwise he would grab doyles arm prevent him from leaving the room even though that might mean a duel between the two of them id seen doyle fight and id seen galen fight i knew who would win but galen wasnt thinking he was reacting and that of course was galens great weakness and why my father had given me to another galen didnt have it in him to survive court intrigue he just didnt but doyle didnt take offense his gaze slid from galen to me he arched an eyebrow as if asking what to do you act as if you are already king galen i said and it sounded harsh even to me because i knew he was thinking no such thing but i had to get him under control before doyle stepped in i had to lead here not doyle the look of astonishment on galens face as he turned to me was so genuine so galen almost any other of the queens ravens would have been able to guard their expression better than that his emotions had always been painted on his face i dont know what you mean and he probably didnt i sighed i gave one of my guards an order and you have stopped him from carrying out that order who but a king would supercede the orders of a princess confusion chased across his face and his hand fell slowly away from doyles arm i didnt mean it that way his voice sounded young and unsure of itself he was seventy years older than me yet politically he was still a child and always would be part of galens charm was his innocence it was also one of his most dangerous flaws do as i bid doyle doyle gave me the lowest and most courtly bow hed ever given me then he went for the bedroom door and the mirror beyond galen watched him go then turned back to me merry please dont put yourself in that creatures power because of me i shook my head galen i love you but not everyone is as inept politically as you are he frowned whats that supposed to mean it means my sweet that ill negotiate with niceven if what she asks is too great a price i wont pay it but trust me to take care of things i wont do anything stupid galen he shook his head i dont like this you dont know what nicevens become since queen andais has been losing some of her hold on the court if andais lets her power slip then others will hurry to grab it up i know that galen how how do you know that when youve been away while its all been happening i sighed again if andaiss power has slipped so that her own son cel would plot around her if her power has deteriorated to the point where the sluagh are being used to police her court instead of being the ultimate threat that they should be then everyone must be scrambling to pick up the pieces and they will do their best to keep the pieces they grab galen looked at me uncomprehending thats exactly whats been happening for three years but you havent been there how did you a look of astonishment showed and then you had a spy no galen i had no spy i dont have to be there to know what the court will do if the queen is weak nature abhors a vacuum galenhe frowned at me he had no desire for power no political ambitions it was as if that part of him was missing and because it was totally lacking in him he did not understand it in others id always known this about him but id never realized just how profound his lack of understanding was he couldnt conceive of me seeing all the puzzle without having seen all the pieces first because he couldnt have done it he couldnt understand someone else doing it i smiled and it felt sad i went to him touched his face with my fingertips i needed to touch him to see if he was real it was as if id finally realized just how profound his problem was and knowing it it seemed as if id never really known him at all his cheek was just as warm as real as ever galen i will negotiate with niceven i will do it because to leave one of my guards so crippled is an insult to me and all of us the demifey should not be able to unman a sidhe warrior he flinched at that gaze sliding away from me i touched his chin moved him back to look at me and i want you galen i want you as a woman wants a man i wont mortgage my kingdom to cure you but i will do my best to see you whole a faint flush climbed up his face darkening the green cast to his skin so that it was almost orange instead of red merry i dont i touched my fingertips to his lips no galen i will do this and you will not stop me because i am the princess i am the heir to the throne not you you are my guard not the other way around i think i forgot that for a while but i wont forget again his eyes looked so worried he took my hand from his lips and moved it palm up he laid a slow gentle kiss upon my palm and that one touch made me shiver he was so hopeless at the politics that to make him king would be almost a death sentence it would be disastrous not just for galen personally but for the court and for me no i could not have galen as my king but i could have galen for a brief time before i found my true king i could have galen in my bed i could quench the fire that had been burning between us quench it with the flesh of our bodies as he lowered my hand from his mouth the look in those pale green eyes was enough to make me want for a moment to mortgage my kingdom i wouldnt do that but i would do much to have those eyes looking down at me while i lay underneath him i gave his knuckles a quick kiss because i didnt trust myself to do anything more go finish setting the table i think the bread should be cool enough by now he smiled suddenly a flash of his old grin i dont know it feels pretty hot from here i shook my head and pushed him halflaughing toward the kitchen maybe i could just keep galen as the royal mistress or whatever the male equivalent was the sidhe had been around for several millennia and surely there was court precedent for a royal lover somewhere in all that history chapter over dinner we discussed what to do when niceven called back doyle had left a message that would let her know who had called he was sure shed be intrigued enough to call back and he was also sure shed know what we wanted niceven has been anticipating this call she has a plan i dont know what that plan will be but she will have one doyle was sitting on my right so that his body blocked me from the window hed made me draw the drapes but allowed the window to be opened for the breeze it was december in california and the wind through the window was delightfully cool like late spring or very early summer in illinois by no stretch of imagination did it feel cold or wintry in the least she is an animal galen said pushing back his chair he took his empty bowl to the sink and began to run water into it his back to us do not underestimate the demifey because of what they did to you galen they used teeth because they enjoyed it not because they dont have swords doyle said a sword the size of a straight pin rhys said not much of a threat give me a blade no bigger than a pin and i could slay a man doyle said deep voice soft yes but youre the queens darkness rhys said youve studied every weapon known to man or immortal i doubt nicevens crew has been as thorough doyle stared at the palehaired man across the table from him and if it were your only weapon rhys wouldnt you study how it could be used on your enemy the sidhe are not the enemies of the demifey he said the demifey like the goblins are tolerated and barely that in the courts and the weefey do not have the goblins fierce reputation to protect them from the slings and arrows of mischance for some reason mention of the goblins made it hard not to look at kitto he hadnt sat at the table but had crouched underneath hed eaten his stew then crawled to his oversize doggie bed he seemed shaken by the afternoon at maeve reeds pool too much sun and fresh air for a goblin no one harms the demifey frost said they are the queens spies a butterfly a moth a tiny bird can all be demifey their glamour is almost undetectable even by the best of us doyle nodded around a mouth full of stew he sipped a little of his red wine then said all that you say is true but the demifey were once much more respected in the courts they were not merely spying eyes but truly allies with the weeones rhys said why i answered if the demifey leave the unseelie court then what remains of faerie will begin to fade that is an old wives tale rhys said like if the ravens leave the tower of london britain will fall the british empire has already fallen and yet they still clip the poor ravens wings and stuff them full of food the damn things are as big as small turkeys it is said that where the demifey travel faerie follows doyle said what does that mean rhys asked my father said that the demifey are the most closely allied with the rawness that is faerie the very stuff that makes us different from the humans the demifey are their magic more than any of the rest of us they cannot be exiled from faerie because it travels with them wherever they go galen leaned against the counter at the end of the kitchen arms crossed over his now bare chest hed put the apron away i think to save me embarrassment i dont know why his bare chest wasnt as eyecatching as his chest peeking through all that sheer cloth but i couldnt eat and sit across from him while he wore the apron the second time i missed my mouth with the stew doyle asked him to take the apron off that doesnt work for most of the rest of the smaller fey the rule is the smaller you are the more dependent you are on faerie and the more likely you are to die when away from it my father was a pixie i know what im talking about galen said how big a pixie rhys asked galen actually smiled big enough there are many different kinds of pixies frost said either missing the humor or ignoring it i loved frost but his sense of humor wasnt his best feature of course a girl doesnt always need to laugh ive never known another pixie who wasnt a member of the seelie court rhys said did you ever learn what your father did to earn exile from taranis and his gang only you would refer to the glittering throng as taranis and his gang doyle said rhys shrugged grinned and said whatd your daddy do the smile faded then grew on galens face my uncles tell me that my father seduced one of the kings mistresses his smile faded galen had never met his father because andais had had him executed for the audacity of seducing one of her ladiesinwaiting she never would have done it if shed known there was going to be a child in fact the pixie would have been elevated to noble rank and there would have been a marriage it had happened with stranger mixes but andaiss temper made her a little too quick on the death sentence and thus galen never met his father if any humans had been in the room they would have apologized for bringing up such a painful subject but there werent any and we didnt bother if galen was in pain hed have said something and wed have taken care of it he didnt ask and we didnt pry treat niceven as a queen an equal it will please her and catch her off guard doyle said she is a demifey she can never be the equal of a sidhe princess this from frost who sat on the other side of galens empty chair his handsome face was as severe and haughty as id ever seen it my greatgrandmother was a brownie frost i said my voice was soft so he wouldnt think i was chiding him he didnt take well to that frost seemed impervious to so much but id learned that he was really one of the most easily wounded of the guards a brownie is a useful member of faerie they have a long and respected history the demifey are parasites i agree with galen they are animals i wondered what else frost would say that about what other members of faerie would he dismiss out of hand nothing is redundant in faerie doyle said everything has its purpose and its place and what purpose do the demifey serve frost asked i believe that they are the essence of faerie if they were to leave the unseelie court would begin to fade even faster than it already is i nodded getting up to put my own bowl in the sink my father believed it was so and i havent found much that my father believed turn out to be false essus was a very wise man doyle said yes i said he was galen took the bowl from my hands ill clean up you made dinner you shouldnt have to clean up too im not much good for anything else right now he smiled when he said it but it didnt quite reach his eyes i let him take the bowl so i could touch his face ill do what i can galen thats what im afraid of he said softly i dont want you to put yourself in debt to niceven not for me its not a good enough reason to owe that creature anything i frowned and turned to the room at large why call her creature i dont remember the demifeys reputation being this bad before i left the court nicevens court has become little more than the queens errand runners or cels you cannot retain respect if you have been regulated to a threat and nothing more i dont understand what threat youve all been saying that the demifey are no threat i have not said that doyle said but what the demifey did to galen was not the first time it has been done though this time was more severe more flesh was taken than id seen before galen turned away at that and began to busy himself at the sink rinsing out the bowls placing them in the dishwasher he seemed to be making more noise than was necessary as if he didnt want to hear the conversation anymore you know that crossing the queen can get you sent to the hallway of mortality to be tortured by ezekiel and his redcaps yes now she will sometimes threaten us with being given to the demifey in effect nicevens court once a court of faerie with all the respect and ceremonies of any court has been reduced to nothing more than another boggle to be dragged out of the dark and sent to torment others the sluagh are not merely boggles i said and they have a court with their own customs they have been one of the greatest threats in the unseelie arsenal for a thousand years much longer than a mere thousand years doyle said but they have retained their threat their customs their power the sluagh are what remain of the original unseelie court they were unseelie before there was such a term it was not they who joined us but we who joined them though there are very few among us now who remember that or who will admit to remembering it frost spoke i hold with those who say that the sluagh are the essence of the unseelie court and if they leave we will fade it is they and not the demifey who hold our most primitive power no one knows for certain doyle said i dont think the queen would chance finding out rhys said no doyle said which means that the demifey are in a position similar to the sluagh i said doyle looked at me explain the sudden full weight of that dark gaze made me want to squirm but i resisted i wasnt a child anymore to be frightened of the tall dark man at my aunts side the queen would do almost anything to keep the sluagh on her side and at her beck and call but wouldnt the same be said for the demifey if she truly fears that their leaving would make the unseelie decline even faster than they are already then wouldnt she do almost anything to keep them at her court doyle stared at me for what seemed a long time then finally he gave one long blink perhaps he leaned toward me clasping his hands on the nearly empty table galen and frost are correct about one thing niceven does not react like another sidhe she is accustomed to following the commands of another queen to have in effect given her royal authority over to another monarch we must make her think of you in that way meredith what do you mean i asked we need to remind her in every way that you are andaiss heir i still dont understand when cel contacts the demifey he is his mothers son his requests are usually as bloody or more so than his mothers but you are asking for healing for help that automatically puts us into a position of weakness for we ask a boon of niceven and have little power to offer her in return okay i understand that but what can we do about it lounge upon the bed with your men drape us around you for effect just as the queen would do it is a way of looking powerful for niceven envies the queen her bevy of men doesnt niceven get her pick of the demifey no she had three children by one male and he is her king she cannot be freed of him i didnt know niceven had a king rhys said few do he is king in name only the thought wasnt the idle gossip it should have been sleeping with all the guards was lovely but being forced to marry one of them simply because we made a child what if the father was someone i didnt respect the thought of gentle nicca tied to me forever was a frightening one he was lovely to look at but he wasnt powerful enough or strong enough to help me much as king in fact he was more likely to end up a victim instead of a help which reminded me is nicca still working on that bodyguard case yes doyle said he took over from frost how did the client feel about trading guards in midstream doyle looked at frost who shrugged she is in no real danger she merely wants a sidhe warrior on her arm to show how much a star she is one sidhe warrior is much like another for her purposes how much of a show do we need to put on for niceven i asked as much as you are comfortable with he said i raised my eyebrows at that and tried to think dont include me in the show galen said i dont want to see any of those things not even from a distance hed loaded the dishwasher and turned it on so that the quiet chugchug of the machine followed him as he returned to his chair apparently hed help us plan as long as he wasnt included in the event that makes it tough you and rhys are the only two of this group who really dont mind major flirting in public both frost and doyle are usually pretty circumspect in public for tonight i am willing to help doyle said frost looked at him you would pander in front of the wee ones he made it a question doyle shrugged i think it is necessary i will be on the bed as i have been for some of the queens calls but i will not pander not for niceven that is your choice but if you will not play the part of merediths lover something you actually are then do not ruin the show that the rest of us put together perhaps you should wait in the living room while we talk to the weefey frost narrowed those grey eyes of his you held me back today when i would have aided meredith twice you held me back now you suggest that i not be in her bed while you play her lover whats next darkness will you finally break your fast and take my night in her bed for truth and not just playacting i am within my rights to do so that made me stare at doyle his face was blank neutral had he just said he would share my bed tonight or was he just arguing with frost frost stood up looming over the table doyle stayed seated calmly looking up at the other man i think we should let meredith decide who shares her bed tonight we are not here to make meredith choose doyle said we are here to see her with child the three of you have had three months and her womb is empty would you truly deny her a chance to have a child to be queen knowing that if cel succeeds and meredith fails he will see her dead emotions chased over frosts face too quickly for me to follow them all finally he hung his head i would never wish meredith ill i stepped forward and touched his arm the touch made him look at me his eyes were filled with such pain and i realized that frost was jealous of me as much as i cared for him he hadnt earned the right to be jealous of me in that way not yet though i realized with a start that the thought of never having him in my arms again was a painful one i couldnt afford the sinking sense of loss any more than he could afford the jealousy frost i began i dont know what i would have said because there was a sound of sharp bells from the bedroom it was as if someone had taken the delicate sound of silver bells and turned them into alarm bells the sound sent my pulse racing and not in a good way id let go of frosts arm when the sound came we stood there looking at each other while everyone but galen and kitto moved toward the bedroom i have to go frost i started to apologize but didnt he hadnt earned it and i didnt owe it i will come with you he said i gave him wide eyes i will do for my queen what i would do for no one else and i knew in that moment that he didnt mean andais chapter doyle was kneeling on the burgundy bedspread speaking to the mirror when frost and i entered the room i will allow shared sight as soon as our princess is with us queen niceven the mirror was a swirl of mist as i crawled across the bed it put doyle kneeling at my back slightly to one side rhys was sitting behind both of us against the headboard propped up among the pile of burgundy purple mauve pink and black pillows i couldnt tell for certain but he seemed to be nude except for a few wellplaced pillows i had no idea how hed stripped that quickly frost crawled onto the bed to half sit half recline a little behind me and to one side so that i was framed by doyle and him doyle made a sideways movement with his hand and the mist cleared niceven sat in a delicate wooden chair carved so that her wings slipped through the slotted back without damaging them her face was a near perfect triangle of white skin but her whiteness was not the same as mine or frosts or rhyss her white skin held a greyish tinge her whitegrey curls had been done in elaborate ringlets like those of some oldtime doll a tiny tiara held those curls back from her face and the tiara sparkled with the cold warmth that only diamonds can manage her gown was white and flowing the looseness of the cloth would have hidden her body except that it was absolutely sheer and you could see the small pointed breasts the almost skeletal thinness of her ribs the dainty crossed legs she wore slippers that seemed to be made of flower petals a white mouse as large to her as a german shepherd to me sat beside her chair she stroked the fur between its ears a trio of ladiesinwaiting stood behind her each in a different color dress that matched the brilliance of their wings rosered daffodilyellow and irispurple their hair was black yellow and brown respectively niceven had gone to a great deal more trouble than we had to stage her little scene i felt positively ordinary in my green skirt outfit but i didnt mind too much it was a business call after all queen niceven it is good of you to return our call in truth princess meredith i have been awaiting your call these three months your affection for the green knight is well known among the court i am most surprised that it has taken thee so long to contact me she was being very formal i realized it wasnt just the speech that was formal she wore her crown i had no crown not yet she sat upon her throne while i was sitting in the middle of a slightly rumpled bed she had ladiesinwaiting like a silent greek chorus behind her and a mouse mustnt forget the mouse i had only doyle and frost on either side of me and rhys in the pillows behind niceven was trying to put me at a disadvantage wed see about that in truth we have sought the aid of healers out here in the world of mortals it is only recently that we had to admit that a call to you was necessary sheer stubbornness on your part then princess perhaps but you know why i have called and what i wish i am not some fairy godmother to be granting wishes meredith shed dropped my title a deliberate insult fine we could both be rude as you like niceven then you know what i want you want a cure for your green knight she said one hand tracing the pink edge of the mouses ear yes prince cel was most insistent that galen remain injured you told me once that prince cel does not yet rule the unseelie court that is true but it is not at all certain you will ever live to be queen meredith shed dropped the title again doyle moved from beside me to put his back to rhys he made sure he was still at the edge of the bed at the limit of my peripheral vision and well within the queens as if theyd arranged it rhys rose from the pillows to his knees and showed clearly that he was nude he rolled doyles long braid in his arms until he came to the end and began to undo the ribbon that bound it nicevens eyes flicked behind me to the movement then back to my face what are they doing preparing for bed i said though i wasnt percent sure of that delicate grey brows furrowed it is what nine oclock where you are the night is young to waste in sleeping i did not say we would sleep i kept my voice even she drew a deep enough breath that i could see the rise and fall of her dainty chest she tried to keep her attention on me but her gaze kept flicking to the men rhys was working doyles thick hair free of the braid id seen doyle with his hair free of that braid only once only once had it been like some dark living cloak to shroud his body niceven watched them furtively giving me very little eye contact i wasnt sure if it was doyles hair or rhyss nudity i doubted the nudity because being nude just wasnt that unusual among the court of course maybe she was gazing at rhyss washboard abs or what lay just below them frost sat up took off his suit jacket and began to slip out of his shoulder holster her eyes flicked to him niceven i said softly i had to repeat her name twice more before she looked at me how do i cure galen it is not certain that you will be queen and if prince cel becomes king then he will hold it ill that i helped you and if i am queen i will hold it ill that you did not she smiled so i must find a way between the two snarling dogs i will help you here because i have already helped cel it will even things up i remembered galens screams and the pain in his eyes these last months and i didnt think it evened things up i didnt think fixing what shed ruined came close to evening things up but we were doing faerie politics here not therapy so i said nothing silence is not a lie a sin of omission but not a lie our cultures allow you to omit as much as you can get away with how is galen to be cured i asked she shook her head making her curls bounce and her diamond tiara glitter no we talk price first what would you give me to make your green knight whole frost and doyle moved up beside me almost simultaneously you will have the goodwill of the queen of the unseelie and that should be enough frost said his voice as cold as his name she is not queen yet killing frost nicevens voice was full of a cold cold anger it had the taste of an old grudge was it personal to frost i saw doyle begin to reach toward the other man and i stopped him with a look there was a tension between them tonight it wouldnt make us look strong to argue amongst ourselves doyle stayed at my side only his eyes looking at frost the look was not friendly i touched frosts arm squeezing slightly he startled muscles tightening looked first to doyle then realized it was my touch hed expected it to be doyle he relaxed slowly he let out a deep quiet breath and moved a fraction behind me i turned back to the mirror and found nicevens face shrewd watchful i half expected her to say something but she did not she merely sat and waited for me to commit myself what would queen niceven of the diminutive fey want from princess meredith of the unseelie court in return for curing her knight id purposefully put both our titles in the same sentence emphasizing that i knew she was queen and i was not i was hoping to make up for frosts outburst she looked at me for a few heartbeats then gave a very small nod what would princess meredith of the unseelie court offer us you said once that you would give much for a longer drink of my blood she looked startled before she could school her face to courtly blankness when she could control herself she said blood is blood princess why should i care for yours now she was just being difficult you said that i tasted of high magic and sex or have you forgotten me so quickly queen niceven i made my face fall my eyes downcast did it mean so little to you i shrugged and let my newly shoulderlength hair fall across my face i spoke behind a curtain of hair that sparkled like spun rubies if the blood of the heir to the throne means nothing to you then i have nothing to offer i turned my eyes toward her knew the effect that those tricolored green and gold eyes could have through a frame of blood auburn hair coupled with glimpses of skin like polished alabaster id grown up among women and men who used their beauty like a weapon i would never have dreamed of doing it with another sidhe because they were all more beautiful than i but with niceven and her hungry eyes that followed my men with her i could use my own otherworldliness as shed tried to use hers she slapped her tiny hand on the arm of her chair hard enough to startle the white mouse by flora you are your aunts blood prince cel has never mastered his beauty as andais has and as you have i gave a small bow because its always hard to bow from a sitting position a pretty compliment from a lovely queen she preened smiling petting the mouse leaning back in her chair so that her sheer dress showed off more of her body her body had gone past slender into cadaverous so that it was like looking at a little starved thing but she thought her body was beautiful and i could show nothing less in my face frost stayed unmoving a little behind me hed removed his belt his shoulder holster his suit jacket but nothing else even his shoes were still on he was not going to strip for niceven doyle on the other hand had removed his shoulder holster his belt and his shirt the silver ring in his left nipple glinted so that niceven could see it even in profile rhys continued to work at all that thick black hair as if he were smoothing out the train of a dress the men moved about me like ladiesinwaiting preparing themselves for bed they left me alone to deal with niceven which meant i was doing all right on my own good to know i flashed her a curve of lips as red as the red red rose no lipstick needed a drink of my blood to cure my knight you agree you give your own lifes fluid away very freely princess she was being cautious i only give that which i own the prince thinks he owns all the court i know that i own only the body i inhabit anything else is hubris the queen laughed will you come home so that i may feed do you agree that another feeding is worth my knights cure she nodded i agree then what would a feeding once a week be worth i felt the men behind me tense the atmosphere of the room was suddenly thicker i was careful not to look at them i was princess and i didnt need the permission of my guards to do anything i either ruled or i did not nicevens eyes narrowed into pale little flames whats that supposed to mean a feeding once a week it means exactly what i said why would you offer to make a weekly blood offering to me for an alliance between us frost pushed toward me over the bed meredith no he was going to say something unfortunate and ruin everything i had the beginnings of an idea and it was a good one no frost i said you do not tell me no i tell you no or yes dont forget that i gave him a look that i hoped he understood which was shut the fuck up and dont ruin this he closed his mouth into a tight thin line so obviously unhappy but he sat there sulking at least he was quiet about it i heard doyle take in a breath and i just looked at him the look was enough he gave a small nod of his head and let rhys begin to brush out his long hair there was a wave to all that blackness because of the braid i think i remembered doyles hair as straight i was distracted for a moment watching rhys kneeling so pale and perfect against all that darkness it was doyle clearing his throat who made me jump and turn back to the mirror niceven laughed the sound of just slightly offkey bells as if it were something lovely that had been just a bit malformed my apologies for my inattention queen niceven if i had such a bounty awaiting me i would make this a short conversation and what if you had the bounty of my blood awaiting you what then her face sobered you are persistent it is most unfeylike i am part brownie and we are a more persistent people than the sidhe you are part human as well i smiled humans are like the sidhe some are more persistent than others she didnt smile back at me for another drink of your blood i will cure your green knight but that is all one drink one cure and we are done for one drink of my blood king kurag of the goblins became my ally for six months her delicate eyebrows raised that is goblin and sidhe business and none of ours we are the demifey no one cares who we ally ourselves with we fight no battles we challenge no duels we mind our business and everyone else minds theirs so you refuse an alliance i think caution is the better part of valor here princess no matter how tasty you may be in negotiations always try to be nice first but if nice doesnt work there are other options everyone leaves you alone queen niceven because they consider you too small to worry about prince cel thought us big enough to spoil your plans with the green knight her voice held the first hint of anger yes and what did he offer you for that bit of work the taste of sidhe flesh knights flesh and blood we feasted that night princess he paid you in someone elses blood when his body was full of blood only one step down from the queen herself have you ever tasted the queen niceven looked nervous almost frightened the queen shares only with her lovers or her prisoners how that must irk you to see such a precious gift wasted niceven pouted tiny ghost silver lips if only she would take some of my people to her bed but we are too small i finished for her yes she hissed yesss always too small too small a power for an alliance too small a power to be used except as her sneak spies tiny pale hands balled into fists the white mouse cowered away from her as if he knew what was coming even the trio of ladies behind her throne shuddered as if from the brush of an icy wind and now you do dirty work for her son i said my voice was carefully neutral almost pleasant at least he sought us to do his work the anger in that small delicate figure was frightening her rage made her take up more space than mere physicality could explain she was truly regal in her rage i offer you what the queen will not i offer what the prince will not and what is that royal blood blood of the very throne of the unseelie court ally with me queen niceven and you will have such blood not only once but many times more her eyes became narrow little slits again glittering with a fire colder than the diamonds on her crown what would either of us gain from such an alliance you would gain the ear and the aid of my allies the goblins have little to do with us and what of the sidhe what of them as ally to one of the heirs you would gain status they would no longer be able to dismiss you for fear that you might bear a grudge and whisper it back to me she kept those glowing eyes on meand what would you gain from this alliance you would spy for me as well as for the queen and cel you would cease to spy for him he wont like that he doesnt have to like it if you are my ally then to injure you is to insult me the queen has decreed that i am under her protection to harm me now is a death sentence so he insults me then you step in then what threaten to bring your entire court out here to los angeles out here to me she shivered i would not wish to take my people out into the city of men she spoke as if there were only one city of men the city you could live in the botanical gardens acres of open land theres room for you here niceven i swear it but i do not want to leave the court wherever the demifey travel faerie follows most sidhe do not remember that my father made sure i knew the history of all the fey the demifey are the most closely allied with the rawness that is faerie the very stuff that makes us different from the humans you are not leprechaun or pixie to pine and die away from faerie you are faerie is it not said that when the last demifey fades there will be no more faerie upon the earth a superstition she said maybe but if you leave the unseelie court and the seelie court retains its own demifey the unseelie will be weakened cel may not remember that bit of our lore but the queen will if cel insults you enough for you to pack your belongings the queen will intercede she will order us to stay she cannot order another monarch to do anything that is our law niceven looked nervous she feared andais everyone did i do not wish to anger the queen neither do i do you really believe that the queen would punish her own son if he drove us away rather than take out her anger on us she had crossed her legs again arms folded over her chest forgetting to flirt forgetting to be regal in her fear where is cel now i asked niceven giggled a most unpleasant little giggle being punished for six months there are bets going round that his sanity will not survive six months of isolation and torment i shrugged he should have thought of that before he was such a bad bad boy you are flippant but if cel comes out insane it will be your name that he screams your face that he wants to smash ill cross that bridge when i come to it what its a human saying it means that ill deal with the problem when and if it comes to pass she seemed to be thinking very hard then said how would you offer this blood to me i do not think either of us would relish a weekly trip between faerie and the western sea i could put it upon a piece of bread and the essence could be sent to you via magic she shook her head ghostly curls bouncing around narrow shoulders the essence is never the same what do you suggest if i send one of my people to you they could act as my surrogate i thought about it for a moment feeling frosts stillness hearing the heavy almost tearing sound of rhys pulling the brush through doyles hair agreed tell me the cure for my knight and send your surrogate she laughed offkey bells ringing no princess you will gain the cure from the lips of my surrogate if i give it to you now before i have been paid you may think better of it i have given you my word i cannot go back upon it now i have dealt with the great of faerie for too long to believe that everyone keeps their word it is one of our most stringent laws i said to be forsworn is to be outcast unless you have friends in very high places who make sure such tales are never spread what are you saying queen niceven i say only this that the queen doth love her son much and has brokenmore than one taboo to keep him safe we stared at each other and i knew without asking that cel had made promises and broken them that alone should have made him outcast and certainly denied him the right to any throne andais had always spoiled cel but i never realized just how much when can we expect your surrogate i asked she seemed to consider this reaching an idle hand out toward where the mouse was crouched it crept close to her its long whiskers twitching ears alert as if it still wasnt sure of its welcome she stroked it gently a few days she said we are not always at home to welcome visitors i would be loath to have your envoy receive less than our best hospitality leave a pot of flowers by your door and that will sustain him him i believe a him would please you more would it not i gave a small nod because i wasnt sure i cared i was sharing blood not sex so i didnt have a preference or at least i didnt think i did i am sure the queen is wise in her choosing pretty words princess it remains to be seen whether you have pretty actions to back up all those words her eyes flicked back to the men and settled on doyle and rhys pleasant dreams princess and to you queen niceven something harsh crossed her face made it look even thinner and sharper as if her face were a mask if she reached up and ripped her face off i was not going to be able to hold my business face in place but she didnt she merely spoke in a voice that was like the whisper of scales on stone my dreams are my own business princess and i will keep them as i like them i gave her another half bow i meant no insult none taken princess merely envy rearing its ugly head with those words the mirror went blank and smooth i sat gazing into my own reflection movement caught my gaze and i watched rhys and doyle still on their knees muscles worked in rhyss arms as he brushed doyles hair frost didnt so much move as just look at me in the mirror so hard that it turned me to look at him frost glared back the other two seemed unaware of my attention niceven is gone you can stop pretending i said i havent finished brushing out all of this hair rhys said this is why i stopped growing mine down to my ankles its almost impossible to take care of it by yourself he separated out another section of hair hefted it in one hand and began to brush with the other doyle was silent as rhys worked on his hair with the seriousfaced concentration of a child there was absolutely nothing else childish about him as he knelt nude surrounded by a sea of black hair and multicolored pillows his body was as always tightly muscled pale gleaming he was lovely to look at but he wasnt excited nude didnt mean sex to the sidhe not always frost made a small movement that turned me to him his eyes were the dark grey of the sky just before a storm he was angry it showed in every line of his face the tension of his shoulders the way he sat so careful immobile and shimmering with energy at the same time im sorry if it upset you but i knew what i was doing with niceven you have made it abundantly clear that you rule here and i merely obey his voice was harsh with anger i sighed it was early but it had been a long day i was too tired for frosts hurt feelings especially since he was in the wrong frost i cannot afford to appear weak to anyone right now even doyle holds his opinion in public no matter how unfavorable it is in private i have approved of everything youve done today doyle said i am so happy to hear that i said he gave me a very level gaze ruined only a little by the tugging of his hair from the brush its hard to look menacing when youre being fussed with he stared at me until most people would have looked away or flinched i met his gaze with my own empty one i was tired of games just because i could play them and play them fairly well didnt mean i enjoyed them ive had enough power plays for one day doyle i dont need any more especially not from my own guards he blinked those dark dark eyes at me hold off rhys meredith and i need to talk rhys stopped obediently sitting back among the pillows the brush still in his hand in private doyle said frost jumped as if hed been struck it was his reaction more than doyles words that made me suspect we were talking about more than just a few secrets it is my night with meredith frost said his anger seemed to have vanished on the wings of possibilities he hadnt foreseen if it was rhys then he would have to wait his turn again but i have not had a turn so i am within my rights to ask for this evening frost stood almost stumbling in his haste and the lack of space at the foot of the bed first you hold me back from helping her today now you take my night in her bed i would accuse you of jealousy if i did not know you better you can accuse me of anything you wish frost but you know i am not jealous perhaps perhaps not but you are something and that something has to do with our merry doyle sighed a deep almost wounded sound perhaps i thought that by making the princess wait for my attentions i would intrigue her today i saw that there is more than one way to lose a womans favor speak plainly darkness doyle stayed kneeling halfnaked his hands limp and empty resting against his thighs surrounded by a sea of his own hair he should have looked helpless or feminine or something but he didnt he looked like something carved out of the elemental darkness as if hed risen as one of the first things to ever draw breath before the light came the silver ring in his nipple caught the light as he breathed his hair had covered all the earrings so that this one silver spark was the only color on him it was hard to look away from that shining silver light i am not blind frost doyle said i saw the way she looked at you in the van and you saw it too you are jealous he shook his head no but you have had three months and there is no child she is a princess and will be a queen she cannot afford to give her heart away where there is no marriage so youll step in and win her heart instead frosts voice held more heat than id ever heard in it outside of the bed no but i will see that she has choices if i had paid closer attention i would have stepped in sooner oh you in her arms will make her forget all about me is that it i am not so arrogant as that frost i told you today i realized there was more than one way to lose a womans heart and waiting too long is one of them if there is to be any chance that meredith will not turn to you or galen then something must change now not later but now what does galen have to do with any of this frost asked if you have to ask that then it is not i who am blind doyle said confusion chased over frosts face finally he frowned and shook his head i dont like this you dont have to like it doyle said as interesting as the conversation was id had enough of it you are all talking as if im not here or as if i have no choice in the matter doyle turned his so serious face to me do you object to me sharing your bed tonight he asked it in the same neutral voice that he would have used to order at a restaurant or talk to a client as if my answer meant nothing to him but i knew he sometimes used that neutral voice when he felt anything but neutral it was a way of shielding himself from the emotion act as if it doesnt matter and maybe it wont i looked at him the sweep of shoulders the swell of his chest and that sparkling glint of silver the flat plains of his stomach the line where his jeans cut across his body i had never seen doyle nude ever he did not participate in the casual nudity of the court neither had frost i looked at frost his silver hair was still back in the loose ponytail so his face was clean and unadorned if anything that beautiful could ever be called unadorned he had his jacket and shoulder holster complete with gun hung over one arm he was wearing his arrogant mask again the one he hid behind so often at court that he felt he had to wear his mask here and now in front of me hurt my heart i wanted to go to him wrap my arms around him lay my cheek against his chest and tell him dont leave i wanted to feel his body against mine i wanted to wake in a cloud of his silver hair i did go to him then but not the way i wanted to go i got close but didnt trust myself to touch him i was afraid if i did i wouldnt let him go i have the chance to satisfy mine and many a court ladies curiosity tonight frost he turned away so he couldnt see my face i wish you joy in it but he didnt sound like he meant it i want you tonight frost that turned him to me with a startled look with doyle in my bed looking like that and all the waiting i still want you my body begins to ache when youre not with me i hadnt realized until today what that meant i couldnt keep the pain out of my eyes and finally stopped trying he stared down at me raised a hand to touch my face but stopped himself just short of my skin if that is true then doyle is right you will be queen and some things you cannot be as others you must be queen before all else i laid my face against his open hand and even that small touch made me shiver he drew his hand away rubbing it against his pants as if something clung to his skin tomorrow night princess i nodded tomorrow night my and i stopped there for fear of what word i might use to finish he turned without another word and left the room shutting the door firmly behind him some small noise turned me back to the room rhys slid to the other side of the bed near the window and picked up his clothes that were lying in a hasty heap on the floor the first night shouldnt be a group effort making this a threesome had not occurred to me doyle said rhys laughed i didnt think it had he worked his way round the bed holding the clothes with the brush balanced on top all held above waist level so my view was uninterrupted it was a nice view a little help with the door please the moment he asked i knew that he was feeling left out he was flaunting his charms and i was ignoring him a deadly insult among the fey i got up to open the door for him as if he couldnt have shifted his clothes around to do it himself but i stopped before opening the door and raised up on tiptoe to kiss him i balanced with one hand behind his head lost in the curls at his neck and the other hand trailing down the side of his body caressing over his ribs the sweep of his hip i let him see in my eyes how beautiful he was to me it made him smile and he gave me a shy glance out of his one perfect eye the shy was pretend but the pleasure wasnt i stayed on tiptoe long enough to put my forehead against his my hands played in the curls at the back of his neck and he shivered under my touch i stood back on the ground flatfooted and moved out of the door so he could pass rhys shook his head that was her idea of a goodbye kiss doyle he glanced back at the other man still kneeling in the bed have fun kiddies but his serious face didnt match the flippant words rhys offered me the hairbrush from the pile of clothing then i let him out i shut the door behind him and was suddenly very aware that i was alone with doyle doyle whom id never seen nude doyle who had frightened me when i was a child doyle who had been the queens right hand for a thousand years hed kept me safe guarded my body and my life but somehow he hadnt really been mine somehow he wouldnt really be mine until id touched that dark body seen all of him bare before me i wasnt sure why that was so important to me but it was by withholding himself from me it was almost as if he was holding his options open as if he believed that once he was with me hed have no more options which wasnt true id been with my onetime fiance griffin for seven years and in the end hed found plenty of options none of them me having sex with me hadnt been a lifealtering experience for him why should it be different for doyle meredith he said my name once but for once his voice wasnt neutral that one word held uncertainty a question and a hope he spoke my name once more and it turned me around to face the bed and what lay waiting for me among the burgundy sheets chapter he sat on the edge of the bed closest to the mirror closest to me he was almost lost among the black dream of his hair almost all the other sidhe i knew had some contrast from hair to skin to eyes but doyle was all of one piece his unbound hair cascaded around him like a black cloud so that his ebony skin was almost lost in the folds of it a long long lock of hair had fallen over his face and his blackonblack eyes were lost in that darkness he looked like a piece of night itself come to life he swept a hand up to draw back the hair and try to tuck it behind one pointed ear the earrings glittered like stars against his darkness i walked forward until the bed bumped against my thighs my legs pressed into the bed but all i could feel was the thickness of his hair trapped between my body and the firmness of the bed he turned his head and i felt the hair tug underneath me i pressed in harder trapping his hair he turned those dark eyes up to me and there were colors in his eyes that shone nowhere in the room like a swarm of brilliant fireflies blue white yellow green red purple and colors i had no name for the pinpoints danced and swirled and for a second i could almost feel them flying around me the tiny wind of their passing like being caught in a cloud of butterflies then i was falling and doyle caught me i came to myself in his arms in his lap where hed sat me when i could speak i said why i am a power to be reckoned with meredith and i want you to never forget that a king should have more to offer than seed i slid my hands across his skin wrapping my arms around his neck are you auditioning he smiled we all are meredith some of the others may forget that in the rush of hot skin and sex but you must never forget you are choosing a father for your children a king for the court and someone you will be tied to forever i hid my face in the curve of his neck his skin was warm to the touch his pulse beat against my face his smell was so warm so very warm ive been thinking about that i spoke the words against his skin he rubbed his neck against my face and what conclusions have you come to i drew back enough to see his face that nicca would be a victim and a disaster on the throne that rhys is lovely in bed but i cant see him as a king that my father was right and galen would be utterly disastrous that there are more knights at court that i would rather kill than be tied to for the rest of my life he laid his lips against the side of my neck not quite kissing me he spoke with his own mouth against my skin so that his words made small kissing movements against me there is frost and me the feel of his lips made me shiver writhing in his lap doyle drew a sharp breath his hands wrapping around my waist across my thighs he whispered merry against my skin his breath warm and fierce his fingers digging into my thigh my waist there was such strength in his hands such pressure as if with little effort he could plunge his fingers into my body and bring my blood and flesh to the surface peel me apart like something ripe and sweet something that had been waiting for his hand to open me to bring me to spill me in a rush of pleasure over his hands across his body he half lifted me half threw me onto the bed i waited for him to press his body against mine but he didnt he got up on all fours straddling above me like a mare with a colt but there was nothing motherly about the way he stared down at me hed thrown all that hair over one shoulder so that his naked upper body was exposed to the light his skin gleamed like polished ebony his breathing was deep and rapid making the nipple ring wink and shimmer above me i raised my hand to touch it brushed my fingers over that bit of silver and a sound came out of doyle low in his body and growing a growl like some great beast echoing through that slender muscled body he straddled my body lips curving back to flash white teeth while that growl trickled out of his lips past his teeth like a warning it made my pulse race but i wasnt afraid yet not yet he leaned down into my face and snarled run i just blinked at him my pulse in my throat he threw back his head and howled a sound that echoed and echoed in the small room the hair on my body stood and i stopped breathing for a second because i knew that sound that lone clear evil belling of the gabriel ratchets the dark hounds of the wild hunt he put his face inches from mine and growled run i scrambled out from underneath him and he watched me with those dark eyes his body immobile but so tense it seemed to shimmer with the promise of some violent action violence contained constrained restricted but there all the same i had crawled off on the wrong side of the bed i was trapped between the window and the bed the outer door lay across the bed past doyle id played games of hunt and catch before a lot of things in the unseelie court liked to catch you first but that was pretend play foreplay the look in doyles eyes was hungry but one hunger looks much like another until its too late his voice fought out from his clenched teeth you are not running with that last he made a rush at me on all fours a black blur i threw myself over the edge of the bed rolled and fell to the floor in front of the outer door i was on my feet hand on the doorknob when his body crashed into mine the door shook and my body bruised with the violence of it he jerked my hand off the doorknob and i could not withstand his strength i screamed he tore me away from the door threw me on the bed i tried to slide off to one side but he was there his lower body pressing against mine keeping me pinned to the side of the bed i could feel the firmness of him through his jeans through my panties the door opened behind us and rhys looked in doyle growled at him rhys said you screamed his face was serious there was a gun in his hand held next to his leg not pointed but there doyle growled get out i leave at the princesss order not yours sire he shrugged sorry you having a good time merry or he made a vague motion with the gun im im not sure my voice came out breathy the feel of doyle pressed tight and firm against me was exciting even the promise of violence was exciting but only if it was the promise of it a game his hands on my thighs were shaking his entire body quivering with the effort not to finish what hed started i touched his face gently he startled as if id hurt him then turned looked at me the look in his eyes was barely human it was like looking into the eyes of a tiger beautiful neutral hungry are we having fun here doyle or are you going to eat me my voice was a little steadier firmer this first time i would not trust myself to put my mouth to such tender places it took me a second to realize that he had misunderstood me i dont mean eat me in the euphemistic sense doyle i mean am i food my voice sounded utterly calm now ordinary pinned to the bed by his body his eyes still animalistic and wild and i sounded like i was in the office talking business he blinked and i saw the confusion in his eyes i realized that i was asking him to think too deeply hed given himself over to a piece of himself that he rarely let out that part didnt think like a person he did something with his legs that pressed him tighter against me it made me cry out but not in pain do you want this his voice was almost normal breathy but almost normal i searched his face tried to read something there that would comfort me there was a glimpse of him in the eyes a sliver of doyle left behind i took a deep breath and said yes you heard her get out his voice began to fall into the growl again every word lower and lower you sure merry rhys asked id almost forgotten him standing there i nodded im sure so we just close the door and ignore the noise and trust that youll be all right i stared into doyles eyes and found nothing but need a need like nothing id ever seen in any man it went beyond desire and became a true need like food or water for him tonight this was need if i turned from him now we might come together as lovers but hed never let himself go this far again he might close this part of himself away forever and it would be a little death id endured that little death for years dying by inches on the shores of the human sea doyle had found me and brought me back to faerie hed brought back all those parts of myself id had to leave behind to pass for human to pass for lesser fey if i turned from him now would he ever find this piece of himself again ill be all right rhys i said but i wasnt looking at him i was looking at doyle you sure doyle turned and spoke in a voice that was almost too low and animal to understand you heard her now get out rhys gave a small bow and shut the door behind him doyle turned those eyes back to me he growled more than spoke you want this he was giving me one last chance to say no but his body ground against mine his fingers digging into my thighs as he said it his mind and mouth were trying to give me a way out although his body didnt want to i had to close my eyes as i shuddered under the press of him he growled against my face and the sound traveled through his body vibrating along mine as if the sound could travel places that his body hadnt touched yet even as his body ground into mine forced small noises from my throat he growled do you want this i want this one of his hands slid from my thigh to the side of my panties the silk tore with a wet sound like skin being cut my body jerked as he stripped the silk away and pressed the rough material of his jeans against my naked body he ground himself against me until i cried out half in pleasure half in pain he scooted me onto the bed just enough so that he could tear at his pants the belt opened the burton the zipper everything slid down until i saw him nude for the first time he was long and thick and perfect he slid a finger inside of me it made me cry out but that wasnt why hed done it when he found me wet and open he pushed himself inside me and even wet he had to work himself in i was screaming underneath him before hed managed to get himself all inside me he seemed to fill me up every inch and i writhed underneath just from the feel of him stiff and large inside me then he began to drag himself out of roe and push himself into me and the small waves of pleasure began i watched the dark length of him sliding in and out of my white white flesh and the sight alone made me cry out my skin began to glow like id swallowed the moon and his dark skin gleamed in answer filled with all the colors that had been in his eyes it was as if he were still black water reflecting the glow of the moon and i was the moon the bright dancing colors flowed under his skin and the room brightened brightened flickering as if we both burned with colored flame we cast shadows on the wall the ceiling as if we lay at the center of some great light some great flame and we became that light that fire that heat it was as if our skins melted into each other and i felt those dancing lights flow across my skin i sank into his dark glow as he was swallowed by my white shine and somewhere in all of that he brought me screaming screaming screaming drowning in pleasure that was so intense it was like pain i heard him cry out heard that belllike howl but in that one moment i didnt care he could have ripped my throat out and id have gone with a smile i came to myself with doyle collapsed on top of me his breathing labored his back covered in a sheen of sweat and blood i raised my hands and found blood on my white skin glowing like neon against the fading glow in that last moment when i hadnt been aware id bloodied his back i felt the first stinging trickle of blood and found his teeth marks in my shoulder bleeding hurting a little but not too much not yet nothing could hurt too much with doyles body still on top of mine him still inside me as we both relearned how to breathe how to be in our own bodies again his first panting words were did i hurt you i touched my bloody fingers into the bite on my shoulder mixed the neon glows together like mixing paint and held up my fingers before his face i think i should be asking you the same question he put a hand back to touch the blood on his back as if he hadnt felt it until that moment he propped himself up on one elbow and stared at the blood on his hands then he threw back his head and laughed laughed until he collapsed on top of me again and when he finished laughing he cried chapter we lay entwined together on a bed of doyles hair it was like having fur rubbing the length of my bare body my head was cradled in the curve of his shoulder his body was like warm muscled silk i traced my fingers along his waist over the curve of his hip an idle gesture not exactly sexual more to know that i could touch him wed been quietly touching each other for several minutes his one hand was trapped underneath my body curved up around my back holding me close but not too close he wanted room to run his free hand down my body and he wanted to give me room to touch him he wanted the feel of hands on his body it was as if he wasnt merely starved for sex but starved for touch i knew that humans could become touchstarved infants will die from lack of enough touch even if every other need is met but i hadnt known it of the sidhe especially the unmovable object known as the queens darkness but he lay beside me smiling his fingers running over my stomach and tracing the edge of my belly button i caught a glimpse of the mirrored bureau behind his head my blouse hung across the middle of the mirror as if flung there he caught me looking behind him he brought his hand up to my face tracing the edge of my cheek what do you see i smiled at him i was just wondering how we managed to get my blouse on the mirror he turned his head as much as he could with both his own weight and mine on his hair he had a very wide smile when he turned back have you looked for your bra i gave him wide eyes and started to prop myself up to see the rest of the bureau over his body he held me down with one gentle hand on my shoulder behind you i fell back still in the circle of his arm my green lace bra which had matched both my blouse and my panties was hanging forlornly from the philodendron plant that sat on the black lacquered armoire in the corner it hung like a badly chosen christmas decoration i shook my head half laughing i dont remember being in that much of a hurry he curved his free hand over my waist down my hip drawing closer to me as he pulled me in against his body i was in a hurry i wanted to see you naked i wanted to feel the touch of you on my bare skin he pressed that bare skin along the length of my body just the strength in his arms made me shiver but the feel of him growing larger against my body was almost an overwhelming thing i slid my hands over the smooth tightness of his buttocks and drew him in tighter against me he moved his own hands down my body to cup my buttocks and pressed our bodies together until i had to wonder if it hurt him to be shoved so hard against the unyielding front of my body as he grew the length of him pressed into my stomach and it was softer more yielding he drove himself against my flesh and i cried out i felt the prickling rush of magic a second before the voice filled the room well isnt this a pretty sight we both rolled over to see the queen of air and darkness andais my aunt doyles keeper sitting on the foot of her own bed watching us chapter the queen wore an elaborate black ball gown with black satin gleaming in the candlelight black ribbons to hold back the flounces black satin gloves to cover her white arms black straps over pale shoulders her black hair was piled atop her head with trails of curls artfully framing her face and slender neck her lips were the color of fresh blood her tricolored grey eyes had been kohllined so that they seemed enormous in her slender face seeing her dressed to the nines was nothing new andais was fond of parties and any excuse would do what was new was the fact that the bed behind her was empty the queen never slept alone we stayed halffrozen staring back at those eyes doyle squeezed my arm and i spoke without really thinking your majesty how good of you to call though unexpected my voice was neutral or as neutral as i could get it it was considered polite to make some sign first before popping in like this you never knew what people might be doing are you criticizing me niece her voice was very cold almost angry i hadnt done anything to anger her not that i knew of at least i settled myself a little more comfortably against doyles body i wished for a robe but knew that covering up when shed been nothing but polite would imply that i didnt like or trust the queen the fact that it was true was a matter for my own worries not hers i meant no criticism aunt andais i was merely stating a fact we did not expect your call tonight it is not night niece it is morning just not yet dawn i see you have slept no more than i i like you aunt have had better things to do than sleep she touched the full skirt of her ball dress yes another party she didnt look happy about it i wanted to ask if the party had not gone to her liking but didnt dare it was too personal a question to ask the queen and she was too easily offended she took a deep breath that made the front of her gown shift almost as if it wasnt tight enough around her body a bustier without a boost if you werent too well endowed you could wear those gowns that seemed to just float around your body for me it would have been an embarrassment waiting to happen nudity on purpose is very different from falling out of your dress by accident she turned those dramatic eyes to us the unhappy look changed narrowed to one i knew all too well malice youre bleeding my darkness i glanced down at doyle and realized he was still mostly on his side turned toward me which gave her a view of his back and the fingernail marks on his dark skin yes my queen he said in his perfectly neutral perfectly careful voice who has harmed my darkness but her eyes were already on me and it was a very unfriendly gaze i do not see it as harm my queen doyle said her eyes nicked down to him then back to me youve been a busy girl meredith i pushed up from doyle so that i was more or less sitting upright i thought you wished me to be a very busy girl aunt andais i dont know if ive seen your bare breasts before meredith they are a little large for a sidhe but very nice her eyes didnt hold lust or kindness only a dangerous light all that shed said so far could be mistaken for politeness shed never seen my breasts bare so she should compliment them but only if i was trying to be attractive which i was not i just happened to have no clothes on i did not feel the least bit luscious around my aunt and there was more to it than just being heterosexual much more and you my darkness its been so many centuries since i saw you nude that i cant remember is there some reason you have your back to me is there some reason you hide yourself from my sight is there some aberration that i dont remember that spoils all that darkness she was within her rights to compliment him but asking if he was deformed demanding he flaunt himself to her that was impolite if it had been almost anyone else id have told her to go to hell there is nothing spoiled here aunt andais i said and i knew my tone wasnt neutral enough id lost the knack of keeping my voice in line over the years id been away from the court i was going to have to relearn and quickly she gave me very cold eyes i was not talking to you princess meredith i was speaking to my darkness shed used my title not niece or just my name but my title it was not a good sign doyle squeezed my arm again tighter this time as if telling me to behave he answered andais but not in words he rolled onto his back with his knees bent so his thigh hid him from her view then he lowered the leg closest to her slowly like a curtain coming down there was heat in her eyes now real heat real need my my darkness you have been keeping secrets he turned and looked at her nothing you couldnt have discovered at any time in the last thousand years now it was his voice that was not neutral it was just a slight change in tone a mild inflection of reproof but id never heard him lose even that much control in front of andais it was my turn to lay a warning hand on his stomach just a touch to remind him who we were speaking to i dont think my face showed the fear that was curling along my spine king taranis might not hurt me for fear of andais but andais might hurt me in a fit she might regret it later but dead is dead the look she gave doyle was enough to tighten my hand against his skin just a light digging of nails it made his body react and i hoped id done enough to remind him to tread lightly have a care darkness or i will grow distracted and forget why i called we await your news queen andais i said she looked at me then some of the heat going from her eyes replaced by puzzlement and underneath tiredness andais wasnt usually this easy to read i think because she didnt have to be careful around anyone the nameless is free doyle spilled his legs to the floor and sat up suddenly it didnt matter that he was nude nobody cared the nameless was the worst of both courts seelie and unseelie it was the last great spell that the two courts had cooperated on they had stripped themselves of everything too awful too hungry to allow us to live in this new country nobody had demanded it of the sidhe but we didnt want to be forced out of the last country that would have us so wed sacrificed some of what we were in order to become more human some said that the nameless was what caused us to begin to fade but that wasnt true the sidhe had been fading for centuries the nameless was just a necessary evil so we didnt turn america into another battlefield did you set it free my queen doyle asked of course not she said then who he asked i could tell you a pretty story but in the end the answer is simply i dont know it was obvious she didnt like saying it and equally obvious that she was speaking the truth she stripped off one of the black gloves in an abrupt movement and began to run it over and over through her hands there are very few beings in faerie who could do such a thing doyle said dont you think i know that she snapped what would you have us do here my queen i dont know but the last hint we had of it it was traveling west do you believe it will come here he asked it is unlikely she said slapping the glove against her arm but the nameless is nearly unstoppable it is everything we have given up and that was a great deal of wielding power if it was sent for meredith then you would need all the preparation time you could manage do you truly think it was loosed to hunt the princess if it had merely been set free it would have ravaged the countryside by now but it has not she stood giving us a view of the nearly naked back of the dress she turned back to us with an abrupt gesture it vanished from our sight all of our sights very quickly we cannot track it which means that the thing is getting some very highly placed help but the nameless is a part of the courts a part of who you were you should be able to track it as you would track your own shadow the moment i finished i knew i should have kept quiet all the anger flowed into her face her posture her hands where they gripped her elbows she shivered with rage i think for a second she was too angry to speak doyle stood putting himself in front of me have you told the seelie court you do not need to hide her away darkness i am working too hard to keep her alive to kill her myself and yes the seelie know what has happened will the two courts come together to hunt the nameless he asked he hadnt moved from in front of me which left me peeking around his body like a child that wasnt exactly the way to be a strong presence i moved so i could see the mirror but they both ignored me no but it is to each ones benefit surely taranis is being difficult hes acting as if the nameless is made up of only unseelie energy pretending that all his light has no taint she looked like shed tasted something sour he will not claim its parentage so he will give no aid for to give aid is to admit his part in its making that is foolishness she nodded he was always one more interested in the illusion of purity than in purity itself what can stand against the nameless he asked voice soft almost as if he were thinking aloud we do not know for we bound it without testing it but it is full of old old magicks things we no longer tolerate among even the unseelie she sat down on the end of the bed almost jerkily whoever released it and hid it from our sight if they can truly control it it is a powerful weapon what do you need of me my queen she looked up at that and the look was not unfriendly what if i said come home come home and protect me what if i said i dont feel safe without you and frost at my side he dropped to one knee his face was lost in a wave of his own hair i am still captain of the queens ravens you would come she asked voice soft if you commanded it i sat on the bed and tried to keep my face neutral i hugged my knees to my chest and tried to not look anything nothing if i could just not think it wouldnt show on my face you say you are still the captain of my ravens but are you still my darkness or do you belong to another now he kept his head down and stayed silent i kept trying to think of nothing she gave me a very unfriendly look you have stolen my darkness from me meredith what do you want me to say aunt andais its good to remind me that you are my blood seeing his back sliced up makes me hope you are more mine than i knew nothing nothing i would think nothing i imagined emptiness like looking through a pane of glass into another pane and another and another clear nothing the nameless was loosed for a reason darkness until i know what that reason is im covering my assets the fair meredith is one of those assets i still hope to get a child out of her she looked at me and it was not a friendly look is he as magnificent as he looks i fought for a neutral voice to match the face yes the queen sighed a pity but i didnt want to give birth to puppies now did i puppies i said didnt he tell you doyle has two aunts whose true forms are dogs his grandmother was one of the hounds of the great hunt hellhounds humans call them now though you know we have nothing to do with hell a different religious system altogether i remembered the baying and the look of hunger in doyles eyes i was aware that doyle wasnt pure sidhe his grandfather was a phouka so evil that he bred in dog form with the wild hunt itself and lived to tell the tale she smiled and it was sweetly malicious doyles as mixed a bag of genetics as i am then the voice was still neutral yeah for me but did you know he was part dog before you took him to your bed doyle stayed kneeling through all this his hair hiding his face i knew he owed his bloodline in part to the wild hunt before he came inside me really she made it sound like she didnt believe me ive heard the belling of the hounds come out of his mouth i moved my hair so she could see the bite mark on my shoulder very near my neck i knew that he dreamed of my flesh in more than one way before i allowed him to satisfy either hunger her eyes grew hard again you surprise me meredith i never thought you had the stomach for violence i do not enjoy hurting people violence in the bedroom when all agree is different ive never found it different she said i know i said how do you do that she asked how do i do what my queen how do you sound so neutral utterly neutral yet somehow you manage to say go to hell with a smile and a neutral word its not deliberate aunt andais believe me at least you didnt try to deny it we do not lie to each other i said and this time my voice was tired arise darkness and show your queen your ravaged back he stood without a word gave his back to the mirror and swept his hair to one side andais came close to the mirror reaching out with one gloved hand so that for a second i thought her hand would keep traveling and come out like a d image i had taken you for a dominant doyle and i dont enjoy being dominated you never asked what i enjoyed my queen he was still facing away from the mirror his back to it i also never thought youd be so blessed down below she sounded wistful now like a child who hadnt gotten what she wanted for her birthday i mean you are descended from dogs and phoukas and they are not much in that way most phoukas have more than one shape my queen dog and horse sometimes eagle yes i know all about that what does that have to do she stopped in midsentence and a smile crooked at the edges of her lipsticked mouth are you saying that your grandfather could turn into a horse as well as a dog he spoke softly yes my queen youre hung like a horse she started to laugh he said nothing only shrugged his broad shoulders i was too startled at her laughter to join it it wasnt always a good thing to amuse the queen my darkness it is wondrous but a horse you are not the phoukas are shapeshifters my queen the laughter faded around the edges then she said in a voice still light with it are you implying that you can change the size would i imply something like that he asked in his neutral voice i watched emotions flow across her face too fast to catch disbelief curiosity and finally a hardedged wanting she stared at him the way misers stare at gold a covetous clinging selfish want when all this is over darkness if you have not fathered a child with the princess we will make you live up to this boast i think i failed at the neutral face but i tried to hang on to it i do not boast my queen doyle said almost in a whisper i dont know what to wish for now my darkness if you make babies with meredith i will never know the joy of you and i still believe what i have always believed and what has truly kept you out of my bed dare i ask what that is he said you may dare i may even answer silence stretched for a second or two then doyle said what do you believe that has kept me out of your bed all these years he turned his head enough to see her face when he asked that you would be king in truth not merely in name and i will not share my power she looked past him to me i fought to keep a blank face and knew i was losing what of you meredith how do you feel about having a true king one who will demand a share of your power and a share of more than your bed i thought of several answers discarded them all and tried very carefully to tell the truth i share better than you do aunt andais she stared at me a look in her eyes that i couldnt read i met that gaze with one of my own letting the sincerity of what id said show in my eyes you share better than me you share better than me what does that mean when i do not share at all it is the truth aunt andais it means exactly what it says nothing more nothing less she stared at me for a long long moment taranis does not share his power either i know i said you cannot be a dictator if you do not dictate i am learning that a queen must rule those around her truly rule them but i am not learning that a queen must dictate to all around her i am finding that the counsel of my guards who you so wisely sent with me is worth listening to i have counselors she said and it sounded almost defensive so does taranis i said andais sat back against one of the bedposts she seemed almost to slump the one bare hand playing along the black ribbons on her dress but neither of us listens to anyone the emperor has no clothes the last comment caught me off guard it must have showed because she said you look surprised niece of mine i didnt expect you to know the story i had a human lover some time ago who was fond of childrens stories he read to me when i could not sleep there was a dreamy wistfulness to her voice now a true note of regret she continued in a more normal tone the nameless has been freed it was last seen headed west i doubt it will get as far as the western sea but i thought you should know all the same with that she made a gesture and the mirror went blank my eyes were very wide in the glass can you make the mirror so that no one can get through without signaling to us first yes he said do it the queen may take that ill i nodded looking at my scared face in the mirror because now that i didnt have to pretend i could look as scared as i felt just do it doyle just do it i dont want any more surprises tonight he went to the mirror and made small gestures at its edges i felt the spell prickle along my skin as i climbed back into the bed doyle turned from the mirror and hesitated by the edge of the bed do you still want company i held out my arms to him come to bed and hold me while we sleep he smiled and slipped under the sheet he spooned his body against mine until i lay cupped in his arms his chest his stomach his groin his thighs he encircled me and i pulled the warm silken hardness of him around me he spoke softly as i began to drift off to sleep you do not mind that my grandmother was a hound of the wild hunt and my grandfather a phouka no my voice was thick with sleep then i asked could i really end up having puppies it is unlikely okay i was almost asleep when i felt him hold me tighter as if i was his security blanket instead of the other way around chapter the grey detective agency didnt usually get called to murder scenes we had helped the police in the past when something mystical was doing something bad but that was usually as decoys or advisers i could count on both hands the number of murder scenes id seen and still have a couple of fingers left over i had one less finger to count today the womans body was already on a gurney her yellow hair trailed across her face darker gold where the ocean had touched it her very short evening dress was pale blue on the edges but dark blue where the water had soaked into it a broad ribbon probably white sat just under her breasts tightening the dress enough to show cleavage her long legs were bare and tanned her toenails were painted a funky blue to match the fingernails her lips were an odd blue color too but it was lipstick not some sign of her death the lipstick color is called asphyxiation i turned to the tall woman just behind me detective lucinda tate walked up with her hands plunged inside the pockets of her slacks she tried to give me her usual smile but it didnt work her eyes stayed worried and the smile vanished before it had really gotten started her eyes were always cynical under the humor but today the cynicism had spilled out and swallowed the humor im sorry lucy what did you say about the lipstick its called asphyxiation its supposed to mimic the lip color of a corpse who died from suffocation nicely ironic she said i looked down at the woman again there were bluish and white tints around the eyes the nose the edges of the lips i had a strange urge to wipe off the lipstick and see if the lips really were the same color i didnt do it but the urge was like a great itch across my palms so she suffocated i said lucy nodded yeah i frowned she didnt drown i doubt it none of the others did i stared up at her others jeremys had to go with teresa to the hospital what happened i asked teresa touched a lipstick that one of the women had been about to put on before she died teresa started hyperventilating then she couldnt breathe if we hadnt had paramedics on the scene she might have died i should have known better than to invite one of the most powerful clairvoyants in the country into this mess she glanced at frost who was standing a little out of the way one hand on the other wrist very bodyguardish the effect was somewhat ruined by his silver hair spilling around him in the wind as if it was trying to pull loose from the ponytail a pale pink shirt matched the show hankie in the white suit jacket that matched the slacks the slender silver belt matched his hair his shiny loafers were creamy tan he looked more like a fashion plate than a guard though the wind gave occasional glimpses of the black shoulder holster underneath all that v white and pink jeremy said you were running late today detective lucy said you getting much sleep lately merry not much i didnt bother to explain it wasnt frost who had kept me up last night we were doing friendly banter empty meaningless something to say to fill the windy silence while we stood over the dead woman i looked down at her face lovely even in death the body looked thin not exactly strong more like shed dieted her way to a size whatever if shed known she would die last night would she have gone off her diet the day before how old was she her id says twentythree she looks older i said dieting and too much sun will do that to you any flash of humor had gone now she was somber as she looked up on the cliff above us you ready to see the rest sure but im a little puzzled about why you called jeremy and all of us in its sad but she got herself killed or choked to death or something she suffocated its horrible but why call us in i didnt call in your two bodyguards for the first time there was true hostility on her face she pointed down the beach at rhys frost might have been uncomfortable but rhys was having a very good time he watched everything with an eager eye smiling humming the theme song to hawaii fiveo under his breath or at least thats what hed been humming when he went farther down the beach to watch some of the uniforms wade in the surf rhys had already done magnum pi until frost told him to stop rhys preferred film noir and would always be a bogart fan at heart but bogie wasnt making movies anymore in the last few months rhys discovered reruns in color that he actually enjoyed he turned toward us and waved smiling his white trench coat billowed out around him like wings as he began to trudge his way back up the beach he had had to take off his tan fedora to keep it from blowing into the sea rhys is creepy around murder scenes detective lucy said he always has such a good time like hes happy someones dead i didnt know how to explain that rhys had once been worshipped as a god of death so death didnt bother him all that much but that part was best not shared with the police i said you know how much he loves film noir this isnt a movie she said whats got you all upset lucy ive seen you at worse murder scenes than this why are you so bothered you just wait you wont need to ask once youve seen it can you just tell me lucy please rhys came up to us face all shiny like a kid on yule morning hi detective tate theres no burst blood vessels in the girls eyes no bruising anywhere that i could find does anyone know how she suffocated you looked at the body her voice was cold he nodded still smiling i thought thats what we were here to do she pointed a finger at his chest you werent invited to this show merry was and jeremy was and teresa was but you she poked the finger into his chest were not the smile faded and left his tricolored blue eye cold merry has to have two bodyguards with her at all times you know that yeah i know that she poked again hard enough that he was shoved backwards just a little but i dont like you around my murder scenes i know the rules detective i havent messed with your evidence ive stayed out of the way of everyone from the emts to the video photographer the wind gusted blowing her dark hair across her face so she was forced to take a hand out of her pocket to smooth it back then stay out of my way too rhys why what did i do wrong you enjoy this the last was almost spit in his face youre not supposed to enjoy it she stalked back up the beach toward the stairs that led up to the road the parking lot and the club on its little promontory who licked her fur the wrong way he asked shes creeped out by whatevers up the stairs and she needs someone to take it out on youre it why me frost had joined us because she is human and humans mourn death they dont enjoy poking at it like you do thats a lie rhys said a lot of the detectives enjoy their work and i know the medical examiner does but they dont go around humming at the crime scene i said sometimes they do rhys said i frowned at him trying to figure out how to make it more clear humans hum or sing or tell bad jokes over the bodies so they wont be scared you hum because youre happy this doesnt bother you he glanced down at the dead woman she doesnt care anymore shes dead we could stage a wagnerian opera on top of her and she wouldnt care i touched his arm rhys its not the dead you should try to placate its the living he frowned at me be less happy in front of the humans when you are looking at their dead frost said very well but i dont understand why i should pretend pretend that detective tate is queen andais i said and it bothers her that you go around chortling over the dead i watched some thought slip over his face then he shrugged i can seem less happy around the detective but i still dont understand why i sighed and looked at frost do you understand why if it were my kinswoman on the gurney i would feel something for her death i turned back to rhys see he shrugged ill be sad around detective tate just somber will do rhys id had this sudden image of him falling on the next corpse with weeping and wailing dont overdo it he grinned at me and i knew that hed been thinking of exactly what id feared i mean it rhys if you dont behave yourself tate could get you barred from crime scenes he suddenly looked somber that mattered to him okay okay ill be good sheesh detective tate yelled back at us her voice riding the wind like seagulls overhead she was halfway up the stairs and it was impressive that her voice carried back to us so clearly hurry it up we dont have all day here actually we do rhys said i was already walking through the soft sand toward the stairs i was very sorry that id worn high heels today and i didnt protest when frost offered me his arm actually we do what i asked we have all day we have all eternity the dead arent going anywhere i glanced at him he was watching the tall detective with a sort of faraway almost dreamy look on his face you know what rhys he looked at me raising one eyebrow lucys right youre creepy at a murder scene he grinned again not nearly as creepy as i could be whats that supposed to mean rhys wouldnt answer he just started walking ahead of us in his lowerheeled shoes i looked up at frost what did he mean by that rhys was once called the lord of relics and that means what i asked nearly stumbling in the heels holding tighter to his arm relics is an old poetic word it means corpse i stopped him with my hands on his arm and stared up at him i tried to see his eyes through a tangle of his silver hair and my own red fluttering across my face when a sidhe is called a lord of anything it means they have power over it so youre saying what that rhys can cause death i knew that no meredith i am saying that he could at one point raise the old dead those that had grown stiff and cold to rise and fight on our side in battle i just stared at him i didnt know rhys had that kind of power he no longer does when the nameless was created rhys lost the power to raise armies of the dead we had no more use for armies among ourselves and to fight the humans in such a way would have meant our expulsion from this country frost hesitated then said many of us lost our most otherworldly powers when the nameless was cast but i do not know of any who lost so much as rhys i watched rhys walking ahead of us his white curls blowing in the wind to mingle with the white of his coat he had gone from being a god who could raise armies at his will to being rhys is that why he wont tell me his real name the name he was worshipped under when he lost his powers he took the name rhys and said that the other was dead along with his magic everyone including the queen has always respected that it could so easily have been any one of us who gave the most of ourselves to the spell i balanced on one foot while i slipped off the heels my stocking feet would do for the sand how did you get everyone to agree to the nameless those in power decreed death for any who opposed it i should have guessed i transferred my shoes to one hand and slipped my other hand back on frosts arm i mean how did andais get taranis to agree that is a secret only the queen and taranis know he touched my hair smoothing it back from my face unlike rhys i do not like being around so much death and sadness i look forward to tonight i turned my face and kissed his palm me too merry lucy tate screamed at me from the top of the steps rhys was almost even with her lucy walked out of sight with rhys almost but not quite chasing her if you could call it chasing at a casual walk i tugged on frosts arm we had better hurry yes frost said i do not trust rhyss sense of humor alone with the detective we exchanged a glance on the windy beach then we began to hurry toward the steps i think we were both hoping to get there before rhys did something cute and unfortunate i for one didnt believe wed make it in time chapter some of the bodies were in body bags plastic cocoons from which nothing would wake but theyd run out of body bags and just started laying the uncovered bodies out i could not count at a glance how many there were more than fifty maybe a hundred maybe more i couldnt bring myself to start counting to make them just things in a row so i stopped trying to estimate i tried to stop thinking at all i tried to pretend that i was back at court and this was one of the queens entertainments you never dared show distaste disgust horror or least of all fear at one of her little shows if you did shed often make you join in on the fun her shows ran more to sex and torture than true death and suffocation wasnt one of andaiss kinks so this little disaster wouldnt have pleased her shed probably see it as a waste so many people who could have admired her so many people she could have terrorized i pretended that my life depended on keeping a blank face and feeling nothing it was the only way i knew to walk among the bodies and not have hysterics my life depended on not going into hysterics i repeated it in my head like a mantra my life depends on not having hysterics my life depends on not having hysterics and it kept me moving down the rows kept me able to look down at all this horror and not scream the bodies that werent covered all had lips almost the same shade of blue as the girl on the beach except this obviously wasnt lipstick theyd all suffocated but not instantly they hadnt dropped magically and mercifully in their tracks there were nail marks on some of the bodies where theyd clawed at their throats their chests as if trying to get air into lungs that no longer worked nine bodies seemed different from the others i couldnt figure out what it was but i kept pacing in front of the nine scattered in a row among the others frost had paced beside me at first but he was back at the edge of the floor trying to stay out of the way of the hurrying uniforms plainclothes paramedics and all the extra people who seem to accumulate at any murder scene i remembered being surprised the first time i saw how very many people tracked through a murder scene behind frost was something covered with a tablecloth but it wasnt a body it took me a few seconds to realize that it was a christmas tree someone had covered the artificial greenery covered the entire christmas display it was as if someone hadnt wanted the tree to see the bodies like hiding the eyes of the innocent so they wont be tarnished it should have seemed ridiculous but it didnt somehow it seemed appropriate to cover the decorations in this room to hide them away so they wouldnt be spoiled frost seemed unaware of the covered tree or much of anything else rhys on the other hand seemed aware of everything he stayed right at my side he wasnt humming or even smiling now hed been subdued since we walked in on the carnage though carnage seemed the wrong word for it carnage seemed to imply blood and flesh ripped and torn this was strangely clean almost impersonal no not impersonal cold id seen people who enjoyed slaughter and they literally enjoyed the act of cutting someone up the feel of the blade in flesh there was no savage joy in this scene it was just death cold death as if the grim reaper had been brought to life to ride through this place what is it about these nine thats different i hadnt realized id spoken aloud until rhys answered me they went quietly no nail marks no signs of struggle these and only these nine just dropped where they were dancing what in goddesss name happened here rhys what the fuck are you doing here princess meredith we both turned to the far side of the room the man stalking toward us through the bodies was medium build balding obviously muscular and even more obviously pissed lieutenant peterson isnt it i said the first and last time id met peterson id been trying to convince the police to investigate the possibility that a fey aphrodisiac had gotten out into the human population theyd informed me that aphrodisiacs didnt work and neither did love spells id proven that it did work and nearly caused a riot in the los angeles police department the lieutenant had been one of the men id use to prove my point theyd had to handcuff him before they could drag him off me dont be pleasant princess what the fuck are you doing here i smiled its lovely to see you too lieutenant he didnt smile get out now before i have you thrown out rhys moved an inch closer to my side petersons eyes flicked to him then back to me i see your two gorillas if they try anything diplomatic immunity or no diplomatic immunity theyre going to jail i glanced back just enough to see that frost was drifting closer i shook my head and he stopped he frowned clearly not happy but he didnt have to be happy he just had to give me room have you ever seen this many dead before i asked my voice was quiet what peterson asked i repeated my question he shook his head what does that have to do with anything its horrible i said yeah its horrible and what the fuck does that have to do with anything youd be friendlier if it wasnt such a horrible crime scene he made a sound that was almost a laugh but too harsh to be one well hell princess this is friendly this is exactly how friendly i am to murderers like you who hide behind diplomatic immunity he smiled but it was a baring of teeth like a snarl id once been suspected of killing a man whod attempted to rape me i hadnt done it but without diplomatic immunity i might have gone to jail anyway id have at least seen a trial i didnt try to deny it again peterson wouldnt believe me now any more than he had before why are these nine bodies the only ones that went quietly i asked he frowned at me what why are these nine bodies the only ones without signs of struggle on them this is a police investigation and i am the senior officer onsite this is my investigation and i dont care if you are one of our civilian advisers on metaphysical shit i dont even care if youve helped us out in the past youve never done shit for me and i dont need help from any goddamned faerie so for the last time get the fuck out of here id tried being sympathetic id tried being businesslike when being good doesnt help you can always be bad i reached out toward him as if to touch his face he did what i knew hed do he backed up whats wrong lieutenant i made sure to look puzzled dont ever touch me his voice was quieter now and i realized much more dangerous than the yelling it wasnt the touch of my skin that drove you mad last time lieutenant it was the branwyns tears his voice dropped even lower dont ever touch me again there was something in his eyes that was frightening he was afraid of me really afraid and that made him hate me rhys stepped a little ahead of me not quite putting himself between me and the lieutenant but almost i didnt fight him its never comforting to have anyone look at you with such hatred weve met only once lieutenant why do you hate me it was a question so direct that even a human wouldnt have asked it but i didnt understand couldnt understand so i had to ask he looked down hiding his eyes as if he hadnt expected me to see so far into his soul his voice was very low when he said you forget i saw what you left on that bed just a pile of raw meat cut to ribbons without dental records we couldnt have recognized him and you wonder why i dont want you to touch me he shook his head and looked at me eyes blank and unreadable cop eyes now get out princess take your two goons and get out i am senior officer in charge and i wont have you here his voice was calm now very calm too calm for standing in the middle of all this lieutenant i called the grey detective agency lucy tate came in from the deck and who authorized that peterson asked ive never needed special authorization to bring them in before she picked her way through the lines of bodies and when she got close enough lucy was over a head taller than the lieutenant the clairvoyant i understand even mr grey because hes a wellknown magician but why her he jerked a thumb at me the sidhe are well known for magic use lieutenant i thought the more heads we have on this one the better you thought you thought well dont think detective just follow procedure and procedure is that you check with the head of the task force and thats me and i say shes not welcome lieutenant i detective tate if you want to stay on this task force youll follow my lead my orders and you wont argue with me is that clear i watched lucy struggle with his sharp words then finally she said yes sir thats clear good he said because the upper brass can think anything they want but its my ass on the line here in the cameras and i say its some kind of toxic gas or poison when they finish the toxicology work on the other bodies theyll know what it is and itll be our job to find out who did it look first for whodunit not whatdunit you dont have to go to fairytale land to solve this murder its just another crazy son of a bitch thats as mortal as everyone else in this room he turned his head to one side in an odd gesture then looked at me at rhys and at frost beyond sorry my mistake mortal as all the rest of us humans in this room now you take you immortal asses and get out of here and if i hear that anyone on my watch has been talking to you theyll be up on disciplinary charges is that clear to everyone yes sir lucy said i smiled charmingly at him thanks so much lieutenant i hated being here among all this death its been one of the worst things ive ever seen in my life so thank you for letting me leave when it was taking everything i had not to run out i kept smiling as i pulled off the one surgical glove id put on i hadnt touched anything or any body because i hadnt wanted to take the feel of their dead flesh back with me rhys stripped off his gloves too and he had touched things we worked our way to the bag set out for glove disposal and i couldnt help saying just before we stepped out the door thanks again lieutenant for letting me go i agree with you i dont know what the hell im doing here with that i left rhys and frost trailing behind me like pale shadows chapter i was behind the wheel of the acura before i realized i couldnt remember where we were supposed to be going i stared at the keys in my hands and couldnt think where are we going the men exchanged a look then rhys said from the backseat let me drive merry he reached between the seats and took the keys gently from my hand i didnt argue the day seemed to be full of a high buzzing sound like some invisible mosquito humming in my ear rhys held the door open for me and i walked around to the passengerside door frost held the door for me and got me settled in before getting into the back i was lucky that rhys was with me frost didnt know how to drive a car buckle up rhys said it wasnt like me to forget my seat belt it took me two tries to get the belt fastened whats wrong with me shock rhys said as he put the car in gear shock why frost answered leaning forward over my seat most of the guards never buckled up they could be decapitated and not die so i guess a little trip through a windshield didnt worry them you said it yourself to the policeman you have never seen anything as awful as what you have just seen have you seen worse he was quiet for a second then said yes i glanced at rhys who had moved us onto the pacific highway with its beautiful views of the ocean how about you how about me what he asked flashing me a grin i frowned at him have you seen worse yes and no im not going to tell you about it not even if i ask nicely especially if you ask nicely if i was angry enough i might try to shock you with the horrors ive seen but im not angry with you and i dont want to hurt you frost i am sure rhys has seen worse than was not alive during the very first battles when our people fought the firbolgs i knew the firbolgs were the first semidivine inhabitants of the british isles and ireland i knew that my ancestors had defeated them and won the right to be the new rulers of the lands it was several thousand years of history away that i knew what i hadnt known was that rhys was older than frost older than most of the sidhe that rhys was one of the first of us to come to the isles now thought to be the original home of all sidhe rhys is older than you are yes i looked at rhys he suddenly seemed very interested in driving rhys yes he said looking straight ahead he maneuvered a curve a little too fast so hed have to play with the wheel how much older are you than frost i dont remember his voice held a plaintive note yes you do he glanced at me no i dont its been too long merry i dont remember what year frost was born he sounded grumpy now do you remember what year you were born i asked frost he seemed to think about it then shook his head not really rhys is right on one thing after a time it simply is too long to think about are you saying you all begin to lose parts of your memories no frost said but it no longer becomes important what year you were born you know that we do not celebrate our birthdays well yes but i never really thought about why i turned back to rhys his face looked almost grim so youve seen worse than back there at the club restaurant whatever yes the word was very short clipped if i asked you to tell me about it would you no he said there is no that can be worn down to yes then there is no rhyss no was one of those i left it alone besides i wasnt sure i wanted stories today about awful deaths especially if that death was worse than what wed just walked through it was the most dead id ever seen and more than id ever wanted to see ill respect your wishes he glanced at me almost as if he didnt trust me thats big of you no need to be snide rhys he shrugged sorry merry im just not feeling particularly good right now i thought i was the only one having trouble handling this its not the bodies that bothered me rhys said its the fact that the lieutenant is wrong it wasnt gas or poison or anything like that what do you mean rhys what did you see that i didnt frost leaned back away from my seat okay what did you both see that i didnt see rhys kept staring at the road there was silence from the backseat someone talk to me i said you seem to be feeling better frost said i am theres nothing like getting a little angry to get you through things now what did you two see there that i missed you were shielding too hard to see anything mystical rhys said you bet i was do you know how much metaphysical crap there is in a place where youve had a recent murder let alone a mass execution there are a lot of spirits that are attracted to sites like that they flock like vultures to feed on the remaining living feeding off their horror their sorrow you can go clean into a place like that and come out covered in riders we know what the spirits that fly the air can do frost said probably better than i do i said but youre sidhe and you dont get riders we dont get small ones frost said but i have seen others of our kind nearly possessed by incorporeal beings it does happen especially if someone works with dark magic well im human enough that ill pick up things casually i dont have to do a thing to attract them except not shield well enough you tried to sense as little as possible while you were there rhys said i am a private detective not a professional psychic im not even a professional magician or witch i had no business being there today i couldnt help you could have helped if youd let your shields down just a little rhys said fine ill try to be braver next time now what did you see frost sighed loudly enough for me to hear him i could feel the remnants of a powerful spell very powerful it clung in stinging echoes to the place could you sense it as soon as we got inside no i did not wish to touch the dead so i searched with other senses besides touch and vision i as you say dropped my shields it was then that i sensed the spell do you know what spell it was i asked id turned in my seat enough to see him shake his head i do rhyss voice turned me back around to him what did you say anyone who concentrated could have sensed the remains of magic merry could have seen it if shed wanted to it would have told her nothing as it told me nothing frost said but it would have made it harder for her to endure what she saw im not arguing that rhys said what i mean is that i got down and looked at the bodies nine of them dropped where they stood but the rest had time to fight to be afraid to try to run but they didnt run like theyd run if say wild animals had attacked them they didnt go for the doors or break a window not as soon as they saw what was happening its as if they couldnt see anything you speak in riddles frost said yeah plain english rhys please what if they didnt run because they didnt realize that anything was in the room what do you mean i asked most humans cant see spirits of any kind yeah but if youre implying that spirits noncorporeal beings killed everybody at the club then i cant agree noncorporeal beings riders whatever they dont have the physical oomph to take out that many people like that they might be able to do one person who was very susceptible to their influence but even thats debatable not noncorporeal beings merry but a different kind of spirit i blinked at him you mean what ghosts he nodded ghosts dont do things like this rhys they might be able to scare someone into a heart attack if the person had a weak heart but thats it real ghosts dont harm people if you get true physical damage then youre dealing with something other than ghosts it depends on what kind of ghosts youre talking about merry what do you mean by that there is only one kind of ghost he glanced at me then having to turn his head almost completely around because of the eye patch he often glanced at me when he drove but it was a movement without meaning because his right eye was gone he couldnt see me now he made the effort to look at me with his left eye you know so much id always assumed rhys was one of the younger sidhe because he never made me feel like i was in the wrong century he was one of the few who had a house outside the faerie mound electricity a license now he looked at me as if i were a child and would never understand stop that i said he turned back to the road stop what i hate it when any of you give me that look the look that says im so young and i couldnt possibly understand what youve experienced well fine ill never be a thousand years old but im over thirty and by human standards im not a child please dont treat me like one then stop acting like one he said and his voice was full of reproach again like a disappointed teacher i got enough of that from doyle i didnt need it from rhys how did i act like a child because i wouldnt drop shields and see all that horror no because you say there is only one type of ghost like its the only truth trust me merry there are more than human shades running around like what i asked he took a deep breath flexing his hands on the steering wheel what happens to an immortal being when it dies theyre reincarnated like everybody else he smiled no merry if it can be killed then by definition its not immortal the sidhe say theyre immortal but they arent there are things that can kill us not without magical help there isnt i said it doesnt matter how its done merry what matters is that it can be done which brings us back to the question what happens to the immortals when they die they cant die theyre immortal i said exactly he said i frowned at him okay i give up what did that mean if something cant die but it does what happens to it you mean the elder ones frost said yes rhys said but they are not ghosts frost said they are what remains of the first gods come on guys rhys said think with me a human ghost is what remains of a human after death before it goes to the afterlife or in some cases a piece gets left behind because its too hard to let go but it is the spiritual remains of a human being right we both agreed so arent the remnants of the first gods just ghosts of the gods themselves no frost said because if someone could discover their name again and give them followers they could theoretically rise to life again human ghosts do not have such an option does the fact that the humans dont have the option make the elder ones less a ghost rhys asked i was beginning to get a headache okay fine say that there are ghosts of elder gods running around what has that got to do with anything i said i knew the spell i dont not exactly but i have seen the shades of the elder let loose on fey it was as if the very air turned deadly their lives were just sucked out of them fey are immortal i said anything that can be killed even if it reincarnates is mortal merry length of life doesnt change that so youre saying that these ghosts were let loose in that club fey are harder to kill than humans if the place had been full of fey some might have survived or been able to protect themselves but yes i am saying that thats what did it so the ghosts of dead gods killed over a hundred people in a nightclub in california yes rhys said could it have been the nameless he seemed to think about that then shook his head no if it had been the nameless the building wouldnt be standing that powerful that destructive when did you see this happen the first time before frost was born so a few thousand years ago yes who called the ghosts up then who did the spell a sidhe who has been dead longer than england has been ruled by the normans and their descendents i did quick history math in my head so before yes is there anyone alive today who could do the spell probably but its forbidden to do it if youre caught its an automatic execution no trial no commuting the sentence you just get dead who would risk such a thing to harm a crowd of humans on the edge of the western sea frost asked no one rhys said how sure are you that these elder ghosts did this i asked theres always the possibility that some human magician has come up with a new spell that resembles the effects but id bet a great deal that it was the elder ghosts do the ghosts take the lives for their master frost asked no they keep the lives and they feed on them theoretically if they were allowed to feed each night unchecked they could become alive again for lack of a better word they need the aid of a mortal to do it but some of the elder ones can be brought back to full strength if they get enough lives sometimes one of them will convince a cult somewhere that theyre the devil and get them to sacrifice themselves and that could work but it would take enormous amounts of lives to do it taking the lives from the mouths of the victims is quicker no wasted energy like trying to drink blood from an offering bowl has one of them ever been brought back to full strength i asked no its always been stopped before it got that far but to my knowledge theyve never been let loose to feed directly except for once and that was in a controlled situation where they were contained as soon as the spell was finished if theyve gotten out without a leash on them then what can stop them i asked the spell needs to be reversed how do we do that i dont know ill have to talk to some of the others back at the apartment rhys i said softly because a horrible idea had just occurred to me yeah if the only person youve ever known to do this spell was a sidhe then does that mean its one of us again silence for a few heartbeats then thats what im afraid of because if its a sidhe and the police find out if they could prove it it might be grounds to evict us all from american soil theres an addendum to the treaty between us and jefferson that says if we perform magic that is detrimental to the national interest then we are considered outcast and well have to move on thats why you didnt mention this in front of the police i said one of the reasons he said whats the other merry they cant do anything about this they cant stop these things im not even sure that there are sidhe alive today who can stop them there has to be at least one sidhe who could stop them i said how do you figure rhys asked a sidhe let them loose he could put them back maybe rhys said or maybe the reason they slaughtered a hundred humans in a matter of minutes is that the sidhe lost control of them they may have killed him when he couldnt control them fine if a sidhe raised these things why are they in california and not in illinois where the sidhe are rhys did another of those fullface turns merry dont you get it what if they wanted a way to kill you that couldnt be traced back to faerie oh but we did trace it back to faerie i said only because im here most of the court forgets who i was and i dont remind them because thanks to the nameless i dont have the power to be that anymore he couldnt quite keep the bitterness out of his voice then he laughed im probably one of the few sidhe alive who saw what esras did i was there and whoever raised the elders just forgot about me he laughed again but it burned with mockery as if it hurt coming out of his throat they forgot about me heres hoping i can make them regret that little oversight id never heard rhys so full of anything but lust or teasing he was never serious for long if he could help it i looked at him as he drove us toward the apartment to pick up kitto there was a look to his face a set to his shoulders even the grip of his hands seemed to have changed i realized in that moment that i didnt really know him he hid behind a veil of humor lightness but underneath was more much more he was my bodyguard and my lover and i didnt know him at all i wasnt sure if i owed rhys an apology or if he owed me one chapter the drive all the way back to el segundo was out of the way to say the least but when kitto had woken up this morning hed had circles under his eyes like purple bruises and his pale skin had seemed tissuepaper thin as if hed worn thin over the night i couldnt see him walking around on the open beach with nothing but a press of sky above him once i knew the location of the scene i gave kitto a chance to decide and hed opted to crawl back into his covered dog bed i walked up the stairs from the parking area sandwiched between frost in front and rhys in back frost spoke as we rounded the edge of the small pool if the little one does not begin to thrive you are going to have to send him back to kurag i know i said we went up the last flight of steps and were almost instantly at my door im just worried about what kurag will send next he expected me to be offended when he offered kitto in the first place the fact that i took him and was okay with it really bothered him by goblin standards kitto is ugly rhys said it made me glance back at at him he still hadnt regained his usual savoir faire he looked downright glum i didnt ask how rhys who understood almost nothing of goblin culture knew what they considered pretty with a sidhe warrior theirs for the evening i was sure the goblins had given him only the most beautiful among them by their standards the goblins prized extra eyes and extra limbs and kitto didnt fit the bill i know and hes not connected to the royal house in any way kurag expected me to refuse and thus hed have gotten out of our treaty we were at the door a small potted geranium pale pink was sitting by the door galen had taken over most of the house chores like searching for an apartment big enough for all of us and buying flowers for wandering fey to rest in wed have had a bigger apartment ages ago if price hadnt been a problem but it was a very big problem to find a place big enough for all of us that we could afford most places had limits on how many people theyd allow to live there and six adults was over that limit i was still refusing money from the courts because no one gives money without expecting something in return frost thought i was just being stubborn but doyle agreed that there was always a price on any favor i was pretty sure what andaiss favor would be not to kill her son if i got the throne and that was one favor i could not afford to grant i knew that cel would never accept me as queen not as long as he was alive that andais didnt understand this was simply a mothers blindness cel was a wretched twisted being but his mother loved him which was more than i could say for my own mother frost pushed the door open entering first hed checked and the wards had been intact the sweet clean smell of lavender and sage incense met us at the door the main altar sat in the far corner of the living room so that everyone could use it you didnt need the altar you could stand in the middle of a meadow or a woods or a crowded subway and deity was always with you if you paid attention and if you invited it into your heart but the altar was a nice reminder a place to start out every day with a little communion of the spirit people often thought that the sidhe had no religion i mean they were once gods themselves right well sort of they were worshipped as gods but most sidhe acknowledge powers greater than they are most of us bend knee to goddess and consort or some variation thereof goddess is the giver of all life and consort is all that is male they are the template for everything that descends from them she especially she is a greater power than anything on the planet anything that is flesh no matter how spiritual that flesh may once have been except for the thin trail of incense from the altar and a small carved bowl of water that had been added to the altar the apartment looked empty it didnt feel empty though there was the small skintingling of magic nearby not big magic but more the everyday kind doyle was probably on the mirror talking to someone hed opted to stay behind today and try to uncover more information about the nameless from some of our friends at court doyles magic was subtle enough that he might go completely undetected as he moved around amongst them i could not have done it rhys locked the door and pulled a taped note off it galens out apartment hunting he hopes we like the flower he pulled a second note from the door nicca hopes to finish up the bodyguard job today the actress is in no danger frost said as he began to slip his jacket off i believe most sincerely that her agent put her up to it to get more attention for a how do they say flagging career i nodded her last two movies were pretty much flops both financially and artistically that i did not know but the media is there to photograph us more than her shes taking you to all the hot spots where you are bound to get seen i wanted to slip off the high heels but we were going right back out to work so instead i walked to kittos covered hideyhole and knelt down smoothing my skirt behind automatically so the buckles on my shoes wouldnt snag my hose i could see his back curled toward the opening kitto you awake he didnt move i touched his back and the skin was cold mother help us frost rhys somethings wrong frost was at my side instantly rhys hung back frost touched the goblins back hes like ice he reached farther in so he could feel the pulse in the neck he waited waited for too long before finally saying his blood does flow but slowly he reached in and began pulling kitto out from his nest he came like one already dead his limbs moving as if he was just dead weight kitto i didnt scream his name but it was close his eyes were closed but it seemed i could see the vibrant blue of his pupils behind the closed lids as if the skin was translucent his eyes fluttered open and a slit of blue showed before his eyes rolled up into his head he was murmuring something and i bent close to hear it was my name merry merry over and over hed stripped down to his shorts and i could see his veins through his skin the muscles a dark shape on his chest moved and i realized that it was his heart beating i could see it it was if he were melting or i looked up at frost hes fading he nodded rhys had gone to the bedroom door and brought doyle out they gathered round us but the looks on their faces said more than words no i said its not hopeless theres got to be something that we can do they all exchanged looks that flitting game of glance throwing like the thoughts were too heavy to bear and you had to throw them to the next person and the next i grabbed doyles arm there has to be something we do not know what would hold a goblin from fading his mother was sidhe save him the way youd save another sidhe doyle looked a little disdainful as if id insulted them all dont go all high and mighty on me doyle dont let him die because hes less mixed than either of us his expression softened meredith merry a sidhe fades only if he wishes it so once the process is begun it cannot be stopped no there has to be something we can do he frowned down at us all hold him while i try to contact kurag if we cannot save him as sidhe we will try to save him as goblin kitto lay still in frosts arms merry needs to hold him doyle said as he went for the bedroom frost laid kitto in my arms across my lap i slumped to the floor put a hand under his legs and pulled him into my lap he fit here was a man who i could hold in my lap id spent much of my life around beings smaller than kitto but none who had looked so sidhe maybe that was why he seemed so dolllike at times i laid my cheek against his icy forehead kitto please please come back come back from wherever youve gone please kitto its merry hed stopped murmuring my name hed stopped making any noise and his weight the way his body slumped against me he felt dead not dying but dead there is a weight to a dead body that the living no matter how sick do not have logically it has to be the same but it never feels the same doyle came back out muttering under his breath kurag is not near his mirror or any still body of water i cannot reach him merry i am sorry if kitto were sidhe what would you do to save him the sidhe do not fade from lack of faerie doyle said the sidhe fade only when they wish to i held his cold body in my arms and felt the beginnings of tears but tears wouldnt help him damn it i needed to talk to kurag now what was one thing all goblin warriors had on their bodies at all times give me your blade frost what my blade is trapped under kittos body i need a blade now do as she says doyle said frost didnt like doing something he didnt understand but he took out a knife from behind his back one that was almost as long as my forearm and handed it to me hilt first i took my hand out from under kittos legs and said hold the blade steady frost dropped to one knee steadying the blade with both hands i took a deep breath placed my finger against the point and jerked downward it took a second for the blood to well merry stop hold the blade frost thats all you have to do so do it i cant hold the blade and kitto too just do it he frowned but stayed kneeling holding the blade as i drew my bleeding finger down that shining surface the blood didnt coat it just stained it almost beading on the immaculate surface i dropped the shields that kept me from seeing spirits kept me from shedding magic like old body skin the magic flared for a second glad to be free then i willed it into the blade i pictured kurag his face his voice his rough manner kurag i call you kurag thousandslayer i call you kurag king of the goblins i call you thrice called thrice named come to me kurag come answer your blade the surface gleamed through the light latticework of blood but it was just metal no sidhe has called a goblin by blade in centuries rhys said he wont answer the naming of three is very powerful doyle said kurag might be able to ignore it but few others of his people could but i have something he wont ignore i leaned close to the blade and blew my breath warm upon it until it fogged with the heat of my body the blade glittered through the fog the blood the fog cleared and the blood soaked into the surface as if it had been drunk i was left staring into a dim silvered surface a blade even the highest quality is not like a mirror no matter what the movies show a blade gives an uncertain image misty as if you need to adjust some button or knob but there is none there is only a vague outline of a small portion of a persons face their eyes are the most clear a blur of yellow lumpcovered skin and two orange eyes appeared in the downside blade half the upper was less clear but showed kurags third eye like a dim sun seen through cloud his voice was as clear as if hed been standing in the room it boomed out in a surprising rumble that made me jump meredith princess of the sidhe was that your sweet breath that blew across my skin greetings kurag goblin king and twin of kurag goblin kings flesh greetings also kurag had a parasitic twin who consisted of one violet eye a mouth two thin arms two thin legs and small though fully functional genitalia the mouth could breathe but not speak and to my knowledge i was the only one who ever acknowledged his existence as separate from the kings i still remember the horror i felt when i realized there was an entire person trapped in the side of kurags body it has been long since a sidhe has called the goblins by blood and blade most of the warriors who fought beside us after the great treaty have forgotten this old trick my father taught me many tricks i said kurag and i both knew that my father had often contacted him by blade and blood my father had been andaiss unofficial ambassador to the goblins because no one else wanted the job my father had taken me to the goblin hill many times as a child his laughter did not so much roll out of the blade as roll through the room what would you have of me merry daughter of essus hed offered his help and that was what i needed i described the condition wed found kitto in hes fading kurag cursed in the guttural language that was high goblin i understood only about every other word something about black tits the mark ties you together you and kitto your strength should sustain him his hand passed over his face like a yellow ghost in the blade this should not be happening i thought of something what if the mark healed over the mark would not heal it would scar he said it did heal kurag and it did not scar his orange eyes got very close to the blade and very wide that should not happen i didnt know that it was a problem to have it heal kitto didnt say anything a lovers mark always scars merry always at least among our kind i couldnt read his expression in that narrow piece of reflection but suddenly he let out a great snort and said has he been allowed to mark that white flesh only once yes i said and the sex he sounded suspicious now the treaty demanded only that i share flesh sharing true flesh is more valuable among the goblins than sex gabriels hounds take me yes we value flesh but whats a little bite without a little poke sinking teeth and dick into flesh merry girl thats the ticket kitto shares my bed kurag and stays with me most of the time touching me he seems to need to touch me if the touch of your skin was all he had he dissolved into high goblin again which goblins rarely did it was considered rude to use a language that the other person didnt know my father had taught me some goblin but it had been too long and kurags use was too rapid for my rusty skills when kurag had ranted long enough he paused for breath and spoke in a language we could all understand the high and mighty sidhe goblins are good enough to fight all your wars do most of the dying but not good enough to fuck sometimes i hate you all even you merry and youre one of my favorites i love you too kurag dont sweettalk me merry if youd have fucked kitto regularly the mark would have scarred he needs a constant supply of flesh to sustain him out in the western lands either true flesh or fucking but his tie to you is too weak without it and he is dying because of it i looked down at the still cold figure in my arms then realized he wasnt as cold he was still chilled very but not icy hes warmer i said it softly i think because i couldnt quite believe it doyle touched kittos face he is warmer is that you darkness kurag asked it is i goblin king is he truly fading i dont think merry has ever seen anyone fade he is fading doyle said then why is he warmer if he is fading then he should grow colder and colder merry has been holding him in her arms for a time i believe that is warming him maybe its not too late then is he strong enough to fuck he is barely conscious doyle said kurag said a sharp word that i knew meant something that no goblin ever wished on another impotency it was their worst insult one to the other can he tear her flesh with his teeth we all stared down at the still form he was warmer though he still hadnt moved at all i dont think so i said blood then can he take blood kurag asked maybe i said if we wiped it upon his mouth we might get some of it into him doyle said if it did not choke him hes a goblin darkness he cant choke to death on blood does it have to be merrys blood this from rhys i know you of old rhys and that silence held a name that no one used anymore you should come visit us again sidhe the womenfolk still talk of you thats high praise from a goblin female rhys had gone very pale and very quiet he made no answer kurag gave an unpleasant laugh yes it must be merrys blood later if some of the rest of you want to share blood and flesh with kitto feel free the sidhe are always good eatin he glared at me with those orange eyes if the blood revives him then give him flesh merry real flesh this time his eyes suddenly grew huge in the blade he must have nearly pressed his nose to the blade you thought youd get the goblins as allies for six months and not have to bed one of us you shared flesh so i cant say you lied about the alliance but you pixied on the spirit of it you know it and i know it i placed my stillbleeding finger against kittos lips painting them crimson while i talked to his king if i take him to my bed then he has a chance to be king king of all the unseelie that is worth more than a sixmonth alliance kittos eyes flickered his mouth made a small movement i slid my finger over his lips between his teeth and his body jerked once oh no you wont get me that easy merry girl not that easy you give him flesh like you should have done all along and you get only three more months out of us after that your battles are your own kitto began to suck on my finger like a baby gently at first then harder harder teeth beginning to graze my skin hes sucking my finger kurag id take the finger out before you lose it hes not in his right mind yet and goblins can bite through iron kitto fought me his mouth trying to hold on to my finger by the time i pulled it free his eyes were trying to open kitto i said he didnt react to his name or anything else but he was warmer and he was moving hes moving and hes warmer i said good very good ive done my good deed merry the rest is up to you i looked directly into the blade again instead of down at kitto youre just going to sit back and watch who wins arent you what matters to us who sits on the unseelie throne it matters to us only who sits on the goblin throne doyles deep voice cut in and what if cels followers were planning war with the seelie doyle knelt down one hand squeezing gently but firmly on my shoulder i think he was warning me not to interrupt what are you babbling about darkness i am privy to much among the sidhe that the goblins do not know you are not at court now i am not without ears spies you mean i did not use such a word fine fine play the word games that you are all so fond of but speak plainly to me there are those at the unseelie court who believe andais is desperate to have meredith named her heir they believe having a mortal on the throne is the end of them they are talking about going to war on the seelie before they all become powerless mortals our strength comes from our kings and queens as you know what you tell me is enough to make me throw in my lot with cels people if the goblins were merrys allies then no one at the unseelie court would risk fighting against her they dare to challenge the seelie only because they assume they will have the goblins support what is it to us if the sidhe kill each other off you are bound by word blood earth fire water and air to support the rightful heir to the unseelie throne in all matters of strife if merry sits on the throne and unseelie rebels fight against her while you sit back and do nothing then your oath will come back upon you you cant frighten me sidhe the nameless walks the land again and you think it is i whom you should be frightened of there are terrible things far beyond me that will rise from the depths descend from the sky and take rightful payment from those who are forsworn by such oaths as you have taken it was difficult to tell in the blurred image but kurag looked worried i hear your words darkness but merry has fallen silent are you her new puppet master i tend your goblin kurag and i have a better use for my tongue than telling you what you already know i remember my oaths girl no kurag that is not what i mean the sidhe may not bear tales to the goblin mound but you and i both know you have other means i did not say out loud that the lesser fey at court some servants some not talked to the goblins sometimes for a price sometimes for the feeling of power it gave them my father had given his word never to tell of kurags system of spies i had given no such oath i was free to reveal the goblins secret but did not speak freely princess and do not toy with this old goblin i have spoken as freely as i intend to kurag goblin king he blew out a loud breath merry girl you are too much your fathers daughter essus was my favorite of all the sidhe his loss was great to all the courts of the unseelie for he was true friend to many that means a great deal coming from you kurag i didnt thank him because you never thank an older fey some of the younger ones are cool with it now but its an old prohibition among us almost a taboo do you honor all the oaths your father gave no some i did not agree with and some i know nothing of i thought he told you everything kurag said i am not a baby anymore kurag i know that even my father kept his secrets i was young when he died some things i wasnt ready to know you are wise as well as luscious how sad sometimes id have liked you better if youd been just a little more stupid i like my women less bright than i am kurag you old charmer he laughed then a true laugh and it was contagious i laughed with him and as the eyes began to fade out of the blade he spoke i will think on what your darkness has said and what you have said and even what your father said but you must give true sustenance to my goblin or in three months i will be free of you youll never be free of me kurag not until youve fucked me or thats what you told me when i was sixteen he laughed but at the end he said i used to think things would have been safer if youd agreed to be my queen but im beginning to think youre just too dangerous to be allowed that close to any throne chapter kitto lay against the dark burgundy sheets like a ghost his black curls made him seem paler his eyes kept fluttering open flashing blue then shutting leaving his blue eyes like gleaming bruises behind the thin skin of his closed lids i touched his bare shoulder he still looks almost translucent the lesser fey fade in truth doyle said he stood beside me in front of the mirrored dresser rhys stood at the foot of the bed and stared down at the goblin hes not up to sex no pun intended i looked at him he looked unhappy maybe even worried but that was all youre not going to protest about me sharing my body with a goblin would it do me any good he asked no i said he gave a weak version of his grin then i might as well start making the best of it besides i dont think we have to worry about you doing the bump and grind with him tonight theres not enough of him left merry must share flesh with kitto to bring him back to himself doyle said i sat down on the edge of the bed and kitto rolled toward me like the sea pulled by the moon he cuddled against me with a sigh that was almost a whimper he cant take a bite out of me if hes not conscious put power into him as you did the sword doyle said make him aware of you as you made kurag aware of you i looked down at the tiny man he seemed asleep but his skin still had that awful thin quality like it was wearing away i stroked my hand down his shoulder he wiggled closer to me but did not wake i leaned over him putting my mouth just above the skin of his shoulder i had raised my shields automatically when id finished using the magic to contact kurag shielding was like breathing for me it was dropping them that took concentration id learned to shield about the same time i learned to read but this wasnt a spell this was less and more than that the human witches call it natural magic which means a natural ability you can perform without much training or effort i drew magic energy into my breath and blew it across his skin i willed him to wake to see me kittos eyes fluttered open and this time he did see me his voice came hoarse merry i smiled at him touching the curls on the side of his pale face yes kitto its me he frowned and grimaced as if something hurt whats happening you need to take flesh from me he continued to frown up at me as if he hadnt understood i took off my jacket and began unbuttoning my blouse i probably could have pushed the sleeve up enough to expose my shoulder but i didnt want to get blood on the white material the bra underneath was white as well but i was pretty sure i could keep it from getting stained if i was careful kittos eyes had widened flesh he made it a question leave your mark on my body kitto we contacted kurag doyle said he said that the reason you are ailing is that your mark with meredith has healed her energy must sustain you away from faerie and for that you need a new sharing of flesh kitto stared up at the tall dark man i dont understand i touched his face turned his eyes back to me does it matter does anything matter except the scent of my skin i put my wrist next to his face then slid my arm slowly just above his lips so that our bodies touched here and there i ended on my knees by the bed taking my other arm behind his head to bring his face close to the upper part of my free arm just below the shoulder during sex biting is great even some bloodletting but this was cold and i wasnt ready for it this was going to hurt so i preferred it be somewhere with some cushioning some meat his pupils had gone to thin black slits there was a stillness to him but it was not static it was a stillness full of so many things eagerness need and hunger a terrible blind hunger something in that moment as he watched the white flesh of my shoulder reminded me his father was not just a goblin but a snake goblin kitto was becoming warm and so terribly mammalian yet something of that reptilian stillness was in him he was still a small version of a sidhe warrior but watching his body tense i was reminded of a snake about to strike for a moment i was afraid of him then he was moving in a blur of speed and i fought with myself not to flinch away it was like being hit in the arm with a baseball bat like being bitten by a large dog it was the impact that startled but it didnt exactly hurt not right away blood poured from his lips down my arm he worried at it like a dog trying to break the neck of a rat and i cried out i slumped down the side of the bed away from him and he stayed at my shoulder teeth dug into my flesh blood dripped onto my chest staining the white bra i drew my breath from deep inside my body but i didnt scream he was a goblin screaming and fighting back just drove them to blood lust i blew my breath soft upon his face he stayed locked on my arm eyes closed face enraptured i blew one quick hard breath in his face the way you do on small pets when they bite most things dont like having you blow in their face especially on their eyes it made him open his eyes i watched kitto flow back into those eyes watched him fill back up while the animal receded he let go of my arm i slumped back against the dresser and the pain was sharp and immediate i had the urge to curse him soundly but staring up into his face i couldnt blood covered his mouth like lipstick gone wild it dripped down his chin stained his throat his eyes were focused and he was himself again but he still ran that narrow forked tongue across tiny bloodstained teeth he rolled back onto the bed and basked in the afterglow i just sat on the floor and bled doyle knelt behind me with a small towel in his hands he raised my arm wrapping the towel around it not so much to stop the bleeding but to catch the blood and keep it from getting all over everything the scent of flowers filled the air pleasant but strong doyle glanced up at the mirror someone is asking permission to speak through the mirror who is it i am not sure niceven perhaps i looked at my bloody arm is this a good enough show if you do not show pain while we bind the wound yes i sighed great help me sit on the edge of the bed he lifted me in his arms and sat me on the bed i didnt need that much help my apologies i didnt know how hurt you might be ill live i took the towel and held it on the wound kitto curled around me his face still bloodstained hed kicked off all the sheets so that with his body pressed up against mine you couldnt see his shortshorts from the mirror hed look naked he writhed against me his forked tongue licking the blood from his lips and further around his mouth his hands stroked along my waist and hips kurag could say what he wished but taking flesh this way was sex for the goblins answer them doyle then get me something to stop the blood he smiled and gave a small bow he motioned and the mirror sprang to life showing a hooknosed man with skin the color of bluebells it was hedwick king taraniss social secretary not only was he not niceven but he was so not going to appreciate the show chapter hedwick didnt even look out from the mirror he was reading down a list face halfaverted greetings to princess meredith nicessus from the high king taranis thunderer this is to inform you of a preyule ball three days hence his majesty looks forward to seeing you there during the speech he had not looked out at the room his hand was actually reaching out to cleanse the mirror when i spoke i said the one word he probably didnt expect to hear no his hand went down and he looked up into the room with a cross look on his face the look gave way to astonishment then disgust maybe it was watching kitto writhe on the bed maybe it was me being splattered with blood whatever he didnt like the show you are princess meredith nicessus are you not his voice dripped with disdain as if he found it hard to believe yes then we will see you at the ball again his hand went up to cleanse the mirror no i said again he lowered his hand and scowled at me i have quite a few invitations to make today princess so i do not have time for histrionics i smiled but could feel my eyes going hard but underneath the anger was pleasure hedwick had always been an officious little bootlicker and i knew that he gave the invitations to all the lesser fey lesser people another sidhe handled all the important social contacts that hedwick had extended the invitation was an insult the way hed given it was a double insult im not the least bit hysterical hedwick i cannot accept the invitation as it stands he bristled his fingers going to his fluffy white cravat he was dressed as if the s had never passed at least he wasnt wearing a wig for that i was grateful the high king himself commands your presence princess he sounded like he always did as if it was the utmost honor to toady for the king i am unseelie and i have no high king i said doyle knelt at my feet with a small basket of medical supplies wed started keeping them near at hand though the bites from the other guards were usually nowhere near this bad hedwicks gaze flicked down to doyle then up to me with a frown you are a seelie princess doyle moved around me so that he was on the side with the wound he took the towel applying direct pressure with it i took a slightly sharper breath as he pressed the cloth very firmly into the bite but other than that my voice was normal i sounded all business as doyle tended my wound and kitto writhed against me it was agreed that my title in the unseelie court supercedes my seelie title now that i am heir to the unseelie throne i can no longer acknowledge my uncle as high king for me to acknowledge the title might imply that he was also high king of the unseelie and that is not true hedwick was clearly perplexed he was good at following orders flattering those above him and playing errand boy i was forcing him to think he wasnt used to having to do anything that complex he smoothed his cravat again and finally looking a great deal less sure of himself he said as you like then king taranis commands your presence at the ball three days hence doyles gaze flicked up to my face at that i smiled and gave a small shake of my head id caught it hedwick the only royal who can command my presence is the queen of air and darkness he shook his head stubbornly the king can command the presence of anyone of lesser title than he and you are not a queen yet he stressed the yet princess meredith doyle opened the towel to see if my wound had stopped bleeding apparently it had because he got some antiseptic to clean the wound if i was king taraniss royal heir then he could command me but i am not his heir i am queen andaiss heir only she can command me because only she outranks me hedwick flinched at the mention of the queens true name all the seelie were like that never invoking her true name as if afraid it would call her to them are you saying that you outrank the king he sounded truly outraged doyle began to clean the wound with soft gauze even so the little touches sent tiny shock waves of pain through my arm i gritted my teeth a little and fought not to show it i am saying that order of rank in the seelie court has no meaning for me anymore hedwick when i was merely a princess of the unseelie court i could also have had the same rank at the seelie court but i am to be queen i cannot have a lesser rank in any other court if i am to rule there are queens aplenty in the court who acknowledge taranis as their high king i am aware of that hedwick but they are part of the seelie court and they are not sidhe i am part of the unseelie court and i am sidhe you are niece to the king he said still trying to think his way through the political maze id thrown up around him so nice of someone to remember that but it would be as if andais had called eluned and asked her for acknowledgment as her high queen princess eluned has no ties to the unseelie court hedwick sounded terribly offended i sighed and it went sharp as doyle finished cleaning the wound hedwick try to understand this i will be queen of the unseelie court i am royal heir king taranis cannot command me to do anything or to appear anywhere because i am not his royal heir are you refusing to appear at the kings command he still looked like he didnt trust his own ears he had to have misheard something the king has no right to command me hedwick it would be like him having you call the president of the united states with a command to appear you grow above your station meredith i let the anger show on my face and you no longer seem to know what yours is hedwick you truly are refusing the kings command astonishment showed through his voice his face his posture yes because he is not my king and cannot command anyone outside his own kingdom are you saying you renounce all titles that you hold in the seelie court doyle touched my arm made me look at him his gaze said careful here no hedwick and for you to say such a thing is deliberately insulting you are a minor functionary a message carrier nothing more i am the kings social secretary he said trying to pull himself up to every inch of his small height even though he was sitting down you carry messages to lesser fey and to humans of no great account all the important invitations go through rosmerta and you know it sending his invitation through you and not her was an insult you do not merit the attentions of the duchess rosmerta i shook my head your message is incomplete hedwick youd best go back to your master and learn a new one one that has a chance of being well received i nodded at doyle he stood and blanked the mirror in the middle of hedwicks sputtering doyle smiled almost grinned at me well done you just insulted the king of light and illusion rhys said he looked pale no rhys he insulted me and more than that if i had accepted such a command from taranis it could have been interpreted that when i gain the unseelie throne i would acknowledge him as high king over the unseelie as well as the seelie could it have been the secretarys error frost asked could he simply have used the same words with you as everyone on his list perhaps but if so it was still an insult insult maybe but merry we can swallow a few insults to stay out of the kings bad graces rhys said he sat down on the far end of the bed as if his knees were weak no we cannot doyle said we all looked at him dont you see rhys merry will rule taraniss rival kingdom she must set the rules now or he will forever treat her as less for the sake of all of us she must not appear weak what will the king do frost asked doyle looked at him and they had one of those long looks in absolute truth i do not know has anyone ever defied him like this frost asked i dont know doyle said no i said they looked at me just as you walk around andais like shes a snake about to strike you tiptoe around taranis the same way he does not seem as frightening as the queen frost said i shrugged and it hurt so i stopped hes like a big spoiled child whos had his own way for far too long if he doesnt get what he wants he throws tantrums the servants and lackeys live in fear of those tantrums hes been known to accidentally kill in one of his rages sometimes hes sorry sometimes hes not and you just threw a steel gauntlet into his face rhys said staring at me from the end of the bed one thing i always noticed about taraniss temper was that it never struck out at anyone powerful if he was in this uncontrollable rage then why was it always directed at people who were powerless to fight back always his victims were either magically inferior or politically inferior or people with no strong allies among the sidhe i shook my head no rhys he always knows who hes lashing out at its not mindless he wont hurt me because i stood my ground hell respect me and maybe begin to worry about me worry about you rhys asked he fears andais and even cel because cels crazy and taranis isnt sure what hell do once hes got the throne taranis was probably thinking he could control me now hell begin to wonder it is interesting that this invitation comes after we have spoken to maeve reed doyle said i nodded yes isnt it the three of them exchanged glances kitto just stayed wound around me quieter now i do not think it would be wise for meredith to attend this ball frost said i agree doyle said unanimous rhys said i looked at them i dont intend to go but why are you all looking so serious doyle sat down on the far side of me forcing kitto to scoot back a little is taranis as good a political thinker as you are i frowned i dont know why will he think you refused for the true reasons or will he wonder if you refused because of something maeve said to you i still hadnt told them maeves secret and they had not asked they probably assumed that she had made me give my word not to tell them which she hadnt the reason i hadnt shared it was because it was the kind of knowledge that could get you killed and now suddenly out of the blue was the invitation to court shit i looked at doyle and the others frost had moved over to lean against the dresser arms crossed rhys was still on the bed kitto curled against me i looked at each in turn i wasnt going to tell you what maeve told me because its dangerous information i thought wed just avoid the seelie court altogether and it wouldnt matter taranis hasnt sent me an invitation to anything for years but if we are going to have to deal with him then you need to know i told them why maeve had been exiled rhys just put his head in his hands and said nothing frost stared even doyle was speechless it was kitto who said it taranis has condemned his people if he is truly infertile then yes he has doomed them all to death as a people doyle said their magic dies because their king is sterile dead soil frost said it is what i believe andais fears for the unseelie but she has borne one child and taranis has always been childless so thats why shes so interested in cel or me breeding i said doyle nodded i believe so though she has kept her own counsel on her exact motives in pitting you and cel against each other taranis will kill us all rhyss voice was quiet but very certain we all looked at him it was beginning to feel like a very confused tennis match looking from person to person he raised his face from his hands he has to kill everyone who knows hes sterile if the other seelie find out that hes condemned them they will demand he make the great sacrifice and his blood will be spread to recover their fertility looking into rhyss bleak face it was hard to argue especially since id thought the same thing then why is maeve reed alive and well frost asked julian has told us there have been no attempts on her life none whatsoever i cant explain it rhys said maybe its because she has no way to tell anyone else in faerie weve met with her but she cant talk to anyone else who isnt already in exile meredith is not in exile and she can talk to people who would matter people who would believe her and act on it we all sort of sat there thinking doyle broke the silence frost call julian and tell him that there may be trouble i cannot tell him why frost said no doyle said frost nodded and went out into the other room to call on the phone i looked at doyle have you talked to anyone else about this only barinthus he said the bowl of water on the altar i said doyle nodded he was once the ruler of all the seas around our islands so contacting him by water is nearly undetectable i nodded my father used to talk to barinthus that way how is he doing as your strongest ally among the unseelie hes making some progress in forming alliances for you i stared into doyles dark eyes what did you just leave out he closed his eyes looked down once you could not have seen that in my face ive been practicing what did you leave out there have been two assassination attempts on him lord and lady protect us how serious serious enough that he mentioned them not so serious that he was truly threatened barinthus is one of the oldest of us all he is a thing of the element of water water is not easy to kill as you said barinthus is my strongest ally if they kill him then the rest will fall away i would fear that yes princess but many fear what cel will be like when he is released from his torment they fear he will be completely mad and they do not wish someone like that on the throne barinthus believes that is why cels followers are passing around the fear that you will contaminate them all with mortality they sound desperate i said no the desperate part is the talk about declaring war on the seelie court what i did not tell kurag is that there is talk of war no matter which of you takes the throne they see cels madness your mortality the queens weakness as signs that the unseelie are slipping away that we are fading as people there are some who talk of going to war one last time while we still stand a chance of defeating the seelie if we have a fullscale war on american soil the human military will be called in it would break part of the treaty that allowed us into this country in the first place rhys said i know doyle said and they think cel is mad rhys said did barinthus say whos the main voice behind the idea of war with seelie siobhan the head of cels guard there is only one siobhan doyle said thank the lord and lady for that rhys said siobhan was the equivalent of doyle she was leprously pale with spiderweb hair and not very tall physically she was nothing like doyle but just as whenever the queen had said where is my darkness send me my darkness and someone had bled or died so cel with siobhan but she had no nickname she was simply siobhan i hate to be picky i said but did she receive any punishment for following cels orders and trying to assassinate me yes doyle said but it has been months meredith and the punishment is over how long was the punishment i asked a month i shook my head a month for nearly killing a royal heir what kind of message does that send to everyone else who wants me dead cel gave the order meredith and he is experiencing one of our worst punishments for half a year no one expects his mind to survive they see that as the punishment and have you ever been in ezekiels tender care for an entire month rhys asked ezekiel was the court torturer and had been for many mortal lifetimes but he was mortal the queen had found him plying his trade for a human city and so admired his handiwork that shed offered him a job ive never been in the hallway of mortality for a month no but i spent my share of time there ezekiel always said he had to be so careful of me hed spent so many centuries with the immortals that he was afraid hed kill me by accident i ave to be so careful of ya princess so delicate so fragile so human rhys shivered you imitate his voice well he liked to talk while he worked i apologize merry youve done your time but that means you understand what it meant for siobhan to be in his care for a months time i understand rhys but id have felt better if shed been executed the queen is loath to lose any nobleborn sidhe doyle said i know there arent enough to spare but i wasnt happy about it if you tried to kill a royal heir the punishment should have been death anything less and someone might try again come to that siobhan might try again why does she want war i asked she likes death rhys said hooked at him i wasnt the only one who used to be a death deity and im not the only one who lost a great deal of their weirding when the nameless was cast siobhan was not always her name either that reminded me tell doyle what you discovered at the murder scene today he told doyle about the elder gods and their ghosts doyle looked less and less happy i did not see esras do this but i know the queen gave the command for it one of the agreements between us and the seelie was that some spells were never to be performed again that was one of them theoretically if we could prove that a sidhe from either court did the spell would that negate the peace treaty between us doyle seemed to think on that i dont know in the actual agreement yes but neither side wishes allout war siobhan does i said and she wants me dead could she have done it they both paused to think for a few silent minutes kitto just lay quietly beside me she wants war so she would have no qualms about doing it doyle said eventually but whether she is such a power i do not know he looked at rhys rhys sighed once she was hell so was i once she might have been able to do it but that would mean she was here in california you dont send them out of sight and expect to be able to control them out of sight of their magical keeper theyll just wander around slaughtering people they wont hunt merry not specifically are you sure of that doyle asked yes of that much i am sure wouldnt barinthus have mentioned if siobhan was missing from court i asked he specifically said shes being a pain in his ass so shes there i said but that doesnt mean that she didnt leave for a time but it still wouldnt get merry killed rhys said good to know i said then i added but what if my death is only a sideline what if the real purpose behind it all is war between the courts then why not have the elder ones doing their horror in illinois near the courts doyle asked because whoever did it wants war not an execution for themselves i said doyle nodded that is true if the queen discovered anyone had performed one of the forbidden spells she would execute them in hopes that taranis would be appeased and he would be rhys said because neither ruler wants allout war so in order to get their little war started they have to get away with it i said think about it if its proven to the courts that its sidhe magic at work but cant be proven which side did it then suspicion mounts on both sides and the nameless doyle said only a sidhe could have freed it only a sidhe could have hidden it from both courts siobhan isnt capable of freeing the nameless rhys said that i am sure of wait i said didnt the queen say that taranis is refusing to help search for it refuses to admit that anything so terrible could be part of his court doyle nodded yes she did what if its somebody from the seelie court i said would we have more trouble tracking it perhaps are you saying that the traitor is seelie rhys asked maybe or maybe weve got two traitors siobhan could have raised the elder gods and someone from the other court could have freed the nameless why free the nameless rhys asked if you could control it doyle said almost as if he was talking to himself it would give someone access to all the most elder and frightening powers of faerie if you could control it you might become unstoppable someones preparing for war i said doyle took a deep breath and let it out slowly i must inform the queen about the elder ghosts i will share some of our speculation about the nameless as well he looked at me and until we are certain that the elder gods cannot be directed at you you will stay inside the wards can the wards hold them off he frowned and looked at rhys who shrugged i saw them let loose in open battle i know that wards can keep out anything that means harm but i dont know how powerful these things will become especially if they are allowed to feed they may grow to be able to breach nearly any ward thanks that was comforting i said he turned a serious face to me it wasnt meant to be comforting merry just honest he gave a wistful smile besides well all give our lives to keep you safe and were pretty hard to kill you dont think youll win i said how do you fight something thats invisible and untouchable but can see you and touch you something that can drink the life out of your mouth like wed empty a soda bottle how do you fight that for that i will speak to the queen doyle stood up and went for the bathroom with its smaller mirror apparently he wanted privacy he stopped at the door call jeremy and tell him we wont be back today until we know if this is a direct threat to merry we guard her and her alone and what do we do for money i asked he sighed rubbing his eyes as if he was tired i admire your determination to owe no one i even agree with it but things would be simpler if we took a stipend from the court and had only court politics to worry about there will come a time meredith when we cannot work a ninetofive job and survive the politics i dont want to take her money doyle i know i know call jeremy explain that you will be sitting with kitto when you tell him that kittos fading and youve saved him jeremy will understand you dont want him to know about the elder ghosts this is sidhe business meredith and he is not sidhe sure but if the sidhe go to war then so do all the fey my greatgrandmother was a brownie all she wanted to do was stay near her humans home and tend it but she got killed in one of the last great wars if theyre going to be dragged into it then shouldnt they know about it beforehand jeremy is exiled from faerie so he will not be involved youre ignoring my point i said no meredith i am not but i dont know what to say to your point until i can think of what to say i will say nothing with that he went around the corner i heard the bathroom door open then close rhys patted my arm gutsy of you to suggest that fey other than sidhe should have a vote very democratic dont patronize me rhys he dropped his hand i even agree with you meredith but our vote doesnt count for much once youre on the throne maybe that will change but right now there is no way in all the kingdoms of faerie that a sidhe ruler will agree to include the lesser fey in our war talks theyll be notified when we decide to go to war not before thats not fair i said no but its the way we do things get me on a throne and maybe that can change oh merry dont let us risk our lives to make you queen only to have you turn around and piss off all the sidhe we can fight off some of them but not all of them there are a lot more lesser fey than sidhe rhys numbers arent what counts merry what does count strength strength of arms strength of magic strength of leadership the sidhe have all that and that is why my pretty princess we have ruled the fey for millennia hes right kitto said softly i looked down at him still pale but not that frightening translucent uncolor the goblins are great warriors yes but not great wizards and kurag fears the sidhe everyone who is not sidhe fears the sidhe kitto said im not sure thats true i said i am he said and he crept even closer spooning his entire body around me holding himself as tight against me as he could i am chapter the upside to kittos neardeath experience was that i got to go back to bed and sleep id suggested that doyle join us but frost had thrown a fit so doyle had just begged out as long as frost didnt get to join us either id pointed out that doyle and i had gotten the least amount of sleep last night but frost didnt care i also pointed out that we were just going to sleep so did it really matter who slept with me neither of them were moved by my arguments so i got to go back to bed and cuddle kitto i made him take my usual side of the bed though so i could spoon around his body without lying on the shoulder that hed bitten id taken some advil but the shoulder still ached fiercely like it had its own pulse it hadnt hurt nearly this much the first time hed marked me maybe it was a good sign i hoped so i hated to have something hurt this much for no good purpose jeremy had been furious that none of us were coming back to the office until he found out that kitto had nearly died he was silent for a long time long enough for me to say his name softly im here merry just bad memories ive seen fey fade away before do what you need to do to take care of him well muddle through at the office theyre going to keep teresa overnight for observation shes sedated so i dont know how much theyre going to be observing is she going to be all right he hesitated probably but ive never seen her like she was today her husband yelled at me for endangering her he doesnt want her doing any more crime scenes i cant blame him you think teresa will agree with him i dont know if it matters merry ive made an executive decision the grey detective agency no longer does police work im a good magician but i had no clue what did that today i could feel the remnants of a spell but that was all i told detective tate what id felt but lieutenant peterson didnt want to hear it hes determined that its something mundane extraordinary but mundane jeremy sounded tired you sound like you need to go to bed and cuddle up to somebody too you volunteering he laughed greedy ol merry wanting to take up all the fey men in la if you need to come over and be held youd be welcome he was quiet for a moment id almost forgotten that forgotten what that its okay to be held by your friends in ways that humans consider sexual that it would be all right for me to come and cuddle close to you while we slept if you need it ive been out among the humans too long merry i dont think entirely like a trow anymore i dont know if i could go to bed with you and not have it turn sexual i hadnt known what to say to that when i woke the light against the drapes was fading to dusk i was still spooned around kittos body and he was still pressed against me as tight as he could get it was as if neither of us had moved all day i lay there for a moment feeling how stiff my body was from simply being immobile for so long the shoulder ached distantly ignorable kittos breathing was still deep and regular what had woken me then a soft knocking sounded at the door again it opened before i could say anything galen peered through he smiled when he saw me awake hows kitto i moved enough to prop myself up on one elbow and look down at the goblin he made a small sound and cuddled in against me so that there was again no space between his body and mine he looks better and hes warm i combed my ringers through his curls his head moved to cuddle in against the movement of my hand but he never woke is anything wrong i asked galen made a face that i couldnt quite read well not exactly i frowned at him what is it he came into the room gently closing the door behind him we talked in low voices so as not to disturb kitto galen came to stand at the end of the bed he was wearing a longsleeved shirt whose pale green color brought out the green tint in his skin intensified the darker color of his hair the pants were just faded blue jeans washed until they were almost white there was a hole in the middle of his thigh where white threads gave hints of the pale green skin underneath i realized hed said something and i hadnt been paying attention im sorry what did you say he grinned flashing white teeth queen nicevens representative is here he says he has strict orders to collect the first payment before he tells us the secret of how to cure me my gaze went back to the hole in his pants then traveled up his body until i met those grass green eyes the heat in his eyes matched the tightening in my body kitto stirred beside me opened his blue blue eyes talking doors opening and my moving hadnt stirred him but the tightening of my body in response to galen that had woken him i explained briefly that nicevens man was here kitto had no problem with the demifey coming into the room id known he would have no problem id asked for politeness sake the queen wouldnt have asked but i think it was more that she didnt care what someone thought rather than her knowing they wouldnt mind galen went back to the door and opened it wide a tiny figure fluttered in the body was about the size of a small barbie doll his wings were larger than the rest of his body and mostly rich butter yellow with lines and bars of black and spots of blue and orangeyred he hovered over the bed above me his body was a slightly paler version of the rich yellow of his wings he wore a filmy yellow skirt or kilt as his only clothing greetings to princess meredith of the unseelie from queen niceven of the demifey i am known as sage most lucky fey to be chosen as our royal majestys ambassador to the western lands his voice was like the sound of tinkling bells a laughing sound it made me smile and i knew instantly it was glamour i tsked at him no glamour between us sage for that is a kind of lie he pressed tiny perfect hands to his chest his wings beating faster sending a breath of air against my face glamour i would a humble demifey be able to do glamour to a sidhe of the unseelie court he had been careful not to deny the charge he simply skirted the issue you can drop the glamour or it can be stripped from you you can put it all back but for our first meeting i want to see what or whom i am truly dealing with he flew closer close enough that the wind from his wings played in the strands of hair around my face my lovely maiden you wound me i am as fair as you see me here if that is true then light upon me and let me test the truth of your words for if you are truly as you appear then touching my flesh will not change you but if you play me false then the mere touch of my skin will show your true self the very formality of the words was a type of spell i had spoken truly and believed utterly what i had said thus it was true when he touched my skin he would be forced to appear as he truly was i sat up so i could extend a hand the sheets slipped down pooling at my waist kitto curled himself closer around me his large eyes staring at the fluttering fey he watched the tiny figure like a cat fascinated by a bird i knew that the goblins were not above cannibalizing other fey the look on kittos face said that perhaps demifey were a delicacy are you all right kitto he blinked and looked up at me his gaze slid from the fluttering fey across my bare breasts and the look of hunger changed but a very little that one look frightened me something must have shown on my face because kitto hid his own face against my bare hip snuggling under the sheet the taste of flesh has made our little goblin bold doyle was in the doorway the little fey turned in midair to give a small bow the queens darkness i am honored doyle gave the barest of bows a mere nod to courtesy sage i must say that i am surprised to see you here the tiny flying man rose upward so that he could come close to seeing doyle eye to eye but he stayed out of reach like the shy insect he resembled why surprised darkness his voice didnt sound so much like joyous bells now i did not know that niceven could spare her favorite lover no more that darkness and well you know i know that niceven had child and husband by another but i didnt think the demifey cared so very much for the niceties sage flew a little higher a touch closer you think because we are not sidhe that we do not know the law the anger could have sounded impotent coming from that tiny chimelike voice but it didnt it was the sound of chimes when storm winds strike them a frightening music so doyle said no longer queens lover whatever have you been doing with yourself sage i had never heard doyle so chiding before he was deliberately baiting sage id never seen doyle do much of anything that didnt have a purpose to it so i let it go but it all had a personal feel to it what could this minute man have done to the queens darkness to earn such personal attention i have had the whole of our kingdoms women to please me darkness he flew almost into doyles face and you one of the queens eunuchs what have you been doing with yourself look at what lies in the bed sage tell me that that is not such a bounty as man or fey would sell their soul for the fluttering man didnt even bother to turn around i did not know that you liked goblins doyle i thought that was rhyss peculiarity you can be deliberately obtuse sage but well you know the meaning of my words rumors are swift things darkness they say that you guard the princess but do not share her bed there has been much speculation as to why you would pass by such a bounty when the others have partaken of it the little man flew close enough that his wings almost brushed doyles face rumor whispers that perhaps there was more than one reason queen andais never took you to her bed rumor would have you eunuch in truth and not merely in lack of use i couldnt see doyles face through the rapidly beating wings of the demifey i realized that though his wings looked like butterfly wings they beat much faster and the physical motions werent identical to the insect he mimicked i give you my most solemn oath doyle said that i have taken the pleasure of princess meredith in the way that a man may take pleasure with a woman sage hovered for a wing beat then his entire body dipped as if hed almost forgotten to fly for a second he regained himself fluttering up to meet doyles eyes again so you are no longer the queens eunuch but now the princesss lover the voice sounded low and evil a tinny hiss whatever was happening was definitely personal as you say sage rumor runs rife and rumor whispers that niceven took a page from andaiss book you were her favorite lover before her onenight tryst with pol got her with child when she was forbidden from your bed you were forbidden from anyone elses if she could not have her favorite then no one would sage hissed at him like an angry bee much pleasure must you take in our two places being switched darkness whatever do you mean sage but doyles voice was low and held a note that said he knew exactly what the demifey meant i taunted you and yours for centuries the great sidhe warriors the great ravens of old reduced to court eunuchs oh yes i taunted you all i boasted of my prowess and my queens delights like an evil whisper in your ears doyle just looked at him sage flew a little distance from him doing a circle in the air like one might pace on the ground now what good does my prowess do me what good is it to see her in all her beauty but be unable to touch her he turned back to doyle oh i have thought long these many years darkness on how i didst torment you do not think the irony of it is lost upon me simply because i am not sidhe he got very close to doyles face and though i knew it was a whisper the hiss of it filled the room irony enough to choke upon darkness irony enough to die of irony enough to kill to rid myself of it then fade sage fade and be done with it the little fey winged backwards fade yourself darkness fade and be done with you i am here at queen nicevens command to act as her surrogate if you wish cure for the green knight then you must deal with me his voice was thick with menace galen came to the stillopen door from the living room i wish to be cured but not at any price his usual smile was gone his face somber enough of this i said voice soft not angry they all turned to me i glimpsed the rest of the men including nicca crowding just outside the doorway i bargained with niceven not doyle and i alone bargained for galens cure the price for that cure was my blood sage fluttered over the bed not quite over kitto and me one drink of your blue blood one cure for your green knight as my queen has bid me his voice wasnt the ring of bells anymore it was almost normal small thin but a mans voice his dark eyes had become flat and black like the eyes of a doll there was nothing particularly friendly on that pretty toysize face i held up a hand and he alit upon it he was heavier than he looked more solid i remembered niceven being lighter more bone than muscle she felt as cadaverous as she looked sage was meatier or rather his slender body held more substance than nicevens seemed to his wings went still showing them as huge perfect butterfly wings they fanned softly as he stared at me i wondered if the wings beat in time to his heart his butter yellow hair was shaggy thick straight falling in careless strands around his triangular face the hair brushed his shoulders in places there was a time when andais would have punished him for letting his hair grow so long only the sidhe men were allowed to have hair long as a womans it was a mark of status royalty privilege his hands were no bigger than the fingernail on my smallest finger he put one of those hands on his slender waist the other hanging by his side one foot in front of the other a defiant pose if we are given privacy then i will take payment and give you the cure for your knight he sounded petulant it made me smile and the smile made his face fill with hatred i am not a child to be looked upon with indulgence princess i am a man he made a sweeping gesture with both hands a small one by your reckoning but i am still male i do not appreciate being looked upon as you would smile upon a naughty child it was almost exactly what id been thinking that he looked cute standing there so defiant so tiny i had been treating him like a doll or a toy or a child i apologize sage you are correct you are fey and you are male size notwithstanding he frowned at me you are royal and you apologize to me i was taught that true royalty lies in knowing when one is wrong or right and admitting the difference not in false perfection he turned his head to one side an almost birdlike movement i have heard from others that you deal fairly with all like your father before you his thin voice sounded thoughtful it is good to hear my father spoken of still we all remember prince essus i am always happy to share my fathers good memory with others sage watched me closely though it wasnt the same as being watched by a larger person his idea of eye contact seemed just that his whole face seemed to stare at only my right eye though hed apparently seen my smile and judged it correctly which meant he could see all my face i simply was not accustomed to dealing with the demifey my father had always been respectful of them but i had not been taken to nicevens court as i had been to kurags and others prince essus had our respect princess but time moves on and so must we he sounded almost sad he looked at me face growing arrogant again and i fought not to smile at this tiny figure looking so full of himself it wasnt funny or cute he was just as much a person as anyone else in the room but it was hard to truly believe that let us have privacy to fulfill my queens desires then you will have your cure for the green knight i looked at doyle and galen inside the room the others just outside frost was already shaking his head my guards do not allow me to be alone with any member of the courts do you think i should be flattered that they see me as a potential threat he turned on my hand and pointed a finger at doyle darkness knows me of old and knows what i am capable of or thinks he does sage turned back to face me his bare feet sliding strangely against my skin but i would still have privacy for this no doyle said sage turned back to him fluttering inches from my hand you should understand this darkness doing my queens bidding is all that is left me doing exactly what she says is all that i have what i will do tonight in this room will be the closest i have come to knowing feminine delights in a very long time i do not think privacy is too much to ask for that the guards werent happy about it but they finally agreed only kitto stayed wound around my body tangled in the sheets that one too sage said pointing at the goblin he faded today sage i said he looks well enough his king kurag has informed me that my body my blood my flesh my magic is what sustains kitto out here among the humans he needs to stay in contact with my skin for a time longer you would kick him out of your bed for one of your sidhe warriors no kitto spoke softly i have been privileged to stay while they mate i have seen their light cast shadows on the walls so bright they glowed sage fluttered down to hover over kittos upturned face goblin your kind eats mine in times of war the strong eat the weak it is the way of the world kitto said the goblin world sage said it is all i know you are far from that world now kitto cuddled under the sheet so that only his eyes showed merry is my world now do you like this new world goblin i am warm safe and she bears my mark on her body it is a good world sage hovered for a few moments more then flew back up to my waiting hand if the goblin gives his word of most solemn honor that nothing he sees hears feels or senses in any way will he repeat to anyone then he may stay kitto repeated the promise word for word very well sage said he gazed down my body and though he was no taller than my forearm i shivered and had the most uncomfortable desire to cover myself a tiny red tongue like a drop of blood licked across his pale lips first the bloodletting then the cure the way he said cure made me half wish i hadnt agreed to all the guards leaving me alone he was smaller than a barbie doll but in that instant i was afraid of him chapter he fluttered down off my hand toward my breasts i put my other arm between him and my body he ended up on my other wrist which i moved out from my body in order to see him more easily i raised the sheet over my chest with my other hand he looked disgusted will you deny me heart blood i saw what your kind did to my knight i would be foolish to let you near such tender flesh before i see exactly how gently you feed he sat down on my wrist ankles crossed hands on either side to steady him he seemed to weigh more sitting down not much more but it was noticeable i would be ever so gentle fair lady his voice was the sound of chimes in a warm summer breeze had his lips been like a tiny crimson flower but a moment ago he touched that flowersoft mouth to my hand his body reclined along my arm as i would have reclined upon a couch he ran his tiny mouth and hands over the minute hairs on my arm where a larger lover would have smoothed them with his mouth or fingertips sage played with them as if he was making music along my skin soundless music that only he could hear but i could feel it it played along my skin my arm as if it were all larger more than was actually happening i flung him sharply into the air where he buzzed at me like an angry bee why did you do that we were having so much fun no glamour remember i said scowling up at him clutching my sheet without glamour the feeding will not be nearly so pleasant for you he shrugged his thin shoulders the movement making him dip in midair for me it is much the same for nicevens purposes it is much the same but for you fair princess it is not the same let me save you some pain and discomfort and let this be a friendly sharing if hed caught me on another day when kittos bite didnt still ache i might have told him no just to take his queens blood and be done with it goblins could not do glamour of any kind so kitto had had no choice without the natural glamour of sex to soften his feeding there was nothing he could do magically sage was offering me a choice i took a deep breath let it out slowly then nodded just enough glamour to make it pleasant but thats all sage if you try for more than that ill call for the guards and you wont like what theyll do to you he made a sound that would have been rude except that it came out like a tiny trumpet as if a butterfly could make an asss bray darkness has been waiting centuries for me to put a foot out of line princess i know well perhaps better than you what he owes me i noticed it seemed personal between you more than with the others personal you could say that he smiled and it managed to be pleasant and evil at the same time as if he was imagining terrible things that would be a great deal of fun to do i could have asked sage what was so personal but i didnt either doyle would explain or i would never know i didnt think doyle would take kindly to me prying his secrets from a fey he hated it was one thing to gain information from one friend about another friend but you didnt talk to peoples enemies about your friends and you didnt let those enemies talk to you behind your friends backs it just wasnt kosher you may feed sage and you may use a little glamour to keep it from being so unpleasant but mind your manners do you need to look so far for protection you have your goblin there beside you will he not reach up and snatch me from the air and grind my bones if i play you false goblins have little chance against strong glamour and well you know it he put his hands on his chest widened his eyes but i am but a demifey i cannot have the glamour of a sidhe lord why should any goblin fear the likes of me the demifey of every description have powerful glamour and well you know that they have led travelers and the unwary astray for centuries a little swamp water never hurt anyone sage said hovering closer toward me unless there happens to be quicksand or sucking mud under that water you are unseelie fey which means if the traveler falls through the murk to his death so much more the fun he crossed his arms which were thinner than a pencil was round over his chest and what happens when a seelie willothewisp guides travelers into marshy land and they fall to quicksand do not tell me that they then run for help and grab a rope they may weep pretty tears for a poor mortal but as soon as his last breath bubbles up from the swamp theyre away giggling to themselves looking for another traveler to lead astray they may avoid that particular patch of swamp but they wont stop their game simply because it led to some unfortunates death he landed on my sheetcovered knee and is it so unfair to lead some netwaving butterfly collector to his death when if he caught me he would throw me in a killing jar and mount me with a pin through my heart you have glamour enough to keep away from that fate i said yes but my gentler brethren the butterflies and insects that we demifey mimic what of them one fool with a net can devastate a summer meadow put that way he had a point or seemed to are you using glamour now a sidhe princess should know when shes being tricksied about with he said arms still crossed i sighed fine its not glamour but i cant agree that youre within your rights to lead an entomologist to his death just because hes collecting butterflies ah sage said gazing up at me but you do agree a little at least or you wouldnt have asked about the glamour i sighed again i had made the terrible mistake of taking entomology in college i hadnt understood that you had to kill insects to pass the course i remembered a carousel of butterflies trapped in a killing jar it was one of the most lovely things id ever seen alive they were magical dead they were like tissue paper and sticks id finally asked how many insects i had to collect for a d and id collected that many and no more there had been no point to collecting the insects when the college had a complete collection of almost everything the class was killing it was the last biology class i took where you had to collect anything i stared at the little butterflywinged man on my knee and couldnt find an argument that didnt make me feel like a hypocrite i wouldnt kill someone for collecting butterflies but if i had butterfly wings on my back and spent most of my life out among them fluttering from flower to flower maybe id see the death of one butterfly on a different scale maybe if you were the size of a barbie doll killing the small creatures was every bit as horrible as killing people maybe maybe not but i didnt feel sure enough of my ground to argue chapter i mounded the pillows behind me so that i was propped to halfsitting id had to make kitto move before i could move the pillows he clung to me with hands and arms but his eyes were all for sage he watched the demifey as if he didnt trust him or expected him to do something dangerous or maybe he was just wondering what sage would taste like whatever kitto was thinking it was not friendly sage didnt seem to notice the goblins lessthanfriendly stare he simply hovered fluttering as i made myself comfortable i secured the sheet across my chest and held my hand out to him i cupped my hand upward so sage could reach my fingers because that was where he would take the blood from niceven had taken blood from me there once and if it was good enough for his queen it was good enough for sage besides something about him unnerved me it was ridiculous to be nervous of someone i could smash against the wall with one hand but silly or not i couldnt deny how i felt i didnt question it just covered most of my more vulnerable bits and gave him my hand sage landed on my wrist he knelt in my upturned palm and wrapped tiny hands around my middle finger he stroked my finger and the movement was both nice and disturbing i must have tensed up because he said you have given me permission to use glamour have you not i nodded not quite trusting my voice he smiled and his mouth was like a tiny red petal his eyes warm sincere i felt myself relax as if a hand had simply stroked all my nervousness away i didnt fight it because i had agreed and the pain in my shoulder was gone nothing hurt kitto curled around my waist sliding his leg along mine my hand fell away from the sheet and stroked his curls his hair was unbelievably soft he snuggled his face in against my waist and the brush of his face against my skin made me shiver i think anyone could have touched me then and i would have reacted to them i looked at sage youre very good my voice was husky we have to be he said as he ran his hands up and down my finger it was no longer nice it was erotic as if there were nerves in that one finger that had never been there before i knew it was glamour the natural magic of faerie but it still felt so good so very good surrendering to someones glamour if his glamour ran to the sensual could be a wondrous experience sidhe did not do it with each other because to practice glamour on another sidhe in an intimate situation was considered a grave insult but the lesser fey practiced it often among themselves and almost always when lying with a sidhe perhaps it was insecurity perhaps it was just a way of saying look what we have to offer sage had much to offer he wrapped his arms around my finger and it was as if he touched larger things so much more intimate things he laid a kiss against my fingertip that was like the brush of finest silk i felt his lips part and they felt larger than they were i had to open my eye and look at him to make sure that he was still small kneeling in my hand i had sunk back upon the pillows my arm resting in my lap but sage was still kneeling in my cupped palm kitto entwined his leg over mine and i felt him growing firm against my leg for a moment i wondered what the glamour was doing to and for the goblin when suddenly sage bit into my flesh he bit me like he was biting into an apple sharp but the pain floated away and when he began to suck at the wound it was like he had a thin red thread from my fingertip to my groin every movement of his mouth pulled on things low in my body he fed drawing faster harder and it was as if he stroked lower things faster harder i felt that growing warm weight in my body that said i was on the edge the edge of pleasure it was as if sage had coaxed me to the edge of a cliff i hadnt seen and i had to choose whether to fall over it into the embrace beyond i couldnt think i couldnt decide anything i had become only sensation the growing tug of pleasure the weight of warmth building building in my body then that warmth flooded out of me over me through me i called out but it wasnt pain that burst from my lips i cried out in pleasure and writhed on the sheets caught between sages mouth still locked on my body and the firmness of kittos body pressed against my leg kittos body rode mine as i writhed on the bed his hands sliding over my waist upward to brush the tip of one breast it was a tentative touch but in my heightened state it felt like so much more i cried out again and when kitto slid his body over the edge of my thigh pressed himself against me not entering but lying across me both of us nude both of us eager i didnt protest kurag had said that i had to give kitto true sex and for a goblin that meant only one thing intercourse but i also knew that goblins didnt have sex without drawing blood now nothing hurt nothing would hurt i looked up to find sage hovering over us he was glowing a soft honeyed light as if a candle had lit within him his eyes burned like black jewels and the veins of his wings gleamed with black fire the yellow blue and orangeyred glowed like stained glass in a fall of brightest sunlight i had enough sense left to ball up a handful of kittos hair and jerk his face up to mine blood only kitto no flesh missing when were done he whispered yes mistress i released his hair abruptly and he looked up at me his eyes a solid drowning blue with his pupils like a thin black line within them it was as if i could have fallen into the blue of his eyes and i knew it was sages glamour still at work and i didnt care i gave myself over to it let the illusion ride me kitto slid inside me and i was more than wet more than ready he seemed larger than i knew he was filling me up swelling inside me he raised himself up on his arms pressing our lower bodies together frozen for a moment with his body sunk inside mine with us joined he gazed down at me spread underneath him and a single tear welled up from one blue eye i knew what the goblins considered sex and they didnt cry at the first joining through the glamour i saw kitto through all the magic i truly saw him and i raised a hand up a hand that had already gone white and shining i touched that one crystal tear and did what goblins do with precious body fluids i touched it to my lips i drank the salt of his tears and he made a sound low in his throat and began to thrust himself inside me with every thrust he seemed to grow bigger swelling wider touching parts of me that had never been touched that were not supposed to be touched i watched him entering my body and his skin had begun to glow white and pearlescent he thrust himself inside me a glowing shaft as if he were made of light and that was not glamour i lay under him my skin glowing like moonlight only for another sidhe would my body shine like this colors began to dance under his skin as if rainbows danced inside his body coming to the surface of his skin like fireworks glimpsed through crystal water his eyes held nothing but blue flame behind glass his short curls moved around his head as if an unseen wind played with them and the wind was kitto he was sidhe goddess help us he was sidhe he brought me in a wash of light and magic that blinded me for a moment all i could see was white light and rainbow flashes across my vision all i could feel was my body locked around his as if the place of our joining was the only part of our bodies that was still solid as if we had become light and air and magic and only the anchor point of our joined bodies held us tied us bound us then even that fell away as he came inside me and we became nothing but light and magic and color and wave upon wave of pleasure it was as if you could become laughter become joy become whatever most pleasured you i came to myself slowly kitto had collapsed on top of me we were still joined our bodies still glowing softly like two fires banked down for a long winters night a warmth that would keep the house the family everything safe through the long cold nights to come flashes of color were still flitting through the room like stray rainbows from some crystal sun catcher but there was no sun no crystal only us well not only us the guards stood around the bed hands held up palms toward us i concentrated and saw the nearly invisible barrier that they had thrown up around us they had put up a sacred circle a circle of power doyles deep voice came the next time you decide to invoke enough energy to raise an island from the sea meredith a little warning would be good i blinked up at him for he stood closest to me did we hurt anything we caught it in time i think but the news will probably be full of unusual tides we will have to see if the ground itself holds still for such a release kitto hid his face between my breasts and whispered im sorry do not be sorry kitto it is we who owe you an apology we thought of you as goblin because you are half theirs we never thought what it might mean for you to be half ours kitto moved his head enough to look up at doyle then he hid his face again i dont understand he spoke with his mouth against my skin and even after all wed done the feel of him whispering against my chest made me shiver my voice was a little breathy but i answered you are sidhe kitto truly sidhe you have come into your power he shook his head his face still buried against my breasts i have no powers i put a hand on either side of his face and raised him gently to look upon me you are sidhe one of the shining ones there will be power now his eyes widened and he looked frightened well help you galen said from the far side of the bed well help you learn how to control your magic its not that hard if i can do it anyone can he smiled made it a joke kitto didnt look convinced some small movement made me turn my head farther and i saw sage perched upon a stray mound of pillows he was still glowing softly like a golden bejeweled doll his face was tearstreaked the line of tears like silver glitter upon his tiny face his face was enraptured damn you princess and damn this newest prince i have glimpsed heaven and found it fair and now i stand on the shores of earth abandoned i did not understand until this moment what it meant that you were sidhe and i was not he laid his face in his hands and wept curling on his side on a satin pillow his wings held out behind him stiff almost forgotten kitto touched my chest and it hurt a little i realized that hed bitten me between my breasts a little to one side so that some of the mark was in the mound of my left breast it hadnt hurt until he touched it it wasnt as deep as the mark on my shoulder because it hadnt needed to be the sex had made up for the lack of violence it should have healed cleanly and quickly but somehow i knew it would not somehow i knew i would bear his mark over my heart forever i am sorry he whispered as if hed read my mind i shook my head touching the silken skin of his cheek i wear your mark with honor kitto never doubt that he gave a shy smile then raised up on his arms much as he had through the beginning of the lovemaking i noticed first the spots of blood on my own white skin he had hurt me more than id thought then i looked up at kitto and saw that from collarbone to waist my nails had marked him bloody furrows across the perfection of his skin across the small mounds of his nipples id sliced into the meat of one of his nipples and it bled there more than the rest it was my turn to say im sorry he shook his head and the smile wasnt shy now you have marked me and there is no higher compliment among my kind may the marks never fade i traced the edge of one of the nail marks and he shivered above me you are among your kind now kitto right now doyle seemed to know what i wanted because he pulled his black tshirt up enough to show kitto the nail marks on his black skin you are unseelie sidhe i said he moved off of me his body grown softer with all the talking he lay beside me one arm over my waist he gazed at the men around the bed my mothers people were seelie they left me for dead outside the goblin mound his voice was matteroffact as if it was just truth something hed always known doyle lowered his shirt and turned to face the bed we are not seelie he did not lower the circle around the bed but stepped inside it he raised kitto up with a hand on his shoulder kitto seemed frightened but didnt struggle doyle laid a chaste kiss on the smaller mans forehead you have already tasted the blood of our court and been tasted in return now receive our kiss and be welcome among us one by one the other guards bent and laid lips upon kittos forehead he was crying and shaking by the time they had finished and when the last of my knights had kissed kittos forehead sage rose up into the air his wings humming a blur of color it made an angry whirring sound i hate you all the venom in those words was thick enough to choke on now let me out of this accursed circle doyle made an opening in the circle big enough for the demifey the tiny figure flew through it and doyle closed the circle behind him sage hovered in front of the closed bedroom door i thought one of us would have to get up to open it but the door opened of its own accord and sage hurried through the opening he turned in the darkness of the living room still glowing faintly from all the magic the queen has had her price but you have not had your cure the cure lies within my body where the queen didst place it i meant to share you with the goblin to ensure his silence not be displaced by him he hissed like an angry cat who knew goblin could be sidhe would that it were me in thy arms and not he what could have been done in pleasant glamour will nidst be done in unpleasant bargain he hissed again and vanished into the darkness beyond the door slammed shut behind him we all stared at the door did he mean what i think he meant galen asked it would amuse niceven to force a sidhe princess to pleasure one of her tiny men doyle said i raised eyebrows at that how best not to ask he said and he looked down at kitto for tonight we will worry over nothing we have found new blood of our blood kin of our kin we will sorrow over nothing tonight as celebration of the faerie court went it was modest we ordered out kittos choice bought some very fine wine and partied until dawn it was a little after dawn when the earthquake hit a on the richter scale centered in el segundo there is no major fault underneath el segundo its probably all that saved us from demolishing the entire city it lasted for only about a minute really not that much damage overall no one was killed though there were injuries but it added an entirely new twist on the idea of safe sex chapter on the first day of my being restricted to the apartment hiding behind our wards taraniss main social secretary dame rosmerta had called shed been dressed in pink and gold cloth that complemented her goldtinted skin and dark gold hair to perfection shed been the soul of polite and proper decorum more than making up for hedwicks rudeness she also made it clear that the ball in question was the yule ball i had to decline if i attended any yule ball it had to be the unseelie ball rosmerta had made noises that she of course understood that we werent missed in helping with the murders because peterson had forbidden anyone from the grey detective agency from interfering with the case jeremy had been pissed enough that he told teresa not to tell them what shed seen but teresa is all about helping her fellow man she went dutifully from the hospital to the police station and finally found a detective who would take her report teresa had felt the people suffocate felt them die and shed seen the ghosts white shapes she said sucking the life from them the police had informed her that everyone knew ghosts didnt do shit like this peterson had come in about then and thrown the report in the trash can in front of teresa usually the police wait until someones left the room before doing that teresa had managed to drag her husband out before he got himself arrested for assaulting a police officer teresas husband used to play for the rams back when they were the football team in la rays like a nicely maintained mountain with a winning smile and a very firm handshake we ended up with a lot of time on our hands no we did not just have sex all day we pestered sage i had paid the price that queen niceven asked but we had no cure why hadnt sage given us the cure last night why did kitto becoming sidhe change everything for sage did he really mean to imply that he needed to have sex with me to effect the cure sage didnt want to answer any questions he had flown around the apartment trying to escape our questions but it was a small apartment even if you were the size of a barbie doll late in the day he launched himself from the windowsill and got a little too near galen who batted at him like youd swat a mosquito i dont think he meant to strike him sage fell heavily on the floor he lay very still a tiny buttercolored thing with his bright wings like a fragile shield he raised slowly onto one arm before i could finish kneeling by him are you all right i asked he looked at me with such hatred in those tiny doll eyes that i flinched he stumbled a little in rising to his feet but he fanned his wings and caught his balance he refused the hand i offered him he stood there hands on hips and stared up at us as we towered over him if i die green knight the cure dies with me best remember that when youre being careless i didnt intend to hurt you galen said but there was something in his eyes that was not kind not gentle not galen perhaps more than just his manhood had been damaged by the demifey too close to a lie that sage said rising into the air his butterfly wings a blur butterfly wings just didnt work like that it was more the way a dragonfly moved when hed gained height enough to meet galens gaze the wing beats slowed and he hovered the large wings fanning more slowly but still with enough force to stir the curls around galens face i didnt intend to strike you that hard galens voice was low and warm with anger there was a hardness there that id never heard before part of me mourned that tone part of me felt a flare of hope perhaps even galen could learn those harsh lessons that would be needed if he ever became king or perhaps he was just learning how to hate that lesson i would have spared him if i could i watched the two men glare at each other both hating sage was still the size of a barbie doll but his anger wasnt amusing anymore that he could elicit such negativity from my smiling galen was a little frightening all right boys play nice now they both turned and glared at me so much for breaking the tension fine be that way but what did you mean that if you die the cure dies with you sage rotated in midair arms half crossed on his tiny chest as if he couldnt quite cross them and fly at the same time i mean princess that queen niceven left a present in my body the healing for your man here is trapped in this tiny package he spread his arms wide as he said it almost bowing as he hung fluttering what does that mean sage doyle said exactly what it means no prevaricating just the truth all of it he gave another turn in midair so he could look directly at doyle sage could have simply glanced over his shoulder but i think he wanted doyle to know he was being looked at you want truth darkness all of it yes doyle said his thick voice lower deeper not angry but a tone that had made many a sidhe pale sage laughed a joyous tinkling sound that nearly drew a smile from me he was very good at glamour better than i thought any demifey could be oh youll be angrier than that when you hear what my dear queen has done just tell us sage i said quit drawing out the story he turned to me hovered close enough for the breath of his wings to caress my face say please his tone made it an insult galen tensed and rhys laid a hand on his shoulder i think i wasnt the only one who didnt quite trust galen around the demifey please i said i had a lot of faults but false pride wasnt one of them it cost me nothing to say please to the tiny man he smiled obviously happy since you asked nicely he grabbed his tiny crotch through the filmy skirt he wore the cure is trapped here where queen niceven laid it i felt my eyes widen how does meredith retrieve the cure doyle asked his voice held emptiness no tone at all sage smiled and even on a face not much bigger than my thumb i recognized a leer when i saw it the same way the queen gave it to me niceven is not allowed intercourse with anyone but her husband doyle said ah but there are exceptions to every rule you should know that darkness better than most doyle seemed to blush though through the pure night of his skin it was hard to be sure if queen andais knows she has broken her marriage vows it will go badly for your queen the demifey never held to such rules until andais grew jealous of nicevens children three children she has three pureblood demifey only one belonged to pol but andais chose that match to be permanent andais envies niceven her babes and all the court knows it i would be careful who i told that to rhys said there was no teasing in his voice just truth sage brushed it away with his tiny hands you requested a cure for your green knight and there is only one cure for it she had to lay with me to lay the spell within me andais agreed that the green knight must be cured at all costs she didnt seem too concerned what those costs might be i shook my head no no intercourse not with you sage rose into the air then your green knight stays unmanned i shook my head again well see about that i felt the first stirrings of anger i didnt let myself get angry often in the courts it was an indulgence that only the most powerful could afford i had never been that powerful maybe i still wasnt but wed see doyle call queen niceven we need to talk the anger had leaked out into my voice sage came hovering close enough that the wind from his wings fanned my face there is no other way princess the cure has been given for this curse and cannot be given twice i glared at him i am not every mans meat to feast upon little man i am princess of flesh and heir to the unseelie throne i do not whore for niceven only for andais sage said i came very close to swatting him but i wasnt sure how hard i would have hit and i didnt want to hurt him that badly not by accident no if i hurt sage that badly i wanted it to be on purpose doyle contact niceven now he didnt argue just went for the bedroom door i followed him with the others trailing behind sage kept talking as we went what do you plan to do princess what can you do is one night with me such a high price to pay for your green knights manhood i ignored him niceven was already in the mirror when i entered the bedroom she wore a black dress today utterly sheer so that her pale body seemed to gleam through the dark cloth discreet touches of black sequins sparkled at neck and sleeve her white hair fell loose around her body the hair fell almost to her tiny ankles but it was thin thin and strange looking almost like it wasnt hair at all all i could think of was a spiderweb blowing in the breeze her pale wings framed her like a white curtain her three ladiesinwaiting stood behind her chair but each was clad only in a tiny silken robe as if theyd been roused from bed each robe still matched each set of wings rosered daffodilyellow and irispurple the hair that flowed loose around their faces was sleeptousled the way real hair should be the white mouse was back at her side complete with bejeweled collar for niceven to wear no crown no jewels meant she had been in true haste to answer our call princess meredith to what do i owe this unexpected honor her voice held just a trace of peevishness apparently we had awakened her entire court from their beds queen niceven you promised me the cure for galen if i fed your servant i have lived up to my bargain but you have not lived up to yours she sat up a little straighter hands folded in her lap ankles crossed sage has not given you the cure she sounded truly puzzled no i said her gaze left my face and found the tiny man who had alit upon the edge of the dresser so he could be easily seen from the mirror sage what is this about she refused the cure he said spreading his hands out as if to say not my fault niceven looked back at me is this true did you truly think i would accept him in my bed he is a wonderful lover princess to one of your height perhaps but to one of mine it grows a little ridiculous or rather doesnt grow enough rhys said from the back of the bedroom i shot him a hard look he shrugged almost an apology then turned back to the mirror if size is the only problem that can be remedied niceven said your majesty sage said i do not think this is wise only meredith swore a solemn oath not to reveal our secret then let them all swear she said i shook my head we swear nothing i said if you do not give the cure for my knight now then i call you oath breaker oath breakers do not have long political careers among the fey the cure is there for the taking princess it is not my fault if you will not partake i stepped closer to the mirror sex is a greater boon than sharing blood and well you know it niceven her face seemed to become even thinner her pale eyes glittering with anger you overstep yourself meredith forgetting my title no it is you who overstep yourself niceven you retain your title as queen at andaiss sufferance and well you know that i will have you up before my aunt as an oath breaker if galens cure is not forthcoming immediately i will not be turned from my course by anger no matter how much you taunt me meredith niceven said reveal yourself sage my queen i think this unwise i did not ask what you thought i said only to do it she leaned forward in her chair now sage you didnt need a translator to hear the threat in those two words sages wings slicked tight together then he flung himself off the edge of the dresser not flying as if he meant to plunge to his death but he didnt fall he grew he was suddenly tall taller he was nearly as tall as i was four feet eight nine the wings that had been lovely when tiny were like stained glass artwork worn across the back of his body muscles showed under his butter yellow skin and when he turned to look at me over his shoulder the black eyes were the shape of almonds and his red lips were moist and full there was something terribly sensual as he stood there his wings nearly filling one side of the room is he not lovely meredith niceven said her voice full of longing i sighed he is lovely to the eye but in his present size sex is an even greater boon for whosoever gets me with child will be king i had to step to one side to see her clearly past sages wings is it a bid for the unseelie throne niceven is that your goal i wouldnt have thought you that ambitious i bid for no throne she said liar and oath breaker doyle said he had never moved out of the mirrors sight as if he wanted her to remember always that he was by my side she turned a flat and very unfriendly gaze to him mind your manners darkness give meredith the cure as you swore you would queen andais said the green knight was to be cured at all costs doyle shook his head she could not have dreamt this cost there have always been rumors that some of the demifey could grow larger but rumors fables no truth until now the queen would think ill of a demifey king especially one who is your puppet in all things she hissed at him and in that one movement she seemed very alien as if id figure out what she truly was if i thought hard enough and it wouldnt be human the white mouse had crouched away from her as if it feared her temper you have a choice here queen niceven i said you can either give me the cure for galen as you swore you would or i can tell queen andais about your plotting niceven looked at me eyes narrow if i give you the cure you will not tell andais about all this we are allies queen niceven allies protect each other i have not fully agreed to an alliance merely for an offering of blood once a week have sex with sage and i will be your ally give me the cure for galen take your blood offering once a week be my ally or i tell aunt andais what you tried to do here niceven didnt look angry anymore she looked frightened if i had not had sage show you his secret then you would not have had anything to blackmail me with perhaps or perhaps even a little seed in the wrong place can cause a large problem what do you mean galens father was a pixie and thats not much bigger than sage in his true form there have been odder mixes in the courts i think andais would see your demand that one of your men fuck me as a grave breach of trust she spat and the mouse scrambled out of sight even her ladiesinwaiting backed up trust what do the sidhe know of trust about as much as the demifey i said she gave me a truly evil look but i was expecting it or something like it i smiled at her around the curve of sages wings id asked for an alliance so you and yours could spy for me i looked at sage nearly as tall as i was but here is proof that you have other talents your swords are not merely the pinpricks of bees but something much more she shifted in her chair a small movement but she was nervous i do not know what you mean princess meredith i think you do an alliance i still want but your contribution to the alliance will go beyond spying to what sage is but one man you have other and larger swords at your back i touched sages shoulder he jumped as if it had hurt but i knew that it hadnt i leaned in against the back of his body he tensed is what the queen says true sage is your sword so small i looked at niceven as i said it she gave me angry eyes that is not what i meant and well you know it do i i asked running my fingertips down sages arm he shivered under my touch i watched jealousy flare across her face before she could catch it back niceven niceven do not give up to others what you hold most precious her face was angry blank i dont know what you mean i touched sages hair and the hair was soft as spider silk or downy feathers softer than any hair id ever touched never offer to give up that which you cannot afford to lose she shook her head i dont understand you princess be stubborn then but know this i offer you alliance true alliance in exchange for a blood offering once a week you cease to spy for cel and his people prince cel may be locked away princess but siobhan is not and she is more frightening to some than cel will ever be i noticed her phrasing more frightening to some but not to you niceven bowed her head i find cels brand of madness more frightening than siobhans ruthlessness you can plan around a ruthless man but a madman throws all your plans to the wind i nodded your wisdom does you credit queen niceven for a chance for one of my men to be king of all the unseelie i would have risked all but for mere blood i will have to think upon it no an alliance now or the queen will know of your ambition niceven gave me a look of pure venom i will do it niceven do not mistake me on this alliance or answer to andais i have no choices left then she said no i said alliance then but i think both of us will regret it perhaps i said but now the cure for galen and our business can be done for today niceven turned her attention to sage give the princess the cure sage he frowned how my queen if i am not allowed to give it to her as you gave it to me though i gave it to thee through more intimate contact it only needs your body to enter hers to be given no sex i said she gave me a longsuffering look a kiss meredith a kiss and you are free to take no pleasure from it i had to move to one side by doyle so sage could turn around his wings seemed to fill all the space between the dresser and the bed when sage was turned around i stepped back in front of him his wings rose above his shoulders like the top of some golden bejeweled heart his hair was only a shade more golden than the soft yellow of his skin he looked almost unreal in his loveliness until you reached his eyes those glittering black eyes held not just anger but malice it made me remember that he was just a bigger version of the things that had taken bites out of galen no biting no bloodletting i said he laughed flashing teeth that were a little too pointy for comfort blunt negotiating for a sidhe princess i dont want you to have any room to say you misunderstood me sage i want this to be very clear between us niceven spoke from the mirror he will not harm you princess sage turned his head to gaze over his shoulder at her a little blood is fine spice for a kiss he said perhaps to us but you are to do exactly as the princess bids you if she says no blood then no blood why should we heed a sidhe princess he asked you are not heeding the princess sage you are heeding me she gave him a look that leaked some of the malice from his eyes his shoulders slumped a little his wings flexing until they touched the dresser as my queen bids so shall it be he didnt sound happy about it my word that he will not harm you in this niceven said i nodded i will take the queens word sage turned to glare at me but not mine my word is your word niceven said and her voice had fallen to a low hiss the look on sages face was so unfriendly that i knew if niceven saw it she wouldnt have been happy his back shielded her view and for just an instant something traveled through his eyes that was almost sorrow almost dare i say human it was gone almost instantly but that one brief glimpse gave me something to think about maybe nicevens little court wasnt any happier than andaiss i slid my hands on either side of sages face not for romance but to control him his skin was like a babys so soft unbelievably fine under my fingertips id never touched a demifey this much because there had never been enough of them to touch i leaned toward him and he just stood there hands at his sides he waited for me to complete the act i turned my head slightly to the side and hesitated my mouth hovering just above his the lips looked redder than they should have i wondered if they would feel different like the texture of his skin then my lips brushed his and i had my answer they were just lips but soft soft like silk satin rich like tasting some ripe fruit it was interesting but there was no magic to it i leaned back from him hands still on his face i looked at niceven in the mirror there was no spell no cure did his body enter yours she asked you mean tongue that is what i mean since you seem so determined to have nothing else no i said kiss her sage kiss her like you mean it then this can all be done he gave a heavy sigh his body moving under my hands as my queen bids his hands slid around my body pulling me against him we were too close for my hands on his face but as my hands slid down his back i found wings and didnt know where to hold on underneath where the wings attach to my back he said as if he understood the problem maybe hed had the problem before with other nondemifey i moved my arms under his sliding them along his back to where the wings attached to his body his back felt normal other than the extra softness of the skin shouldnt he have had extra muscles under there to flex the wings his hands kneaded my back as he brought his face close closer we kissed and this time he kissed me back gentle at first then his arms convulsed around my body and he thrust himself inside my mouth it was as if his tongue his mouth were heat heat to fill my mouth heat to spill down my throat heat like a stream flowing through my body spilling out out to my fingertips my toes until i was full of it until my skin ran hot with it it was nicevens voice that brought me back you have your cure princess give it to your green knight before it cools sage and i pulled away from each other bodies reluctant to part our hands slid down each others arms as i turned from him to find galen galen had moved up closer to us i went to him slid my hot hot hands over his arms and even through the sleeves of his shirt i could feel his skin feel the heat gliding over him his breathing was fast and hard by the time he bent down to receive his kiss our lips touched and it was as if the heat were hungry for him our lips sealed together so that no drop of heat would be lost lips tongue even teeth fed at each others mouths the heat filled my mouth almost like liquid i could feel the warm sweet thickness of it like warm honey warm syrup that filled my mouth and spilled into galen he drank at my mouth drank the magic down he drew the heat out of me pulled the magic from me with his mouth and his hands and his body the magical heat fed on heat of a different kind and with a small cry i climbed his body to wrap my legs around his waist he cried out when my body touched his groin and it wasnt pleasure he set me down quickly not quite pushing me away in a breathless voice he said i dont feel healed you will be healed two days hence by nightfall or earlier niceven said i was still standing half swaying breath coming in ragged gasps i could barely hear over the pounding of my own pulse in my ears so it was left to doyle to be sensible i want your word queen niceven that galen will be healed two days from now you have it she said he nodded we thank you dont thank me darkness dont thank me then she was gone the mirror just a mirror once again galen sat down heavily on the edge of the bed he was still gasping struggling to breathe but he smiled up at me in two days i tried to touch his face but my hand was shaking so badly i missed he grabbed my hand and put it against his cheek two days i said he nodded still smiling my hand still pressed against his face but i couldnt smile back at him i could see frosts face arrogant angry jealous he seemed to notice me noticing him and looked away he hid his face because i dont think he could control his expression frost was jealous of galen it was not a good sign chapter that night was frosts night and he seemed determined to make me forget everyone else i was licking down his stomach when andaiss voice came like an evil dream out of the empty mirror i will not be blocked from the sight i wish to see not by my own darkness you have one minute then i will clear my own way we froze then rolled to our feet got tangled in the sheets and nearly fell frost said my queen doyle is not here we will fetch him for you if you but wait she made a low sound almost a growl my patience is low tonight my killing frost i will give you two minutes to find him and free this mirror or i will do it for you we will make haste my queen i was already in the doorway doyle the queen on the mirror now she wants to see you my voice must have carried the urgency i was feeling because doyle rolled off the couch shirtless wearing just his jeans he was inside the bedroom one hand outstretched as frost pleaded for just one more minute i climbed on the bed as the fastest way to make room for both of the men to stand in front of the mirror doyle touched the side of the mirror and the glass flashed once with light then cleared then there was something in the mirror i couldnt see much of it around the two broad backs of the men and what i could see made me halfglad my view was obstructed there was torchlight flickering dark stone walls and soft hopeless moaning as if whoever was making the sound had gone beyond the need to scream beyond words beyond anything but that utterly hopeless moaning when i was little id always thought that the wailing of ghosts must be like the sounds in the hallway of mortality strangely ghosts dont make noises like that or at least none that ive ever met how dare you lock me out doyle how dare you i asked doyle to block the viewing on the mirror i said speaking to the backs of both of the men i hear our little princess but i do not see her if we are going to fight then i wish to see her facetoface her voice held anger like a cup filled to the brim with something hot and scalding the men parted so that i was suddenly visible kneeling on the bed in the tangle of sheets and pillows andais was suddenly visible as well she was standing in the middle of the hallway of mortality where id known she was the viewing mirror in the torture area was set so that you couldnt see any of the devices but andais had made sure that she was horrible enough she was covered in blood as if someone had thrown a bucket of it over her her face was speckled with little drying bits and one side of her hair was caked with blood and thicker things it took a minute of staring to realize that she was gore soaked and wore nothing else she was actually so covered in blood and bits that i hadnt realized she was nude at first i took air in through my nose out through my mouth for a few breaths while doyle filled the silence we have had many callers my queen the princess grew tired of being caught unprepared for visitors who else has been calling you niece i swallowed hard let out the breath id been half holding and my voice came out just fine not a tremble good for me taraniss secretaries mostly what does he want she nearly spit the word he i was invited to the yule ball but declined i added the last hastily i did not want her to think id snub her court how terribly highhanded and how terribly typical of taranis if one may be so bold my queen doyle said softly you are in an exceptional mood despite the fact that you have obviously been indulging yourself heartily what has so displeased you doyle was right id seen andais come back from a torture session humming covered in gore and humming she should have been having a very good time by her standards but she wasnt i have taken those who i deemed capable of either releasing the nameless or calling the old ones i have questioned them all most thoroughly if any of them had done these things they would have talked by now she sounded tired the anger beginning to leak away i am sure my queen that you have been most thorough doyle said she looked at him and it was a hard look are you making fun of me doyle bowed as far as the mirror would allow never my queen she rubbed her hand across her forehead smearing blood across her white skin no sidhe in our court did this my darkness then who if not our people doyle asked he did not rise from his bow we are not the only sidhe doyle you mean taraniss court frost said her eyes flicked to him and they narrowed in a very unfriendly manner yes thats what i mean frost bowed mirroring doyle i meant no disrespect your majesty doyle said from his awkward position have you informed the king of his peril he refuses to believe that anyone in his beautiful shining court could do such a thing he says that none of his people would know how to raise the old dead gods and that none would touch the nameless for it has nothing to do with them the nameless is an unseelie problem and the old gods are ghosts and that is an unseelie problem as well what exactly would be a seelie problem i asked i almost hated to have her attention back on me but i wanted to know if none of this was seelie business then what exactly was their business that niece is an excellent question of late taranis seems unwilling to dirty his hands with anything of importance i dont know whats wrong with him but he seems to be living more and more in his own little dream haven built of pretty illusions and his own magic she crossed her stained arms looking thoughtful it has to be one of his court it has to be what can we do to get him to see that i asked i dont know i wish i did she waved her hands oh for pitys sake get up both of you go sit on the bed look comfortable frost and doyle stood and came to sit one on either side of me frost was still nude but his lovely body was no longer at the excited pitch it had been before the queen called he sat with his hands in his lap half hiding himself doyle sat on the other side of me very still like a prey animal trying not to draw the eye of the predator i didnt often think of doyle as a prey animal he was so assuredly a predator but tonight the only predator was staring at us from the mirror move your hands frost let me see all of you frost hesitated the briefest of seconds and then let his hands drop away to either side of his lap he sat there nude eyes downcast no longer comfortable in his nudity you are truly beautiful frost i had forgotten that she frowned i seem to be forgetting a lot of things lately she sounded almost sad then her voice became brisk again hers again just the tone made all three of us stiffen almost shiver and it was a shiver of anticipation but not of pleasure i have not enjoyed myself this day these were people whom i respected or liked or valued and now they will never again be my allies they will fear me but they feared me before and fear is not truly the same as respect im learning that at last give me something pleasant to remember this night by let me watch the three of you together let me see the lights from your skin brighten the night like fireworks the three of us sat there for a second then doyle said i have had my night with the princess frost has made it clear that he does not wish to share her tonight he will share if i say that he will share andais said it was hard to argue with her blood soaked and nude looking like some terrible primal things but we tried i would ask that your majesty not do this frost said he wasnt looking arrogant he was looking almost frightened you would ask you would ask what is it you are asking of me nothing he said head hanging so that the shine of his hair hid his face absolutely nothing he sounded bitter and sorrowful when he said it aunt andais i said keeping my voice level soft like i was trying to talk a crazy person out of setting off the bomb strapped to her body please we have done nothing to displease you we have done everything we can to please you why would you punish us for that were you going to have sex tonight yes but you are going to fuck frost tonight are you not yes you fucked doyle last night correct well yes but then what difference does it make if you fuck them both right now tonight her voice was rising again losing its calm edge my voice went lower more even as hers began to unravel i have not been with both of them at once before your majesty and a menage a trois must be done carefully or you spoil the game i think that doyle and frost are both too dominant to share me comfortably she nodded very well i think we all relaxed let a breath out then replace one of them with one of the others give me a show niece of mine give me something to enjoy this night id done my best reasoning shed even agreed with it and it hadnt helped us i looked from one man to the other at this point im open to suggestions i hoped andais thought i meant suggestions on who to invite in or who to replace but i hoped that the men understood that i was still wanting a way out of all this nicca is less dominant frost said slowly had he understood what i meant or kitto doyle said kitto had his turn today and nicca isnt due for two more nights i think everyone would agree on nicca being moved ahead before they would agree to kitto being allowed two turns backtoback agree the queen said why do the men have to agree to anything dont you just pick among them meredith not really weve got a schedule and we usually stick to it a schedule a schedule she began to smile then to grin and how did you arrive at this schedule it was alphabetical i said trying not to sound as puzzled as i felt she has an alphabetical schedule alphabetical she began to laugh a low trickle of sound at first then it grew into a huge genuine belly laugh she half doubled over clutching at her sides laughing until tears trailed out of her eyes to trickle through the blood belly laughs are usually infectious strangely this one was not or rather it wasnt to us i could hear others behind her joining in ezekiel and his assistants probably thought it was a hoot torturers have such an odd sense of humor the laughter slowed and finally andais stood up again wiping at her eyes i think we were all holding our breaths wondering what shed say she managed to gasp laughter still thick in her voice you have given me the first true pleasure of the day and for that i will give you all a reprieve though i fail to see what is so wrong with doing in front of me what you will do when i leave you i do not see the difference wisely we kept our opinions to ourselves i think we all knew that if she didnt already understand the difference there was no way to explain it to her the queen went away leaving the three of us to stare into the mirror i looked shellshocked stunned by our near miss doyles face showed almost nothing frost got to his feet and screamed a sound of such rage that it reverberated through the room and brought the others to the door with guns drawn rhys looked around the room puzzled whats happened frost wheeled toward him naked unarmed but there was something fearsome in him we are not animals to be paraded for her amusement doyle stood up motioning the others back rhys looked at me and i nodded they left closing the door softly behind them doyle spoke softly to frost some of it was simple soothing talk but some was more insistent we are safe now frost i heard doyle tell him she cannot hurt us here frost raised his head and grabbed doyle by the shoulders the pressure of his pale hands mottled doyles dark skin dont you understand yet doyle if we are not the one who fathers merrys child then we are back to being andaiss playthings her neglected playthings i dont think i could bear it again doyle he shook him just a little i cant go back to that doyle i cant he shook the other man back and forth back and forth i kept expecting doyle to break his grip to force him away but he didnt hed raised his forearms to grip frosts arms other than that hed remained immobile i caught the shine of tears through the silver of frosts hair he slowly fell to his knees his hands sliding down doyles arms but never losing contact he pressed the top of his head against the other man his hands holding on i cant do it doyle i cannot do it id rather die ill let myself fade first with that last choked word he began to cry in earnest great racking sobs that seemed to come from deep deep inside him frost cried as if it would break him in two doyle let him cry and when he had quieted doyle helped me get frost into bed we laid him between us doyle spooning from the back and me entwined from the front there was nothing sexual about it we held him while he cried himself to sleep doyle and i gazed at each other over frosts curled body the look in doyles eyes his face was more frightening than the sight of andais covered in gore i watched a fearful purpose be born that night maybe it had been born a long time ago and i just hadnt noticed doyle wouldnt go back either i saw it in his eyes we held frost and finally we both slept as well sometime during the night doyle got up and left us i woke up when he moved but frost did not doyle kissed me gently on the forehead then laid his hand against the soft glimmer of frosts hair he spoke softly his deep voice like a purr more than a whisper i promise i raised up enough to ask promise what he just smiled shook his head and left closing the door softly behind him i snuggled down beside frost but sleep eluded me my thoughts werent friendly enough for sleep dawns light had greyed the window before i drifted into a fitful rest i dreamed that i stood beside andais in the hallway of mortality all the men were chained to the torture devices untouched unharmed the only shining clean things in all that dark place andais kept trying to get me to join her in torturing them i refused and i wouldnt let her touch them she threatened me and them and i kept refusing her and my refusal somehow made it so she couldnt touch them i refused until frosts small whimpering woke me he was twitching in his sleep struggling i woke him as gently as i could stroking down his arm he woke with a scream halfchoked in his throat eyes wild the scream had brought the other men to the door i waved them away as i hugged frost to me its all right frost its all right it was just a dream he choked on that and spoke fiercely his face buried against my body his arms hugging me so tight it hurt not a dream real i remember it i will always remember it doyle was the last one in the doorway closing it slowly i met his dark eyes and i knew what hed promised ill keep you safe frost i said you cant he said i promise ill keep you safe all of you he raised his hand covered my mouth with his fingers dont promise merry dont promise that dont be forsworn for something you have no hope of doing no one else heard i forgive it you never said it doyles face was just a dark shape in the nearly closed door but i did say it frost and i meant it i will make the summerlands into a wasteland before i let her have you back i said the moment the words left my mouth there was a slight sound though not a sound it was almost as if the very air held its breath it was as if in that moment reality itself froze and then remade itself just a little bit different than it had been frost crawled out of bed and wouldnt look at me youre going to get yourself killed merry he walked into the bathroom without looking back i heard the shower a few moments later doyle opened the door enough to salute me with his gun as if it had been a sword touching the side of the weapon to his forehead then bringing it out and down i nodded my acknowledgment of the gesture then he blew me a kiss with his other hand and closed the door i didnt understand completely what had just happened i knew what it meant though i was now sworn to protect the men from andais but i had felt the world shift as if fate itself had shivered something had changed in the wellorchestrated run of the universe it had changed because i vowed to protect the men that one statement had changed things i had made the fates blink but i wouldnt know if id bettered myself or worsened until it was far far too late chapter we were talking about the fertility rite for maeve reed when the mirror sounded again but this time it was the clear ringing of a bell a clarion call almost like a trumpet doyle had gotten up saying someone new he came back a few minutes later with an odd look on his face who is it rhys asked merediths mother he sounded puzzled my mother i stood up letting the notes i was making fall to the floor i started to bend down and pick them up but galen took my hand do you want company i think of all the men he alone knew how i truly felt about my mother i started to say no then changed my mind yes i would very much like company he offered me his arm and i laid my hand across his in a very formal way would you like more company doyle asked i looked around the room and tried to decide if i wanted to impress my mother or insult her with the men in my living room i could do either or maybe even both there really wasnt room for everybody to troop in so i settled for galen and doyle i didnt really need protection from my own mother at least not the kind of protection that bodyguards could supply doyle went first to tell her that the princess would be a moment galen and i waited outside the door for a little bit then we walked in he escorted me in front of the mirror then sat down on the dark burgundy bedspread trying to be unobtrusive doyle stayed standing though he moved to the far side of the mirror he wasnt as concerned with being unobtrusive i faced the mirror i knew her hair fell in thick perfect waves past her waist but you couldnt tell that from her image in the mirror her elaborate hairdo was piled upon her head in layers she had used leaves made of hammered gold to encircle the hairdo they almost hid the very ordinary brown of her hair it wasnt as if no one of pure sidhe blood had brown hair because some did i think she hid her hair because it was exactly like her mothers my halfbrownie halfhuman grandmother besaba my mother hated to be reminded of her origins her eyes were merely brown a nice solid chocolate brown with long long lashes her skin was lovely shed always spent hours on her skin milk baths creams lotions but nothing she could do would ever give her the pure white of moonlit skin or the soft gold tint of sunlight skin she would never have sidhe skin never her older twin sister eluned had that glowing skin but it was my mothers skin more than the hair or eyes that set her apart at a glance as not pure sidhe her creamcolored dress was stiff with gold and copper thread the square neckline made much of her bust creamy mounds but there was a reason why the sidhe are so fond of bustimproving styles they dont have a great deal to work with her makeup was artful and she was as always beautiful shed never gone a single visit without reminding me that she was lovely a seelie princess and i was not i was too short too human shaped and my hair dear goddess my hair was blood auburn a color that was found only in the unseelie court i looked at her her beauty and realized that she could have been human there were humans who were tall and slender and that was all she had to prove she was more sidhe than i she was far too overdressed to pay a call upon her own daughter the care with which shed arranged herself made me wonder if she knew just how much i disliked her then i realized she was almost always thisarranged this carefully constructed i was wearing a pair of shorts and a tank top that showed off my stomach the shorts were black the top was a bloodred and my skin gleamed between the two colors my shoulderlength hair was beginning to catch some of the wave it had when i let it grow long not the profuse waves of my mothers and grandmothers hair but waves nonetheless the hair was only two shades darker than the bloodred of the tank top i wore no jewelry but my body itself was jewelry my skin shone like polished ivory my hair gleamed like garnets and my eyes i had tricolored eyes i looked at my beautiful but alltoohumanlooking mother and had a moment of revelation it was only as id grown older that she complained about my looks oh the hair shed always hated the hair and shed always been unkind but the worst insults had begun when i was ten or eleven years old shed felt threatened id never realized until this moment as she sat there in her seelie finery and i stood in casual street clothes that i was prettier than my mother i stared at her just stared for a time because it was like rewriting a part of my childhood in a space of heartbeats i couldnt remember the last time id seen my mother perhaps she couldnt either because for a moment she stared seemed surprised even shocked i think shed somehow convinced herself i didnt look like this shining thing she recovered quickly because she is beyond all else the ultimate court politician she can school her face to whatever whim of the king without mussing an eyelash daughter how good to see you princess besaba the bride of peace greetings i had deliberately omitted our blood ties the only mother id ever truly had was gran my mothers mother she i would have welcomed the woman sitting in the silkdraped chair was a stranger to me and always had been she look startled and didnt quite recover her expression but her words were pleasant enough princess meredith nicessus greetings from the seelie court i had to smile shed insulted me in turn nicessus meant daughter of essus most sidhe lost such a last name at puberty or at least in their twenties when their magical powers manifested since mine had not manifested in my twenties id been nicessus into my thirties but the courts knew that my powers had come at long last they knew i had a new title shed forgotten on purpose fine besides id been rude first i will always be my fathers daughter but i am no longer nicessus i put a pensive look on my face has the king my uncle not told you that my hand of power has manifested of course he told me she said sounding defensive and contrite all at the same time oh im sorry since you did not use my new title i assumed you did not know she let the anger show on that lovely careful face for an instant then smiled a smile as sincere as her love for me i know that you are now princess of flesh congratulations why thank you mother she shifted in the small chair as if id surprised her again well daughter we should not let it be so long between talks of course not i said and kept my face pleasant and unreadable i have heard that you are invited to this years yule ball yes i look forward to seeing you there and renewing our acquaintance i am surprised that you have not also heard that i had to decline the invitation i had heard and find it hard to credit her hands stayed gracefully poised on the arms of the chair but her body leaned forward just a bit spoiling that perfect posture there are many who would do much to be so honored with an invitation yes but you do know that i am now heir of the unseelie court do you not mother she sat up straight again and shook her head i wondered if all that gold leaf on her hair was heavy you are coheir not true heir your cousin is still true heir to that throne i sighed and stopped trying to look pleasant settling for neutral im surprised mother you are usually better informed i dont know what you mean she said queen andais has made prince cel and me equals it remains only to see which of us produces a child first if i take after you mother it will surely be me the king is most eager that you attend our ball are you listening to me mother i am heir to the unseelie throne if i travel home for any yule celebrations it must be the unseelie ball she made a small movement with her hands then seemed to remember her poise and placed them carefully back on the arms of the chair you could be back in the kings good graces if you but come to our ball meredith you could be welcome at court again i am already welcome at court mother and how can i be back in the kings good graces when to my knowledge ive never been in his good graces to begin with she again waved that away and even forgot to place her hands back on the chair she was more agitated than she appeared to forget and talk with her hands shed always hated the fact that she spoke with her hands she thought it was a common thing to do you could come back to the seelie court meredith think about it truly a seelie princess at last i am heir to a throne mother why should i want to rejoin a court where i am fifth from the throne when i can rule another she waved it away you cannot compare being part of the seelie court to anything having to do with the unseelie court meredith i looked at her so carefully beautiful so stubbornly biased are you saying it would be better to be the least of all the royals at the seelie court instead of ruler of the unseelie court are you implying that it is better to rule in hell than be in heaven she asked almost laughing i have spent time at both courts mother there is not a great deal to choose between the two how can you say that to me meredith i have done my time at the dark court and i know how hideous it is i have spent my time in the shining court and i know that my blood is just as red on shining goldlaced marble as it is on black she frowned looked confused i dont know what you mean if gran had not interceded for me would you really have let taranis beat me to death beat your own daughter to death in front of your eyes that is a hateful thing to say meredith just answer the question mother you had asked a very impertinent question of the king and that is not a wise thing to do i had my answer the answer id always known i moved on why is it so important to you that i attend this ball the king wishes it she said and she like me moved on from the earlier more painful questions i will not insult queen andais and all my people by snubbing their yule celebration if i come home it will be for their yule ball surely you see that that is the way it has to be i see nothing but that you have not changed you are still as willful and determined to be difficult as always and you have not changed either mother what did the king offer you to persuade me to come to his ball i dont know what you mean yes you do its not enough for you to have the title of princess you want what goes with the title power what did the king offer you that is between him and me unless you come to the ball come and i will tell you i shook my head poor bait that mother very poor bait what is that supposed to mean she was very angry and made no attempt to hide it which from a social climber of her stature was the supreme insult i wasnt worth hiding her anger from i was perhaps one of the very few sidhe whom she would have so insulted her own sister was someone she tiptoed around it means dear mother that i will not be attending the seelie yule ball i motioned to doyle and he cut the transmission abruptly leaving my mother in midword as she faded the mirror rang almost immediately with that bell sound that clarion of trumpets but we knew who it was now and we werent home to her chapter dame rosmerta called early the next morning early enough that we were still abed the sound of tiny bells woke me tinkling into the still shadowed room the smell of roses was almost overwhelming and that was rosmertas calling card apparently shed been trying to wake us for some time and finally resorted to the tiny bells and the scent of roses i tried to sit up but was so tangled in niccas long hair and rhyss arms that i couldnt manage it rhys opened his good eye and blinked blearily at me what time is it early i said how early if youd move your arm id be able to see the clock and tell you oh sorry he muttered into the deep purple sheets he moved his arm i sat up and looked at the clock eight sweet consort what could be so important nicca propped himself up on his elbow trying to sweep his hair behind his back and failing because rhys and i were still sitting on it i loved the feel of all that hair draping over my body but i was beginning to remember why i never let mine grow quite so long rhys and i moved around enough for nicca to retrieve his hair he didnt so much sweep it behind his back as lay it down the side of his body like a slightly tangled cloak rhys turned onto his back not to flaunt himself though he accomplished that but because he wanted to be able to see the mirror with his good eye nicca stayed propped on his elbow behind me i sat up in the middle of the two of them i managed to tug enough sheets out from under everyone so that i was fairly covered nudity was casual in the unseelie court but not always in the seelie court human vanity had been more contagious there the three of us were placed to receive when rhys and i realized at the same time that someone had to touch the mirror shit he said then he rolled off the bed touched the mirror and rolled back into bed very fast as if we had posed for a picture with the camera set on automatic when he rolled back onto the sheets the weight of his body tore the sheet out of my hand and down to my lap rhys realized that he now was on top of the covers not underneath them we both had a second to choose whether we were going to be struggling with the sheets when the mirror flashed to life or be calmly posed we both chose to look comfortable not harried rhys lay full length in front of me one arm behind his head the picture of muscular ease i leaned back against nicca as if he were a chair back he curled himself around me from the back so that his body both cupped and framed me he had managed to keep just enough cover over his groin so that he was covered dame rosmerta appeared in the mirror she was dressed in silk and stiff embroidery a slightly darker shade of pink today almost fuchsia her dark yellow braids were entwined with pink ribbon that matched her dress exactly she was all pink and gold and perfect like a doll her tricolored gold eyes were bright and clear as if shed been up for hours her smile slipped a fraction as she got a good look at us she opened her mouth said nothing i helped her is there something you wanted dame rosmerta ah yes yes she gathered herself visibly remembering her duty it seemed to steady her king taranis would like to invite you to a feast in your honor a few days before yule we are very sorry for the misunderstanding about the yule ball we understand completely that you must of course attend the festivities at your own court she smiled and it was just the right amount of silly ol us but weve fixed it now it might even have been sincere i was tired nicca and rhys had begun to routinely share their nights with me i think it was purely so that they both got two nights in a row rather than one having any preference over the other but it meant that my night had been very busy since we didnt have to go to work we hadnt worried about the late hours now here was rosmerta looking daisy fresh at eight in the morning it was discouraging why was the king so insistent on seeing me before yule was it about maeve something else why did he want to see me now hed never given a damn about seeing me before dame rosmerta i said and tried not to sound as tired as i felt i need to be blunt here which i know isnt polite but i need some questions answered before i say yes or no to the feast of course princess she said making a slight bow as she said my title why is my presence so important to the king that he would give a feast in my honor days before yule the entire court has been working and planning for the ball for months the servants and the functionaries must be frantic at the thought of a feast only days before the great event why would the king need to see me so badly before yule her smile never changed never wavered for that you would have to ask the king himself that would be lovely i said if you would be so kind as to put him on that threw her confusion chased across her pretty face i think most people would have just accepted that you didnt get to talk directly to the king but too many important things were afoot to be that polite rosmerta recovered not as quickly as youd have thought but finally said i will ask his majesty if he could speak with you his schedule is very full though so i can make no promises i wouldnt ask you to make a promise on taraniss part dame rosmerta and im sure his schedule is very full but i really do need the question answered i cannot possibly agree to the feast without an answer and i think getting the answer directly from the king should speed things up considerably i smiled as i spoke mirroring her own pleasant nearly professional smile i will give him the message he may contact you rather quickly so may i humbly suggest that you take this time to dress and present yourself in a manner more befitting your station she smiled while she said it but there was a tightness around her eyes that said she wasnt sure she should have said anything or maybe my thoughts were showing on my face while she was speaking i think that i will present myself to the king as i see fit rosmerta id left off the dame deliberately she was a minor noblewoman and i outranked her that i gave her the courtesy of her title was just that a courtesy i didnt have to do it i meant no disrespect princess meredith she wasnt smiling now her face had closed down into that icy beauty that the sidhe are so capable of i ignored it because to say almost anything was to accuse her of lying maybe she hadnt meant to be disrespectful maybe she just couldnt help herself as that may be dame rosmerta as that may be i look forward to hearing from the king do you think he will call back before we have time to rise for the day i did not realize that i had woken you princess i am most humbly sorry she looked it i will make sure that you are given time to rise and do your morning duties she actually blushed a little and i wondered what word shed thought of before duties or exactly what she thought my morning duties were i realized suddenly that rosmerta had thought we were having sex not waking up andais did answer the seelie in flagrante delicto more often than not or nearly so maybe they expected the same of me i thank you for the time dame rosmerta it is most unseemly to be roused from your early morning bed to speak with a king she smiled and gave me a very pretty curtsy almost disappearing below the mirrors edge rosmerta was the picture of absolute propriety a deep curtsy from her was high praise indeed for it meant she understood i was but a step away from the throne it was nice to know that someone in the seelie court understood that she didnt rise and i realized a little late why you may rise dame rosmerta and i thank you she came to her feet a little unsteady but id left her in a deep curtsy for too long i hadnt meant to i just had forgotten that the seelie court was a lot like the english court once you curtsied you really couldnt rise until acknowledged by the royal before you it had been a very long time since i was among the seelie i was going to be a little rusty on court protocol the unseelie court was much less formal i will speak with his majesty on your behalf princess meredith good day to you and good day to you as well dame rosmerta the mirror went blank i felt all three of us relax let out a breath rhys put both his hands behind his head crossed his ankles and said what do you think maybe a little jewelry so well be more formal i gazed down the length of his body remembering the feel of my tongue running over his firm stomach sliding lower i had to close my eyes and evict the thought before i could answer no rhys i think clothes first well worry about accessorizing later he grinned up at me oh i dont know merry arent you the least bit tempted to have all of us on the bed when he calls you draped in bodies i started to say no then realized it was a lie a little tempted yes but were going to behave ourselves rhys his grin widened if you insist youre the one thats always going on about ooh the king of light and illusion why the change of heart now hes still scary merry but hes also a terrible stuffed shirt he wasnt always like that but somewhere over the centuries he became more human in the worst sense of the word the grin faded around the edges whats wrong i asked just thinking about what might have been taranis used to be good for a few laughs and a drunken brawl or two i raised eyebrows taranis having a boys night out on the town i cant picture it youve known him for only thirty years he hasnt been at his best he sat up got to his feet dibs on the shower if you get it first this morning i get it first tomorrow nicca said only if youre fast enough rhys said heading for the bathroom niccas arms slid around my waist turned me to him let him have his shower he raised a slender brown hand to trace the waves near my face he rolled over on his back drawing me with his hands at my neck and waist the sheet had rolled off of him and i saw that he was firm and ripe again i half laughed dont you ever grow tired of this never his face grew more serious a little less tender this with you is the first time i have ever been with a woman and not been afraid what do you mean the queen is a fearsome thing meredith and she likes her men submissive im not dominant but i dont enjoy her idea of sex i leaned in and gave him a very gentle kiss we do some rough stuff he suddenly hugged me to him no meredith no you dont you never scare me he held me and i relaxed against him let him hold me almost too tight it almost hurt i stroked his sides and what i could reach of his back until he began to relax his arms were not quite so crushing id thought only days ago about sending nicca back home because i did not want him to be king he wasnt able to be king and it had nothing to do with whether or not he could breed i held him stroked him gently until the sudden panic in him eased when he was calm he reached for me again and i went to his arms his mouth his body i hoped king taranis wouldnt call while we were in the midst of things but the lovemaking took the last wounded look from his eyes i needed to see those brown eyes turned to me with nothing but smiles in them when rhys stepped out of the bathroom with his towels we were just finishing he cursed under his breath is it too late to join in yes i said and gave nicca a last parting kiss besides i get the shower next i scrambled out of bed and went for the bathroom before nicca could protest i left them laughing and i left the room laughing myself what better way is there to begin a day chapter that afternoon maeve and gordon reed showed up at our door it had been only days but gordon looked like it had been years his skin had gone from sallow to grey he seemed to have lost weight so that the strong bones that had once made him a tall commanding figure now made him look like a largeboned skeleton covered in paperthin greyness his eyes looked larger in his face and the pain in them looked constant it was as if the cancer were sucking him dry eating him from the inside out maeve had said on the phone that gordon was worse much worse but she hadnt prepared us for this no mere words could prepare you for watching a man die frost and rhys had met their car on the street so they could help her husband up the short flight of steps to our apartment maeve had followed them up with huge sunglasses hiding most of her face and a silk scarf around all that blond hair she held an anklelength fur coat tight at her throat as if it were cold she looked like a hollywood imitation of a great movie star of course who had a better right to the look the men helped gordon into the bedroom so he could rest while we did the first part of the fertility rite maeve was apparently going to pace the living room while she waited shed almost lit up a cigarette before i could tell her no smoking in my home meredith please i need it then you can do it outside she lowered her sunglasses enough to show me those famous blue eyes she was wearing her human glamour again trying to look as unsidhe as possible she kept that blue stare on me as she flung open the coat to frame that long golden body she was nude except for her boots do i look dressed for your neighbors viewing i shook my head your glamour is good enough to hide you buck naked in the middle of a highway so close the coat and take your nerves and your cigarettes outside she let the coat fall closed leaving a thin line of her body showing between the soft mounds of fur how can you be so cruel this isnt cruel maeve and well you know it you spent too many centuries around the courts to think im being cruel just because i dont want your cigarettes stinking up my apartment she actually pouted at me id had enough when i come back inside heavy with magic i want to find conchenn goddess of beauty and spring not some spoiled star no glamour either i want to see those lightningkissed eyes she opened her mouth to protest i think i stopped it with a wave of my hand save it maeve and do what you need to do to help this work she pushed her sunglasses back over her eyes and said in a much smaller voice youve changed meredith theres a hardness in you that wasnt there before not hardness doyle said command she will be queen and she understands that now maeve glanced from him to me fine whats with the bikini i thought you were going to fuck not go to the beach i know youre angry and scared about your husband and that cuts you some slack but theres a limit to that slack maeve dont push it she lowered her head still fingering the unlit cigarette and unused lighter i dont mean to be such a fucking prima donna but i am desperately worried about gordon cant you understand that i understand but if i wasnt having to sit here and argue with you i could already be at the ritual site preparing myself i turned my back very deliberately on her hoping shed take the hint doyle youve extended the wards to include the little garden area in the house behind us as i requested yes princess i have i took a deep breath here was the moment that i had been dreading i had to choose one of the men to act as my consort for the ritual but who i dont know what i would have decided because galen said voice clear but uncertain im whole again merry everyone but maeve turned to stare at him he looked a little uncomfortable under the scrutiny but there was also a pleased smile on his face and a look in his eyes that i hadnt seen in a long time i dont mean to dampen the mood rhys said but how do we know hes cured maeve and gordon may not get another shot at this doyle interrupted if galen says that he is healed enough for this ritual i for one believe him i looked at doyle his face was its usual dark mask unreadable he rarely spoke unless he was certain of something how can you be certain frost asked meredith needs a consort to her goddess who better than the green man whose life has only recently returned to him i knew that the green man was sometimes a nickname for the goddesss consort sometimes a name for the generic forest god i looked at galen he certainly was the green man if doyle thinks its all right then let it be galen i dont think frost was happy with the choice but everyone else took it in stride and frost kept his mouth shut sometimes thats all you can ask of a man or anyone else chapter i needed to be alone to prepare myself for the ritual doyle hadnt liked me being on my own for even a little while but wed extended the house wards across the back wall to the small neglected garden of the house behind us neglected was good in this case because it meant that no pesticides or herbicides had been used in a very long time wed put up a ritual circle earlier in the day i opened a doorway in that circle stepped through and closed it behind me now i stood not just in the wards of the house but in a circle of protection nothing magical could cross this circle nothing less than a deity or the nameless itself the hungry ones that were slaughtering people would have been stopped by it they werent deities yet the yard had been planted within an inch of its life like most yards in southern california it was an abandoned lemon tree grove now the small trees were covered in dark green leaves it was too late in the season for blossoms i mourned that but the moment i walked between the close crowding trees and the dry crumbling grass and leaves underfoot i knew this was it the trees whispered among themselves like elderly ladies talking of the past softly with their heads close together in the warm warm sun the eucalyptus that lined the street just outside the garden wall was a heavy spicy scent that rode the air to mingle with the smell of the warm lemon trees a large cotton blanket lay on the ground waiting maeve had offered to bring silk sheets but all we needed was something of the earth animal or vegetable something thick enough to cover the unyielding ground but not thick enough to separate us from it we still needed to be able to feel the earth under our bodies i lay down on the blanket as if i was going to sunbathe i pressed myself to the blanket arms and legs wide letting myself sink into the soft fuzz of the blanket then past it to the coverings of the grass leaves and sticks a covering of small sharp things and farther still to the hardpacked earth beneath there was water here or the lemon trees would have withered and died but the ground seemed bone dry as if it never felt the touch of rain wind caressed my body drew me back the wind played against my skin rustled the dry leaves and weeds outside the edge of the blanket the leaves whispered and shushed together the smell of eucalyptus coated everything with its warm pinewood scent i rolled onto my back so i could watch the trees moving in the wind feel the heat of the sun on the front of my body i dont know if i heard a noise or just felt him standing there i turned my head my cheek lying on a bed of my own hair and there he was galen stood lost in the tossing green of the leaves and the small whispering trees his hair lifted in a halo of green curls around his face that one thin braid that was all that was left of his long long hair trailed over his bare chest as he stepped out of the trees i could see that he wore nothing his skin was a flawless white with a shade of green to it like the gleaming underside of a seashell his waist looked longer without clothes a slender expanse of flesh and bone leading up to the swell of his shoulders and down to the slenderness of his hips he was bigger than id thought he would be longer thick growing as i watched as if he felt my gaze travel down his body his legs were long and muscled as he moved toward me i think i stopped breathing for a second or two i hadnt really believed that he would come i had grown tired of hoping now here he was i raised my eyes to his face and found his smile galens smile the one that had made my heart skip a beat since i was old enough to care i sat up on the blanket holding my hand out to him i wanted to run to him but i was afraid to move out of the circle of trees and wind and ground afraid almost to look away from him because if i blinked he would seep away into the trees like a summer dream he stood at the blankets edge just out of reach and slowly lifted his hand toward mine until our fingers brushed and that small touch sent a fluttering like a cloud of butterflies inside my body it drew a sigh from my lips galen dropped to his knees on the blanket hands at his sides making no effort to touch me again i came up on my knees to mirror him we knelt staring at each other so close that we almost didnt need hands to touch his hand raised slowly and hovered over the bare skin of my shoulder i could feel his aura his power like a warm breath coming from his body his hand skated across the trembling energy of my own aura and those two separate warmths flared reaching for each other id feared that it would be hard to raise the magic but id forgotten id forgotten what it truly meant to be fey to be sidhe we were magic as the earth and the trees were magic we burned with the same invisible flame that bound the world together that warm flame swelled between us filled the air around us with a shimmering beating energy like the sound of wings we kissed through that rising energy it flowed between our mouths as he bent over me and i raised my face to meet his lips he was velvet warmth against my mouth inside my mouth as his power spilled down my throat inside my body when wed shared nicevens power it had been sharp hot almost painful this was so much more gentle warmth the first breath of spring after a long winter his hands found my body spilling my breasts bare to the wind he drew his lips back from mine and lowered his face to my breasts taking first one then the other into his mouth rolling the nipples in the warmth spilling power his hands cupped my breasts fingers tightening until i cried out his hands slid down my back to my hips fingers catching the edge of the bikini bottoms sliding them down my thighs stopped at my knees trapped he rolled me onto my back and slid the last bit of clothing away i lay naked before him for the first time with the wind spilling over my body spilling over his body he was propped up on one arm the long naked line of his body so close to mine i ran my hand down his chest down his stomach his waist and finally touched the warmth of him i cupped him in my hands holding him solid and warm and he shuddered eyes closing when he opened them his green eyes were full of a dark light a dark knowledge that stopped my breath and made things low in my body tighten i squeezed gently caressed him and his spine bowed with it head thrown back so far i couldnt tell if his eyes were open or closed i moved down while he was staring up at the sky as my hand fondled him i rolled him into my mouth in a sudden complete movement that brought a deep sound from his throat i rolled my eyes so i could see his face when he turned from the sky and looked down at me his lips half parted his face almost wild his breath came in quick gasps that started in his stomach spilled to his chest and came out his lips in a word he breathed my name like a prayer and touched my shoulders he shook his head i wont last long i lifted my mouth from his body pushed him onto his back i knelt over his legs and stared down at him id wanted this for so long i caressed his body with just my gaze memorizing the way the color of his skin went from white to a pale spring green the darkness of his nipples tight against his chest i rubbed my hand down the front of his body feeling the skin like brushed velvet or suede and still there was no word for how soft the skin how hard and firm the flesh but it wasnt just his flesh id been wanting all these years it was his magic i called my power like a breathing warmth from my skin and his aura raised like a warm sea and spilled into my power our magic flowed together like two currents of an ocean mingling drowning together i moved my body over his taking him slowly inside me a tight inch at a time until he was sheathed inside me he whispered my name and i bent over him until we kissed kissed with the feel of him inside me our bodies pressed in the most intimate of embraces the wind blew against my back like a cool hand it raised me up until i was sitting looking down at him i could feel the trees again hear them whispering to one another whispering to me of dark secrets locked deep underground and i could feel the ground underneath us i could feel the earth turning in a ponderous dance under galens body we became a part of that dance our bodies locked together my hips moving back and forth his hips raising up and down so that we formed a double rhythm that fed on each movement until i felt his body swell tight and firm and i squeezed him tight inside my body holding him holding him with hands mouth every part of me as if he would vanish if i did not hold on tight the warmth swelled between my legs rising up in a wave of heat that spilled up my body until it felt as if my skin let loose and i flowed away into the wind and the whispering trees the only thing that kept me anchored to the earth was the hard hot point of galens body i felt him slip his skin felt his power spill outward and for one shining moment we were neither flesh nor blood nor real we were the wind the trees as they tugged at their roots like anchored kites thinking both of deep earth and sunlight we were the sweet evergreen smell of eucalyptus and the thick warm scent of sunburned grass when i could no longer feel my body and could barely remember who id been i began to spill back into myself my body reformed and galen was still inside me his body reformed underneath me and we were left gasping for air laughing into each others arms i slid off his body to lie beside him in the circle of his arms my cheek pressed to his chest so that i could hear the fast sure beat of his heart when we could walk we got to our feet and walked back the way we had come to find maeve reed and her husband and give them the magic that we had found chapter it was conchenn in all her glory who waited in my bedroom for her magic kiss gordon reed seemed even more like a grey skeleton beside her glowing presence the pain in his face as he gazed upon her was horrible to see even through the pulsing glow of the magic we held inside us gordons pain was visible i could not heal his illness but i hoped to ease his pain you smell of wilderness conchenn said the heart of the earth beats through you meredith i can see it like a green glow behind my eyelids she began to cry crystal tears as if her tears should have been able to be held and set in silver and gold your green man smells of sky and wind and sunlight he glows yellow inside my head she sat on the edge of the bed as if her legs couldnt hold her anymore earth and sky you bring us mother and father you bring us goddess and god you bring us i wanted to say dont thank us yet we havent given you a child yet but i didnt say it because i could feel the magic inside my body could feel it in galen as he held my hand it was the raw power of life itself the ageold dance of earth planted with seed bringing forth fruit it could not be truly stopped this cycle because if it stopped life itself would stop maeve moved to sit beside gordon and held one of his thin hands in both her shining ones galen and i stood in front of them i moved to kneel by gordon as galen moved closer to maeve we kissed them at the same time our lips touching theirs like the last movement to some perfect dance the power jumped from us to them in a rush that raised the hairs on our bodies and filled the room with that close hush like a lightning bolt ready to strike the room was suddenly so full of magic that it was hard to breathe galen and i moved back and now i could see behind my own eyes that they both glowed filled with earth fire and the gold of the sun maeve was already moving to kiss her husbands thin lips when we left them to it closing the door quietly behind us we felt the moment of release like a wind that poured from under the door and touched us all doyle spoke into the sudden silence of us all you have succeeded meredith you dont know that for certain i said he looked at me just looked at me as if what id said had been ridiculous doyle is right frost said such power will not fail if i have such fertility power then why arent i pregnant yet there was a second silence not awestruck this time but awkward i do not know doyle said at last we have to try harder thats all rhys said galen nodded solemnly more sex we must have more sex i frowned at both of them but couldnt keep it up finally i laughed we have more sex and i wont be able to walk well carry you everywhere rhys said yes frost said i looked at all of them slowly i was pretty sure they were kidding pretty sure chapter we were finishing lunch the next day when taranis called back i bolted the last of my fruit salad and fresh bread while doyle spoke with him maeve was pregnant the magic had quickened inside her taranis couldnt know that yet but i feared what he would do when he found out it added one more little stress to dealing with the king id chosen a royal purple sundress with a scoop neck and one of those little ties in back it was very feminine very nonthreatening and a style that had been in vogue for a very long time the only thing that had changed was the hem length sometimes when dealing with the seelie court you wanted to go slow into the twentyfirst century i sat on the freshly made bed and it wasnt accidental that the purple of my dress complemented the burgundy bedspread and matched the purple pillows scattered among the burgundy and black ones i had refreshed the red lipstick and left the rest alone we were going for dramatic natural i had my ankles crossed even though he couldnt see them and my hands folded in my lap it wasnt formal but it was about the best i could do without a formal answering room doyle stood on one side and frost on the other doyle wore his usual black jeans black tshirt hed added black boots that reached to his thighs then folded them down to just above his knees hed even pulled the spider necklace out of his shirt so that it gleamed in plain sight on his black shirt the spider was part of his livery his crest and id once seen him cause the skin of a human magicians body to split as the spiders depicted in the jewels poured out of the man until hed become nothing but a writhing mass of them the unfortunate victim had been the man lieutenant peterson thought i had killed frost had gone more traditional dressed in a thighlength tunic of white edged with silver white and gold embroidery tiny flowers and vines were sewn in such detail that you could tell the vines were ivy and roses with some harebells and violas embroidered around them a broad belt of white leather with a silver buckle fastened at the tunics waist his sword winter kiss geamhradh pog hung at his side he left the enchanted blade at home most days because it couldnt stop modern bullets it didnt possess that kind of magic but for an audience with the king the sword was perfect its handle was carved bone inset with silver the bone had a patina like old ivory rich and warm like pale wood polished from all the centuries of being handled they both did their best to stand to one side and not overwhelm me physically but it was hard work even if id been standing up it would have been hard work sitting down it was nearly impossible but we were trying to have me seem friendly they would do the unfriendly parts if it needed doing it was a sort of good cop bad cop but for politics taranis king of light and illusion sat on a golden throne he was clothed in light his undertunic was the movement of sunlight through leaves soft dappled light with pinpoints of bright yellow sunlight like tiny starbursts appearing through the light and shadow the overtunic was the bright almost blinding yellow of full summer sunlight on bright leaves it was both green and gold and neither it was light not cloth and the color changed and moved as he moved even the rise and fall of his breathing made it dance and flow his hair fell in waves of golden light around a face that was so bright with light that only his eyes shone out of the dazzlement those eyes were three circles of brilliant livid blue like three circles of three different oceans each drowning in sunlight each a different shade of blue but like the water they were borrowed from they changed and shifted as if unseen currents boiled within so much of him moved and not in complementary ways it was like looking at different kinds of light on different days in different parts of the world but having them be forced together taranis was a collage of illumination that flashed and flowed and fluttered and never in the same direction i had to close my eyes it was dizzying i felt id grow sick if i looked at it long enough i wondered if doyle or frost were feeling a little motion sick or if it was just me but that wasnt something i could ask aloud in front of the king aloud i said king taranis my partmortal eyes cannot behold your splendor without feeling quite overwhelmed i would beg you lessen your glory so that i might look upon you without growing faint his voice came in a rush of music as if he was singing some wondrous song but he was only speaking in my head i knew it wasnt the most beautiful sound id ever heard but my ears heard something beyond beguiling whatever you need to make this conversation pleasant will be given to you behold i am more easy upon mortal eyes i opened my eyes cautiously he was still as bright but the light didnt move and flow so rapidly it was as if hed slowed down the play of light and his face was not quite as dazzling i could see more of the outline of his jaw but there was still no hint of the beard that i knew he wore his golden waves were more solid less radiant i knew what color his hair was and this wasnt it but at least it didnt make my head spin to look at him anymore well except for the eyes hed kept his eyes that swimming blue play of light and water i smiled and asked where are those beautiful green eyes that i remember from childhood i had looked forward to seeing them again or has my memory deceived me and it is some other sidhes eyes that i thought were yours these eyes were the green of emeralds the green of summer leaves the green of deep still water in a shaded pool the men had given me tips on dealing with taranis from centuries of doing it themselves and seeing the queen do it tip number one had been you never went wrong flattering taranis if it was sweet to the ears he tended to believe it especially if a woman said it he gave a musical chuckle and his eyes were suddenly just as lovely as i remembered them from childhood it was as if the huge iris of his eye was a flower with many many petals each one green but different shades of green some edged with white some with black until id seen maeve reeds true eyes id thought that taraniss eyes were the prettiest sidhe eyes id ever seen i was able to give him a true smile yes your eyes are as beautiful as i remember them he finally appeared as a being formed of golden light with brighter gold hair in waves around his shoulders his green eyes seemed almost to float atop that golden light like flowers riding on water the eyes were real as extraordinary as they were but the rest was not if you had tried to take a photo of him now youd have gotten those eyes and just a blur modern cameras dont like that much magic being pointed in their direction greetings princess meredith princess of flesh or so i hear congratulations it is a truly frightening power it will make the sidhe of the unseelie court think more than twice about challenging you to a duel his voice had calmed to an almost normal though lovely sound it is good to be protected at last i think he frowned it was difficult to tell through all the glory in his face i sorrow that you had such a dangerous time of it in the dark court i assure you that at the seelie court you would not find life so difficult i blinked and fought to keep my face pleasant i remembered what life at the seelie court had been for me and difficult didnt begin to sum it up i had been quiet too long because the king said if you would come to our feast in your honor i can guarantee that you will find it pleasant and most fair i took a deep breath let it out smiled i am most honored at the invitation king taranis a feast in my honor at the seelie court is a most unexpected surprise a pleasant one i hope and he laughed and the laugh was again that ringing joyous sound i had to smile when i heard it the sound even pulled a laugh from my own lips oh most pleasant your highness i meant it when i said it of course it was pleasant to be invited by this glowing man with the extraordinary eyes to a feast in my honor among the beautiful shining court nothing could be better than that i closed my eyes and took in a deep breath then held it for a few heartbeats while taranis kept talking in a progressively more beautiful voice i concentrated on my breathing not his voice i felt my breath the ebb and flow of my body i concentrated on just drawing air in and letting it out on controlling it feeling my body pull it inside me then holding it until it was almost painful not to exhale finally letting the air trickle slowly out i heard doyles voice moving smoothly into the silence id left i caught pieces of it as i performed the breathing exercise and began to be aware of what was outside my own body again the princess is overawed by your presence king taranis she is after all a relative child it is difficult to face such power unaffected doyle had been the one who warned me that taranis was so good at personal glamour that he used it routinely against other sidhe and no one told him it was illegal because he was the king and most feared him feared him too much to point out that he was cheating it had been doyles warning that had prepared me to do the breathing exercise rather than try to be brave and tough it out id spend most of my life around beings that had better persuading glamour than i did so id learned how to break free of it sometimes it required me to do things that were noticeable like the breathing most sidhe would rather have been bespelled than show just how hard they found it to withstand another sidhes power i had never been able to afford that kind of pride i opened my eyes slowly blinking until i felt myself slide more firmly into the here and now i smiled my apologies king taranis but doyle is correct i am a touch overwhelmed by your glowing presence he smiled my most sincere apologies meredith i do not mean to cause you discomfort he probably didnt but he wanted me to come to his little party he wanted that badly enough to try to persuade me magically i wanted so badly to simply ask why it was so important that i come to his little soiree but taranis knew exactly who had raised me and no one ever accused my father of being less than polite direct sometimes but always polite i couldnt pretend to be an ignorant human as i had with maeve reed hed know better the problem was without direct questions i wasnt sure how to learn what i needed to know but it didnt matter the king was far too busy trying to bewitch me to worry about anything else i didnt try to match glamour with one of the greatest illusionists the courts have ever birthed i tried truth first i remember your hair like a sunset woven into waves so many sidhe have goldenyellow hair but only you have the colors of the setting sun i did a pretty little frown an expression that women have been using for centuries to good effect or do i misremember most of my memories of you when you were not clothed in glamour are from a childs memory perhaps i only dreamed of such color such beauty i wouldnt have fallen for it none of my guards would have believed it andais would have slapped me for such obvious manipulation but none of us had known the social coddling that taranis had grown accustomed to hed had centuries of people speaking to him just like that or even sweeter if all you ever hear is how wondrous you are how lovely how perfect is it really anyones fault that you begin to believe it if you believe it then it no longer seems silly or manipulative it seems like the truth the true secret was that i did think that his honest form was more attractive than the light show i was being honest and flattering it could be a powerful combination it was as if the golden waves were twisted carved into individual locks of hair so that his true hair didnt simply appear all at once but was brought slowly into view like a striptease his true color was that crimson that sunsets can have as if the entire sky is filled with neon blood but woven through were locks of that redorange that sometimes hap pens when the sun is just sinking below the horizon as if the sun itself had been crushed across the sky a few strands of hair played throughout like the yellow of the sun drawn down to threads that winked and shimmered through the more solid waves of his hair i let out a breath i hadnt realized id been holding i had not lied when id said his natural color was more spectacular than the illusion had been does this suit you better meredith his voice was rich enough to touch as if i could have grabbed handfuls of it and clutched it to my body i couldnt quite figure out what it would feel like in my arms but something thick sweet maybe like covering yourself in cotton candy all air and spun sugar something to melt and grow sticky i jerked back to myself when doyle touched my shoulder taranis had been using more than simple glamour glamour changes the appearance of something but you still have the choice of accepting it or not glamour might make a dry leaf appear to be a sweet bit of cake and you are more likely to eat the cake illusion than the dry leaf of fact but you must still choose to eat it the glamour changes only the experience it doesnt make your choice to accept it what taranis had just done would try to make my choice for me did you just ask me something your highness he did doyle said and his voice reminded me of dark thick sweet things like honeyed mead done nearly black i realized that a touch of glamour made me think that but doyle wasnt trying to control me he was trying to help me fight against the kings power i asked if you would do me the honor of attending a feast in your honor i am honored that you would go to such trouble your highness i would be more than happy to attend such a function in a month or so things are so busy right now yule preparations and all you know i do not have a cadre of servants to make my plans go as smoothly as yours i smiled but inside i was screaming at him how dare he try to manipulate me like i was some befuddled human or lesser fey this was not the way you treated an equal i shouldnt have been surprised all along his treatment of me had been shabby at best he didnt see me as an equal why should he treat me as one i could turn my hair a different color tan my skin make small changes to my appearance i was a master of that kind of glamour but i had nothing that would keep me safe from the immense power taranis was so casually throwing at me what did i do better than taranis i had the hand of flesh and he didnt but that was something that could only kill and only by touch i didnt want to kill him just keep him at bay his sweet voice continued i would very much enjoy your company before yule doyles hand tightened on my shoulder i reached up to touch his hand and the feel of his skin helped steady me what did i do better than taranis i moved my hand so that doyle wrapped his fingers around mine his hand was very real very solid it was as if the touch of his hand helped push back that heavy voice and shining beauty i would hate to say no to your highness but surely the visit could wait until after yule his power pushed at me in a nearly raw wave if it had been fire i would have burst into flames if it had been water i would have drowned but it was persuasion almost a type of seduction and i could no longer remember why i didnt want to go to the seelie court of course i would go a sudden movement stopped me from saying yes doyle had sat down behind me putting his legs on either side of my body so that i was cradled against him his hand stayed pressed against mine it stopped me from saying yes but it wasnt enough the press of his skin against my hand was still more precious to me than his entire clothed body against me i reached out blindly and frost found my hand he squeezed it and that helped too i looked back at the mirror taranis was still a shining thing beautiful like a work of art but he was not the kind of beauty that made my pulse race it was almost as if he was trying too hard for me to take him seriously he looked a little ridiculous in his shining mask and his clothes made of sunlight his power surged again like a warm slap in my face come to me meredith come to me in three days and i will show you a feast the likes of which you have never seen the opening door saved me that time it was galen he stared at doyle on the bed and frost holding my hand you called doyle i hadnt heard doyle say anything i think i couldnt hear anything but the kings voice for a moment or two i found my voice it was thin and breathy send in kitto just as he is please galen raised his eyebrows at that but gave a quick bow unseen from the mirror and fetched the goblin id worded my request purposefully kitto wore very few clothes when he curled in his hideyhole i wanted skin touching mine and i didnt want to ask the guards to strip kitto came into the room wearing nothing but his shortshorts from taraniss view he would probably look nude let him think what he wished kitto shot a questioning look at doyle and me he was careful not to look in the mirror i placed doyles hand against the side of my neck and held out my free hand to kitto he came to me without question his small hand wrapped around mine and i pulled him to the floor so that he sat at my feet i pulled him in against my bare legs i had worn no hose only purple opentoed sandals to match my dress kitto curled his body around my legs and the warm brush of his skin on mine the feel of his hands his arms around my bare legs underneath the skirt steadied me i began to realize a method behind the madness when andais spoke to the seelie court covered in naked bodies id always assumed she did it as a sly insult to taranis but now i wasnt so sure maybe the insult began with the king and not the queen i thank you for the honor you do me taranis but i cannot in good conscience agree to a feast before yule i would be most honored to attend once the busy season of yule is past my voice came out very clear very steady almost clipped doyle finally figured out that i was after skin because he kept his hands busy on my neck caressing the parts of my shoulders and arms that showed normally the feel of his hands running over my skin would have been seductive now it was just something to keep me anchored the king lashed at me with his power fashioning it into a whip that hurt even as it felt good it tore a gasp from my throat and i would have flung myself at the mirror even cried yes if i could have spoken if i could have moved in that one desperate moment three things happened doyle laid a gentle kiss on my neck kitto licked the back of my knee and frost sat down on the bed to raise my hand to his mouth the touch of their mouths were three anchors that kept me from slipping away frost slipped to the floor on the other side from kitto and slid my finger into his mouth perhaps to hide his actions from taranis i wasnt sure and i did not care the feel of his mouth was like a velvet glove around my flesh i let out a shaking breath and i could think again a little doyle ran his fingers from the base of my skull to the top of my head kneading along my scalp under my hair what should have been terribly distracting cleared my mind i have tried to be polite taranis but you have been as blunt with your magic as i am about to be with my words why is it so important that you see me at all let alone before yule you are my kinswoman i wish to renew our acquaintance yule is a time of coming together you have barely acknowledged my existence most of my life why do you care to renew our relationship now his power seemed to fill the room as if i were trying to breathe something more solid than air i couldnt breathe i couldnt see the world was narrowing down to light light was everywhere a sharp pain brought me back so abruptly that i screamed kitto had bitten my leg like a dog trying to get my attention but it had worked i reached down and stroked his face this interview is over taranis you are being unaccountably rude no sidhe does this to another sidhe only to the lesser fey frost rose to his feet to blank the mirror but taranis said i have heard many rumors about you meredith i wish to see for myself what you have become what do you see taranis i asked i see a woman where once there was a girl i see a sidhe where once there was a lesser fey i see many things but some things will go unanswered until i see you in person come to me meredith come and let us know one another truth between us taranis i can barely function in the face of your power you know it and i know it this is from a distance i would be a fool to let you try this in person i give you my word that i will not vex you in this manner if you will but come to my court before yule why before yule why after yule he countered because you seem to want it so badly and that makes me suspicious of your motives so because i want a thing too much you would deny me just for the wanting of it no it is because you want a thing too much and seem willing to do anything within your power to get it that i fear your wanting of it even through the golden mask i saw him frown he wasnt following my logic though it seemed clear enough to me you have frightened me taranis it is as simple as that i will not put myself in your grasp not until you take some very serious oaths that you will behave yourself around me and mine if you will come before yule i will promise whatever you like i will not come before yule and you will still promise whatever i like or i will not come at all he began to shine his red hair glinting like hard blood you would defy me i cannot defy you because you have no power over me i am ardri the high king no taranis you are high king of the seelie court as andais is high queen of the unseelie but you are not my ardri i am not of your court you made that clear to me when i was younger you would hold old grudges meredith when i extend my hand in peace i will not be swayed by pretty words taranis or pretty sights you nearly beat me to death once when i was a child you cannot blame me for fearing you now not when you went to such trouble to train me to fear you that is not what i meant for you to learn he said without denying that hed beaten me at least that part was honest what did you mean for me to learn then not to question your king i sank into the feel of doyles hands and mouth on the back of my neck on frosts tongue licking across my palm on kittos teeth biting gently along my leg you are not my king taranis andais is my queen and i have no king you seek a king meredith or so rumor says i seek a father for my children and he will be king of the unseelie court i have told andais long that what is ill with her is lack of a king a true king and are you such a king taranis yes he said and i think he believed it i didnt know what to say to that finally i said i seek a different kind of king then one who understands that a true queen is worth any amount of kings you insult me he said and the light that had been friendly before became harsh and i wished for sunglasses to shield from the unfriendly glare no taranis you insult me and my queen and my court if you have no better words for me than this then we have nothing to discuss i nodded at frost and he blanked the mirror before taranis could do it himself we remained in silence for a second or so then doyle said hes always thought himself quite the ladies man do you mean that was some sort of seduction i felt doyle shrug then his arms encircled me hugging me to him for taranis anyone who isnt impressed with him is a thorn in his side he must scratch at anyone who does not worship him he must pluck at it like a small piece of grit in the eye always there always hurting is this why andais talks to him nude and covered in men yes frost answered i looked up at him still standing by the mirror surely its an insult to do such to another ruler he shrugged they have been trying to seduce one another or kill one another for centuries killing or seduction is there a third choice they have found their third choice doyle said against my ear an uneasy peace i think taranis seeks to control you and through you eventually the unseelie court why is he so pressing about yule i asked once there were sacrifices at yule kitto said softly to ensure the light would return they slew the holly king to make way for the rebirth of the oak king the rebirth of the light we all looked at one another it was frost who said do you think the nobles at his court are finally getting suspicious of his lack of children i have not heard even the breath of that rumor doyle said which meant that he had his own spies in that court it was always a king to be sacrificed for a king kitto said never a queen perhaps taranis wants to change custom doyle said holding me close you will not be going to the seelie court before yule there is no reason good enough i sank back against his body let the solid circle of his arms be my comfort i agree i said softly whatever taranis is planning i want no part of it we are all agreed then said frost yes kitto said it was unanimous decision but somehow not very comforting chapter we came out into the living room to find detective lucy tate sitting in the pink wing chair sipping tea and looking less than happy galen was sitting on the couch and trying to be charming which he was actually pretty good at lucy was having none of it everything from the set of her shoulders to the way she crossed her long legs to the way her foot bobbed said she was angry or nervous or both about damn time she said when i came out of the bedroom she looked the three of us over rather critically arent you a little overdressed for a little afternoon delight i looked from galen on the couch to rhys and nicca lounging about the room kitto went into his dog house without a word i didnt see sage and wondered if he was outside on the growing force of potted flowers by the door galen had bought several in a bid to keep the little fey happy it hadnt worked but sage did spend a lot of time lounging in the plants the three visible men gave me very innocent faces too innocent what have you been telling her rhys shrugged then pushed away from the wall where hed been leaning telling her you were having sex with both doyle and frost was about the only way to keep her from storming the castle walls while you finished your little business meeting lucy tate stood up and shoved the cup of tea in galens direction he grabbed it barely in time her face had taken on a flush of unhealthy color are you telling me that ive been out here for nearly an hour and theyve been on a business call her voice was dangerously low each word very calm very clear galen got up and walked the dripping cup into the kitchen one hand held underneath it to keep from leaving a trail of tea behind business call to the faerie courts i said trust me when i say that id rather youd have walked in on a fullblown menage a trois than the call i just finished she seemed to see me clearly for the first time you look shaken i shrugged my family gotta love em she looked at me a long time almost a minute as if she was making up her mind about something finally she shook her head rhys is right only the threat of seeing you in flagrante delicto would have kept me out here this long but family business isnt police business so screw it are you here on police business doyle asked as he moved smoothly past me into the larger room yes she said and stepped around the couch to face him he kept moving into the dining area so it wasnt so confrontational but lucy wanted a confrontation she stood with her arms crossed under her breasts looking belligerent like she wanted to pick a fight with someone whats wrong lucy i asked moving into the room to sit down on the far edge of the couch if she wanted to keep eye contact with me shed have to walk around the couch and face me she did settling uneasily into the pink chair again she leaned forward hands clasped together fingers entwined as she fought with herself i asked again whats wrong lucy there was another mass killing last night lucy usually gave good eye contact but not today today her eyes roved over the apartment restless not looking at anything too long was it like the one we saw i asked she nodded resting a momentary gaze on me then turned away to look at the television the line of herbs that galen had growing in the window exactly the same except for location doyle came to kneel behind the couch arms touching my shoulders lightly i think hed knelt so he wouldnt loom over us jeremy has informed us that everyone at his agency has been forbidden from this case your lieutenant peterson doesnt seem too happy with us i dont know whats gotten up petersons craw and im sitting here trying to decide if i care if i talk to you about this case it could mean my job she pushed to her feet and began to pace in the small space of the living room picture window to pink chair caught between the couch and the white painted wood of the entertainment center all ive ever wanted was to be a cop she shook her head running fingers through her thick brunette hair but id rather lose my job than see another one of these scenes she sat down in the pink chair abruptly and now she looked at me those wide eyes that earnest face shed made her decision it was there in her face have you been following the case in the papers or the news the news called the club incident a mysterious gas leak doyle rested his chin on my shoulder as he spoke his deep voice vibrated down my skin along my spine i had to fight to keep how it affected me from showing on my face i dont think it showed the second was one of those traveling clubs raves i believe bad drugs she nodded a bad batch of ecstasy yeah at least thats the story we leaked we made sure the press had something to chase so they wouldnt put two and two together and start a citywide panic but the rave was exactly like the first two scenes first two i asked she nodded the very first scene probably wouldnt even have come up on anybodys radar if it hadnt been in a ritzy area of town just six adults that time a small dinner party gone very bad itd still be floating around on someones weird shit pile as unsolved but the vies were high profile so when the club got hit it rang bells downtown and suddenly we had a task force we needed one but we never would have gotten it this quickly if one of the first vies hadnt been friends with several mayors and a chief of police or two she sounded bitter and tired the first murders were at a private residence i asked lucy nodded hands just clasped now not wringing tight she was tired and depressed but calmer yes and it was the first related scene as far as weve been able to find i keep dreaming that theres some crack house or sweat shop that was really the first hit and were going to find dozens of dead bodies rotting in the december heat the only thing worse than one of these scenes fresh would be a really old one she shook her head again running her hands through her hair then she shook her head fluffing out the hair shed just smoothed anyway the first one was a private residence yeah we found the couple that lived there two guests two servants how far was that house from the club that we saw i asked holmby hills is about an hour away i felt doyle go very still behind me the silence seemed to widen out from us like circles in a pool we all stared at her and i think fought not to look at one another did you say holmby hills i asked she was looking back at us yes why does that ring everyones bell i looked at doyle he looked at me rhys settled in to lean against the wall as if it meant nothing but his face couldnt quite hide the shine of excitement the mystery was deepening or maybe shallowing if that was a word rhys couldnt help but enjoy it galen went into the kitchen and hid fetching a cloth to dry the teacup frost came and sat on the couch beside me giving enough room so doyle wasnt crowded frosts face gave nothing away nicca looked genuinely puzzled and i realized that hed been out of the loop on exactly where maeve reed lived hed helped with the planning for the fertility rite but he didnt know her address no lucy said no you are not all going to just sit there and look innocent when i said holmby hills you all looked like id stepped in something something nasty you cant give me innocent faces now and not say whats going on we can do anything we wish detective doyle said she looked at me are you going to stonewall me on this i risked my career to come down here and talk to you all we are a little curious about that doyle said why would it be worth your career to come and speak with us you have teresas information and jeremys assurance it was a spell what more can we tell you she glared at him im not stupid doyle there are fey everywhere i look on this case peterson just doesnt want to see it the first incident is in holmby hills almost right next door to maeve reeds house shes a sidhe royal exiled or not shes still fey we put out calls to all the local hospitals looking for anyone exhibiting symptoms similar to our victims we got one bite on a live person no new dead have come in you have a survivor rhys asked her gaze flicked to him then back to doyle and me were not sure hes alive and getting better every day she stared at the two of us would it make you share information with me if i told you our possible survivor is fey i dont know about the rest of them but i didnt even try to keep the puzzlement off my face lucy smiled at us an almost mean smile as if she knew she had us this fey doesnt want to contact the bureau of human and fey affairs seems real eager to avoid it lieutenant peterson says the fey have nothing to do with the case says its a coincidence that maeve reed lives close to the first incident he had the fey interviewed but insists you can never really tell whats wrong with the faeries insists that if it had been the same sort of events the fey would be dead she looked around the room at all of us i dont believe that ive seen fey heal injuries that would have killed any human being ive seen one of you fall off a highrise and walk away she shook her head again no this has something to do with your world doesnt it i fought not to look at anyone around me would you talk to me tell me the whole truth if i let you interview the injured fey lieutenant peterson has declared the fey noninvolved so technically even if he finds out he cant fire me or even discipline me for it in fact the injured fey is my cover story since the fey wont speak to the fey authorities im looking for a few fey faces to try to talk to him help him adjust to the big city you think hes from out of town i asked oh yeah hes got never been to the big city written all over him he screamed when his heart rate monitor beeped at him the first time she shook her thick hair all around her face hes from somewhere where theyve never seen modern equipment the nurses say they had to take the television out of his room because he had some sort of seizure after he saw it work she looked at all of us in turn and finally came back to me doyle and frost talk to me merry please talk to me i wont tell the lieutenant i cant please help me stop this whatever it is i looked at doyle frost rhys galen came back out of the kitchen but he spread his hands wide and shrugged i havent been doing much of the detective stuff lately so i dont feel like i should get a vote nicca spoke up which surprised us all the queen wont like it his voice was clear filling the room but somehow soft like a child whispering in the dark afraid to be overheard she didnt tell us not to share with the human police doyle said she didnt niccas voice seemed so small so much younger than that tall strong body i turned on the couch so nicca could see full into my face no nicca the queen didnt tell us not to talk to the police he let out a large breath okay again it was a childs answer the grownups had told him he wouldnt get in trouble and he believed us we all exchanged looks one more time then i said rhys tell her about the spell he did we emphasized that we werent sure anyone left in the courts could still do the spell and that it might possibly be a human magician or witch it wasnt anyone at the unseelie courts that we were sure of how can you be so sure lucy asked we exchanged another series of looks trust me lucy the queen doesnt have to sweat civil rights or review boards shes very thorough she studied our faces how thorough can you guys be i frowned at her what do you mean ive heard rumors about what your queen does to people can you do anything that effective without leaving marks i raised my eyebrows at that are you asking us to do what i think youre asking us to do im asking you to stop this from happening again the fey in the hospital wont talk to the police he wont talk to the social worker that the bureau of human and fey affairs sent over the fey went wild when i suggested we could contact the ambassador personally if he wasnt comfortable with a human social worker seeing how scared he was to talk to the ambassador made me think he might be even more scared of you guys why i asked the ambassador isnt sidhe what do you expect us to do to this fey doyle asked i expect you to do whatever it takes to get him to talk weve got over five hundred dead doyle almost six hundred besides from what rhys says if these things arent stopped if we just keep letting them feed theyll regenerate or something i dont want a pack of newly born ancient deities with a taste for killing running around loose in my town its got to be stopped now before its too late we agreed to go with her but first we made a phone call we called maeve reed and let her know that the ghosts of dead gods had been resurrected to kill her which meant it was somebody in the seelie court and moreover they had the kings permission to do it chapter lucy flashed her badge a lot to get us through the metal detectors with our guns and blades intact the men even had to show the cards identifying them as queens guardsmen before the nurse in charge would let us on the floor but finally we stood at the bedside of a man well of a male he was a tiny misshapen thing sage was tiny too but he was perfectly proportioned he was meant to be the size he was clearly the man who lay in the bed with the sheets tucked up under his arms was even at a glance wrong i am unseelie court and i call many shapes right pleasant but something about this one made the hair on the back of my neck crawl it made me want to look away as if he was hideous though he wasnt i wasnt the only one having trouble rhys and frost had looked away turned their backs their reaction said that they either knew him or knew what had happened it was a turning away like a shunning had he broken some ageold taboo doyle did not look away but then he almost never did galen exchanged a look with me that said he was as puzzled and disturbed as i was kitto stayed near my side where hed insisted on being one hand in mine like a child seeking comfort i forced myself to keep looking to try to figure out what it was about this small man that made me want to cringe he was a little over two feet tall his tiny feet making small bumps in the sheet something about his body seemed foreshortened even though everything was there his head was a little big for the thin torso his eyes were large and liquid far too large for the face it was as if the eyes were left over from some other face his nose matched the eyes but because the rest of the face had receded the nose looked too large as well that was what it looked like as if his eyes and nose had been left stranded while the rest of his face had grown smaller meaner pinched and wasted nicca moved through the rest of us and held his hand out oh bucca what has become of thee the tiny figure on the bed remained immobile at first then slowly he raised one small hand on an arm so thin it was like thick string he laid that tiny pale brown hand against niccas strong brown one kitto turned a face shining with tears up to the lights buccadhu buccadhu what are you here i thought at first kitto had left out a word or two then i realized he hadnt hed asked exactly what he wished to know the two of you know him doyle said making it more statement than question nicca nodded patting the tiny hand ever so gently he spoke rapidly in the strangely musical tones of one of the old celtic tongues it was too rapid for me to follow but it wasnt welsh and it wasnt scots gaelic or irish which still left several dialects not to mention countries to go kitto joined in speaking something close to what nicca spoke but not exactly a different dialect or maybe from a different century like the difference between middle english and modern english i watched kittos face the eagerness the sorrow i knew he was very sad to find this man here in this condition but that was all i could follow doyle spoke in modern english at last maybe everyone else had been following just fine but i had not nicca knew him in a form not so different from this one but kitto remembers him as we are now a sidhe bucca was once worshipped as a god i looked down at the wizened shape and knew what had made my skin crawl those huge brown eyes that strong straight nose they were very like niccas id always assumed that niccas brown skin and eyes had come from the demifey in his heritage but now staring down at the tiny figure i knew id been wrong i looked at the man with a renewed fit of horror for now i could suddenly see it it was as if someone had taken one of the sidhe and compressed him down into something the size of a large rabbit i had no words for the horror that lay nearly lost in that hospital bed and no thought to how he could have come to that form how i asked softly and wished instantly that i hadnt because the small figure on the bed looked at me with those eyes that shrunken face he spoke in clear though accented english i have brought myself to this girl me and me alone no nicca said that isnt true bucca the small figure shook his head his dark hair cut short but resting thick upon his pillow bunching as he moved there are faces here i know nicca beyond yours and the goblins there are others who were once worshipped and eventually lost their followers they did not waste away like this i refused to give up my power because i thought it would diminish me he laughed and the sound was bitter enough to choke on now look at me nicca what my pride and my fear have done to me i was confused to put it lightly but like is so often the case in fey society the very questions i needed to ask were considered rudely direct the man in the bed turned his oddly heavy head to look at kitto the last time we met i thought you tiny those strangely compelling eyes looked up at the goblin you have changed goblin he is sidhe nicca said bucca looked surprised then laughed you see i fought so hard for so many centuries to keep our blood pure to mix with no one i considered you an unclean thing once nicca nicca kept patting the other mans hand that was long ago bucca i would not let any of our pure buccadhu line go out among the other sidhe now all that is left of my line is those like you who were not pure he turned his head and it looked like it took effort and all that is left of all the buccagwidden is you goblin there are others among the goblins buccadhu and you see the moonlight skin on these sidhe the buccagwidden are remembered they may share the skin but not the hair or eyes no goblin they are lost and it is my doing i would not let any of our people join with the others we would stay the hidden people and keep to the old ways there are no old ways left goblin he is sidhe doyle said acknowledged by the unseelie court as such bucca smiled but not like he was happy and even now all i can think is that i did not know the unseelie sidhe had sunk so low as to accept goblins into their ranks even dying as i am having seen the last of my people die before me and i cannot see him as sidhe i cannot he took his hand out of niccas grasp and closed his eyes but not like hed fallen asleep more like he was trying not to see detective lucy had been very patient through all of this could someone explain to me whats going on doyle exchanged glances with frost and rhys but none of them spoke i shrugged dont look at me im almost as confused as you are me too galen said i recognized either cornish or breton but the accent was too archaic for me cornish doyle said they were speaking cornish i thought there werent any goblins in cornwall galen said kitto turned from the bed and looked at the tall knight goblins were not all one people any more than the sidhe were merely two separate courts we were all more than this once i was a cornish goblin because my sidhe mother was a buccagwidden a cornish sidhe before she joined the seelie court when she saw the form her babe had taken she knew where to lay her burden down and left me among the snakes of cornwall there are nests of snakes everywhere in the isles bucca said in a thick voice even in ireland no matter what the followers of padrig want you to believe most of the goblins are in america now kitto said aye bucca said because no other country would have them aye kitto said okay lucy said whatevers happening old home week family feud i dont care i want to know how this bucca who lists his name as nick bottom which i looked up a character from a midsummer nights dream very cute ended up here nearly sucked dry of life bucca nicca said softly the small figure opened his eyes they were full of such aching tiredness that i had to look away it was like looking down a tunnel into something worse than oblivion so much worse than death his accent thickened with his emotions i cannae die you understand that nicca i cannae die i was the king of my people and i cannae even fade like some did but i am fadin he raised one piteously thin arm i am fadin like this like some giant hand is squeezin me down bucca please tell us how you came to be attacked by the hungry ghosts nicca said in his soft voice when this flesh i am still clingin to fades ill be one of em ill be one of the starvin ones no bucca he held out that thin thin arm no nicca that is what happened to most of the others who were strong we cannae die but we cannae live so we be betwixt and between not good enough for heaven doyle said nor bad enough for hell bucca looked at him yes i always love getting insight into fey culture but lets get back to the attacks lucy said tell me about the attack on you mr bottom or mr bucca or whatever he blinked up at her almost owlishly they attacked me at the first sign of weakness could you expand on that a little lucy said she had her notebook open pen poised you raised them rhys said it was the first time hed turned around the first time hed really looked at bucca since wed entered the room aye bucca said why i asked it was part of the price i had to pay to rejoin the faerie courts that stopped us all for a second it seemed to make sense andais had done it or had it done that was why no one could track it back to her it explained why none of her people had known about it she hadnt used any of her people pay to whom doyle asked i looked at him almost saying aloud we all know then bucca spoke taranis o course chapter we all turned to the bed like a slowmotion scene from a movie did you say taranis i asked are ya deaf girl no i said just surprised bucca frowned up at me why i blinked down at him thought about it i didnt think taranis was this crazy then ya ha not been payin attention she hasnt seen taranis since she was a child bucca doyle said i apologize then he looked at me critically she looks like seelie sidhe i wasnt sure what to do with the compliment i wasnt even sure if under the circumstances it was a compliment lucy walked around to the far side of the bed are you saying the king of the seelie court had you raise these hungry ghosts aye why she asked we seemed to all be asking that question a lot today he wanted them to kill maeve reed lucy just stared at him okay im lost why should the king want the golden goddess of hollywood dead i dont know why bucca said and i didna care taranis promised to give me enough power to recover some of what id lost i was finally willing to join the seelie court but he promised it to me on condition of maeves death and that i could control the starving ones many o them were friends of old i thought they were like me and would welcome a chance to return but they are no longer bucca or sidhe or even fey they are dead things dead monsters he closed his eyes and took a deep shaking breath the first time i faltered they attacked me and now they feed not to return to the old ways but because they are hungry they feed for the same reason that a wolf feeds because it hungers if they gain enough lives to return to something close to sidhe it will be so awful that not even the unseelie court will be able to match the horror of them not to complain lucy said but why didnt you tell all this to the social worker or the ambassador it was when i saw nicca and even the goblin that i knew id been a fool my time is past but my people live on as long as me blood is walkin around then the bucca are not dead tears glittered in his eyes i tried to save meself even if it meant destroying what was left of me people i was wrong terrible wrong he reached out for niccas hand this time and nicca took his with a smile how do we stop them doyle asked i raised them but i cannae lay them i have not the strength can you tell us the spell doyle asked aye but that da na mean you can do it let us worry about that doyle said bucca told us how hed planned to lay the ghosts lucy actually took notes the rest of us just listened it wasnt a matter of magic words more of magical intent and just knowing how to think it through when hed finished telling us everything he knew about the starving ones i asked have you been hiding the nameless from the unseelie court girl have ya not been payin attention taranis is hidin it you raised that for him too i couldnt keep the surprise out of myvoice i raised the starvin ones with a little help from taranis but taranis raised the nameless with only a little help from me he was one of the main powers behind its casting doyle said why would taranis do that i asked i thought he meant to take some of his power back from the thing bucca said and mayhap he did but it didnt work out like hed planned so taranis is controlling the nameless galen said nay lad do not ya unerstand yet taranis freed it gave it orders to kill this maeve but he no more controls it than i do the starvin ones he hid what he had done but it is the thing itself that is hiding it now taranis was not halfpanicked when he realized that i tell you he was scared and he should be what do you mean i asked when i tried to send the starvin ones through maeves wards they couldna reach her they turned on me and found other prey i saw the thing that you call the nameless it will breach her wards and once it has killed her then what will it do i dont know i said softly anything it damn well pleases bucca said what he means rhys said is that once the nameless kills maeve reed it wont have a purpose anymore it will just be this huge powerful thing and it will destroy everything around it now there is a smart boy bucca said i looked at rhys how do you know that for certain i gave most of my magic to that thing i know what it will do merry we have to keep it from killing maeve as long as shes alive it will keep trying to kill her and it will keep trying to hide its presence until its done that once shes dead itll just explode all over the city the most alien energy the fey had to offer will be let loose in southern california the thing will stomp through la like godzilla through tokyo how am i supposed to convince peterson that some ancient fey magic is about to stomp the city lucy asked you arent i said he wont believe it anyway then what are we going to do she asked were going to go keep maeve reed alive maybe convince her that europe would be good this time of year maybe just keep her moving ahead of it until we can figure out something else not a bad idea rhys said i take it back said bucca youre a smart one too glad to hear that i said does someone have a cell phone lucy had one i took it from her and she gave me maeve reeds number out of her little notebook i dialed and marie the personal assistant answered she was hysterical she began to scream its the princess its the princess julian took the phone from her meredith is that you yeah julian whats wrong somethings here something so psychically big i cant even begin to sense all of it its trying to get through the wards and i think its going to do it i started for the door were on our way julian well send the police on ahead of us you dont sound surprised meredith do you know what this thing is yes and i told him as we ran through the hospital toward the cars i told him what it was but i didnt know if anything i told him was going to help at all chapter by the time we arrived maeve reeds place was surrounded by police everything marked cars plain cars special forces armed vehicles ambulances waited at a sort of hopeful safe distance guns were everywhere they were even trained on the wall in front of maeves house the trouble was there was nothing to shoot at a woman in full police battle armor with swat written across it was standing behind a barrier of cars in a pentagram and circle that shed drawn in chalk on the road la had been one of the first police departments to attach witches or magicians to all special units the moment the car engine died i felt her spell it made the air hard to breathe doyle frost and i had ridden with lucy doyle in particular had not enjoyed the wild ride he half staggered over to a line of planted shrubbery and knelt the humans would think he was praying and he was in a way he was renewing his touch with the earth doyle was quite frightened of almost all manmade transportation he could travel through mystical pathways that would have made me scream forever but driving fast through la traffic had nearly done him in frost was fine the other guards including sage poured out of the van at doyles urging we had gone back to the apartment for some more blades lucy had been against it until he pointed out that until the namelesss glamour was broken bullets wouldnt hurt it he assured her that they had things at the apartment that would break its glamour if anything could lucy had decided it was worth a side trip she had radioed ahead that without some magical aid the police might not be able to see the thing letalone shoot it apparently theyd taken our word for it the witch had probably tried something simple and when that didnt work shed begun to work on the chalk drawing complete with runes and the whole nine yards it worked in a skinruffling throatclosing rush of power like an unfelt wind the spell rolled out and hit its target the air wavered like heat rolling off summer asphalt except this heat wavered up and up towering over twenty feet into the air i wasnt sure that the police without psychic talent were going to be able to see anything but the wave of gasps and curses let me know i was wrong lucy stared up at the shimmer do we just start shooting it she asked yes frost said it didnt really matter what we did whoever was in charge gave the order and suddenly the sound of gunfire was everywhere bursting open like one huge explosion the bullets passed through the shimmering almostform like it wasnt there i began to wonder where all those bullets would end up because theyd keep going until they found some target then men were yelling stop firing cease fire all up and down the line the sudden silence rang in my ears the shimmering form just kept pushing at the wall or rather the wardings in the wall it didnt seem to have noticed the bullets or the police what just happened lucy asked it is in a time between this time and the next doyle said he had walked back to us while we were watching them throw bullets at the thing it is a type of glamoury that allows the fey to hide themselves from mortal eyes lucy looked at me can you do that no i said nor can the rest of the sidhe doyle said we gave up that ability when we made the nameless ive never been able to do anything like that i said you were born after wed done two castings like the nameless doyle said how could anyone have blamed you for being less than we once were the witch has broken some of the glamoury frost said but not enough doyle said the two of them looked at each other no i said no to whatever youre thinking they looked at me meredith we must stop it here no i said no we must keep maeve reed alive thats what we talked about no one talked about killing the nameless i mean it cant die can it they looked at each other again rhys joined us no it cant die is it real lucy asked he looked at her what do you mean is it solid enough to be hurt by our weapons he nodded oh yes its real enough for that once its stripped of the magic that keeps it safe we must strip that magic away doyle said how i asked and my stomach was tight at the idea of what it might take it must be wounded frost said i looked at his arrogant face and knew that he was hiding something from me i grabbed his arm how can you wound it his eyes softened as he looked down at me the grey went from the color of storm clouds to sky just after the rain when the sun is about to break through i watched the color swirl like clouds itself across his eyes a weapon of power would be able to wound it if the warrior were skilled enough i held on to his arm tighter what do you mean skilled enough skilled enough not to get killed doing it rhys said both frost and doyle gave him unfriendly looks look we dont have time to play around here one of us with a weapon of power and enough skill to do it has to draw blood rhys said i kept my grip on frosts arm but looked at doyle whos on the list of skilled enough now thats just insulting rhys said doyle and frost arent the only people standing here they gave him another unfriendly look i was never the queens favorite guard but once i was favored in battle galen said im like merry i came along after all the old times ive got good blades but none of them are weapons of power because we lost the knack of making such things frost said we have become more flesh and less pure spirit with every casting it has allowed us to survive even to thrive but it has not been without cost i slid in against frosts body and found his sword winter kiss in our way how apt i looked at the other men frost was the only one in a tunic everyone else was wearing street clothes tshirts jeans boots except for kitto who had thrown a shirt on over his shorts the clothes were wrong but the weapons were right frost had a second sword strapped to his back a sword almost longer than i was tall i knew the tunic covered more blades he always carried some blade somewhere on him unless the queen had forbidden it doyle had kept his gun in its shoulder holster but hed added a sword at his hip and wrist sheaths on both arms the knives glinted silver against his dark skin but the sword was as black as he was the blade was iron not steel id never known what the black handle was made of it was metal but what kind of metal i did not know the sword was called black madness bainidhe dub if anyone other than doyle tried to wield it they would be struck permanently mad the daggers on his wrists were twins formed together at one making these legendary blades were thought to hit any target once thrown their nicknames at court had been snick and snack i knew they had true names but id never heard them referred to as anything else galen had a sword belted at his side and it was a good sword but not magical not in the way of the great weapons he had a dagger on the other side of his belt to balance the sword hed added a shoulder holster and gun over his buttondown shirt and a second gun tucked in the small of his back i had put a belt around the middle of the sundress and threaded a side holster through it to hold my own gun it ruined the line of the dress but if things went really wrong id rather survive looking a little silly than die looking perfect i had two folding knives in thigh sheaths under the dress and a smaller gun in an ankle holster id been deemed unworthy even of a nonmagical blade by both courts rhys had his sword on his back the one hed used of old uamhas dread death he had his axe belted at his side because with only one eye his depth perception just wasnt up to a sword he had daggers on him but i wasnt sure id want to be standing to the side of whatever he was throwing at when youre missing an eye theres only so much you can compensate for nicca had a sword that was almost identical to galens standard knight ware beautiful deadly but not powerful nicca had two guns on either side of his shoulder holster i had reason to know that he used either hand equally well he had added a third gun to the small of his back and a dagger on the opposite side from his sword maybe it was standard issue too like the sword kitto didnt know enough about guns to be trusted not to shoot his foot off but he had a short sword belted across the back of his wile e coyote tshirt sage had a tiny sword that gleamed bright silver in the sunlight he would not give us the name of it to know the name of something is to have power over it he said there was a rumbling sound and the ground seemed to swell up as a portion of maeves wall fell inward the nameless had cheated it hadnt gotten past her wards it had destroyed what she attached them to the shimmering thing moved through the hole while a few shots rang out and officers in charge yelled dont shoot dont shoot doyle was striding forward i will use the daggers they must strike true as is their nature can you get close enough and still stay out of reach frost asked doyle gave a small glance back i think so he kept walking frost moved me away from him his hands gentle on my arms i must go with him if he falls i must be there kiss me first i said he shook his head if i touch your lips i will never leave your side he kissed my forehead quickly then jogged after doyle rhys swept me up into his arms while i was still too surprised to react he kissed me thoroughly and completely and ended up wearing most of my red lipstick on his lips he sat me back on my feet a little breathless you cant steal my courage with a kiss merry you dont love me enough for that he ran after the other two before i could think of anything to say the police rounded up an armored group of swat officers to back up the men then they moved forward through the hole in the wall and vanished from sight strangely the nameless had vanished as well as if once inside the wall the shimmer was lost even though it should have towered above it what if we go in the back and get maeve out galen said into the heavy silence we all looked at him we cant fight the nameless but we might be able to do that lucy slapped her forehead dumb really dumb we should have evacuated ms reed before this it will follow her i said unless you can get a helicopter in here we wont be able to get her away fast enough lucy seemed to think about that for a moment i might be able to swing it the reeds have a lot of clout in this town do it if you can i said in the meantime give us a few men and let us go in the back galen said im going with you i said he shook his head looking so serious no merry youre not yes galen i am i was raised to know that a leader never asks of her people what she isnt willing to do herself your father was a good man but youre mortal merry the rest of us arent the police are all of them and theyre still here he shook his head no we argued but in the end i got my way because all the men that could have argued me down were inside the broken wall facing off against the thing wed come to destroy chapter getting over the wall was surprisingly easy it was tall but not that tall and setting off the silent alarm was no longer a problem the police were already here i was helped down into a narrow lane that was planted so thickly with dark green camellias that they formed a second wall to nearly hide the house in front of us it wasnt the right time of year for blooming so they were just tall bushes with thick waxy leaves i knew exactly how the leaves felt because lucy and galen both made me stand in the damn shrubs i could come along but they were both going to make sure i didnt get to do anything a uniformed officer ducked around the corner and came back with whispered news that there was a sliding glass door easy access we were about to slip around that corner and enter the door to search for maeve reed when something awful happened the nameless became visible its glamour went down with a magical backwash that staggered every fey in the area still pressed into the camellia bushes i couldnt see anything but two of the policemen opened their mouths wide and started to scream the other policemen paled but tried to calm the other two down until one of the screamers dropped to his knees and tried to claw out his own eyes one of the calm ones fought to hold the screamers hands away from his body another older officer slapped the other screamer over and over cursing under his own breath with each blow son of a bitch slap son of a bitch slap until the screaming officer sat down on the grass and hid his face whimpering the remaining two policemen and lucy pale but ready had their guns out galen had moved out from the wall when the glamour crashed down and all the fey with us were staring fascinated at what lay up ahead i almost didnt look i was part human maybe my mind would break like the two policemen but in the end i couldnt not look how do you describe the indescribable there were tentacles and eyes and arms and mouths and teeth and too many of all of it but every time i thought i understood its shape that shape changed id blink my eyes and it wouldnt be the way i remembered it maybe i couldnt see what the nameless looked like maybe my mind just couldnt hold it all and this was the best my poor mind could come up with all i could think was if that shambling mountain of horror was the protective version that my mind would allow me to see i did not want to see anything worse lucy looked down at the ground pain crossing her face as if it hurt her to simply look at the thing were going to kill that contain it galen said you cant kill magic she shook her head took a tighter grip on her gun and turned resolutely back to look at the very large target the radios on the uniforms crackled to life the message was if you can see it you can kill it fire i had a second to think wheres maeve when galen threw himself on top of me and forced me flat on the ground a heartbeat later bullets flew overhead one of the screaming policemen got loose of the two trying to wrestle him down and when he stood up his body did a jerking dance and he fell dead beside us in that one moment bullets were more dangerous than the nameless lucy yelled into her hand radio were taking friendly fire in here we havent secured the civilians yet cease fire unless you fucking know what youre hitting the shooting continued lucy screamed again officer down officer down hit by friendly fire repeat hit by friendly fire the shooting slowed then stopped altogether we all stayed plastered to the ground for a few moments waiting it seemed very important to breathe as if id never done it quite right before or maybe it was the bleeding body of the dead policeman that made breathing such a treat as if we all had to make up for him being dead somehow when everything stayed quiet lucy carefully got to her knees the rest of the police began to get to their knees until finally one of the younger uniforms stood up he didnt fall back down dead so the rest of us stood up cautiously look one of the policemen said we looked the nameless was bleeding blood trickled like crimson string down its head shit lucy said were going to need antitank weapons to blow that thing up i agreed with her how long will it take to get some sort of national guard stuff here too long she said her radio squawked again she listened to the unintelligible talk then said helicopters en route we need to find ms reed and get her over the wall we didnt have to find ms reed she found us she and gordon reed came running around the edge of the house at as fast a pace as he could manage julian was behind them the greatest danger in that first second was shooting each other out of sheer nerves we all managed not to be that stupid but my pulse was thudding in my throat and everyone looked bigeyed like they were ready to get back over the wall maeve reed grabbed my hand in both of hers is it taranis does he know he doesnt know about the baby she frowned then he found out we saw you ms reed an officer was holding out his hand we need to get you over the wall she kissed me on the cheek and let the nice officer hand her to another nice officer waiting on top of the wall gordon reed was next he didnt say anything he seemed to be struggling just to breathe and stay upright between julian and the same nice officer who had helped maeve over the wall when they were safely over i asked julian where are your other people he shook his head everyone but max is dead hes too hurt to walk i made him hide in the house so i could get the reeds out i didnt know what to say but a policeman said youre next to julian and i didnt have to say anything just watch him climb to safety most of the cops that could still walk were already over when lucys soft oh my god turned me around to look at the nameless rhyss white hair shone out against the darker colors of the monster something between an arm and a tentacle wrapped around his chest the blade of his axe sparked in the sun as he drove it into an eye the size of a volkswagen the eye bled the monster screamed and so did rhys get merry out of here said galen then he was gone at a run toward the fight chapter i didnt wait for nicca or lucy to grab me i just started running after galen my sandals werent meant for running full out and i threw them off as i rounded the corner kitto was at my heels and nicca with sage on his shoulder wasnt far behind lucy and the last uniform had come with us too but what we saw froze us all for a few seconds the nameless had no legs yet it did it was a writhing mass of a thing and my eyes could not hold it i felt a scream clawing at my throat but i knew if i let that sound come out of me id never stop like the policeman still huddled by the wall sometimes the only thing that keeps you from going mad is stubbornness and need rhys was still wrapped in its flesh but hed stopped moving his arms hung pale and empty and i knew that to have let all his weapons fall away he was at best not conscious at worst i refused to finish the thought thered be time to think the unthinkable later the armored cops who had come in with the other guards lay scattered about the thing like discarded toys the swimming pool lay just behind the thing and its trail of destruction had taken out the pool house frosts silver hair blew in a shining curtain one arm hung limp at his side but hed won his way to the creatures base he plunged winter kiss into one moving piece and a tentacle came swinging out of the mass and smashed into him tossing him back to bounce against the wall he lay in a broken heap where he landed only galens hand on my arm kept me from running to him look galen said where the sword still stood in the things flesh a white spot was growing when it was the size of a large table i realized it was frost and ice winter kiss was exactly that but the nameless struck at the blade and sent it spinning off behind itself the growing spot of cold remained but ceased to grow i looked for doyle and found him like a pool of blackness beside the turquoise of the water blood spread like a drowning puddle from underneath him he raised himself on one arm and the thing hit him casually knocking him into the water he vanished from sight without so much as his hand surfacing he just fell into the blue water and was gone galen jerked me around to face him hands grabbing my arms so hard that it hurt swear to me that you wont go within its reach galen he shook me swear to me swear it id never seen him so fierce and i knew he wouldnt let me go to help them and he wouldnt help them himself until id promised i swear it he drew me in and gave me a fierce almost bruising kiss then handed me to kitto stay with her keep her alive then he and nicca exchanged a look and drew their guns lucy and the officer did the same thing and they fanned out in a line and started shooting it was easy not to hit rhys there was so much monster to aim at they fired until their guns clicked empty the creature waded into them and lucy managed to dodge for the house but the older uniform was picked up by things that looked like giant taloned hands but were not quite that those huge claws ripped into him sending blood through the air in a bright arch of crimson the mans scream was sharp pain filled horror filled then came silence abrupt silence and i swear i could hear the sound of tearing cloth the thicker sound of tearing flesh the wet pop of bone as the thing ripped the dead man in half and flung him in our direction kitto flung himself on top of me and pressed me under his smaller bulk as the body parts flew overhead spraying blood so that it pattered his clothes like rain when i could raise my head enough to see the fight again nicca and galen had each drawn sword and dagger one for each hand they began to circle it each to one side but how do you circle something that has multiple eyes and multiple limbs i dont know if the other blades had hurt it badly enough that it didnt want to chance more or if it was simply tired of being pricked but it struck not with limbs but with magic nicca was suddenly covered in a white mist when the mist cleared he was motionless on the ground i didnt have time to see if he was still breathing because the nameless rushed galen who stood his ground no one had ever accused galen of cowardice i yelled his name but he never turned and i didnt want to distract him from the fight i just wanted to keep him safe i started struggling to get up off the ground and kitto finally stopped hindering and started helping me galen didnt have a magic weapon of any kind i had to do something i walked forward and kitto grabbed me back i tried to jerk free turning in my bare feet to order him to let me go but i slipped on the bloody ground falling butt first onto the slick grass my hands came away covered in blood fresh crimson blood like rain on the grass that hadnt soaked in yet my left palm began to itch then to burn it was the blood of the nameless and it was as poisonous as the rest of it i got to my feet trying to scrape the blood off my hand with my dress but it didnt help the burning had sunk into my hand my skin and it was flowing through my veins feeling as if all the blood in my body had turned to molten metal solid and burning hot as though my own blood was boiling its way out of my skin i shrieked in pain and kitto touched me tried to help he yelled and let go of me staggered back the front of his tshirt bloomed red fresh blood he clawed at his shirt raised enough for me to see the marks of my nails spilling blood everywhere worse so much worse than the original injury my cousin cel was prince of old blood he could call any injury to life no matter how ancient but it was only ever as bad as the original hurt this was something different doyle had told me once that i would have a second hand of power but there was no way of knowing when it would manifest or what it would be the pain in my own body was receding as kitto bled but i didnt want kitto to bleed i wanted the nameless to bleed if i had to touch the nameless for this new hand of power to work i was going to die but i was going to try with magic like youd try with a gun shoot from far away before youre forced to shoot up close and as long as you have the ammunition keep shooting i pointed my left hand toward the creature palm out and thought not the word blood but of blood i thought about the taste of it salty metallic the feel of it fresh and almost scalding hot in large doses the way it thickened when it cooled i thought of the smell of blood that neckruffling scent and the way enough of it freshly spilled always smelled like meat like raw hamburger i thought of blood and began to walk toward the nameless chapter id taken only a few steps when the pain returned my blood boiled in my veins and i stumbled to my knees hand still out toward the creature but i was betting that kitto had stopped bleeding i screamed and watched one huge eye swivel to look at me to truly look at me for the first time the pain clouded my vision and finally stole my voice my air i was suffocating on pain then it eased just a bit then a bit more when my vision cleared blood was trickling out of the wounds in the mountain of flesh trickling out not like blood should flow but like water faster thinner the last of my pain vanished as blood began to pour out of every wound the creature had sustained that day every bullet hole every blade mark burst scarlet the blood began to rain down the sides of the thing the nameless began to move toward me ponderous and unnerving like watching a mountain roll toward you i knew if it reached me it would kill me so i had to stop that from happening i thought not of blood alone but of wounds i thought not bleed but die i wanted it to die a wound opened like a new mouth slashing down its side then another and another it was as if some giant invisible blade was hacking at it the blood flowed faster until the nameless was covered in a slick red coat from top to bottom covered in a dress of its own blood then blood gushed out of it in a nearly black wave like a lake being dumped out upon the grass it spilled and flowed and billowed toward me until i knelt in a hot pool of blood and still it bled the more it bled the calmer i became a stillness filled my body almost a peacefulness i knelt in the growing spread of blood watching the thing quiver toward me and i had no fear i felt nothing was nothing but the magic in that one instant i lived breathed and was one spell the hand of blood rode me used me as surely as i had tried to use it with the old magicks who is master and who is slave is never sure the nameless rose above me like a great bloody mountain one curl of its body reaching out out toward me and only a few yards away i heard it take a breath a sharp sound almost a sound of fear then it exploded not its body but as if every last ounce of blood in that vast shape had burst forth at one time the air became blood and it was like trying to breathe underwater for a second i thought i would drown then i was choking in air and trying to spit out blood at the same time something large hit the side of my head and i fell to the bloody ground even in its death throes it had tried to take me with it kittos crimsonwashed face with a bloodsoaked sage on his shoulder was the last thing i saw before darkness swallowed the world chapter i woke to floating i was floating in midair and at first i thought it was a dream then i saw galen floating just out of reach i woke to find that all the fey in the yard were floating magic was everywhere streaming through the air like multicolored fireworks flying around us in flocks of fantastic birds that never knew mortal sky entire forests rose and fell before our eyes the dead rose and walked and faded it was like watching someone elses dreams and nightmares march through the bright california sunshine it was raw enchantment with no hand to contain it or order it about it was simply magic everywhere and that magic was spilling into rhys frost doyle kitto nicca even sage i watched a phantom tree float over niccas body and vanish inside him sage was covered by a flowering vine the dead men all went to rhys and marched into him while he screamed frost was hidden by what looked like snow he hit at it with his good arm but he couldnt stop it i caught a glimpse of doyle halfhidden behind something black and serpentine then the magic finally found galen and me as we hung there only a few feet from each other we were hit by scents and bursts of color i smelled roses and blood appeared on my wrist as if by the prick of thorns i think the others were regaining what theyd given up to the nameless but neither galen nor i had given anything to it i thought it would pass us by because of that but it turned out i was wrong wild magic had been freed and it wanted to be somewhere in someone again something white like a great bird rose from the bloody mess and came for me like it had a purpose galen yelled merry and the glowing shape smashed into me through me but not out the other side for an instant i saw the world through crystal and mist i smelled something burning then darkness again by the time galen and i were conscious again the others had bound the nameless into the soil into the water into the very air they had bound it as it was meant to be bound it couldnt be killed but it couldnt be allowed to heal and go free either maeve reed had graciously allowed us to use some of her plentiful estate as the burial place though that wasnt exactly what we did it was both buried on her land and not buried in any land it was trapped in a place betwixt and between maeve offered us permanent use of her guest house which was bigger than most peoples entire homes it solved the problem of a bigger apartment and kept us within reach in case taranis thought up some new way to attack maeve id always thought that andais was the crazy one but ive changed my mind taranis is willing to do anything to save himself anything thats not the way a good king thinks buccadhu is in unseelie protective custody weve had to tell andais everything we have a witness to what taranis did but thats not enough to overthrow a thousandyear reign it will be a political nightmare to tiptoe around but he cannot be allowed to remain in power taranis is still insisting i come for a visit to his court i dont think so rhys laid the hungry ghosts easily hes regained the powers that the nameless had taken from him and so have all the others but what does that mean it means that rhys talks to empty rooms but if they are empty why do voices answer him from the empty air frost can put a tracery of his namesake on my summer window a spread of icy lace he uses to draw pictures for me doyle can vanish in plain sight and none of us can find him i am assured he is not invisible but he might as well be nicca caused a tree to explode into blossom months off schedule just by leaning against it kitto talks to snakes now they slither out of the grass to greet him like youd greet a king it is positively unnerving how many snakes there are that you never see unless they wish you to see them sage has kept a single jasmine blossom alive and fragrant for two weeks with no water the flower just sits tucked behind his ear and shows no sign of fading as for galen and me touched by so much wild magic none of it our own we dont know yet doyle thinks the new powers will come a little at a time my second hand of power has well and truly come all i need is a small wound and i can call all the blood from a beings body i am princess of flesh and blood the hand of blood hasnt been seen as a power since the days of balor of the evil eye for those of you not up on preceltic history thats thousands of years before the birth of christ the queen is pleased with me she was in such a good mood that i got her to give me the men prince cel has his own private guard she has hers shouldnt i have mine andais agreed so everyone who comes my way is mine im keeping them all i promised frost that i would keep him safe that i would keep them all safe a princess should always keep her promises andais is sending more guards to help ensure my safety i asked to be allowed to choose who they will be but she wasnt that happy with me i asked that doyle be allowed to choose and she refused that as well i think the queen of air and darkness has her own agenda and she will send who she wishes i can do nothing about it but wait and see who shows up at my door there are gentle nights with my green knight galen mine at last my darkness is still as dangerous as he ever was but underneath i get glimpses of his pain and his resolution to better things for us all rhys has changed and is no longer my laughing lover nor does he wish to share me with nicca its as if with rhyss returned powers hes grown more serious more compelling there is simply more to him now more magic more desire more force nicca is still just nicca lovely gentle but not strong enough kitto too has grown and changed he is more i watch him grow into his power with something like awe then there is frost what can you say of love for love it is but i am still without a child i performed a fertility rite that brought life to another sidhes womb but my own remains empty why if i was truly infertile the spell would have failed but it did not i must be with child soon or none of the rest matters yule has come and gone and we have only two months left of cels imprisonment will he be insane when he is released will he throw all caution away and try to kill me best to be pregnant before cel gets out rhys has suggested we hire an assassin to slay cel the moment he gets free if it werent for the queens anger and grief i might almost agree almost i kneel at my altar and i pray i pray for guidance and i pray for luck good luck some people will wish someone luck but they dont say which kind always be careful when you pray because deity is listening and will usually give you what you ask for not what you meant to ask for goddess grant us good luck and a fertile winter
