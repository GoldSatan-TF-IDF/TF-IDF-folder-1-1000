anne perry death in the devils acre pc withers sneezed as the icy january wind howled up the alley off the thames it was still three hours before dawn and the gas lamps of the main streets barely lit this dismal passage on the very edge of the devils acre swarming with filth in the shadow of westminster itself he sneezed again the smell of the slaughterhouse fifty yards away was thick in his throat along with the stench of the drains old refuse and the grime of years past now that was funnythe yard gate was open shouldnt be rightlynot at this time of the morning not important probably some apprentice boy forgot to do his jobcareless some lads were but what meat there was would likely be safe in cold rooms still it was something to do in the long boredom of walking the gray pavements he crossed the alley to the cold rooms better just look inside see everything was in order he poked his head around it was silentjust one old drunk dossed down right in the middle better move him on for his own sake before the slaughtermen arrived and kicked him out apt to make a bit of sport of the old boys some of them were ere dad he said loudly as he bent down and shook the mans ample shoulder best be gone youve no business in ere although as why anyoned want to choose a place like this to kip i dunno the man did not move come on dad he shook him harder and lifted his lantern for a better look surely the poor old fellow was not frozen to death not that he would have been the first pc withers had seen by any meansand not all of them old either plenty of kids not more than a few years froze to death in a hard winter the light shone on the mans face yes poor old basket he was dead the eyes were open and glazed funny he said aloud them as freezes to death usually goes in their sleep this face had a startled look as though his death had taken him by surprise he moved the lantern farther down oh god almighty the crotch and thighs of the body were drenched in blood the brown woolen trousers had been slit open with a knife and the genital organs completely removed they were lying useless between the kneesbloody unrecognizable flesh a mass of scarlet pulp the sweat broke out on pc withers face and froze instantly he felt sick and his legs shook uncontrollably great god in heavenwhat sort of a creature would do that to a man he staggered backward and leaned against the wall lowering his head a little to overcome the nausea that engulfed him it was several moments before his head cleared enough so he could think what he must do call help that was certain and get away from here and from that abomination lying on the ground he straightened up made for the gate and closed it hard behind him glad for the slicing wind from the east even though it carried the raw iciness of the sea with it murder was hardly rare in the teeming slums of london in this year of our lord but this was an act of bestiality unlike anything he had seen before he must find another man to stand guard then he could report in and get his superiors to take charge thank heaven he was not senior enough to have to sort out this one two hours later inspector thomas pitt holding a lamp closed the slaughterhouse gate and stood in the yard he stared down at the corpse still lying exactly as the constable had found it in the gray morning light it looked grotesque pitt bent down and lifted the shoulder of the corpse to see if there was anything under ita weapon perhaps or further injury this dismemberment by itself would not account for his death and surely a man so appallingly violated would have made some attempt to protect himselfto staunch the fountain of blood the thought was sickening and he forced it out of his mind he ignored the cold sweat running on his skin soaking his shirt he looked down the body there was no blood on the dead mans hands none at all even the nails were clean which was extraordinary for anyone who frequented an area like this let alone slept in a slaughterhouse yard searching further he found a wide dark stain under the man matting the cloth of his jacket it was near the spine straight through the ribs to the heart he held the lamp higher for a closer look but there was no blood anywhere else on the stones he let out his breath and stood up unconsciously wiping his hands on the legs of his trousers now he could look at the face it was a heavyjowled broadnosed face the skin was faintly plumcolored the mouth marked with lines of humor the eyes small and roundthe face of a man who enjoyed good living the body was portly and of barely average height the hands were strong plump and immaculately clean the hair was graybrown the clothes were made of thick brown wool baggy in places from wear and wrinkled over the stomach there were a few crumbs caught in the folds of the waistcoat pitt picked one up crushed it experimentally in his fingers and sniffed it cheese stilton if he was not mistaken or something like it inhabitants of the devils acre did not dine on stilton there was a noise behind him a scuffle of feet he turned to see who it was glad of company morning pitt whatve you got this time it was meddows the police surgeon a man capable of insufferable good cheer at the most inopportune times but instead of seeming offensive his voice this time was like a sweet breath of sanity in a terrible nightmare oh my good god he stood beside pitt and stared down poor fellow he was stabbed in the back pitt said quickly indeed meddows cocked an eyebrow and looked at pitt sidewise well i suppose thats something he squatted down balanced his bullseye lamp at precisely the right angle and began to examine the body with care dont need to watch he remarked without turning his head ill tell you if theres anything interesting for a start this mutilation is a pretty rough jobjust took a sharp knife and sliced and there you are no skill pitt asked quietly as he stared over meddows head at the dawns light reflected in the slaughterhouse windows none at all just meddows sighed just the most godawful hate insane meddows pulled a face who knows catch him and then ill tell youmaybe anyway who is this poor devil do you know yet pitt had not even thought of searching the body it was the first thing he should have done without answering he bent down and began going through the mans pockets he found everything he would have expected except moneyand perhaps he had not really expected that there was a gold watch very scratched but still working and a key ring with four keys on it one of the keys appeared to be a safe key two were door keys and one was for a cupboard or drawer judging by its sizejust what any middleaged moderately prosperous man might have there were two handkerchiefs both grubby but of good egyptian cotton with finely rolled hems there were three receipted bills two for quite ordinary household expenses the third for a dozen bottles of a highly expensive burgundyapparently a man of selfindulgence at least as far as the table was concerned but what mattered was that his name and address were on the bills dr hubert pinchin lambert gardensa long way from the devils acre in social standing and every other aspect of the quality of life if not so very far as the london sparrow flies what was dr pinchin doing here in this slaughterhouse yard appallingly murdered and maimed well meddows asked pitt repeated the name and address meddows face creased into comic surprise how very unlikely he observed by the way he was probably unconscious and damn near dead by the time they did this to him he gestured toward the lower part of the body if thats any comfort i suppose you know about the other one other one what are you talking about other what meddows face tightened other corpse man the other one we found castrated like this dont say you didnt know about it pitt was stunned how could he have failed to hear of such a monstrosity some gambler or pimp meddows went on other side of the acrenot your station but as i said he was emasculated too poor sod though not as badly as this one it looks as if weve got some kind of maniac loose managed to keep the papers from making too much of the first one victim was the sort of man thats always getting knifedthey do in an occupation of that kind he stood up slowly his knees cracking but this ones different hed seen better times perhaps but he still ate well and id say at a guess that his shabbiness might be more of an eccentricity than a lack of means his suit is pretty worn but his linen is newand reasonably clean not had it on more than a day by the look of it pitt thought of the stilton cheese and the immaculate fingernails yes he said flatly he knew meddows was staring at him waiting all right i suppose if youve finished here wed better have him taken away do a proper autopsy and tell me anything elseif there is anything naturally now came the worst part once again pitt mentally debated whether he could delegate the task of informing the familythe widow if there was one and as always he could not escape the conviction that he must do it himself if he did not he would feel he had betrayed both the junior he sent and the bereaved he might have comforted he gave all the necessary orders to the men waiting outside the body must be removed the yard sealed off and searched for anything at all that might render a clue as to who had done this thing a search must be initiated for vagrants who had been in the area for lodgers who might have been returning home for idle prostitutes for someone who might have seen something meanwhile he would go to number lambert gardens and inform the householdat this hour probably just sitting down to breakfastthat their master had been murdered pitt was met at the door by an extremely competent butler good morning sir the man said politely pitt was a stranger to him and it was too early for a social call good morning pitt answered quietly i am from the police is this the residence of dr hubert pinchin yes sir but i am afraid dr pinchin is not at home at the moment i can recommend another doctor to you if your need is urgent i dont require a doctor im sorry i have bad news for you dr pinchin is dead oh dear the butlers face tightened but his composure remained perfect he moved back a step allowing pitt to enter you had better come in sir would you be good enough to tell me what happened it might be easier if i were to break the news to mrs pinchin i am sure you would be most tactful but he delicately left the obvious in the air yes pitt said with a relief that struck a spark of guilt in him yes of course how did it happen sir he was attacked stabbed in the back i think he probably knew very little pain im sorry the butler stared at him in a moment of immobility then he swallowed murdered yes im sorry pitt repeated is there someone who can identify the bodyperhaps someone other than mrs pinchin it will be distressing should he mention the mutilation now the butler had regained his selfpossession he was in command of himself and of the household yes sir i will inform mrs pinchin of dr pinchins death she has an excellent maid who will care for her there is another doctor in the neighborhood who will attend her the footman peters has been with us for twelve years he will go and identify the body he hesitated i suppose there is no doubt dr pinchin was a little less than my height sir very well built cleanshaven and of a rich complexion he let the vague hope hang in the air but it was pointless yes pitt answered did dr pinchin have a suit of rough brown tweed i should judge of some years wear yes sir that is what he was wearing when he left home yesterday then i am afraid there can be little doubt but perhaps your footman should make sure before you say anything to mrs pinchin yes sir naturally pitt gave him the address of the mortuary and then advised him of the nature of the other wounds and that the newspapers would inevitably make much of it it would be a kindness to keep the reporters out of the house for as long as possible until some other event superseded the murder in the public eye pitt left without meeting the widow at all she had not risen from her bed and only in his imagination did he see her shock followed by disbelief slow acceptance and finally the beginning of overwhelming pain he must of course go to see the officer dealing with the other murder that appeared to be so similar the two crimes may or may not be connected but to ignore the possibility would be absurd perhaps he would even find himself relieved of the case he would not mind in the least he felt no sense of proprietorship as he had in some cases whoever had committed this crime had entered a realm far outside the ordinary world of offense and punishment as he trod on against the squally wind fluttering rubbish off the pavements he reflected that he would not mind in the least if they took this one away from him he crossed the road just before a hansom cab clopped past a boy who was sweeping a clear path from the horse droppings stopped and rested on his broom his small hands were chapped red and his fingers jutted out of the ends of his gloves a brougham swished by and splattered them both with a mixture of mud and manure the boy grinned to see pitts irritation oughterve walked on me parf mister he said cheerfully then yerd not get yerself mucked pitt handed him a farthing and agreed with him wryly at the police station he was greeted with an unexpected warmth inspector pitt yes sir i suppose as youve come about our murder sirit being the same as your one this morning like pitt was taken aback how did this young constable know about hubert pinchin his face must have reflected his thoughts as it often did because the constable answered the question before pitt asked it its in the afternoon extras sir screaming about it they are downright orrible course i know they write up things something chronic adding bits to shock people into ysterics but all the same i doubt they added anything to this one pitt replied dryly he unwound his muffler and took off his hat his coat flapped loose one side longer than the other he must have done it up on the wrong buttons again may i speak to whoever is in charge of your murder if hes in yes sir thatll be inspector parkins i reckon as ell be real glad to see you pitt doubted it but he followed the constable willingly enough into a warm dark office that smelled of old paper and wax polish it was larger than his own and there was a photograph of a woman and four children on the desk parkins was a dark dapper man he sat dismally looking at a sheaf of papers in his hand the constable introduced pitt with a flourish parkins face lost its lugubrious expression immediately come in he said heartily come insit down here move those filesmake yourself comfortable man yes disgusting affair you want to know all about it found him in the gutter dead as mutton quite coldof course no wonder weather weve been having filthy and itll get worse hed been stabbed in the back poor devillong sharp blade probably kitchen knife or something like it he paused for breath and pulled a face running his hands through his sparse hair man was a procurercorpse found by a local prostitute at any other time i would have said that was not inappropriate i suppose youll want to take the case now since its almost certainly connected with yours he made it a statement pitt was startled no he said involuntarily i thought you not at all parkins waved his arms as if declining some favor not at all senior officer much more experience than i have admired you for the way you handled that bluegate fields business he saw pitts surprised expression oh we get to hear the odd thing you know friends a word here word there he held up a finger and waved it in some vague gesture of understanding pitt was surprised and flattered he was vulnerable enough to like having his courage admiredit was a singularly warming feeling and he had been afraid during the bluegate fields investigation he had risked more than he could afford to lose our fellow was only a pimp parkins went on better off without himnot that itll make any difference of course soon as hes gone someone elsell step into his placeprobably have already like taking a bucket of water out of the river tide comes and goes just the samecant see where its been no not at all your fellow was a doctor decent chap you better have all the papers weve gotautopsy report and so on and i suppose youll want to see the body you still have it pitt asked oh yesonly a week ago you know weather like this cold enough to keep bodies for ages yes youd better see it never know might be able to tell if its the same maniac pitt followed him silently to the mortuary parkins opened the door and had a quiet word with the attendant then conducted pitt inside the room was chilly and dry with a faint musty smell like old medicine parkins went to one of the white sheetcovered tables and pulled the cloth off entirely showing not only the face but the whole naked body it was a curiously indecent gesture even toward the dead pitts instinct was to seize the sheet and cover the lower part again but he knew it was ridiculous after all that was what he had come to see but the wound was not identical this was a messy and extremely inexpert castration the glands had been removed and the organ all but severed all right pitt swallowed his throat rough parkins replaced the sheet and looked at pitt his mouth twisted with wry sad humor nasty isnt it he said quietly makes you feel sick dont suppose you know him by any chance not likely but you can never tell he turned the sheet back at the top pitt had not even looked at the face now he did so and instantly felt a prickling sense of shock he had seen those dark surly features before the heavy eyelids and curling sensuous mouth at least he was almost sure he had who is he he asked max used two or three different surnames bracknall rawlins dunmow kept more than one establishment very enterprising fellow why do you know him i think so pitt replied slowly at least he looks like someone i dealt with a few years agomurders in callander square callander square parkins was surprised hardly the area for a creature of this sort are you sure no im not sure he was a footman his name was max burton thenif it is the same man parkins voice lifted with curiosity cant you find out it could be important then his tone fell again and he smiled bleakly at himself although i hardly suppose so hes changed his style of living more than somewhat since then i expect i can pitt said thoughtfully shouldnt be too hard oh where was the wound that caused his death here parkins replied as if he too had momentarily forgotten it stab in the back about so he indicated on pitts body a place close to the spine an inch or two to the left it was lower than the wound in pinchins back but only by a fraction and on the same side but then max had been taller than pinchin what kind of weapon how long how broad about eight inches long and an inch and a half broad at the hilt could have been a kitchen knife everybody has one ordinary enough sorry parkins raised one eyebrow understanding perfectly same as yours is it pitt disliked the reference to pinchin as his but he knew what parkins meant yes he conceded almost exactly he was compelled to add only in todays case the mans entire genital organs were slashed away and placed between his knees parkins face tightened catch him he said quietly catch this bastard mr pitt pitt had not been back to callander square since the murders three years ago he wondered if the balantynes still lived there he stood in the bitter afternoon under the bare trees the bark was wet with rain gathering on the wind it would be dark early he was only twenty feet away from the place where the bodies had been found that had first brought him here to question the residents of these elegant georgian houses with their tall windows and immaculate facades these were people with footmen to answer doors parlormaids to receive and butlers to keep their pantries guard their cellar keys and rule with rods of iron their own domains behind the green baize doors he pulled his collar up higher set his hat a trifle rakishly on his head and plunged his hands into his pockets which already bulged with odd bits of string coins a knife three keys two handkerchiefs a piece of sealing wax and innumerable scraps of paper he refused to go to the tradesmens entrance as he knew would be expected of him but instead presented himself at the front door like any other caller the footman received him coldly good afternoon sir the hesitation was slight but sufficient to imply that the title was a courtesy and in his opinion one not warranted good afternoon pitt replied with complete composure my name is thomas pitt i would like to see general balantyne on a matter of business that is most urgent otherwise i would not have called without first making sure it was convenient the footmans face twitched but he had been forestalled in the argument he had prepared general balantyne does not receive callers merely because they happen by mr pitt he said even more coldly he looked pitt up and down with an expert eye obviously dressed like that he was not a person of quality in spite of his speech such clothes were surely the product of no tailor and as for a valetany valet worthy of his calling would cut his own throat rather than let his master appear in public in such total disarray that waistcoat should not have been matched with that shirt the jacket was a disaster and the cravat had been tied by a blind man with two left hands i am sorry he repeated now quite sure of his ground general balantyne does not receive callers without appointmentunless of course they are already of his social acquaintance perhaps if you were to write to him or get someone else to do it for you the suggestion that he was illiterate was the final straw i am acquainted with general balantyne pitt snapped and it is police business if you prefer to discuss it on the doorstep i shall oblige you but i imagine the general would rather have it pursued inside considerably more discreetdont you think the footman was startled and he allowed it to show to have police at the houseand at the front of itwas appalling damn the mans impertinence he composed his face but was annoyed that pitt was taller than he by some inches so even with the advantage of the step he could not adequately look down on him if you have some problem of theft or the like he replied you had better go round to the tradesmens entrance no doubt the butler will see youif it is really necessary it is not a matter of theft pitt said icily it is a matter of murder and it is general balantyne i require to speak to not the butler i cannot imagine he will be best pleased if you oblige me to come back with a warrant the footman knew when he was beaten he retreated if you will come this way he refused to add the sir perhaps if you wait in the morning room the general will see you when he is able he walked smartly across the hall and opened the door of a large room whose grate held the embers of a fire that took the chill from the air but was not hot enough to thaw pitts hands or warm his body through his clothes the footman looked at the ashes and smirked with satisfaction he turned and went out closing the polished wooden door with a click he had not offered to take pitts hat or coat five minutes later he was back his face pinched with anger he took pitts outer clothes and ordered him to follow the parlormaid to the library in that room a fire was blazing reflecting bright scarlet in the leather bindings of books and glinting off the polished trophies on the far wall the general stood behind a great desk littered with inkstands pens paperweights open books and a miniature field cannon in brassa perfect replica of a crimean gun he had not changed outwardly since pitt saw him last the same broad stiff shoulders the proud face the light brown hair perhaps graying a little although pitt was not sure it was a face dominated by strength of bone and the coloring was incidental well mr pitt he said formally he was a man who did not know how to be casual all his life had been spent observing rules even in the face of terror or extremity of pain as a boy soldier he had stood appalled on the ridge above balaclava and seen the charge of the light brigade the carnage of the crimea was indelible in his memory he knew the men of the thin red line who had held against all the might hurled at them by the russian army men who had kept their ground in face of the impossible hundreds had fallen but not a man had broken ranks my footman says you wish to speak to me about a murder is that correct pitt found himself standing a little straighternot quite to attention but definitely with his feet together and his head up yes sir a week ago there was an extremely unpleasant murder in an area known as the devils acre hard by westminster i know where it is the general frowned but surely that was this morning im afraid there was a second one this morning the first did not make much of a mark in the newspapers however i was called in for this one today and when i heard of the earlier one naturally i went to see the body naturally the generals frown deepened what is it you wish of me now that it came to the point pitt felt rather embarrassed at having to ask this man to come and look at the corpse of a dead procurer of whores what did it matter if it was or was not the man who had been his footman at the time of the callander square murders it could make no real difference now he cleared his throat there was no avoiding it i think the man may be someone you knew the generals eyebrows rose in amazement someone i knew yes sir i think so pitt explained as briefly as he could the circumstances of pinchins death and what inspector parkins had shown him at the mortuary very well the general said reluctantly and reached for the bell cord to summon the carriage the door opened and instead of the footman one of the most striking women pitt could recall ever having set eyes on came in lady augusta balantyne her face was as fine as bone china but without any of porcelains fragility her clothes were magnificent in the subdued taste of those who have always had money and therefore never felt the compulsion to display it garishly she stared at pitt with distaste her very posture appeared to demand an explanation not only for his presence in her house but for his very existence pitt refused to be intimidated good afternoon lady augusta he said with a slight bow i hope i find you well i am always well thank you mr she could not have forgotten their past meetings the subject was too bizarre too painful mr pitt she arched her eyebrows very slightly and her eyes were glacial beneath them to what unfortunate occurrence do we owe your visit this time a matter of identification maam he answered smoothly he felt the general relax even though he could barely see him at the edge of his vision a man general balantyne may be able to name for us and if so that might assist us greatly good graciouscan the man not name himself people do not always tell the truth maam he said dryly she colored at her own clumsiness for not having seen the obvious and in this case i understand he is dead anyway the general added tartly it is nothing for you to concern yourself with my dear it is my duty to be of assistance if i can i dare say i shall not be long have you forgotten we are dining with sir harry and lady lisburne tonight she ignored pitt as if he had been one of the servants i do not intend to arrive late i will not be thought illmannered whatever you may imagine your duty to be the man is in a mortuary not half an hour away the generals face flickered with irritation he disliked dinner parties and with harry lisburne as host this one was likely to be more tedious than ever i have only to look at him and say whether i know him or not i shall be back before dark she blew down her nose with a little sigh and went out without looking at pitt again general balantyne walked into the hall collected his coat from the waiting butler and accompanied pitt out into the rain just as the coachman drove around from the mews and stopped at the curbside for them they rode in silence pitt did not want to prejudice the identification by discussing the case beforehand and he felt no compulsion to make small talk of other things the carriage stopped a short distance from the mortuary and pitt and the general alighted and walked up the path still silent inside the duty attendant appeared startled to see a gentleman of balantynes obvious quality but he recognized pitt and conducted them to the body without hesitation there you are sir he whipped back the sheet with the air of a conjurer producing a rabbit like pitt before him the generals eyes went straight to the mutilation not even glancing at the face he took a deep breath and let it out he had seen death before a great deal of death almost all of it by the violence of war or the ravages of disease what made this uniquely appalling to him was that it had happened deliberately here at home in the streets of london the inexpert dismemberment was not the accident of random cannonfire but looked to be the result of a passionate and individual hatred for one man in particular what man the general looked up at the face pitt watching him carefully saw the start of recognition general he lifted his voice only a little balantyne looked up slowly pitt could not read the emotions in his eyes balantyne was an exceedingly private man unused to the comforts of fellow sympathy pitt could never really understand him their backgrounds were worlds apart balantyne was the last of generations of soldiers who had served monarch and country with unquestioning sacrifice in every foreign war since the days of agincourt whereas pitt was the son of a country gamekeeper convicted unjustly of some petty offense pitt had grown up on the estate of his master and been educated to his excellent almost beautiful diction to provide companionship to the son of the house and to encourage the boy in his studies pitts hunger had been a challenge and not infrequently a reproach to spur the boy out of indolence yet he liked balantyne even admired him he was a man who lived as strictly by the code he believed in as had any ancient knight or monk do you know him he prompted although the question was now no more than academic the answer was in the generals face of course balantyne replied quietly it is max burton who used to be my footman gracie came rushing into the parlor with the early editions of the afternoon newspapers her face was suffused with color her eyes as round as gooseberries oh maam theres been an orrible murdermost terrible in londons istory o crime it says ere doins asd make a strong man go white to is knees indeed charlotte did not stop her sewing newspapers always dealt in hyperbolewho stops in a january street to buy a paper that tells of the ordinary gracie was horrified at her indifference no maami really means it it was dreadful e was all acked to pieces in a place as wot a lady wouldnt even know of leastways not as shed put words to and still call erself a lady the papers is right maam theres a terrible maniac loose in the devils acreand maybe them preachers is right and the last days is come and its satan isself gracies face went pale as the apparition formed in her mind nonsense charlotte said sharply she could see that if she was not careful she would have a case of hysterics on her hands here give me the papers and go and get on with the vegetables or we shall have no dinner if the master comes home out of this weather and there is nothing hot for him he will be most displeased it was an idle threat gracie held pitt in immense respect he was the master after all and beyond that he was a policeman and therefore represented the law and then there were the fascinating and dangerous things he must know shocking things worse than in the papers but she was not in the least afraid of him he was not the sort of person to put a servant out on the street for one neglected meal and she knew it its orrible maam she repeated wagging her head to prove she had been right from the beginning do you want as i should use that cabbage tonight or the turnips both charlotte replied absently already absorbed in the newspapers herself gracie accepted the dismissal and went back to the kitchen turning the mornings events over in her mind it was a source of great satisfaction to her that she worked for a ladya real ladynot one of your jumpedup social climbers as fancied theirselves better than they was but one as was born into the quality and grew up in a house with real servants a staff a butler as had a pantry of his own and a separate cook and kitchenmaids and parlormaids and upstairs maids and the likeand footmen none of gracies sisters or friends had a mistress like that gracie enjoyed considerable distinction because of it and was able to tell other girls what was what and how things should be done proper of course charlotte had come down in the world a bit since then a policeman was not a gentlemaneveryone knew that but still there were times when it was very exciting the tales she could tellif she chose but of course such things were far better hinted at than recounted in detail she had her loyalties and to tell the truth she did not entirely approve of the way her mistress sometimes got herself involved in police goingson more than once she had actually had some facetoface contact with people as had done murders looking for people like that even if they turned out to be from the quality was no thing for a lady to do gracie shook her head and tipped the turnips out into the sink and began to wash and peel them unless she was very mistaken in her judgment her mistress was shaping up nicely to start meddling into something again she had that restless look about her fiddling with things and putting them down half done writing letters to her sister emily as was now viscountess ashworth married above herself that one not that she wasnt very nice the few times that gracie had seen her more often charlotte went to visit her at her grand house in paragon walk and who could blame her for that gracie drifted into a pleasant dream of what a viscountesss house might be like no doubt she would have beautiful footmen all tall and handsome and wearing livery too a man did look good in livery no matter what anyone said in the evening when pitt came home charlotte was waiting for him she had read the newspapers thoroughly because the appalling corpse had been discovered in pitts area she knew it was quite likely that the call he had received before dawn that morning had to do with the murder of course the case was not one in which she would be able to give any help unfortunately she was ready for the challenge even the danger of another investigation but the man had been found in a location she knew nothing whatsoever about except by repute and lambert gardens where apparently he had lived was not part of her familys social circle so she could offer no assistance there either still perhaps if he was prepared to discuss it with her she could at least use her wits she had not been unskilled at divining motives in the past and the nature of human beings had much in common whatever the circumstances she hurried to meet her husband as soon as she heard the front door close even before gracie could get there she took his coat hung it up to dry and then turned immediately to kiss him his face felt cold she knew he must be tired it was over twelve hours since he had left without breakfast her senses told her to restrain her curiosity at least until he had finished supper she led the way into the parlor and talked about nothing of consequence while pitt thawed out in front of the fire until gracie served the meal by nine oclock she considered that tact had been paid more than its due the constable who came for you this morning she began was that because of the corpse in the devils acre a trace of bleak humor flickered across his face when charlotte tried being subtle with him he usually saw through it so she had abandoned the effort anyhow she had not had time to prepare and approach the whole subject in a more devious fashion yes he said guardedly but lambert gardens which is where he lived is not your familys social circle there is nothing you can do to help she was not tactically inept no of course not she said but it is impossible not to be interested the newspapers are full of it this evening he pulled a face she changed her line of attack do be careful thomas it sounds as if there is some dreadful madman loose i mean it isnt a sane sort of crime is it what do you suppose a man like dr pinchin was doing in the devils acre anyway did he have a practice there the newspapers said he was a very respectable man she was not entirely convinced she had known plenty of respectable people herself all the adjective really meant was that they were either clever enough or fortunate enough to have maintained an excellent facade behind it there might be anything at all pitt smiled his eyes uncomfortably clear thank you my dear but you have no need to be anxious for me i dont expect to prowl the acre alone i shall be in no danger from madmen she debated whether to be hurt and pretend he had misunderstood her but decided rapidly that it would not work of course not she said perhaps i was being silly i dare say dr pinchin was not nearly as respectable as the newspapers suggested after all they would have to be very careful of what they said and the poor man is only just dead she looked up wideeyed and totally candid did he have a family charlotte yes thomas he let out his breath in a sigh this is not a case you can involve yourself in dr pinchin was not the only victimhe was the second that we know of and whatever is going on it has its cause in the devils acre the other body was found there too it is not a domestic crime charlotte it does not involve the sort of motives you are good at she ignored the compliment another one i didnt know that the newspapers didnt say anything are you keeping it secret who was it there was a momentary flash of irritation in his face charlotte was not sure whether it was directed at her or at circumstances pitt waited several seconds before he answered and when he did there was resignation in his voice actually it was someone you have already met shock tingled through her not unmixed with a sense of excitement that she was ashamed of the instant after she felt it ive met she repeated incredulously do you remember general balantynein callander square the excitement turned to horror so intense it almost made her sick the room swam and she thought she was going to faint to imagine the general with his fierce inarticulate pride his loneliness his veneration of dutyhow could he have descended to the devils acre to die not in service or battle but exposed in such a horrible manner charlotte surely there must be some way it could be kept quiet it was the last way on earth such a man deserved to die charlotte pitts voice cut through her thoughts she looked up it wasnt balantyne he said sharply it was his old footman maxdo you remember max of course how could she have been so ridiculous she took a deep gulp of air maxyes of course i remember max perfectly odious he always gave me the feeling that when he looked at me he could see through my clothes pitts face dropped in alarm then changed to a wideeyed amusement how graphic i had no idea you were so perceptive she felt herself coloring she had not meant to let him know she understood that look so well especially in the eyes of a footman she ought not have well she attempted an explanation and gave it up he waited but charlotte refused to dig herself in any more deeply what was max doing in the devils acre she asked i didnt think people in that sort of area had footmen they dont he was keeping a brothelin fact more than one she maintained her composure over the years charlotte had had cause one way or another to learn quite a lot about poverty and the prostitution of both adults and children oh she remembered maxs dark face with its hooded eyelids and heavy sensuous mouth he had always given her an acute consciousness of physical power of an appetite that was his servant as well as his master i should imagine he would do that sort of thing rather well pitt looked at her with surprise i mean she started then changed her mind why should she explain she may not know as much as he did but she was not a total innocent in that case he must have had rather a lot of enemies she continued reasonably if he had several establishments then he was doing very welland i imagine in that sort of trade people are not very scrupulous about how they dispose of competition not very he agreed with an expression that showed such a mixture of feelings she found it quite unreadable perhaps dr pinchin kept a brothel as well she suggested sometimes very respectable people own property in places like that you know yes i do know he said dryly she caught his glance of course you know im sorry theres nothing you can do in this case charlotte it isnt your world no of course not she said obediently at this point it would not be to her advantage to pursue the matter because she could think of no argument to put forward i dont really know anything about the devils acre nevertheless the following morning as soon as pitt was out of the house charlotte began making arrangements to be absent for most of the day gracie who far preferred to look after children than blacken the stove polish the passage floor or scrub the doorstep greeted charlottes instructions with enthusiasmand a tacit promise of silence she knew a conspiracy when she met it even if she did not entirely approve a ladys curiosity ought to be restricted to other peoples romances who was wearing what and how much it costand even then she should always keep her dignity if a gentleman was murdered that was one thingbut not a doctor who practiced in the devils acre and was obviously no better than he should be grade had heard about places like thatand people charlotte had said she was going to see her sister emily but gracie had her own ideas of what that was for she knew perfectly well that lady ashworth was not above a good deal of meddling in shocking affairs herself yes maam she bobbed a neat curtsy i ope as youll ave a nice day maam an come ome safe of course ill come home safely charlotte switched her skirt past a chair and accepted her coat from gracies outstretched hands im only going to paragon walk yes maam im sure charlotte gave her a sidewise look but apparently considered she had already said enough about discretion anything more might only make grades suspicions worse what shall i say to the master maam gracie asked nothing i shall be home long before then in fact if lady ashworth has an engagement i may even be home by luncheon and with that she swept out the door down the front step and went briskly toward the corner where the public omnibus stopped paragon walk was classically elegant in the winter sun charlotte walked smartly along the footpath and up the smooth carriageway to emilys front door the footman opened it before she had reached up for the bellpull naturally in a wellordered house the pantry would look out onto the drive and guests would be anticipated good morning mrs pitt he said courteously good morning albert she replied with satisfaction accepting his tacit invitation and stepping inside it was a very comfortable feeling to be recognized so easily it gave her the temporary illusion of belonging to this world again lady ashworth is writing letters he said almost conversationally as he walked ahead of her across the large hall on its walls were the ashworth family portraits stretching back to the days of ruffled collars and elizabethan pantaloons with gorgeous slashes of color but i am sure she will be pleased to see you charlotte knowing how emily disliked letterwriting was also sure and she would be even more pleased when she heard charlottes extraordinary piece of news the footman opened the morningroom door mrs pitt mlady he said emily stood up pushing her pen and papers away before charlotte was even through the door she was not quite as tall as charlotte and had fairer hair that turned to curls with a softness charlotte had envied all her life she came forward and hugged charlotte impulsively her face alight with pleasure how delightful of you to come im bored to pieces with letters they are all to georges cousins and i cant bear any of them really you know the young girls out this season seem to be even sillier than last year and heaven knows they were lightwitted enough i refuse to think what next year will be like how are you she stood back and surveyed charlotte critically you look far too healthy to be in the least fashionable you should appear delicate like a lily not some great bursting rose that is the thing these days and dont you know that it is vulgar to look so excited whatever has happened if you dont tell me i shall a suitable chastisement eluded her she went over to the comfortable chair in front of the fire and curled up in it charlotte joined her on the sofa opposite feeling warm comfortable and smug do you remember the murders in callander square she began emily sat up a little straighter her eyes bright dont be idiotic whoever forgets a murder why has there been another do you remember that dreadful footman max vaguely why charlotte for goodness sake stop being so obscure what on earth are you talking about did you read of the murder of dr hubert pinchin in the newspapers yesterday or this morning no of course not emily was on the edge of her seat now her back ramrod stiff you know george doesnt give me anything but the society pages who is hubert pinchin and what has it to do with that unpleasant footman really you can be extremely irritating charlotte settled more deeply into the cushions and recounted everything she knew emily clenched her hands crushing the shellpink silk of her dress oh dearhow very disgusting but i never liked that man she added frankly he left the balantynes didnt hebefore the end of that affair anyway yes it seems he became very successful as a procurer of women emily winced then perhaps it was rather suitable that he was found in a gutter and by a prostitute do you suppose god has a sense of humor or would that be blasphemous he created man charlotte answered he must at the very least have a pronounced sense of the absurd the newspapers say that dr pinchin was perfectly respectable then what was he doing in the devils acre did he take charity cases or something of the sort i dont know i expect thomas will find out well any man of quality who wanted to pick up a loose woman for the evening would go to a music hall or the haymarket he wouldnt go to some dangerous slum like the devils acre charlotte felt a little crushed the mystery was fast dissolving in front of her perhaps the women in the haymarket were too expensive if max kept a brothel there must be customers in the devils acre if dr pinchin was one of them why kill him emily interrupted with an irritating display of reason nobody but an idiot kills his own customers maybe his wife did emily raised her eyebrows in the devils acre not personally stupid she may have hired someone you would have to hate a person very much and in a particular sort of way to do that to him emilys face lost its spark of amusement of course you would but my dear all sorts of men use loose women from time to time and as long as they do it discreetly a wife with any sense at all does not inquire into it if a man does not offer explanations of where he has been for the sake of ones own happiness it is wiser not to press for them charlotte could think of no reply that was not either painful or naive people must deal with their own truths as they were able emilys mind was on a different train fancy that dreadful footman turning up again he always made me uncomfortable i wonder who provided the money for him to set up a brothel i mean who owned the property and paid for an establishment perhaps it was dr pinchin but a far uglier thought forced itself into charlottes mind linked with memories of the balantyne house murder and fear in the past and maxs sudden silent departure yes she agreed abruptly yes that may very well be so i dare say thomas will discover that emily gave her a narrow look a flicker of suspicion but she did not pursue it will you stay for luncheon as charlotte was preparing for her visit with emily pitt alighted from his cab and walked up to the front door of number lambert gardens it was a high house with a handsome frontage though today of course the curtains were drawn and there was black crepe on the windows and a wreath on the door the whole effect was one of a curious blindness there was no point in putting it off he lifted his hand and knocked on the door it was several minutes before an unhappylooking footman opened it death in the house made him awkward he had no idea how much grief he was expected to show especially in these grotesque circumstances maybe he ought to pretend to ignore it after all what could he possibly say the kitchenmaid had already given notice and he was considering doing the same he did not recognize pitt mrs pinchin is not receiving callers he said hastily but if you care to leave your card i am sure she will accept your condolences i am thomas pitt from the police pitt explained i do convey my sympathy to mrs pinchin of course but i am afraid it is necessary that i also speak with her the footman was painfully undecided about which of his duties was paramount on the one hand preserving the sanctity of mourning from such a crass invasion by a person of this sort or on the other hand his undoubted allegiance to the majesty of the law perhaps if you call the butler pitt suggested tactfully and permit me not to wait upon the step while you do so we do not wish to attract the attention and the gossip of the neighbors maids and bootboys the footmans face was almost comical with relief it was the perfect solution gossip would be inevitable but he had no intention of being blamed for adding to it ohyes siryesill do that if you come this way sir he led pitt across the hall which was filled with a faint odor as if none of the doors had been opened for days the mirrors were blackdraped like the windows there was an arrangement of lilies in a pedestal vase they looked artificial though they were in fact real and undoubtedly extremely expensive at this time of year the footman left pitt in a room with a blackleaded grate and no fire it was dark behind the drawn blinds and it seemed as if the whole household were determined that even if the corpse of the master could not lie in his own home they would order their domestic arrangements to imitate the chill of the grave it was only a few moments before mr mullen the butler arrived his thinning sandy hair brushed neatly back and his face determined i am sorry mr pitt he shook his head im afraid it will be another half hour before mrs pinchin is able to receive you perhaps you would like a dish of tea while you wait it is a very inclement day pitt felt warmer already he had respect for this man he knew his job and seemed to perform it with more than ordinary skill i would indeed mr mullen thank you and if your duties permit perhaps a little of your time certainly sir mullen pulled the bell rope and when the footman answered requested that a pot of tea be brought with two cups he would not have presumed to take refreshment with a gentleman caller and a tradesman would have been sent through the green baize door to the kitchen but he considered pitt to be roughly his social equal which pitt realized was something of a compliment a butler was in many senses the real master of a household and might rule a staff of a dozen or more lesser servants he might also have greater intelligence than the owner and certainly inspire more awe from his fellows have you been with dr pinchin long mr mullen pitt began conversationally eleven years mr pitt mullen replied before that i was with lord and lady fullerton in tavistock square pitt was curious about why he had left an apparently superior employment but was unsure how to ask him without giving offense such a question as well as being against his regard for the man would be professionally foolish at this point mullen supplied the answer of his own accord perhaps he wished to clear himself from suspicion of incompetence they took the habit of going to devon every winter a shadow of distaste crossed his face i did not care for the travel and i have no wish to remain idle in an empty town house with a caretaking staff for several months of each year indeed pitt agreed with some sympathy an estate in the home counties would be an entirely different thing with hunt balls shooting parties and guests for christmas no doubt but a retreat to the silence of devon would be a form of exile and i should imagine dr pinchin was not an uninteresting employer he said trying to probe a little deeper mullen smiled politely he was far too honorable to repeat the vast and intimate knowledge he had acquired of the pinchin household butlers who betrayed that trust were in his opinion contemptible and a disgrace to their entire profession he misunderstood deliberately and both of them knew it yes sir although not a great deal of his practice was conducted from this house he has offices in highgate but we have had some distinguished gentlemen here to dine from time to time oh mullen repeated the names of several surgeons and physicians of eminence pitt made a mental note of their names to call upon later for whatever they might add to his picture of hubert pinchin although he knew from past experience that all professionals seem to defend their colleagues even to the point of ridiculousness however there was always the hope of stumbling upon some personal or professional jealousy that might loosen a tongue he learned from mullen a little more about pinchins habits particularly that he quite frequently returned home very late in the evening it was not unknown that he should be out all night no explanation was offered other than the discreet supposition that illness does not confine itself to convenient hours a few moments later the ladys maid knocked on the door her mistress was ready to speak to mr pitt if he would care to come to the breakfast room valeria pinchin was a woman of wagnerian stature broadbosomed blueeyed with a sweep of fading hair above her wide forehead she was dressed in unrelieved black as became a new widow in the deepest mourning not only for the untimely death of her husband but the appalling notoriety of its nature her face was pale and set in grim and defensive determination she looked at pitt warily good morning maam he began with suitable reverence for the occasion and some genuine pity may i offer my sympathy in your bereavement thank you she replied with a very slight sniff and a lift of her powerful chin you may sit down mrer pitt he took the chair opposite her across the table she sipped at tea without offering him any after all he was an extremely distasteful necessity part of the trappings of the sordid disaster that had overtaken herlike the ratcatcher or the drainman there was no need to treat him as a social equal im sorry maam he began again but i am obliged to ask you a number of questions i can be of no help to you whatsoever she stared at him bridling at even the suggestion you cannot imagine i know anything of such an unspeakable she stopped unable to find a word extreme enough of course not she was not a woman pitt found it easy to like he had to force to his mind some of the other shocked people he had spoken with their various ways of protecting their wounds mrs pinchin was slightly mollified but still her eyes glittered at him and her blackbeaded bosom rose and fell with indignation you can help me to learn a great deal more about your husband he said trying again and therefore whoever might have believed him an enemy he wanted to be as courteous as possible but ultimately the facts must be pursued to their logical end hubert pinchin had been murdered someone had believed he had reason a simple robber does not emasculate his victims she started to say something then changed her mind and took another sip of tea pitt waited my husband was she was obviously finding it difficult to express her thoughts without betraying a part of her life that was far too privateand too painfulto be acknowledged let alone paraded before thispoliceman he was an eccentric man mr pitt she said he chose to practice medicine among some very peculiar people i hesitate to say unworthy she sniffed i do not wish to be hard upon the unfortunate but he could have had an outstanding career you know my fatherher chin jutted forwarddr albert walkersmith no doubt you have heard of him pitt had not but he lied a very famous man maam he agreed her face softened a little and pitt feared for a moment that he would be called on to make some relevant comment he had not the faintest idea who albert walkersmith had been except that obviously he was the man mrs pinchin wished her husband could have lived up to you said dr pinchin was eccentric maam pitt said was that true in any way other than not pursuing his career to its best advantage she crumpled a napkin in her large hands i am not sure what you mean mr pitt he had no unfortunate habitsif that is what you imply all the halfguessedat aberrations of masculinity practices her womans ignorance conjured from the darkness of imagination hovered behind her words pitt looked at her hopelessly she was so armored in dignity and so conscious of the formalities of grief that he knew he would accomplish nothing with these predictable questions her mind was running in channels as entrenched as those of an old river falling to a longpredestined sea did he like stilton cheese he asked instead her thin eyebrows rose and her voice was hard i beg your pardon he repeated the question yes he did but i find that offensively trivial mr pitt some insane creature has attacked and murdered my husband in the mosttears filled her eyes and she swallowedthe most unspeakable manner and you sit here in his house and ask if he cared for cheese it is not irrelevant maam pitt replied with an effort at patience she could not help herself social values and dignity were her only defense against such enormous fears there were crumbs of stilton cheese on his clothes oh she apologized stiffly i beg your pardon i suppose you know your trade yes my husband was very fond of the table he always ate well did i understand you earlier to say that he did a certain amount of charity work he did a great deal of unprofitable work she replied with a sudden wellingup of resentment he wasted most of his time on people who wereyesunworthy of him if you are looking for rivals in his profession mr pitt you are wasting your time my husband had great abilities but he did not ever realize them as he should have her voice held years of disappointment of opportunities glimpsed and lost nevertheless he was well respected i believe pitt was torn between his instinctive dislike of her and a sense of pity for her frustration she had been tied to a man who had failed her and there had been no escape for her her dreams had been within his reach and he had refused to pluck them she sighed oh yes in a certain fashion he was very entertaining you know people liked him her voice lifted a trifle in surprise it was a fact that she did not understand and perhaps did not consciously share her own disappointment was too deep to find his peccadilloes amusing and occasionally he would make a brilliant diagnosis that was his specialty you knowdiagnosis pitt reverted to the obvious can you think of anything at all maam that might help usanyone who might have borne a grudge an old patient perhapssomeone who could not accept the death of a relative and blamed the doctor was there anything unusual in dr pinchins behavior lately or any new acquaintance who was out of the ordinary my husband did not bring his less reputable friends to this house mr pitt her mouth tightened there were certain persons he entertained elsewhere as i am sure you will understand and i noticed nothing odd in his behaviorit was just as usual a look of unhappiness crossed her face a mixture of disapproval of the dead mans habits and a sudden loneliness that he was gone with all his failings and irritating ways she had still grown used to him he had been there for thirty years of her life now there was nothing for a moment pitt felt unclouded pity for her but he knew the gulf between them was too wide to bridge his understanding would not ease her pain at all on the contrary to her it would be presumptuous he stood up thank you maam for your help i hope i shall not have to disturb you again i am sure mr mullen can see to everything else i need to know good day mr pitt she regarded him bleakly until he had reached the door she then lifted the pot and poured herself another cup of tea dabbing her napkin first to her mouth then up to catch the tears running down her cheeks pitt went out and closed the door with a faint click mullen was waiting for him in the hallway is there anything else sir pitt sighed yes please i would like you to show me the household accounts and your cellar i presume you have approved all the staff before they were hired and checked their references mullen stiffened and his expression became chilly most certainly i have may i ask what you expect to find mr pitt they are entirely in order i assure you and the staff are all above question in honesty and morals or they would not remain here and as for any one of them being out at night that is impossible pitt was sorry to have offended him actually he had no suspicions of any of the servants what he was looking for was evidence of pinchins standard of living to judge his expenditures normally a man of his class would not go to the acre even for cheap entertainment was he a good deal less welloff than he appeared or more welloff than his medical practice would account for was he spending money in brothels or gambling houses or was he earning it he would not be the first outwardly respectable man to have a source of income in slum property it is merely routine mr mullen he said with a smile just as you check references even though you believe them mullen relaxed a little he respected professional thoroughness quite so mr pitt i am familiar with police procedure if you will come this way after his visit to the pinchin household pitt spent the afternoon checking the highgate medical practice and talking with shocked and extremely reticent colleagues by the time he got home at five past seven he was tired cold and only a little wiser if pinchin owned property in the devils acre he had hidden all record of itor any other business transactions outside those of his highgate practice his standard of living however did suggest he was enjoying an income rather larger than his medical abilities would account for inherited money savings gifts even a little juggling of the books or perhaps blackmail of patients with indiscretions that required medical help social diseases an unwanted childthe possibilities were legion gracie met pitt at the door and took his coat through to the scullery to dry out orrible wet night sir she said shaking the big coat like a blanket and nearly overbalancing with it she scurried ahead of him muttering to herself about the hours he was obliged to keep in all weathers not once did she meet his eyes she was sorry for him for some reason and her rigid little back was full of disapproval it did not take him long to put two and two together when charlotte was also sweetly attentive and full of conversation have you been out he asked charlotte only for a short while she said quite casually i was home before it began to rain it was really not unpleasant and no doubt you came back in the carriage he added she looked up quickly a faint color in her cheeks carriage didnt you go to see emily there was reluctant admiration in her face how did you know grades back i beg your pardon grades back it is rigid with disapproval since i have only just come home it cannot be anything i have done it must be you i imagine it was a visit to emily to recount to her everything you know about the murders in the devils acreespecially since one of them concerns the footman of a previous acquaintance now tell me am i mistaken i he waited of course we discussed it her eyes were bright the blood warm in her cheeks but that is alli swear anyway what more could we do we can hardly go to such a place but we did wonder what on earth dr pinchin was doing there there are much better places for picking up loose women if that is what he wanted you know yes i do know thank you her eyes met his in a flash then slid away into a professed candor again have you thought that perhaps he put up the money for max thomas you know some unlikelyseeming people go into partnership with yes thank you he replied with a smile bubbling up inside him i thought of that too oh she looked disappointed he took her hand and pulled her toward him charlotte he said gently what mind your own business the following day pitt pursued the investigation in the next most obvious course he took his oldest coat and a rather battered hat that normally not even he would have worn and set out in a drizzling rain for the devils acre to find maxs establishmentsor at least one of them it was an area like many of the older slums of london a curious mixture of societies that lived quite literally on top of each other in the highest handsomest houses with frontages on lighted thoroughfares lived successful merchants and men of private means below them in smaller houses on lesser streets were lodgingrooms for clerks and tradesmen beneath even these squat and grimy were the sagging tenements and cellars of the very poor sometimes packed so full of humanity that two or three families shared one room the stench of refuse and bodily waste was choking rats teemed everywhere so that an untended baby might well be eaten alive and more children died of starvation or disease than ever reached an age of six or seven years when they might profitably join one of the schools for pickpockets and apprentice thieves among this warren of alleys and passageways were the sweatshops the rooms where brokendown lawyers or clerks drafted false affidavits account books and receipts where forgers practiced their art and where receivers of stolen goods made bargains and of course there were the gin mills doss houses and brothels and the police snouts over it all loomed the shadow of the great towers of westminster abbey coronation cathedral of kings the tomb of edward the confessor before norman william ever sailed from france to defeat the saxon king and take england for himself and beyond the abbey was big ben the palace of westminster the mother of parliaments since the days of simon de montfort six hundred years ago there was no point in pitts hoping to receive answers to questions posed in this teeming rats nest the police were the natural enemy and the swarming population knew an outsider as a dog knows one by senses far subtler than mere sight in the past he had made a few arrests here but had also let a few slip by he had friendsor if not friends at least those who knew what could be to their advantage pitt followed gray alleys past youths idle and sullen watching him with mean eyes he hunched his shoulders aping the furtive gait of the longabused but he did not look behind him they would smell fear and be on him like a hunting pack he walked as if he knew where he was going as if the narrow passagessometimes only wide enough to allow two men to pass each other sidewisewere as familiar to him as his home beams creaked wood rotted and settled a dozen rats scattered as he approached their feet scrabbling on the wet stones old men lay in doorways perhaps in drunken stupor or maybe they were dead it took pitt half an hour before he found the man he was looking for in a dilapidated attic where he did his work squeaker harris so named for his sharp highpitched voice he was a little man with narrow eyes and a pointed nosenot unlike a rat himself pitt thought all he lacked was the long hairless tail he was a scrivener a forger of letters of recommendation of papers of attorney wotcher want wiv me he demanded truculently i aint done nuffin not as yer can prove not trying to squeaker pitt replied although i dare say i could if i put my mind to it nah squeaker dismissed the possibility but there was anxiety in his quick little face nahnever we wont know will weif i dont try pitt pointed out so wotcher want then yer never came ter devils acre fer yer ealf information of course pitt looked at him with mild contempt he should have known that indeed the pretense was a waste of time i dunno nuffin abaht no crimes squeaker warned of course not pitt said dryly youre an upright citizen making a few pence writing letters for those who havent the skill for themselves vats rightyer got it in one squeaker nodded vigorously but you know the devils acre pitt pursued course i doi was bloody born ere ever heard of a pimp named max and dont lie to me squeaker or ill arrest you for withholding information about a murder and itll be the long drop for you this is a bad one oh my gawd yer mean vat poor sod as wasoh gawd squeaker paled under the dirt on his face oh gawd he said again so pitt prompted what do you know about max i dunno oo killed im i swear to yer mr pitt some kind o maniac ood do vat ter any man it aint decent of course you dont know who killed him pitt conceded with a tolerant smile or youd have told us all about it naturally natcherly squeaker agreed glancing away nervously he thought pitt was laughing at him but he did not want to put it to the test i swear he added for good measure what about max pitt pressed what was he like good at it squeaker said grudgingly pimping was a lot more profitable than petty forgery as well as probably more fun ad a natcheral talent e adfer vat sort o fing he did not want to be too fulsome in his praise after all max could not have made a good forgery to save himself in fact squeaker was not sure if he could even write a legible hand there was great skill in writing well and it should not be undervalued remembering the heavy sensual face with its dark eyes pitt could well believe that max had such a talent yes he said so i heard had several houses didnt he squeaker looked at him cautiously know vat do yer i do what sort of clients did he cater to depends which ouse as yer talkin abaht squeaker said if n yer means ve one in partridge lanewell anyone as ad ve price real scrubbers vey are but if n yer means ve one up by george streetwell nah vats diff rent altergevver nah some o vem as real class an i as eard say as ell provide a gentleman wiv enough money ter spend wiv some ladies o blood as yer might say he leered knowingly showing brown teeth the idea obviously amused him as a sort of obscene revenge upon the society that had excluded him completely ladies of blood eh pitt raised his eyebrows that sounded promising he fixed squeaker with a look of suspicion ladies of blood he repeated skeptically vats wot i saidtake it or leave it squeaker knew he had pitts interest and he enjoyed the sensation mebbe vats were yer murder comes from never mess wiv the qualitygolden rule vey aint used ter bein took and vey feels it very ardcan get real nasty stick to yer ownven yer wont get someone as dont know ve rules comin all over spiteful and stickin a shiv in yer gut although wot vey done ter max was uncalled for mr pittreal uncalled for i dont know wot you rozzers is lettin the place come to pitt hid a smile disgusting he agreed but a jealous man can get carried to extraordinary lengths if someone has taken his woman and then used her to sell to other men as a whore squeaker sighed he had neither wife nor children but he dreamed of them sometimes a woman whose warmth would not have to be traded for or bought someone who would become familiar with time children who would treat him with respectevery man should have that at least for a while i reckon as yer right mr pitt he said slowly never mess wiv a mans familyvats anuvver rule as should be writ in gold on the ole i reckon as pimpin aint such an ealfy occupation after all women is a dangerous kind o goods ter deal innot ter mention a mans private needs wot can be very odd in some o them gents from up west so ive eard say some o them stories yer wouldnt believe papers is much better fings ter sell knows were yer is wiv papers people dont lose veir eads over paper pitt did not bother to argue with him and this more expensive house of maxs is in george street aint vat wot i jus said squeaker was patient like a schoolmaster with an unnaturally dim pupil yesthank you pitt fished in his pocket and brought out a shilling he gave it to squeaker whose grimy hand closed over it quickly he raised it to his mouth and bit it sharply it met with his satisfaction and he pushed it into his pocket fanks mr pitt he said dont leave the acre pitt warned if youve told me lies ill be back here to take that out of your skin squeaker was taken aback i wouldnt tell yer no lies mr pitt wouldnt be worf me wile nah would it yerd only come back and ruin me business aint good fer trade to ave crushers angin around beggin yer pardon gives the ouse a bad name pitt snorted and went out of the ouse past the rotting wood in the yard a pile of refuse and two drunks in the gutter he made his way rapidly through the rain to george street this was a distinctly more salubrious part of the acre only a few moments walk from the houses of parliament max did indeed have an unusual skill if he had managed to acquire some ladies of blood as squeaker put it and three or four thoroughly handsome whores accomplished in their art he would have made himself a very rich man in a few years pitt found the house without much difficulty a man asking for such a place was not unusual and those willing to give directions were often compensated for their trouble by the proprietors of the establishments this particular house was inconspicuous even a little grubby on the outside it could easily have been taken for another one of the numerous common lodging houses anonymity was a necessary part of the trade inside however the style changed the entrance hallway was discreetly elegant pitt was reminded of maxs service in fine houses of men and women whose taste was nurtured by generations of money and breeding these were people who knew the masters of painting and furniture design as instinctively as they knew how to construct a grammatical sentence or to walk with head high and a very slight swagger to the hips beyond the hallway in the main reception room there was nothing opulent nothing vulgar its sensuality was one of quiet color which belied the ease with which each piece of furniture and each painting complemented the others the pleasure the room afforded was tactile as well soft velvets a carpet that made the feet tread silently almost as if upon grass indeed max possessed a veritable art a man in livery came forward affecting to be something between a footman and a butler he was obviously in charge of who would be permitted to become a customer and who would be discreetly redirected elsewhere good afternoon sir he eyed pitts clothes and with an almost imperceptible change of expression determined that he was unlikely to be able to pay the house charges but he was too skilled to dismiss him immediately gentlemen of the most distinguished rank and fortune were known to assume the oddest of disguises at times good afternoon pitt understood the process exactly and with a touch of amusement he played it all the way using his most courteous manner i came here by recommendation he made sure he stood perfectly straightshouldered as if his disastrous clothes were an attempt at passing for a native of the acreas indeed they were but for an entirely different reason i have heard from various of my friendscould squeaker harris be termed a friend that you have ladies of far greater quality than any of your competitors the mans face relaxed he decided pitt was a gentleman after all his voice not his clothes betrayed the man that beautiful diction and the bearing that is perfectly true sir what kind of quality had you in mind we have both quality of experience and if you prefer quality of breedingalthough that of course does require a little special arrangement so business was proceeding as usual in spite of maxs dramatic demise pitt flared his nostrils a little and widened his eyes looking very slightly down at the man quality of breeding he replied in a tone that suggested there could have been no other answer quite sir the man replied if you would care to make an appointment in advance i will see that it is arranged you understand we can make less deference to individual tastes in such circumstances but if you care to tell me what coloring what figure you prefer we will endeavor to accommodate you yes max had had more than talent he had had genius excellent pitt answered easily i like auburn coloringautomatically he pictured charlotteor next to that dark and i do not care for fat women nor yet too thin dont give me someone whose bones i can feel quite sir the man said again bowing an excellent taste if i may say so he could have been a butler commenting upon a choice of wine for the table if you will return in three days time we will provide you with something that will be to your satisfaction our financial settlement will be fifty guineaspayable in advanceupon your meeting the lady and believing her acceptable of course naturally pitt replied i must say my friend was correct you would appear to be by far the most superior establishment in the area we have no rival sir the man said simply those like mr mercutt who imagine they can imitate us are quite inferioras perhaps you have already heard mercutt pitt repeated frowning a little i dont think i have heard the name he let his voice rise inviting explanation ambrose mercutt the mans eyebrows lifted fractionally in disdain a most indifferent person i assure you sir but with pretensions a duchess might have spoken of a social climber with just such a tone of weary condescension pitt had the name he wanted he had accomplished all he could here the local station would know where to find mr mercutt no he shook his head i cannot think that anyone has mentioned his name to me he cannot be of any account better to leave the man flattered and secure comfortable people betray far more than those who are suspicious the man smiled with satisfaction quite sirof no account at all if you care to return at about this time in the afternoon in three days time pitt inclined his head in agreement and took his leave equally satisfied inspector parkins received pitt with a look of expectant pleasure the case of max burton had been handed over and parkins was delighted to be rid of it there were already more than enough unsolved crimes within his responsibility and this particular one promised little joy ah mr pitt come in wretched day what can i do for you pitt took off his coat and the appalling hat then ran his fingers through his hair making it look as if he had had a bad fright he sat down in the chair opposite parkins ambrose mercutt he asked parkins face relaxed into a dry smile ambrose mercutt he repeated an elegant pimp with ambitions you think he might have murdered max out of a business rivalry max was taking his trade parkins shrugged and raised his eyes do you know how many brothels there are in this area it was a rhetorical question pitt took it literally about eightyfive thousand prostitutes in london he answered parkins put his hands up to his face oh godis it that many i look at them sometimes and wonder how they came to it stupid isnt it but there are a couple of thousand at least here on my patch we cant clean them outand what good would it do anyway theyd only start up somewhere else we dont call it the oldest profession for nothing and a lot of the patrons are men with moneyand power i dare say you know that as well as i do a police inspector who made things embarrassing for them would have a good deal more courage than sense pitt knew it was all ugly and painfully true so you didnt take a lot of interest in maxor ambrose mercutt parkins pulled a face we cant do everything better to concentrate on crimes where there are obvious victims and we can imprison someone if we catch themtheft forgery robbery assault there are enough of them to use all our time then what is the gossip about ambrose mercutt and max parkins relaxed again leaning back in his chair mercutt used to have the carriage trade till max came along but max could provide a better class of womenive heard even a few of distinct breeding god knows what theyre doing it for his face mirrored his complete mystification an attempt to understand and defeat yes mercutt had good reason to hate max but i wouldnt have thought he was the only one by any means pimping is a very cutthroat business he stopped remembering the literal use of the knife in the crimes where would max get women like that pitt spoke his thoughts aloud society is quite capable of providing its own diversions if some of their women want a little adultery parkins looked at pitt with interest he had worked all his professional life in the acre or areas like it whitechapel spitalfields places where he never even spoke to the quality is that so parkins glimpsed a world beyond his own pitt tried very hard not to sound condescending ive known a few cases that have shown it he answered with a small smile not women parkins was shocked pitt hesitated parkins worked in the devils acre amid its filth and despair most of its inhabitants were born to live hard and die young we all need to believe in some ideal even if it is forever out of reachdreams are still necessary a few he spoke less than the truth only a few parkins seemed to relax and the anxiety died out of his face perhaps he also knew it was fairyland he imagined but he wanted it all the same do you want to know where to find ambrose mercutt he offered yes please pitt noted the address parkins gave him talked a little longer then took his leave into the bitter evening the sky had cleared and the east wind was so sharp on his face that it stung his skin the following day he went first to his office to see if there was any further information but there was nothing beyond the autopsy report on hubert pinchin which told him only what he already knew then he went back to the acre to find ambrose mercutt it proved a less easy task than he had first supposed ambrose supervised most of his business himself at eleven oclock in the morning he was not up nor did he wish to receive visitors of any sort least of all from the police it was half an hour before pitt prevailed upon his manservant and ambrose was brought protesting into the palecarpeted dining room with imitation sheraton furniture and erotic paintings from the new decadent artists on the walls he was lean and elegantly effete clad in a silk dressing robe his wavy hair falling over half his face hiding rather wispy eyebrows and pale puffylidded eyes pitt could see instantly why max had succeeded him as the proprietor for the carriage trade max had had a sensuality himself that would attract the women who worked for him and a taste of his own to appreciate and select the best new whores for the tradeperhaps even teach them a little nature had given him an advantage that ambrose with all his intelligence could not hope to emulate ive never heard of you ambrose said his eyes wide looking pitt up and down you must be new in the acre i cant imagine what you want here i have some very good custom youd be foolish to make lifeawkwardfor me inspector his paused as if to see if pitt had the mental agility to understand him pitt smiled i believe you do have some very good custom he agreed coolly but perhaps not as much as you had before max burton moved into the trade ambrose was shaken his hand moved down his body and tightened on his silk robe pulling it a little further around himself is that what youre here about maxs murder so he was not going to pretend to be stupid that was a relief pitt was not in the frame of mind to play games with him yes im not interested in your other affairs but max took a lot of your business and maybe some of your women as welland dont waste time in denying it ambrose shrugged and turned away its a chancy trade you do better one year worse anotherdepends on your girls max was doing well nowhis girls would have left in time highclass women always do either they get bored or settle their debts or they marry someone and get out of it altogether he wouldnt have lasted perhaps ambrose had talked himself into believing this but personally pitt thought max would have been well able to replace any women that left ambrose must have sensed his doubts he turned back and stared at pitt defiantly ever wonderedinspectorhis voice was very delicately sarcastic as if the title were illdeservedever wondered just how max got the quality of women he did women like his dont take to whoring in the devils acre you know just for a little diversion theres plenty of whoring to be had in their own circle if thats all they want surprises you that does it he looked into pitts eyes and saw that it did not his face hardened if you want to find out who murdered max and then castrated him look among the husbands or lovers of some of the highborn women hes brought in here believe me if i simply wanted a business rival removed i should stick a knife into him by all means and then throw him into the riveror put him in one of the rat holes deep inside the acre i wouldnt cut him about and then leave him where hed be found by you lot no inspectoragain he hesitated fractionally making the title an insultlook at some man he cuckolded or whose wife or daughter hes seduced into whoredom pitt led him further and how would he seduce a wellborn woman into whoredom he asked with a trace of doubt for that matter where would he even meet one he used to be a footman somewhere he probably knew other menservants ambrose used the word to convey all his hatred and contempt for max and his class in general probably blackmail thats where your murderer is believe me perhaps pitt conceded with an affectation of far more reluctance than he felt much as he disliked ambrose what he said made excellent sense then what about dr hubert pinchin ambrose threw up his hands theatrically god knows perhaps he was the one who did the blackmailing maybe he used his medical practice to find these women or to discover their secrets maybe they were partners how should i know do you want me to do your entire job for you pitt smiled and saw a trace of irritation on ambroses face he had meant to offend not amuse im always glad of a little expert help pitt replied softly ive worked on a few murders one sort and another arson burglaryknow a lot about fine artbut keeping a whorehouse is outside my experience ambrose drew a sharp breath to retort but he did not find the words before pitt had turned and left the elegant room of pale decor and ambrose himself standing in his silk robe in the middle of it pitt went out into the rainy graywalled street he felt a glow of satisfaction for at least having been thoroughly rude and there was also a strong possibility that ambrose was right lady augusta balantyne was not looking forward to the morning she had decided that she could no longer put off visiting her daughter christina to discuss her behavior in the frankest terms christina and alan ross would be at the family dinner party this evening but what augusta had to say required uninterrupted privacy as in the past when dealing with christinas indiscretions augusta intended to keep the entire matter from general balantynes knowledge he might be an excellent military tactician when he had cannon and horses to dispose but when the battle concerned emotions and the possibility of scandal he was a babe in arms over breakfast she maintained a civilized conversation about the usual trivialities general balantyne of course did not mention the murders in the devils acre that filled the newspapers in case he should distress hernot realizing that she had read them for herself and she was perfectly happy to leave him in his ignorance if it pleased him at ten oclock lady augusta called the carriage and gave the coachman instructions to take her to her daughters house she was received with some surprise good morning mama good morning christina she walked in for once not bothering to notice if the flowers were fresh or if there were new ornamentsnot even if christinas gown was the very latest she had already made her comments on extravagance from now on it was alan rosss affair today something infinitely more serious filled her mind christina still looked surprised i have only just finished breakfast would you care for a dish of tea mama no thank you i do not wish to be interrupted by servants coming and going or the inconvenience of fiddling about with cups christina opened her mouth to say something then decided against it she sat down on the sofa and picked up a piece of embroidery i hope you have not been obliged to cancel this evenings dinner i have footmen to send on errands like that augusta said dryly i wish to talk to you privately and the opportunity will not present itself tonight she looked at her daughters charming profile her soft chin and wide tilted eyes how could anyone have such a passionate will and at the same time so little sense of survival augusta had tried all her life to impart to her her own understanding of the possible and the impossible and she had failed this was going to be unpleasant but it was unavoidable will you please put that downi wish for your attention a situation has arisen which means that i can no longer allow you to continue with your present behavior christinas blue eyes widened in surprise at the questioning of her conduct she was a married woman and accountable to her husband but certainly not to her mother my behavior mama dont treat me as if i were foolish christina i am perfectly aware that you have been amusing yourself in some most unsavory places i can understand boredom can you christina said scathingly have you really the faintest idea what it is like to be so bored you feel as if your whole life is sliding away and you might as well be asleep for all you do with it of course i have do you imagine you are the only woman to find her husband tedious and her usual acquaintances infinitely predictable till she could recite every word of their conversation before they begin but papa a shadow darkened christinas face was it pain or merely irritation at least he must have been exciting when he was young when he was in the army fighting my dear girl how many times do you think i wish to hear the exact detail of the disposition of the guns at balaclavaor anywhere else he considered it disloyal to talk about other officers faults or ambitions and vulgar to discuss their love affairs in front of women good god there were times when he bored me till if i had not been a lady i would have screamed at him and slapped his face out of sheer desire to jolt him out of his damned satisfaction but it would have served no purpose at all he would not have understood he would merely have thought i was having hysterics and ordered me rest and a soothing tisane so i learned to adjust my expression to look interested and to occupy my mind with something else a little selfdiscipline would improve you a great deal and would provide a rather better understanding of what is really important to you to keep alan spoils you spoils me he provides everything i need and then treats me like a social entity someone to be polite to christinas face flushed with temper he is so pious he is insufferable he should have married a nun sometimes i wonder if he has any passion in him at allreal passion augusta felt a stab of pity and dismissed it this was not the time do not confuse passion with mere excitement she said coolly excitement is like playing cards for matchstickswin lose or draw you have nothing left at the end but a pile of splinters christinas face set her chin hard dont patronize me i shall do as i choose augusta changed her approach do you read the newspapers what of it if alan doesnt mind it is none of your concern then you cannot be unaware that there have been two particularly unpleasant murders in the devils acre augusta continued the color faded from christinas cheeks max burton had been footman in the house before she had married alan ross it hurt augusta to have to recall anything of that painful affair but christinas present foolishness and now her stubbornness in denying it left her no alternative one of the victims used to be employed as a servant in our house i know christina said quietly she took a shaky breath it is extremely unpleasant the police are investigating both crimes naturally although i cannot see what good it will do every so often people like that are bound to get murdered i dont suppose there is the slightest chance they will ever discover who did it and why hardly matters i really cannot believe they carethey have to go through the motions because it is expected of them doubtless but that is not the point it is inspector pitt who will trydo you remember pitt christina winced there are houses in that quarter augusta continued where wealthy women occasionally find themselves some diversion i dare say it offers them a certain thrill to enter into a world of filth and danger perhaps their own looks the sweeter after it christinas eyes were hard and angry her skin tight across the cheekbones i have no idea augusta sighed dont pretend to be stupid christina and above all do not pretend that i am alan may prefer to affect ignorance of a great deal that you doindeed he appears to be remarkably patient but he cannot ignore scandalno one can the devils acre will come under very close scrutiny these crimes have shocked peopleand since pinchin was relatively respectable frightened them as well if you cannot control your taste for slumming you must do it elsewhere although you would be very wise not to do it at all london is much smaller than you thinkyou cannot be anonymous for long your lady friends will not frequent these gambling houses or music halls but their husbands might well what is a dangerous adventure for you is merely a lark for them hypocrites christina spat out my dear girl stop behaving like a child you are too old for it naivete excusable at twenty is boring at twentyfive and at thirty it becomes ridiculous you stand in danger of losing your reputation take a great deal of thought as to what that means on the contrary i am very popular and considered most entertaining so are buffoons and whores do you wish to be one of them christinas face was very white im sorry you imagine i go to cheap music halls mama i have never entered one in my life so i cannot say what they offer but if i wished to gamble there are plenty of perfectly respectable houses where i could do so and i do not need to find myself a loveri have more offers than i can entertain augusta was unimpressed she had seen christinas wounded dignity before do you indeed are you telling me you have not been to the devils acre i had no intention of discussing it with you at all the matter was too urgent for augusta to lose her temper she did not wish to tell christina that she had learned through an old servants loyalty of her trips to the slums under the shadows of westminster it would jeopardize the servants postbut more practical than that it would remove her own source of information and with christina so rash there was only augusta to protect her no doubt she said tartly which is why it is just as well i am aware of it for myself you were seen you must stop immediately christina was frightened now augusta had known her too long to be deceived by the arrogant stance the squared shoulders under the thick satin good heavensshe was still so much of a child as feckless as a summer day so little thought of consequences she saw what she wanted and reached for it where on earth had she come by such abandon it was certainly not her father he had never done anything emotionally prodigal in his lifewould to god he had and augusta had always had enough strength of will at least to be discreet she knew the line between pleasure and duty and would walk it with an acrobats balance why was christina such a fool reallyyou try my patience she said furiously sometimes you dont seem to have retained the wits you were born with if youve never had an affair worth a damn then im sorry for you christina was shouting now pouring all her frustration her hunger and her pride into a burning contempt for what she considered a lesser woman i went to the acre to a house owned by a friend of mine and yes i did go there to meet a lover but you wont tell alan that because you want to ruin my marriage even less than i do alan ross was your choice for me he was the best offer you had my girl and you were as happy to take it as iat the time augusta reminded her who is this lover at least be glad i am conducting it in a very private room and not at someone elses house party creeping in and out of bedrooms christina snapped who he is is none of your business but he is a gentlemanif that is your concern then your taste is improving augusta said cruelly and rose to her feet but from now on you will restrict it to your own home remember christina society does not forgive women and it does not forget a great deal of flirtation may be overlookedeven affairs if they are conducted discreetly enough but slumming in the devils acre halls will not it is a betrayal of ones own class she moved to the door and opened it there was no servant in the hall be careful my dear you cannot afford another mistake i have not made one christina replied through her teeth i thank you for your concern but it was unnecessary augusta had chosen to make dinner a very formal affair the servants were in full livery and all the best crystal was out there were three georgian silver candelabra and arrangements of flowers on the table that must have come from a dozen glasshouses general balantyne chose not even to imagine what they had cost augusta herself wore black and white favorites of hers complementing her dark hair with its streaks of silver and her still perfect white shoulders general balantyne was obliged to acknowledge with a little jolt of surprise that she looked magnificent he could still see in her the beauty and dignity that had delighted him as a young man of course it had been a very suitable marriage he was of excellent family with a long and spotless reputation but all its titles were military ones and there was not a great deal of money augustas father however had been an earl her title was her own for life regardless of whom she marriedunless of course she gained a better one and there was not a little wealth in her dowry and later in her inheritance all the same her person and her qualities had enabled him to ask for her hand with considerable enthusiasm and she had seemed happy to accept the surprise was that her father had also been agreeable that brought the generals mind to his own daughter christina and to her marriage to alan ross of course that had been different christina was nothing like her mother though as far as he could judge she was even less like him she had not augustas regal beauty but she was dazzlingly pretty and she had always had charm allied with a considerable wita wit too often exercised at the expense of someone else for his pleasure but that was what made society laugh a harmless wit was for them a contradiction in terms he was not sure whether she had ever really loved alan ross or indeed if she was ready yet to love anyone but she had certainly been determined to marry him and that was something augusta had refused to discuss it all belonged to the shock and the weeks of fear and distress during the murders here in callander square three years ago the suspicion still filled him with unhappiness he liked alan ross he was an unusually quiet man one moment the fine aquiline nose made him look strong even arrogant then that peculiarly vulnerable mouth shattered the impression leaving one with a sense only of the passions that might lie unreachable beneath balantyne had never quite known what ross felt about christina on the other hand he had come to know his son a great deal better brandy had augustas dark good looks but he was gentler he had a well of laughter within himone might even go so far as to say an appreciation of the absurdand balantyne envied it there was random joy in such a quality he would dearly have loved to possess and brandy had certainly shown a courage no one had expected when he had insisted on marrying reggie southerons governess jemima she was a charming girl well mannered and apparently more than adequately educated though she was barely more than a superior servant till the marriage but they were obviously happy and they had named their daughter after balantynes mothera gesture he found remarkably pleasing yes brandy had made a good choice the dinner was served in seven courses and naturally took a great deal of time augusta presided at the far end of the table although balantyne himself was nominally at the head on the side nearest the windows with their mossgreen velvet curtains drawn to exclude the night and its driving sleet alan ross sat with the candlelight gleaming on his fair hair as usual he spoke little jemima sat next to him she was wearing pale green and white the design of the fabric suggesting it would be like flowers to touch she reminded balantyne far more of spring or the gentle days of early summer than this icy january jemima always did she made him think of daisies and saplings bending in the wind she was talking to augusta and on the far side brandy was watching her smiling beside him christina sat immaculately dressed in a deep shade of gold her dark hair gleaming balantyne could see why men found her beautiful although her nose was a little small her eyebrows winged instead of arched and her lips too rounded for classical taste but there was something individual about her an impression of daring she had a touch of brandys humor but without his tolerance or his sense of the absurd the course was cleared away and the next one served do you remember that fellow pitt brandy asked looking up from his plate they were eating a whitefish curled and baked covered with sauce and flaked almonds balantyne did not like it no augusta said coldly the only pitt i know of was the first minister of england who introduced income tax during the napoleonic wars alan ross hid a smile and jemima bent her head but the arch of her neck suggested to balantyne that she was smiling also the policeman who always looked as if hed just come in out of a gale brandy went on oblivious of the chill three years ago even he avoided mentioning the events of death so close to them then why on earth should i remember such a person augusta inquired critically brandy seemed impervious to the ice in her voiceor to the warning he was rather memorable for goodness sake christina interrupted he was a policeman that is like saying one ought to remember other peoples servants brandy ignored her also hes in charge of this maniac case in the devils acre he continued did you know that augustas face froze but before she could speak christina turned on her brother her voice unusually brittle i think it is most coarse of you to bring up such a subject at table brandy indeed i cannot see the need to discuss it anywhere at all and i would be obliged if while we are eating you could talk of something pleasant for instance did you know that lady summervilles eldest daughter is betrothed to sir frederick byers augusta relaxed the tension in her shoulders easing under the stretched silk of her gown but she did not yet resume eating as if she might be required at any moment to rescue the situation i know freddie byers doesnt know it brandy replied dryly at least he didnt on tuesday christina laughed but without the usual fullthroated delight oh how marvelous i wonder if we are to have a scandal i cant bear rose summerville anyway did i tell you that story of when she was presented to the princess of wales and what happened to her feathers balantyne could not think what on earth she meant feathers he repeated with disbelief oh papa christina waved her small hand delicate ringed with two beautiful diamonds when one is presented at court one has to wear the prince of wales feathers as a headdress it is really dreadfully difficult to keep them standing up especially if you have wispy hair like rose she proceeded to tell the disaster so trenchantly that even though balantyne found the whole social presentation of debutantes farcical and more than a little cruel he was obliged to smile he looked once at jemima who of course had never been anywhere near the court but her eyes were bright with laughter even if her mouth showed some indecision on just how much pity she felt for the hapless girls herded like competing livestock one after another dressed in hundreds of guineas worth of gowns for their entrance into society honor demanded they find a suitable husband before the seasons end the dishes were cleared away and the next course served chicken in aspic the color and texture of it reminded balantyne of dead skin and in a flash of memory the present footmans face was replaced by maxs as he bent forward to offer the silver dishes suddenly he did not wish to eat there was no more food on the table than usual but it seemed too much he thought of the cold body on the mortuary slab that was meat too graywhite flesh like fowl all the red blood settled to the back and buttocks and yet even robbed emasculated max had not seemed anonymous in death as most men he had seen that heavy face was too similar to his memory of the man in life augusta was staring at him he could not possibly explain to her what was in his mind better force himself to eat even if it stuck in his throat he would be able to wash it down with the chablis and the physical discomfort was easier than the continuing constrictions of trying to explain i rather liked miss ellison too brandy said out of nowhere she was one of the most individual women i have ever met miss ellison augusta looked nonplussed i dont think i know any ellisons when was she presented never i should think brandy smiled broadly she was the young woman who helped papa put his papers in order when he began writing his military history of the family for goodness sake why ever should we talk about her christina shot him a contemptuous glance she was the most ordinary creature the only possible thing remarkable about her was a good head of hair and even parlormaids can have good hair my dear girl parlormaids have to have good hair brandy answered scornfully and all the other physical attributes as well any house with pretensions to quality chooses its parlormaids for their looks but you know that as well as i do are we really to be reduced to discussing the appearance of parlormaids augustas nostrils flared as if at some faintly unpleasant odor balantyne was compelled to defend charlotteor was it his memory of her a thing that mattered to him needed safeguarding miss ellison was hardly a parlormaid he said quickly in fact she was not a servant at all she certainly was not a lady christina snapped back a shade too rapidly i can tell the difference even if brandy cannot really sometimes i think anything the least bit handsome in a skirt and some men lose whatever judgment they once had christina augustas voice was like ice cracking and her face was whiter than balantyne could remember ever having seen it before was she so angry for him because his daughter had insulted him at his own table or was it for jemima who had once been so little more than a servant oddly he would rather believe it was for jemima he turned to stare at his daughter one of the qualities of a lady christina he said quietly is that she has good manners and does not even accidentally cause offense to others by her clumsiness christina sat perfectly still her eyes glittering her cheeks bloodless fist clenched over her napkin on the contrary papa it is servantsand social climberswho do not give offense because they know they cannot afford to there was a ruffle of embarrassment round the table it was alan ross who spoke laying his fork down beside his plate he had good handsstrong without excess of flesh servants do not give offense because they dare not my dear he said quietly to his wife a lady would not wish to that is the difference it is people who are obliged to no one but have not the mastery of themselves nor sufficient sensitivity to understand the feelings of others who offend you have everything worked out so neatly dont you alan she said it as though it were a challenge even an insult implying he had curtailed thought with some preconceived answer balantyne felt a cold wave of unhappiness and pushed his plate away from him alan ross was dignified he had a sense of decency he did not deserve this illbehavior from his wife mere beauty was not nearly enough one hungered for gentleness in a woman no matter how splendid her wit or her face or even her body christina had better learn that before it was too late and she forfeited alans affection beyond retrieval he must have augusta speak to her about it someone should warn her brandy jarred him back to an even uglier subject it was max burton who used to be our footman who was killed in the devils acre wasnt it he looked at them in turn his remark had the presumably desired effect of stopping the previous conversation utterly augustas hands hung paralyzed over her plate christina dropped her knife alan ross sat motionless a petal fell from one of the flowers onto the tablecloth whiter purer than the starched linen christina swallowed really brandy how on earth would we know and for that matter why should we care max left here years ago and its all completely disgusting the devils acre and its occupants are not of the least concern to us augusta agreed huskily and i refuse to have them or their obscenities discussed at my table i disagree mama brandy was not impressed as long as everybody refuses to talk about them i imagine half the city is talking of little else augusta cut him off there are plenty of people whose nature wallows in such things i do not intend to be among themand neither will you while you are in my house brandon im not thinking of the details brandy leaned forward his face earnest im talking about the general social conditions in our slums apparently max was a pimp he procured women for prostitution brandon he ignored the interruption do you know how many prostitutes there are in london mama balantyne looked across at augustas face and thought he would not forget her expression as long as he lived her eyebrows rose and her eyes widened am i to assume brandon that you do she inquired in a voice that could have chipped stone the color came up brandys cheeks slightly but his face set in the same defiance that echoed as far back as nursery days over such trivialities as rice pudding and talcing naps he swallowed eightyfive thousand to have added approximately would have diminished the impact and some of them are no more than ten or eleven years old nonsense she snapped for the first time alan ross joined in i am sorry mamainlaw but that is true several people of some reputation and quality have been espousing the cause of these people lately and there has been much investigation dont be ridiculous christina laughed but it was a high sound without happiness mama is perfectly correct how could a person of any quality whatsoever take up such a cause thats preposterous it really is not worth discussing we are descending to absurdity and it is most unpleasant balantyne wondered at christinas agreeing so readily with her mother it was not like her he was surprised to hear his own voice eightyfive thousand unfortunates in london he had unconsciously used the current euphemism for prostitution it made the whole dark amorphous misery seem less terrible it allowed one to think that people were moved by compassion unfortunates brandys eyes were narrow with scorn he ripped balantynes thought apart exactly as if he had read it from his mind dont make it sound as if we had some kind of pity for them papa we dont even want to know about them weve just said they are not suitable conversation for our table we prefer to pretend they dont exist or that they are all doing it quite happily and sinfully because they want to dont talk rubbish brandy christina snapped you know nothing about it and mama is perfectly correct it is most disagreeable and i think you are illmannered to force it upon us we have already made it as plain as we can that we dont care to learn of such coarse subjects jemima she stared across the table im sure you dont wish to hear about prostitutes over your dinner do you balantyne leaned forward wanting to defend jemima she was peculiarly vulnerable she was in love with brandyand she had married wildly above herself but jemima smiled back at christina her gray eyes clear and level i should find it extremely uncomfortable at any time she answered but then when i can regard other womens distress either physical or moral without feeling uncomfortable about it then i am in need of a very sharp reminder of my responsibilities as a human being there was a moments silence brandys face broke into a dazzling smile and his hand moved for a moment as if he would reach across the table and touch her how very pious christina said with delicate contempt you sound as if you were still in the schoolroom you really must learn not to be so unimaginative my dear its such a bore and above everything else in the world society hates a bore the color drained out of brandys face but it usually forgives a hypocrite darling he turned on his sister so you will remain a success as long as you are careful not to become too obviouswhich you are doing at the moment a clumsy hypocrite is worse than a boreit is insulting you know nothing about society christinas voice was brittle her face hot i was trying to be helpful after all jemima is my sisterinlaw no one wishes to sound like a governess even if one thinks like one good heavens brandywe have all had more than enough of the schoolroom of course we have augusta came to life again at last no one wishes to be instructed about social ills brandy take a seat in parliament if you are interested in such things christina is right but it is not poor jemima who is a boreshe is merely being loyal to you as a wife should be it is you who are being extremely tedious now please either entertain us with something pleasant or else hold your tongue and allow someone else to do so she turned to alan ross ignoring balantyne at the end of the table he was still unhappy and sought the words to convey his sense that the subject could not so easily be dismissed its comfort or discomfort was irrelevant it was its truth that mattered alan augusta said with a slight smile christina tells me you have been to see the exhibition at the royal academy do tell us what was interesting did sir john millais show a picture this season there was no alternative but to answer ross gave in gracefully offering her a light and delicately humorous description of the paintings at the academy balantyne thought again how much he liked the man after the dessert had been cleared away augusta rose and the ladies excused themselves to the withdrawing room leaving the gentlemen free to smoke if they chose and to drink the port that the footman stride brought in in a waterford crystal decanter with a silver neck and an exquisite fluted stopper he left it on the table and retired discreetly without knowing why he said itthe subject had been a ghost on the edge of his mind for daysbalantyne returned to max and the devils acre it was our old footman who was murdered he filled his glass and picked it up turning it looking at the light on the rubyreflecting facets pitt came here he asked me to go and identify the body rosss face was blank he was a very private man it was not often easy to know what he thought or felt balantyne remembered helena doran whom ross had loved before christina and the painful idea occurred to him that possibly he had never entirely stopped loving her it hurt him for both of themfor ross himself and for christina perhaps that was why she was soso fragile at times and so unkind jemimas happiness must be like caustic in the wound and yet the happiness of how many marriages is based on anything else than a certain sharing of time of experience that welds a couple together simply because it is something held in common the fortunate marriages mellow into a kind of friendship had christina even tried to win alan rosss love she had all the wit and beauty it could have needed the gentleness the generosity of spirit were her duty to acquire and then to show him again the thought intruded that he must have augusta speak to her brandy was staring at him pitt came here didnt they know who he was balantyne brought his mind back to max apparently not he was using several names but pitt recognized his face or thought he did they sat in silence perhaps in some obscure way they had half imagined it was not really the same man now it was different it was undeniably a person they had known had lived with and seen every day even if as a servant he was merely a part of the household appurtenances not an individual like themselves poor devil brandy said at last do you think theyll ever find who did it ross asked turning to look at balantyne his expression was very intense if he was trading in women one has a certain understanding for whoever killed him it has to be as low as a man can sink this side of insanity the trade in children is the lowest brandy said quietly especially in boys ross winced oh god he breathed out i hadnt even thought of that how criminally ignorant we are i cannot imagine what brings a human being to do such things and yet there must be thousands who do here in my own city and i may pass them in the street every day of my life in boys balantyne repeated not entirely as a question after thirty years in the army he could not help being aware of the appetites and aberrations of men far from home under pressure of war presumably such hungers were latent before loneliness and the absence of women brought them to the point of physical indulgence but he had not thought of anyone earning a living by selling the bodies of children for such acts it was beyond his capacity to comprehend the mind of such a person did max deal in boys he asked women i think brandy replied at least thats what the newspapers said but perhaps they would have avoided mentioning it if he had used boys people dont want to know about the trade in children adult women we can blame say they are immoral and anything that happens to them is beyond societys responsibility prostitution is as old as mankind and will probably last as long we can wink at thateven wellbred women affect not to know that way they are not required to react ignorance is a most effective shield balantyne suddenly thought how little he really knew brandy there was anger in him and bitterness he had never recognized before years had slipped by and because balantyne himself felt that he had barely changed he assumed that brandy had not changed either the difference between fortyfive and fifty was nothing the difference from twentythree to twentyeight could be all the world he looked at his son at the line of his brow and nose utterly different from alan ross very dark smooth straight lines and that stubborn emotional mouth one imagines vaguely that ones son will be like oneself but had brandy ever been much like him thinking about it nowperhaps not are we as shallow as that he said aloud defensive brandy answered selfpreserving alan ross ran his hand over his hair most of us avoid looking at the unbearable he said so quietly they could only just hear him especially when there is nothing we can do about it you cant blame a woman who doesnt choose to know that her husband uses a prostituteparticularly if that prostitute is a child to accept that the child is also a boy would force her to leave him we all know that divorce ruins a woman even to quite moderate society she ceases to exist she would be an object of intolerable pity not to mention the obscene imaginations and suggestions of the less charitable no he shook his head in a fierce little gesture her only option is to connive at his secrecy and never in any circumstances allow herself to kill the last precious doubt there is nothing else she can afford to do for once brandy was silenced balantyne stared at the flames of a candelabra he tried to imagine what it might be like trapped in such a relationship suspecting and yet knowing you dare not acknowledge such a truth in fact for your own survival and perhaps the survival of your children you must be the most ardent accomplice in hiding it it had never occurred to him that augusta was anything but a virtuous and satisfied wife was that insufferably complacent of himblindly stupidly insensitive or was it simply a measure of his trust in her even perhaps a kind of happiness he had never used a prostitute in his life even in his early army days there had been the occasional lapse of course before he was marriedbut for mutual pleasure never for money but after that he had not ever questioned his moral duty to abstinence when either he or augusta were away from home or indisposed augusta was not a passionate woman perhaps decency precluded it and he had long ago disciplined himself to master his own body and its demands upon him such control was part of the mind of a soldier exhaustion pain and loneliness must be governed alan ross sat back im sorry he said running his hand over his hair again it was not a suitable subject to discuss i have spoiled your dinner no balantyne swallowed and dragged his thoughts back what you said is true he corrected quickly the situation is hideous but you cannot blame people for not acknowledging what can only destroy them god knowsa man who procures prostitutes is barely fit to live but murder cannot be the answer and this mutilation is barbaric have you ever been to the devils acre papa brandy spoke without fire now his face somber or any of our other slums balantyne knew what he was thinking in the fight for survival in grinding hopeless poverty what else could people be but barbaric memories of army camps came back to him of the crimea of scutari of sudden and violent deathof what men do in towns during the weeks and the nights waiting for battle any day their bodies could be mangled faceless under the sun of africa or frozen in the himalayan snows if he did not really know brandy neither did brandy know him ive been thirty years in the army brandy he replied i know what can happen to people is that an answer no brandy drank the last of his port only i dont find it acceptable to avoid the question anymore balantyne stood up we had better rejoin the ladies in the withdrawing room before they realize we have been discussing this subject again alan ross rose also i know a member of parliament id like to see do you wish to come brandy we might be of assistance to him i hear he has some sort of bill to put before the house what about brandy followed them child prostitution of course ross replied opening the door but dont mention it in front of christina if you dont mind i think the subject is one that distresses her balantyne was pleased he had thought from her remarks that she merely considered the matter in ill taste rather than painful this was entirely different he was ashamed for having misjudged her but there was nothing he could say to apologize would only betray the thought just before midnight when the others had gone balantyne followed augusta slowly up the stairs you know i like alan ross better each time i see him christina is very fortunate he remarked she turned and looked at him coldly and what do you mean by that precisely what i saidthat with the best intention one may still find that a person is not what one had hoped alan ross is even more than we might have presumed on our early acquaintance not on mine she answered firmly do you imagine i would have permitted my daughter to marry a man of whose worth i was not sure he was surprisingly stung and spoke the truth without thinking it is difficult to know how much choice we had in the matter with christina augustas eyes were as unfamiliar as those of some stranger he had accidentally jostled in the street the sense of comfort he had felt at the dinner table among the wineglasses vanished like an illusion i have every choice she said cuttingly i see to it that i do do you imagine that i am incompetent that was one thought that had never crossed his mind since the day he had first met her at her comingout ball she had been formidably composed even then her lack of nervousness the fact that she neither flirted nor giggled was among the things that had attracted him the memory was of too long ago he tried to recapture the feeling he had had thenthe excitement the sense of anticipationand it eluded him vaguely it hurt the qualities that had delighted him then were now frightening like a closed door dont be ridiculous he was wounded into a defense of himself affecting the arrogance that had once sat on him so easily i am as well acquainted with christina as you are a lie of majestic proportions she is excessively strongwilled and even you my dear augusta are capable of the occasional error she was tired her face hardened finally shutting him out she turned and continued her way up the stairs her back was straight but she climbed with an effort naturally she said and so are you brandon i wish you would refrain from discussing at the table such disagreeable subjects as slums and their various unfortunatesespecially when we have guests it is illmannered and can only lead to embarrassment i would have expected you to see that for yourself a social conscience is a worthy thing but there are appropriate times and places for exercising it in view of the fact that that wretched footman once served in this house i would be obliged if you would refrain from mentioning him again i do not wish the entire staff sent into hysterics or the next thing we know half of them will be giving noticeand it is hard enough to keep good servants these days as it is she reached the landing and turned for her bedroom good night brandon there was nothing else for him to do but reply and to go on along to his own room he closed the door and stood still the room felt unfamiliar though every furnishing every book and memento had been his for years balantyne was met the following morning in the hall by stride his face white hands knotted in front of him instead of by his sides as usual there were no members of the female staff to be seen for an instant it flashed across balantynes mind that augusta was right all the maids had given notice and fled in the night afraid that they were employed under the same roof as some creature like max and that they might be spirited off to a life of whoredom at any moment stride was waiting his eyes bleak what is it balantyne demanded what has happened the newspapers sir was that all balantyne was furious with relief god damn it man so theyre late if they havent come in an hour send someone out for them he turned to brush past him and go in to breakfast stride stood firm no sir i fear i have not made myself clear the newspapers are hereit is what they contain sir there has been another murder in the devils acre sir this one far worse balantyne could not conceive of anything worse than the mutilation of hubert pinchin his mind fumbled in horror and failed he was not so badly stride hesitated and swallowed so injured sir balantyne was confused and relieved not so badly i thought you said worse strides voice dropped it was sir bertram astley sir he was found outside a house of pleasure for male persons only for male good god you mean a homosexual brothel stride winced he was not accustomed to such vulgar frankness yes sir bertie astley balantyne felt a little sick suddenly the smell of kedgeree drifting from the silver serving dish on the breakfastroom sideboard was nauseating would you like brandy in the library sir stride offered yes please bless the man balantyne had never appreciated him fully before yes i would he started gratefully toward the library what would you like me to tell her ladyship sir balantyne stopped he would like to have protected her from knowing at all it was ugly she should not have to learn about such things tell her there has been another murder reality would be forced upon her anyway he could not shield her from that but better she become acquainted with it by the decent words of someone like stride rather than the anonymous sensationalism of the newspaper or someones unthinking tattle you had better tell her it was sir bertram astley but do not say where he was found quite so sir unfortunately sir bertrams death will become common knowledge quite soon stride said yes balantyne could think of nothing more to say yes thank you stride he went into the library and found the brandy already there on a salver beside the newspaper he poured himself a stiff tot and then sat down to read the corpse of sir bertram astley had been found on the doorstep of a house of dubious repute in the devils acre how idiotically they phrased it the cause of death was a deep stab wound in the back but he had also been slashed across the groin and the pit of the stomach they did not mention the more private organs but the implication was obvious inexplicably the more grotesque for its omission apparently the murderer had intended to mutilate him as he had the previous victims but had been frightened away before he could do more than vent his insane hatred in a single violent sweep of the knife inspector thomas pitt was in charge of this case as he was of the two others balantyne put down the paper and finished the brandy in a single burning gulp pitt had been called for in the predawn darkness by a whitefaced sergeant in a hansom cab the man fumbled with his hat and clung to it with numb fingers as he tried to convey the urgency of his message without articulating the horror he had seen pitt understood there had been another murder only a very grave discovery would bring the sergeant to his door at such an hour its mortal cold outside sir the sergeant offered intending to be helpful thank you pitt put on his jacket and then a voluminous coat that made him look as if a stiff wind might fill him out like a sail he accepted a muffler from the sergeants outstretched hand wound it around his neck jammed on his hat squashing his hair over his ears and opened the front door it was as the sergeant had said mortal cold they sat together in the hansom while it jolted over the uneven cobbles toward the devils acre well pitt asked the sergeant shook his head bad one he said sadly sir bertram astley cut aboutbut notwell not actually in pieces as you might say not mutilated like the others norather looked like our maniac was interrupted bit o late business maybe he shook his head again i dunno pitt was confused bit of late businesswhat do you mean somed say as thats the worst part sir i dunno oos goin to tell is family e was found in the doorway of a brothelfor male persons only oh god pitt suddenly knew why the sergeant felt so awkward why it was all so difficult to put into words how do you tell people like the astleys that the scion of their house has been murdered and indecently wounded in the doorway of a male brothel now he understood the reason for the pity in the sergeants face the unnecessary warning that it was cold outside but before all that he must see the corpse and the place where they had found him sorry sir the sergeant put on his hat and banged it with the flat of his hand who discovered him and when pitt asked constable dabb sir i left im there in charge to see that nothin was moved bright lad saw imsir bertram that isabout quarter past four or a few moments after eard big ben e did body was lyin in the doorway so constable dabb goes over to look at wot es doin there like then o course e sees as es dead we gets a fair few dead uns in the acre and all around there so e dont take all that much notice not like to send for me till is coat falls open and poor dabb sees wots bin done to iswots bin done to im then o course e sends for usotfoot and we sends for you how did you know who he was how long could a dead man lie in the devils acre and not be robbed of everything but his clothes the sergeant understood no money o course but still got is cards and a few letters and the like anyway dont know what the docll say yet but e wont ave bin there that long not moren an hour trade comin and goin d ave fallen over im otherwise course they finish on the early side daylight an they all want to be were they aint ashamed to be seen back at their own tables most like to lead family prayers the contempt in his voice was as thick and pungent as tar although pitt was not sure whether it was for their use of the place itself or for their hypocrisy in hiding it another time perhaps he would ask the hansom jarred to a stop and they both climbed down they were on the southern edge of the acre hard by the river its damp breath swirling up over the rime of ice hardening on the pavement since the rain had stopped above and beyond them in the clogging darkness loomed the gothic towers of the houses of parliament a young constable with a lantern was standing guard over a body crumpled in a doorway all of it but the face covered by a heavy overcoat decency had prompted the constable to hide the face with his own cape and he stood shivering beside it a strange reverence pitt thought that makes us take off our own clothing and stand chilled to the bone in order to clothe the dead already touched with the final coldness of the grave mornin sir the constable said respectfully mornin mr pitt such is fame good morning constable dabb he said returning the compliment it was a mean street smelling of dirt and refuse there were other derelicts asleep in the doorways opposite glanced at in the gray light they did not look significantly different from the corpse of bertram astley how did you know he was dead he asked wondering what had made the constable stop and examine this particular body constable dabb straightened a little west side of the street sir he replied west side winds from the east sir and bin rainin too nobody even a drunk is goin to sleep in the wet when theres shelter twenty feet away on the other side pitt gave him a smile of appreciation then picked up the cape and handed it back to him he bent over the corpse bertram astley had been a handsome man regular features good nose fair hair and side whiskers and very slightly darker mustache his eyes were closed and it was impossible to guess what vitality he might have possessed in life pitt looked down and opened the coat where constable dabbs sense of decency had compelled him to close it over the wound this one was peremptory a single slash not deep there was not a great deal of blood he lifted the shoulders enough to see the back the coat was cut and there was a long dark stain a little to the left of the spine this was the death wound the same as the others he let the body ease back to its position have you sent for the surgeon he asked yes sir of course he had his professional pride would not permit him to forget such a primary task pitt looked around the street there was nothing else unusual it was narrow lined with houses that sagged as timbers rotted and plaster grew mold and bulged crumbling away drains overflowed would anyone have noticed a man carrying a corpse or two people righting he doubted it if there had been a witness entering or leaving the brothel would they ever be foundor speak if they were hardly homosexuality was a crime carrying a long penalty of imprisonment and social ruin for life of course to practice it discreetly was common enough but to force people to admit they were aware of it was utterly different see what else you can do here he instructed do you have the address of the family yes sir the sergeant handed it to him on a slip torn from his notebook pitt sighed then id better go and tell them before the newspapers have time to print a late extra no one should learn of this sort of thing from a paper no sir im afraid there was reporters ere over an hour ago i dont know ow they eard it was not worth discussing there were eyes and ears everywhere people accustomed to death and keen for a sixpence to let some newshound be the first to run to fleet street with material for glaring headlines pitt climbed back into the hansom and gave the driver the address of the astleys london house there was faint light in the sky when he stepped out and dismissed the cab he had no idea how long he would be the street was almost deserted a kitchenmaid carried out rubbish a bootboy slammed a back door only the servants quarters were alive he climbed the steps to the front door and knocked a footman looking sur prised answered pitt did not give him time to make judgments good morning he said firmly i am from the police i am afraid i have very serious news to deliver will you please conduct me to a suitable place and inform the head of the family and you had better bring brandy or whatever you consider best for the treatment of shock the footman was stunned he made no protest as pitt stepped in past him and closed the door sir bertram he began is not at home i know pitt interrupted quietly i am afraid he is dead oh the footman attempted to collect himself but the situation was beyond him i had he swallowed i had better fetch mr hodge the butlerand mr beau sir bertrams brother and before pitt could speak the footman flung open the door of the cold morning room where a maid had cleaned the grate but not yet lit the fire sir he left pitt to fend for himself and disappeared toward the back of the dark hallway the green baize door and safety pitt stared around the room it was full of rich furniture much of it exotic lacquered japanese tables inlaid ebony intaglio french watercolors on the wall the astleys lacked neither taste nor money to indulge themselves and their choice was exceedingly catholic an elderly butler came in soberfaced a silver tray with brandy and french leadcrystal glasses in his hand is frederick correct sir that sir bertram has met with an accident and is dead there was no purpose in lying the butler would be the one who would have to control the staff and see that during the first days distress of the family all the necessary duties of the household were continued i am sorry it was not an accident sir bertram was murdered oh dear hodge set the brandy down sharply on the table oh dear he had not managed to think of anything else to say when a few moments later a young man opened the door and stood staring he was still dressed in night attire and robe his fair hair was damp from his morning ablutions but he was not yet shaved there was a marked resemblance between his features and those of the dead man the same good nose and broad brow but this face even in the tight expectancy of fear was animated there were lines of humor about the mouth and the eyes were wide and blue he closed the door what is it pitt realized how fortunate he had been with mullen and valeria pinchin he thought he had remembered how hard it was but the impact was there all over again i am sorry sir he replied very quietly it was easier to say it all at once more merciful than spinning it out a detail at a time i have to tell you that we have just discovered the body of your brother sir bertram in the devils acre i am afraid he has been murdered in a similar manner to dr hubert pinchin although he was far less mutilated he stopped there seemed nothing more to say im sorry sir he repeated beau astley stood perfectly still for several seconds then straightened his shoulders and walked over to the table hodge offered him the brandy but he ignored it in the devils acre was it worse to ask now in the numbness of shock or later when the anesthesia had worn off and the wound was raw and inescapable either way there was only one answer pitt could act on do you know what sir bertram might have been doing in that area beau astley looked up then at last he took hodges brandy and drank it in two gulps he poured himself two more fingers and drank it also i suppose there is no point in lying inspector bertie gambled occasionally not much and i dont think he ever lost in fact i think he won most of the time usually he went to one or the other of the gentlemens clubs but once in a while he liked to go slumming somewhere like whitechapel or the acre cant think whydisgusting places he paused as if the incomprehensibility of it might yet make it untrue pitt was surprised in his state of shock beau astley was so jarred out of his normal composure that he seemed not even to resent a policeman in his own morning room asking him personal questions about his family there was no condescension in his voice and sir bertram went gambling yesterday evening pitt pursued beau reached for a chair and hodge pulled it in position for him immediately he sat down hodge retreated silently and closed the door behind him no beau put his head in his hands and stared at the table no thats it he went to call upon may he was invited there to dinner may oh of course you wouldnt know miss woolmer she and bertie were to be betrothedat least i think so oh god id better go and tell her i cant let her find out from the police or some idiotic gossip he looked up without hope i suppose theres no chance of keeping it out of the newspapers my father is deadbut mother lives in gloucestershire ill have to write his voice trailed off im sorry the newspapers had already been there by the time i was called myself pitt replied in an area like that sixpence is a lot of money he thought he did not need to explain further of course beau was suddenly terribly tired his face leached of the animation that had been there only minutes before do you mind if i get dressed and go to miss woolmer immediately i dont want her to hear it from anyone else no sir that would be by far the best thing pitt said he watched as beau stood up he must tell him the rest it would be common knowledge by late morning iim afraid there is one more thing sir he was found in a mosthe searched for the right worda most unfortunate place you said the devils acre yes sirbut in the doorway of a brothel for men only beaus face tightened in an attempt at a smile he was past any further shock surely brothels are inspector pitt hated telling him already he liked the man no he said very quietly in most brothels the staff are female he let it hang beaus dark blue eyes widened thats ridiculous bertie wasnt no pitt said quickly he was neari expect that was merely where his attacker caught up with him but i had to warn youthe newspapers will possibly mention it beau ran his hand through the hair that was falling forward over his brow yes i suppose they will they cant leave the prince of wales alone so they certainly wont have any compunction about bertie if youll excuse me ill go and get dressed hodge will get you a brandy or something he was gone before pitt could thank him pitt decided to ask for hot tea and perhaps a slice of toast the thought was enough to make him even more conscious of the cold void inside him to look at a corpse was grim but the dead were beyond feeling it was telling the living that hurt pitt and made him feel guilty and helpless he was the bringer of pain the onlooker shielded from everything but its mirror image he would take his tea in the kitchen there was nothing else he could ask beau astley at the moment but there might be something to be learned in the servants quarters even inadvertently then later when the first news had been broken he would have to see miss may woolmer who apparently had been the last person they knew of to talk with bertram astley before he left for the devils acre during that brief respite in the kitchens warmth nursing a mug of tea pitt learned a great deal of detail from hodge the footman the valet and from several of the maids later he had an excellent luncheon with the entire staff very sober at their long table housemaids were sniffling footmen silent cook and kitchenmaid rednosed but none of it as far as he could judge amounted to anything other than the outline of an ordinary young man of title of very much more than adequate means and extremely pleasing looks his character had not been unusual a little selfish as one might expect in an elder son who had known from birth that he had the exclusive right of inheritance but if he had practiced either malice or outward greed it appeared his household had been blind to it his personal habits had been typical a little highspirited gambling now and thenbut who did not if he could afford it occasionally he drank rather too much but he was neither quarrelsome nor licentious none of the maids had complained and he was not niggardly with the expenses of the house altogether he was a fine gentleman a little after two oclock pitt was permitted into the woolmer house again reluctantly and only in order to keep him from being observed importuning on the doorstep by inquisitive neighbors no one wished it known that there were police in the house whatever the reason miss woolmer will be unable to see you the footman said coolly she has received news of a bereavement and is indisposed i am aware of the bereavement pitt answered unfortunately because sir bertram apparently dined here yesterday i am obliged to ask miss woolmer what she may know of his frame of mind any remark he may have made as to his intentions the man stared at him abhorring his crassness im sure if miss woolmer knows anything of value to you she will be happy to inform you when she is recovered he said coldly all day pitt had felt nothing but grief now at last he found release for it in anger i am afraid the pursuit of murder cannot wait upon the convenience of miss woolmer he retorted there is an insane creature loose in the devils acre three people have been murdered and mutilated already and if we do not catch him there is no reason to doubt there will be a fourth and a fifth there is no time to wait upon indisposition will you please inform miss woolmer that i regret the necessity of disturbing her at such a time pitt continued but she may be able to give me information that will assist us to arrest whoever killed sir bertram the footmans face was white yesif it is unavoidable he conceded grudgingly he left pitt alone and went down the hall searching in his mind for words to relay the order more than half an hour passed before pitt was shown into the withdrawing room a place crowded with pictures ornaments lace crochetwork and embroidery a brilliant fire burned and all the lamps were lit of course the curtains were lowered as suited a house suffering a violent bereavement may woolmer was a remarkably handsome girl with a fine figure now draped in elegant grief on a chaise longue she was dressed in dove grayneither too colorful for such a delicate moment nor yet an ostentatious display of her feelings her hair was thick and shining like honey and her features were regular she stared at pitt with her large widespaced eyes and held a handkerchief in one white hand mrs woolmer stood behind her like a sentry her large bosom encased in beaded purple suitable for half mourning very appropriate in such awkward circumstances her hair was as fair as her daughters but faded in patches and her face was heavier her chin too soft her throat thick without question she was grossly offended and pitt was the obvious target for her wrath he was here and she assumed he was without defense she glared at him i cannot imagine why you feel it necessary to intrude upon our distress she said icily i trust you have sufficient good taste to be brief pitt wanted to be equally rude in return to tell her what be believed good taste really was a matter of selfmastery of consideration so that you did not avoidably discomfort others least of all those unable to retaliate i shall try to maam he said simply mr beau astley tells me that sir bertram expected to dine here yesterday evening did he in fact do so they did not invite him to sit down and mrs woolmer still remained standing on guard yes he did she answered bluntly what time did he leave a little after eleven i cannot tell you precisely was he in good health and good spirits it was almost a meaningless question if they had had a furious quarrel neither of these women would be in the least likely to tell him excellent mrs woolmer lifted her chin sir bertram was always most happy here he was devoted to my daughter in fact he had approached me with a view to asking for her hand she took a breath and a shadow of indecision flickered across her face was that a lie that no one could now disprove nobeau astley had said much the same then why the doubt had there been some illfeeling last night a change of mind i am most distressed for you maam he said automatically did sir bertram say anything about where he intended to go after he left here her eyebrows went up whyhome i assume i cant understand it may spoke for the first time she had a pleasant voice a little soft but agreeably low i simply cannot understand it at all of course you cant mrs woolmer said irritably it is incomprehensible to any person of decency one may only assume he was kidnapped that is the course you should follow mr she disregarded his name hunching one shoulder to indicate its unimportance poor sir bertram must have been abducted then when the perpetrators of this crime became aware of whom they had taken they were afraid perhaps bertie fought them may suggested tears came to her eyes how brave of him he would mrs woolmer liked that explanation it is perfectly dastardly that is what must have occurred i am sure of it i dont know why we pay the police when they allow such things to happen pitt had already questioned the astley coachman over luncheon sir bertram did not leave in his own carriage he said aloud i beg your pardon mrs woolmer had expected an apology or an attempt at defense not this extraordinary question no may answered for her he dismissed his own brougham and then had willis call him a hansom we offered to have our carriage take him but he would not hear of it he was most considerate she dabbed at her cheek with her handkerchief most if only we had been more persuasive he might not have been abducted mrs woolmer still directed the accusation at pitt it was the police who were at fault people of quality should not have to protect themselves from blackguards in the streets it was possible that astley had been abducted but extremely unlikely still if the woolmers did not know of his habit of occasionally slumming in the devils acre there was no point in telling them now they would probably not believe him anyway and perhaps this anger was their way of encountering grief it was not uncommon in illness it was the doctor who could not save who received the blame in crime it was the police pitt looked at them may still adhered to the rules for a young ladys behavior none of the awkwardness of real grief showed yet her feet were tucked carefully on the chaise longue her skirt draped in the most modestly becoming folds her hands were twisted a little in her lap but they were still beautiful the lines were composed serene she could have sat just so for a neoclassical painter had they removed threequarters of the decoration from the tables and the pianoforte behind her mrs woolmer was bracing herself like britannia to repel the foe they were both gathering their thoughts out of the confusion and would betray nothing yet there was no point in pressing them they had not really understood in time it would comeperhaps a memory of some word or gesture that mattered he left in a hansom about eleven he repeated and as far as you know he was in good health and spirits and intended returning directly home precisely mrs woolmer agreed i do not know what else you imagined we could tell you only the time maam and the means of transport and that as far as you know he had no intention of calling upon anyone else she blew down her nose with a little snort reminding him of a dray horse then if that is all perhaps you would be kind enough to take your leave and permit us to be alone he went outside past the footman and down the step into the street he started to walk east again facing into the wind he wondered what may woolmer was like when her mother was not present had bertram astley loved her she was undoubtedly handsome and well mannered enough to make any gentleman a wife acceptable to society did she also have wit and courage the honesty to laugh at herself and to praise others without grudge was she gentle or had bertie astley even considered such things perhaps beauty and a temperate disposition were enough they were for most men and what was it he had seen in beau astleys face at the instant thought of may even in the moment of his own bereavement had that been love also he would have to remember next time he saw him that he was now sir beau and presumably a considerably wealthier man after the appropriate interval would he step into his brothers shoes and marry may woolmer as well it was not unlikely that mrs woolmer would do her best to see that he did there were not so many eligible young men around with titles and money and it was late in the yearthe next season was almost on them pitt pulled his coat collar up the east wind had a breath of sleet in it he hated the thought of examining the private failures and weaknesses of the astleys lives in the morning he was sent for by his superior dudley athelstan was standing in his office his suit fit him as immaculately as the tailors art could contrive but his tie was askew and his collar seemed too tight for him the mornings newspapers lay spread over his great desk pitt pitt come in weve got to do something about thisits appalling commissioners been to see me about it came here himself next thing ill be getting letters from the prime minister over three murders in a slum pitt looked at the chaos on the desk and at athelstans flushed face therell be a new society scandal for them to talk about in a day or two and theyll forget it you swear that athelstans eyes bulged and he threw his hands up youll arrange one will you great heaven man have you got any idea what this latest murder has done decent men are terrified to he stopped abruptly to go into the devils acre pitt finished for him smiling athelstan grunted its all very well for you to be pious pitt you dont have to explain yourself to these peoplethank god or wed have the whole police force thrown out on its ear some very influential men find the odd entertainment in establishments like max burtons they accept the risk of being overcharged even robbed outright in the street or the occasional roughing up but being murdered and emasculated godit doesnt bear thinking of and the scandal the shame perhaps its an ardent reformer trying to put the whorehouses out of business pitt said his tongue in his cheek damn your impertinence athelstan replied without heat this is no time for levity pitt he ran his fingers inside his collar to ease it ive got to get this solved and the maniac responsible in bedlam where he belongs and i dont care if hes a demented clergyman trying to clear up hell singlehanded or a greedy pimp who thinks he can carve himself an empire what have you got so far very little sir dont make excuses damn it facts witnesseswhat do we know pitt repeated the few medical facts thats not much use athelstan said desperately no witnesses pitt added none at all pitt shrugged with a faint smile did you expect any do any of your outraged correspondents say they were there athelstan gave him a filthy look what about other pimpswhores vagrantsanyone no athelstan shut his eyes damn damn damn weve got to get this tidied up pitt he put his hands to his face can you imagine what theyll do to us if the next victim is one of the nobility or a member of parliament theyll crucify us what do they expect us to do patrol the streets of the acre where the whorehouses are dont be idiotic they want us to get rid of this lunatic and get things back to normal he stared at pitt his eyes pleading and weve got to do it find your snouts your informersuse money if necessary not much mind dont lose your head someonell talk someone knows look for motives rivalries jealousy see who was losing money my advice is find who killed the pimp max and the rest will follow what is the connection between max and this dr pinchin we havent found one yet pitt aware of his failure felt his face tighten well get out there and look for it athelstan clenched his fists and for gods sake find it pitt lock someone up weve got to stop thisthis his hand knocked the nearest newspaper onto the floor exposing a pile of letters on embossed notepaper theyre panicking important people are very upset pitt shoved his hands into his pockets yesim sure they are well get on with it athelstan shouted in exasperation get out there and do something yes sir accordingly pitt went back to the devils acre to question ambrose mercutt more precisely over his rivalry with max he found him dressed in a scarlet robe with velvet collar and cuffs and in a remarkably ill humor i dont know what on earth you expect of me he said exasperatedly ive no idea who killed the wretched man ive already told you everything i can think of good heavens he had enough enemies you seem to be the most obvious among them mr mercutt pitt was armed with the additional research of two more constables and was in no frame of mind to be patronized by an effete pimp dressed in a red robe at ten oclock in the morning max burton had taken a considerable amount of your custom and at least four of your best whores he was a very great threat to your livelihood nonsense with a wave of his long fingers ambrose dismissed the idea as ludicrous i told you before women come and go and in time theyd have left burton and gone to someone else anyway it was nothing out of the ordinary if you were remotely competent at your job inspector you would start looking at some of those married women he used try louisa crabbe ill wager you havent even thought of that have you his eyes gleamed with malicious satisfaction as he saw pitts surprise noi thought not i wonder what albert crabbe thought of max ill wager hed have been delighted to cut him to pieces in the most disgustingly intimate way he screwed up his face such vulgarity was offensive he made a more than comfortable living out of the physical appetites of others but he found such things distasteful himself he sat down and crossed his legs the thought flickered through pitts mind that louisa crabbe was an invention but ambroses face was too secure too satisfied indeed pitt said with as little expression as he could and where do i find this albert crabbe ambrose smiled my dear inspector are you completely incapable how in gods name do i know look through maxs bookstheres bound to be some record of how he contacted her he suited the women to the client you know this is not a merely haphazard business one has to have a certain flair we at this end of the market are not common takeyourchance whorehouses thank you pitt said sarcastically i confess i had not fully appreciated your entrepreneurial art what pitt did not bother to explain he felt a flicker of satisfaction but it was a poor victory and he knew it the aftertaste was thin i imagine louisa crabbe was not the only onesimply the only one whose name you care to give me pitt said i told you inspector max burton was of no importance to me ambroses face was smooth again unconcerned i didnt bother to keep up with his comings and goings why should i i have a steady clientele and i do very nicely naturally there were those he hurt in the way of taking their business if i were you id ask the daltons theyre in the cheap end of the trade i dare say they had cause to be upset with max pitt could go back to the police station and find out about the daltons but he could not be bothered to pretend his pride was not worth it where are they he asked a smile of superiority touched ambroses mouth crossgate street really inspector what would you do without me ask someone else pitt replied dont tempt me to think if the devils acre were not such a cesspit id be inclined to work for one whorehouse the fewer he glanced round the pale room but what difference would it make have you ever read of the labors of hercules ambrose knew he was being insulted both directly and obscurely he resented the one he did not understand the more no perhaps not pitt answered his own question look up the augean stables sometime we might consider diverting the thames i havent the slightest idea what youre talking about ambrose snapped hadnt you better get on with your job it doesnt strike me youve made so much progress that you can afford to stand around here wasting your timeand mine it was hurtfully true and with hubert pinchin and bertie astley also dead the motive for the murder of max was becoming less and less important anyway was sir bertram astley ever a customer of yours pitt asked as a parting shot from the doorway ambrose raised his thready eyebrows really inspector do you imagine i ask gentlemen for their names dont be naive no i didnt imagine you asked them ambrose pitt replied levelly but i most certainly imagined you knew ambrose smiled in an obscure way it was an admission of his competence of his professional skill indecision wavered for a moment in his face then disappeared no he said at last not bertram astleynor dr pinchin either his smile widened sorry pitt believed him the indecision he judged not to be whether to admit to it but whether to brag a little and pad out the importance of his clienteleand by implication the fact that he had nothing to fear from max no pitt glanced around the room again and allowed a faint curl to his lip noi imagine not he closed the door on ambroses hot eyes and the flare of sudden anger on his face crossgate street was dirty and cold but pitt had no difficulty locating the daltons establishment it was large and seemed to be cheerful full of gaudy red and pink furnishings and there was a fire in the main receiving room even though it was the middle of the afternoon apparently the daltons catered to clients around the clock the place did not have the stale acrid smell of a public house in offbusiness hours it seemed they kept maids like any domestic establishment he was met by a plump roundfaced girl ordinary enough with a countryfresh complexion pitt felt a twinge of pity that she should be engaged in such an occupation still she was far better off in a bawdy house such as this with a roof over her head and regular meals than many another woman who walked the streets looking for any man who would buy her body for the price of a days food for her child or a piece of clothing for its back he saved her the indignity of importuning him im here from the police he said immediately i want to speak to mr dalton he may be able to help me with some information mroh comprehension and amusement flooded her face you mean miss dalton would that be miss mary or miss victoria sir although im not rightly sure as theyll want to be seein the police miss it had not occurred to him that the daltons would be women although there was no reason why not there was an air of femininity about the place a simple sensuality that was less selfconscious and infinitely less effete than the house of either max or ambrose mercutt somehow he found it less offensive although he could not think why either miss dalton will do he answered and i am sorry but i insist upon seeing them it is a matter of murder if they make it necessary i shall return with other officers and things may become unpleasant i cannot imagine that anyone will wish that it is bad for business the girl looked startled his manner was courteous his voice so very civilized and yet what he said jarred if youll wait here she scuttled away and immediately pitt was sorry he had had no need to be so harsh but it was impossible to undo it now barely moments later a slightly older woman appeared perhaps in her early thirties buxomly built with a blunt handsome face and a dusting of freckles on her skin she looked like a competent parlormaid on her day off her dress was high to her neck and of plain lavender color there was no paint on her face that pitt could see i am victoria dalton she said civilly violet says you are from the police and you wish to speak to me would you like to come into the parlor at the back violet will bring us tea feeling ludicrous as if he had made a wild error of judgment pitt silently followed her trim back as she walked out of the big red and pink hall with its sofas and cushions along a corridor and into a small more intimate room where there was another fire burning from somewhere upstairs he heard the peal of womans laughter followed by a shriek of delight and a fit of giggles he did not hear any man apparently it was two women recounting exploits to each othernot a matter of trade victoria dalton sat down on a large green sofa and invited pitt to make himself comfortable on a similar one opposite her she folded her hands in her lap and stared at him pleasantly well what is it you wish of us he was a little taken aback she was so composed so totally different from max or ambrose mercutt this place was like a middleclass house comfortable with an air of family about it he felt impelled to use euphemisms which was ridiculous i am investigating a murder maam he began not as he had intended somehow she had put him out of ease in fact three murders how unpleasant she spoke as if he had remarked upon the weather she continued to regard him candidly like an obedient child waiting for him to continue it was disconcerting either she had not fully understood him or else death was so commonplace it held no power to shock her meeting her steady gray eyes he believed it was the latter the maid brought the tea and left it on a tray for them victoria dalton poured and handed him a cup he accepted it with thanks he began again the first victim was max burton he kept a house in george street perhaps you knew of him of course she said we knew he had been murdered he was good at his business why was he finding it so hard to question her was it because she gave him no openings and unlike ambrose mercutt was not defensive oh yes she answered he had a remarkable talent for the first time her face showed some expression one of anger her full lips turned down at the corners but pitt had the odd conviction that it was a reflection of disapproval not any sense of personal injury ambrose mercutt says he used a number of wellborn women in his george street establishment pitt went on she gave a slight smile yes ambrose mercutt would tell you that is it true oh yes max was very clever he was very attractive to women you know and there is a certain class of women wellborn idle married for convenience to some bloodless manprobably a great deal older than themselves poor in the bedroom without appetite or imaginationand they become bored max appealed to them they began by having an affair with him then he introduced them to the top end of the trade he could get a high price for whores like that she discussed it as any merchant might speak of her goods a marketing process did he take any of your custom he asked equally bluntly she was quite sober not much we provide skill rather than novelty most of these wellborn women have more sense of adventure moreshe frowned a littlemore need to fill their boredom than patience or knowledge how to please a good whore has humor and generosity and doesnt ask questions she smiled bleakly as well as a good deal of practice she was so used to the idea that it was ordinary to her the traffic in womanhood was her daily life and it did not move her emotions to know her business was necessary for survival what about ambrose mercutt he changed direction oh yes ambrose was suffering she said he caters to the same trade gentlemen with jaded tastes who want something novel something to stimulate their imagination and are prepared to pay for it now there was real contempt in her face her eyes narrowed and there was a sudden brilliant glitter in them that could even have been hatred but for whom he had no idea perhaps for those rich spoiled women with money and time to dabble in whoredom for entertainmenther women did it to live perhaps for ambrose because he pandered to them or maybe for the men who made it all worthwhile by paying or was it hatred for max because he had taken her trade after all or something he had not even considered yet could she even have been attracted to max herself it was conceivable she was young the curves of her mouth were soft and rich was maxs killing simply the rage of a woman rejected considered in that light though hubert pinchins death made no sense where did he meet these highborn women he asked instead not here in the acre the emotion died from her face her eyes were calm again like gray water with flecks of slate in them oh no he went to some of the dining places and theaters where such women go she replied he had been a footman in a big househe knew how to behave he was very striking to look at and he had good clothes he had an art to sense when a woman was dissatisfied and he knew which ones had the nerve or the desperation to do something about it once again pitt was forced to acknowledge that max had had a talent of massive proportions and had exercised it to the full but if it was immense it was also dangerous what happened when these women grew bored or frightened society would turn a blind eye to a great deal but whoring for money in the devils acre was grossly beyond its capacity to ignore there was an almost infinite difference between what a man might do and get away withas long as he was discreetand what a woman any woman might be forgiven sexual appetite was part of a mans nature abhorred by the sanctimonious but acceptedeven made the butt of sly jokesand given a certain reluctant admiration by most but by convention men chose to believe that women were different only harlots took pleasure in the bedroom to sell ones body was sin unto damnation and when these women of maxs saw their safetytheir marriagesimperiled what did they do did max allow them to leave quietly as secretly as they had come and then obliterate their names from his memory or did he keep an eternal whip held over them the reasons for murder were legion victoria dalton was still regarding him soberly he had no idea how much of his thought she had guessed have you ever heard of a dr hubert pinchin he asked her he was murdered also wasnt he it was a statement not a question that was some distance from here no i dont think i knew anything about him she hesitated not under that name anyway people here dont always give their own names you know she kept all but a shadow of her contempt out of her voice he was stocky running to paunch pitt said starting to describe pinchin as he had seen him dead in the slaughterhouse yard yet trying to recreate him alive in his minds eye he had thinning graybrown hair a broad rather squashy nose mouth apparently goodhumored small eyes and a plumcolored complexion he wore baggy clothes he liked stilton cheese and good wine she smiled there are a lot of gentlemen in london like that and a great many of them with unfriendly wives of forbidding virtue find their way here at some time or another that described valeria pinchin remarkably well it would not be surprising if hubert pinchin had found his way to victoria daltons house a place of considerable laughter and purchased pleasure fat pillows soft bosoms lush hips and obliging habits yes i imagine so he said unhappily what about sir bertram astleyyoung fair goodlooking quite tall he had forgotten to ascertain the color of his eyes but the description was useless anyway there must be several hundred young men in london even with breeding and money who would answer it not by name she answered patiently and we do not pry its bad for business that was unarguable it began to look more and more as if it were a random lunatic with some passionate hatred of masculinity perhaps some man injured or impotent himself tormented by it until his mind had turned that was an unsatisfactory answer but so far he had discovered no connection however tenuous between max dr pinchin and sir bertram astley perhaps if he pursued maxs conquests something would emerge some woman known to all of themperhaps used by all of them yes a revengecrazed husband was not impossible or even if the woman herself had been blackmailed she might have hired some ruffian to blot out all traces of her aberration there were plenty in the devils acre who would do such a thing for a small fee small compared to the ruin that might face her and if she spoke to the ruffian anonymously well cloaked and hooded she might be safe enough afterward but why the terrible mutilation his stomach tightened and he felt sick again at the memory of pinchin with his dismembered genitals perhaps it was a husband who had done it after all or a father there was too much hate involved for something as cold as money the speculation was useless until he had more information he stood up thank you miss dalton you have been most helpful why was he being so polite almost deferential to this woman she was a bawdyhouse keeper like ambrose mercutt and max himself maybe it was a mark of his own worth and had nothing to do with her if i can think of anything else i need to ask i shall come back she stood also of course good day mr pitt the maid showed him out into the grimy street the already darkening afternoon the stink of sewage came up from the river and the long moan of a foghorn sounded as barges gunwale deep made their way toward the pool of london and the busiest docks in the world perhaps it was not even the same murderer in all three cases they had been given wide publicity maybe one at least was a copycat crime what about beau astley with his brothers title fortuneand possibly even may woolmerto inherit why should he be surprised to find the devils work here in the devils acre the murder of bertram astley was on the front pages of all the newspapers the public was outraged under the shrill cries of horror of the offense to decency beneath even the compassion there was a hard real feeling of fear close and personal if a man like astley could be so obscenely murdered for no apparent reason who was safe in the streets of course it was not said openly there were letters to the editor requiring more action from the police more efficiency men of better discipline and intelligence there was a demand to know whose errors were being hidden by this silence was there corruption in high places that these monstrous crimes were still unsolved one elderly gentleman even suggested that the devils acre be burned to the ground and all its denizens transported to australia forthwith charlotte put down the paper and tried to clear the echoes of hysteria from her mind to think what kind of man bertram astley might have been everything she had read was filtered by the rosy gloss of emotion that allowed no evil thought of the dead simplicity is so much easier grand sweeps of feeling that are full of dramatic blacks and whites max was evil astley an innocent victim the police either fiddled or worse were corrupt either way society itself was in peril and pitt was working from before dawn till long after dark when he came home more often than not he was too tired to speak but where did one even begin to look for a random lunatic she must help of course she could not tell him he had specifically forbidden her to meddle in this affair but that was before bertram astley when it had involved only people quite outside her social knowledge now things were different surely emily would know the astleys or someone of their acquaintance through whom an introduction might be scraped she would have to be very discreet if pitt found out before she achieved something significantly helpful he would be furious gracie she called cheerfully gracie must not even guess with the best will in the world the girl was totally transparent yes maam gracies head appeared around the door her eyebrows raised her glance fell to the newspaper oooisnt it terrible maam theres bin another one a real gentleman this time with a proper title an all i dont know wot the worlds comin to i dont well perhaps thats just as well charlotte said briskly i never did approve much of second sight smacks of superstition to me and only causes a lot of trouble gracie was nonplussed as she was intended to be maam dont dwell on it gracie charlotte stood up its all miles from here and doesnt have anything to do with anyone we know she passed her the paper here use it to light the fire in the parlor later but theres the master maam gracie protested pardon e as to do with it poor man e looked proper froze yesterdy night wen e came ome an i think e still dont know as oo done it any moren we do beggin your pardon maam if im bein impertinent a trace of anxiety passed over her face but i reckon as es chasin the forces o evil stuff and nonsense its a lunatic now stop thinking about it put the newspaper on the back of the fire and get on with your work im going to order myself a new dress im going for a fitting this morning ooh gracies eyes lit up immediately a new dress was more fun than a murder second hand what color maam are you going to ave it that new line down the front thats in the pictures in the london illustrated its too fashionable charlotte bought what she could afford i dont like following everyone else as if i were a sheep without a mind of my own quite right maam gracie said she also had an excellent mind for the practical get a good color i always says and the restll take care of itself as long as you smiles at people polite like but not so friendly as to lead em on excellent advice charlotte nodded but i shall take a little look and see what other people are wearing all the same so i may not be back for luncheon yes maam never hurry a new dress charlotte arrived at emilys house to find her sister out at the dressmakers herself and was obliged to wait nearly an hour for her to return how on earth can you go visiting seamstresses on a morning like this she demanded as soon as emily was in the room for goodness sake dont you read the newspapers emily stopped short then her face tightened you mean about bertie astley charlotte there is nothing we can do thomas already told you not to meddle that was before when it only concerned pimps and that odd doctor now it has struck one of our own social circle you mean my social circle emily closed the door and came over to stand in front of the fire actually i dont know the astleys but i dont see what good it would do if i did oh dont be so stupid charlotte lost her patience what do you suppose bertie astley was doing in the devils acre in the middle of the night visiting a house of pleasure you mean a whorehouse emily winced dont be so coarse charlotte you are beginning to lose your refinement thomas is right you shouldnt meddle in this affairit is not our sort of case at all not even if bertie astley knew max and they were involved in something togetherwith dr pinchin charlotte dangled the most tempting bait she could think of a really firstclass scandal emily was silent for a moment fashion could become extremely tedious removed from anything that really mattered who cared whether someone had a subtler color or a lower neckline even gossip at this time of the year was distinctly jaded that would be different she said and very serious it would mean it was not a lunatic at all but someone perfectly sane and very dreadful quite emily shivered as her ideas changed altogether where should we start that was less easy the practical possibilities open to them were very few the astleys charlotte decided after a moment there isnt anywhere else we might be able to discover exactly why he was in the acre and if he knew either max or dr pinchin what does thomas say charlotte was perfectly honest he is too tired to say anything much he hardly ever tells me about this case just the odd word theres been a lot of public outcry and the police are being accused of inefficiency even corruption that removed the last shred of reluctant conscience from emilys mind then we must help i dont know the astleys personally but i do know he was paying considerable attention to may woolmer everyone has been wondering if she would catch him she is this seasons newest beauty not my taste actually very handsome i suppose in a creamy sort of way like an extremely wellbred dairymaid and about as interesting oh dear charlotte pictured something in frills carrying a bucket oh theres nothing whatsoever wrong with her emily backtracked a step or two but that in itself is bound to grow tiresome in time she is as predictable as a jug of milk whatever did bertie astley want to marry her for has she money or influence charlotte inquired hopefully none at all but her manners are perfect and she is certainly extremely agreeable and all that rich white flesh is attractive to some men considering emilys slender shoulders and slight bosom charlotte forbore from making comment on the subject instead she recalled a fragment of a remark pitt had made when he was too tired to guard his tongue thomas says that max even had women of good breeding and family working for him sometimes good god emilys chin dropped in incredulity you mean for moneywith oh no apparently amazement superseded disbelief and then a reluctant thrill of horror charlotte are you sure im sure thats what thomas said but whatever kind of wellbred woman would need money so badly she could think of i simply cannot imagine it not out of need married women out of boredom or frustrationthe way men gamble with more money than they can afford to lose or drive crazy races with a fourinhand and get themselves half killed when they turn over did he keep booksmax i dont know and i havent thought it wise to ask thomas yet but emily if we really tried surely we could discover who some of these women might be perhaps one of them killed max because he was blackmailing her wouldnt let her go that would be a real reason worth killing for emily pursed her mouth doubtfully but what about dr pinchin brothels must need doctors sometimes mustnt they maybe he was in partnership with max perhaps he put up the money or found the women through his practice he would be in a position to know and bertie astley maybe he was a customer and recognized her that would account for why he was not so badlyhurt that doesnt make sense if it was her husband who killed them he would hate bertie just as much well maybe it wasnt but someone did charlotte we shouldnt emily let out a long breath ive met may woolmer two or three times we could go and convey our condolences to her ive got black accessories you can borrow weve got to start somewhere well go this afternoon what are you going to tell thomas youre a terrible liaryou always say too much and end up by giving yourself away i told gracie i was going to the dressmaker emily grunted and gave her a suspicious look then i suppose i had better give you a dressfor your alibi thank you charlotte said graciously that is very generous of you id like a red one would you indeed mrs woolmer turned over the goldembossed card and examined it carefully it was of excellent quality discreet and there was no denying the title viscountess ashworth who is she mama may inquired hopefully she was finding this state of limbo exceedingly tiresome no one yet seemed sure whether bertie had been the victim or an offender who deserved whatever end he met may herself therefore could not be sure what attitude to adopt and meeting people in the meantime was testing all her abilities on the other hand not meeting people was like being imprisoned i have no idea mrs woolmer replied with a frown between her carefully plucked brows she was wearing purple again a good choice for those who were not quite certain whether they were in mourning or not may wore black because she looked utterly dazzling in it she glowed like warm alabaster in sunlight the parlormaid dropped a curtsy if you please maam she is most soberly dressed maam an she came in a carriage with a coat of arms on the side and two footmen maam in livery an she as er sister with er very proper like an she looks like she would be a lady too but she didnt give me any card mrs woolmer made a rapid decision social behavior must be judged to a nicety if one were to climb to the heights nature had given her one great advantage in the most beautiful daughter of the season it would be ungracious to squander it with a clumsy gesture now she smiled at the maid please invite lady ashworth and her sister to come in marigold and then tell cook to prepare refreshmentstea and the best cakes and delicaciesand bring them to us yes maam marigold withdrew to do as she was bidden as soon as emily and charlotte came in mrs woolmer was reassured obviously the viscountess ashworth was a lady one had but to observe the quality and discretion of her clothes only the nobility mixed good taste with the spending of money in quite such a way may was also delighted they were young enough to gossip a little and perhaps before too long even extend her an invitation a private dinner would not be unseemly after all she had not actually been betrothed to bertie the more she thought about it the more she considered it would be best to maintain a gentle and dignified silence upon the whole affair let people interpret that as they wished to say nothing was always safer than to commit oneself and a great many men preferred women without too many opinions of their own andrather more to the point in the marriage stakestheir mothers always approved silence and a sweet smile were taken as signs of an obedient nature a thing much to be desired in a daughterinlaw lady ashworth was dressed in the height of fashion in a subdued color that made her look all the more elegant her sister was far less fashionable but undeniably handsome indeed her face was quite individual there was a warmth in it may found herself drawn to my dear lady ashworth came forward her hands outstretched and took mays before she could readily think of anything to say i am so sorry i had to come and assure you of my sympathy in your distress may had been distressed but not as lady ashworth supposed she had not been especially fond of bertie in fact she greatly preferred beau astley he was betterlooking and a good deal more fun but one had to be practical he had been a younger son with very few prospects and he would have had even fewer when bertie married and there was a new mistress in astley house she recollected herself and smiled sadly thank you lady ashworth that is most sensitive of you i can still hardly believe that anyone i knew could meet with such a dreadful fate mrs woolmer cast her a warning glance she must not say anything to link herself irretrievably with the astleys they might turn out to have possessed heaven knew what disgusting habits for all the newspapers genteelisms one knew where he had been found but may was perfectly aware of all the pitfalls and had no intention of falling into any of them lady ashworth introduced her sister mrs pitt and the ladies accepted seats graciously life can give us some cruel surprises emily observed her expression one of wise sorrow they can be very hard to bear she lowered her head apparently overcome with her own thoughts may felt compelled to say something good manners demanded it indeed ii realize now how little i knew him i had never imagined such a she stopped because there was no satisfactory conclusion to that sentence she looked frankly at lady ashworths sister mrs pitt i believe i must be most lamentably innocent i fear the less charitable might be laughing at me already the envious mrs pitt corrected generously and they will always be there the only way to avoid them is to fail where they may see it and be satisfied i assure you no person of worth will feel anything but understanding for you it is a situation in which any woman might find herself may had a fluttering nervous feeling that mrs pitt was referring to her indecision about beau astley with a very acute perception and not at all to her grief for bertie it was uncomfortable to have her motives so thoroughly perceived she looked at lady ashworth and saw the same frank understanding in her clear blue eyes she decided at once to enlist them as allies may was blessed with one virtue of perspicacity she knew precisely whom she could deceive and whom she could not she let out a sigh and smiled disarmingly what a relief it is to know someone who really does understand so many people speak kindly but they think only of a natural grief at losing a friend mrs woolmer fidgeted twisting her hands in her lap she did not like the turn of this conversation but could not think how to alter it without displaying marked discourtesy quite lady ashworth agreed with a little nod continuing mays thought one imagines one knows people and then something like this occurs but what can one do if one is introduced by respectable acquaintances that is all anyone requires my husband and i were astonished she took a deep breath of course i do not know sir beau at all but may was not to be so easily trapped he appears to be extremely pleasant she replied without emotion she forced beaus face from her mind the laughter the soft voice memories of dancing lights music whirling feet his arms about her sir bertram always behaved himself impeccably in my company she finished levelly of course mrs woolmer said a shade too quickly im sure lady ashworth brushed her fingers delicately over her skirt but if you will forgive me saying so my dear men have been known to behave very rashly indeed when they fall in love and even brothers have learned to hate one another over a beautiful woman oh mrs woolmers hand flew to her mouth and stifled an exclamation in language far less than genteel may felt distinctly uncomfortable of course she was aware that many men had desired her surely that was what the season was for but so far she had considered the emotions superficial all a part of the exquisite charade where the winners retired with agreeable husbands and with futures assured both socially and financially the losers retreated to consider next years tactics may had always known her strengths and her weaknesses and how best to deploy them she had every intention of being a winner and envy was to be expectedbut not hatred and certainly not the kind of passion that breeds murder i think you flatter me lady ashworth she said carefully i have given no one cause for such feelings perhaps it would be better to change the subject turn lady ashworths curious eyes onto something even more shocking i do not have the amorous skill of many of the ladies withshe gave a tiny smileshall we say experience i am loath to repeat rumor but it is so persistent that in all common sense i cannot believe it is entirely false there are some ladies of perfectly good family who behave like women of pleasure no doubt they have the art to inflame the sort of dreadful emotions you are speaking of it burst like a bombshell as was intended nonsense mrs woolmer choked on her indrawn breath you cannot possibly know of such a thing women of pleasure indeed i will thank you to hold your tongue lady ashworths head came up her eyes wide but surprisingly it was mrs pitt who came to mays rescue it is most distressing she agreed dropping her voice to a confidential tone but i also have heard of such things and i have to admit that my source was irreproachable it makes me wonder how ever to judge where to pursue acquaintances and where one dare not i am sure you must have had the same doubts as i i feel guilty even for suspecting people who are probably as innocent as the day and yet i would be appalled to find myself through good nature and an excess of gullibility in a situation from which i could not retreat with my reputation unblemishednot to think of things far worse lady ashworth seemed to be in the grip of some overpowering emotion she coughed furiously and covered her face with her handkerchief her shoulders shook her skin was pink to the very roots of her hair fortunately at that moment the maid returned with tea and other refreshments and they were able to revive lady ashworth her face was flushed but she was apparently otherwise in control of herself but mrs pitt was quite right one simply could not afford to associate with women who were even suspected of such behavior may racked her thoughts to know which of her acquaintances might be involved several names came to mind and she determined to avoid them on every possible occasion perhaps she should in all kindness warn mrs pitt are you acquainted with lavinia hawkesley she inquired lady ashworths eyes widened there was no need for indelicate explanations may blandly mentioned a few other names and then they discussed fashion and current romances for a pleasant half hour all undershot with a frisson of scandal mrs woolmer tried to guide the conversation toward the ashworths acquaintance with eligible young men and met with no success whatsoever at four oclock the parlormaid opened the door and asked if the ladies would receive mr alan ross who had called to offer his familys sympathies lady ashworth jumped to her feet seizing mrs pitt by the hand come charlotte we really must not monopolize the whole afternoon she turned to may i fear we have enjoyed your company so much we have forgotten our manners if you will permit us to take our leave before mr ross arrives we will not make him feel uncomfortable by appearing to avoid him mrs woolmer was startled of course ifif that is what you wish marigold have mr ross wait in the morning room for a moment if you please marigold closed the door behind her lady ashworth bent to may with a confidential whisper my sister and i were once acquainted with mr rosss family during a period of tragedy which must be most distressing to him i think it would be a kindness my dear if you were not to mention our names to him im sure you understand may did not understand at all but she was perfectly capable of taking a hint of course you will merely be two ladies who have called by in friendship i appreciate your sensitivity and i hope i shall have the good fortune to meet you again in more fortunate circumstances i am sure of it lady ashworth said confidently with the slightest of nods may understood it was all she wished outside in the street charlotte turned on emily what are you thinking of surely it would have been to our advantage to meet with alan ross again max may have used his old connections to find these women i know that emily exclaimed but not in there he wont be longwe can wait out here for him its freezing why on earth should we stand around here hell know we are forcing an acquaintance if oh dont be so silly william she waved her hand at the coachman find something wrong with one of the horseskeep yourself occupied until mr ross comes out of the house yes mlady william obediently bent and ran his hand down the near horses leg and began to examine it charlotte shivered as the wind cut through her coat why on earth couldnt we simply have stayed in there and met him she demanded glaring at emily i always thought general balantyne was very fond of you emily appeared to ignore the remark charlotte had liked to think so too the memory brought a pleasant glow a tinge of excitement she did not argue christina moves in just the right circle to know the sort of women who might be used by max emily continued she could be of great assistance christina ross wouldnt assist us across the street if we were blind charlotte remembered callander square vividly the most likely assistance she could give me would be into the nearest ditch which is why we must pursue the general instead emily said impatiently if you conduct yourself properly he will help you to anything you like now be quiet mr ross is coming out i knew he wouldnt be long as alan ross approached emily smiled dazzlingly at him he smiled back and raised his hat a little uncertainly then his eyes moved to charlotte and his face eased in recognition miss ellison how charming to see you again i hope you are well do you have trouble with your carriage may i take you somewhere thank you i am sure it is nothing serious charlotte answered quickly do you recall mr ross emily my sister lady ashworth she wanted to tell him delicately that she was mrs pitt during the callander square murders she had found a position in the balantyne house by pretending she was a single woman in need of respectable work mr ross emily cut in offering her hand to alan ross of course i remember mr ross please give my best wishes to mrs ross i confess it is quite some time since i have seen her one becomes so busy with people one is obliged by courtesy to visit that one misses those one is genuinely fond of she is such an entertaining person i look forward to meeting her again emily detested christina and always had her smile did not waver a fraction and charlotte has spoken of her frequently we really must call upon her i hope she will forgive us for our neglect i am sure she will be delighted to see you he gave the only possible answer he could emily smiled as if equally charmed by the prospect then please tell her that lady ashworth and miss ellison will call upon her next tuesday if she receives upon that day i am sure she will but why do you not come to dine that would be far pleasanter it will be only a small gathering but if lord ashworth is not engaged i am sure he is not emily accepted with alacrity she would make sure that george was not other engagements would have to be dispensed with he bowed slightly then i shall see that invitations are sent if you are sure i can be of no assistance he looked at william now standing to attention by the horses head i am sure we shall be perfectly all right emily said then i bid you good day lady ashworth miss ellison he met charlottes eyes for a moment smiled then turned and walked back along the pavement to his own carriage emily accepted williams assistance into the carriage and charlotte followed after her landing in a bundle what on earth is the matter with you she said furiously why did you let him go on thinking i am miss ellison i hardly need a job in christinas household emily yanked her skirt free from where charlotte was sitting on it well hardly be in a position to discover much if they know you are married to a policeman she pointed out let alone the very policeman who is investigating the murders added to which it will do no harm for the general to see you as still unmarried what are you charlotte began then stopped short there was considerable good sense in what emily was saying people like christina balantyne did not dine with policemens wives if they knew she and emily were bent on inquiring into murder they would never even get through the front door after all they had a certain moral duty to discover as much as they couldit was every persons duty and in truth they had proved unusually skilled in the past yes she said meekly yes i suppose you are quite right emily if she and emily were to investigate effectively they must have all the knowledge available but to get it from pitt was no easy matter so far he had spoken of no further discovery it seemed he was trudging day after day through the squalor of the acre pursuing a word here a suggestion there but if he was any nearer find ing a connection between max dr pinchin and bertie astley he had not told charlotte of it thomas she began softly he opened his eyes and looked at her it was late he was half asleep by the fire in the parlor she had chosen her time with care and tried to sound casual have you learned anything more about max i know everything there is to know about max he replied sliding a little farther down in his chair looking at her through his eyelashes except who his clients were who his women were and who killed him oh she was not sure how to pursue it that means he kept no sort of record or else it was taken he was killed in the street he pointed out unless it was his house manager who did it there would be no chance to look for papers anyway according to all i can find out there were none he kept names in his head and all business was strictly cash no records then how could he blackmail anyone she asked curiously i dont know that he did he moved his feet off the fender it was getting too hot but he might have had knowledge enough to ruin anyones reputation proof is not necessary word of mouth in the right place substantiated by a few names and places would do excellently suspicion alone can destroy but the motive could just as easily have been professional rivalry he was taking other peoples business either way it is none of your affair this isnt a case where an amateur can help she met his gaze and suddenly felt a great deal less sure of herself oh yes of course she said after all she was not really investigating it was only a matter of keeping her ears open for any odd piece of information that might prove relevant but it is only natural i should be interested isnt it she said reasonably charlotte was something less than honest over the dinner invitation to the rosses on tuesday pitt was working as she had trusted he would be she mentioned that they had been invited to dine with emily and george and would he mind very much if she went even though he was unable to she knew he would not refuse her after all he had not been able to take her anywhere himself or even to offer her much companionship since the case began and so far as it went what she said was true she would be with emily and george even if it was not in their home as she allowed pitt to presume emily lent her a gown as usual and charlotte dressed for the occasion at paragon walk with emilys maid to dress her hair she felt not the least qualm about that for the whole idea had been engineered by emilys connivance with alan ross the gown was of apricot silk with the most delicate lace a shade or two deeper and appeared to be quite new in fact it crossed her mind to wonder if emily had obtained it for the purpose it was a color emily herself should never have worn with her fair hair and clear blue eyes the shade was ideal for a warmer complexion and darker heavier hair with gleams of red in it she felt a sudden gratitude for emilys generosity both in providing the gown which flattered her so much and for doing it in such a discreet manner she decided to say nothing and thus let the gift reach the fullest measure instead she swept down the stairs from the spare dressing room like a duchess entering her own ballroom and swirled to a grand curtsy in the hallway at emilys feet the sense of excitement inside her was as vivid as the light on the chandeliers your dress is perfect she said rising with a little less grace than she had intended i feel fit to dazzle everyone and make christina quite sickly with envy thank you very much emily was in the palest aquamarine with diamonds at her ears and throat sparkling like sunlight upon clear water they were as different as could be which of course had been the intentionalthough possibly emily had not expected charlotte to look quite so splendid but if she hadnt she rapidly adjusted her thought and smiled back with unclouded approval now just remember not to say anything too candid she warned society adores mirrors to its face and its attire but has no love whatsoever for a reflection of its morals or its soul i shall be obliged if you bear that in mind before you express your opinions yes emily she did owe her something for the dress emily had obviously taken some care in forewarning george of the purpose of their visit he had agreed to accompany them and to refrain from enlightening their hosts about charlottes marriage and thus her current social status although charlotte did not know if emily had also told him the reason for this christina ross received them distinctly coolly obviously the invitation had come from her husband and she had been obliged to go along with it since it could hardly be withdrawn how kind of you to come lord ashworth lady ashworth she said with a very small smile george bowed and passed some civil remark vaguely complimentary and miss ellison christinas eyes swept over charlottes gown with slight surprise she allowed it to show as a delicate insult to what she considered to be charlottes station and therefore the unsuitability of the gownlet alone how she might have come by it i hope you are in good health there was a lift in her voice which was wasted charlotte too obviously glowed with an abundance of wellbeing of every sort christina abandoned the inquiry without waiting for an answer and indicated where they were welcome to seat themselves george did not believe that they should interfere in the solving of the crimes and he had in fact barely known bertie astley but he was generally goodnatured as long as he was not unduly criticized or robbed of his habitual pleasures emily had proved an excellent wife she was neither extravagant nor indiscreet she rarely lost her temper she never sulked or rebuffed him and she was far too subtle in her dealings with him to need to nag he was aware in afterthought of having changed one or two of his amusementsmaybe even three or fourin order to please her but it had proved less painful than he had anticipated and one had to be prepared to make some adjustments he therefore did not really object to humoring her with regard to cultivating christina ross if she felt it was useful of course he knew quite well it was absolutely pointless but if it entertained her what matter and he could see no reason why it should not be pleasant charlotte he had never understood nor had he tried to he liked her well enough in fact to be honest he even liked pitt accordingly he put himself out to be charming to christina and without any great effort was devastatingly effective his face was handsome especially his eyes and generations of privilege and money had given him an assurance so easy it required no attention at all he could sit and stare at christina with appreciation and flatter her merely by giving her his undivided concern there was little enough time and emily wasted none of it but began immediately on the subject that had brought her it is so pleasant to see you again she said to alan ross with a smile george was delighted when i gave him your invitation we spend so much time with those in society who are not of the most attractive i confess i am not as clever at judging people as i had imagined i was i have been somewhat naive and have found myself in the company of persons i would not have chosen had i been wiser but one so often learns these things too late even now i do not fully understand she dropped her voice as if imparting a confidence but i have heard whispers that some ladies of what one would have thought to be impeccable family have been behaving in ways too appalling to speak of indeed a shadow crossed alan rosss face so brief charlotte was not sure if she had imagined it but it left her with an impression of pain had the unintended clumsiness of emilys remark disturbed some memory of the past the murder in callander square emily she said quickly perhaps it is a subject indelicate to discuss emily gave her a blue stare of amazement then turned back quickly to alan ross i do hope i have not offended you by speaking my feelings too candidly she looked wounded anxious but underneath the wide swirls of her skirt she gave charlotte a sharp kick charlotte winced but was obliged to keep her face expressionless of course not ross said with a slight movement of his hand the smallest gesture of dismissalit was too trivial to require more i quite agree with you there is only one thing more boring and more unpleasant than debauchery and that is to hear of it interminably and at second hand he smiled very slightly and charlotte could only guess at the thoughts that had prompted the remark how i agree with you emilys foot gave charlotte a warning tappainful since it caught exactly the spot where she had landed the first kick i find it most embarrassing when women speak of such things i hardly know what to say charlotte moved her feet discreetly out of emilys reach and that is a mark of how deeply she is affected she put in it quite robs her of a responseand what a remarkable instance that is you may judge emilys foot came out sharply and met only piles of skirt she looked at charlotte with acute suspicion out of the corner of her eye charlotte smiled ravishingly at alan ross at that moment the door opened and the footman ushered in general balantyne and lady augusta george and alan ross both rose to their feet and the rest of the party remained perfectly still balantyne stared at charlotte until she could feel the color burn in her face she wished desperately that emily had not lied and introduced her as miss ellison christina broke the pattern she stood up and sailed forward arms stretched in a theatrical gesture stopping just short of embracing her father papa how delightful to see you she half turned and held out a cool cheek to lady augusta mama you know lord ashworth of course formal acknowledgments were made george bowing gracefully and lady ashworth her voice dropped to a tone distinctly chillier emily had risen as was fitting for a younger woman to an elder when they both possessed titles again the acknowledgments were made christina turned at last to charlotte also of course now standing and perhaps you recall miss ellison who was so kind as to assist papa with some clerical work a few years ago indeed augusta did not wish to be reminded of that time or of anything to do with it good evening miss ellison her incomprehension that charlotte should be included in the company at all clearly showed good evening lady augusta suddenly charlottes guilt vanished and she stared back as coldly as she imagined augusta herself might have if confronted with a debutante who did not know her place there was a faint tinge of color on the generals high cheekbones good evening miss ellison he caught something in his throat and coughed how pleasant to see you again i was thinking of you only the other day he stopped that isa certain event brought you to mind i have remembered you often charlotte wanted to rescue him and what she said was almost true she never heard or read of any military event without in one way or other associating it with him christinas raised eyebrows showed her amazement oh dear i had no notion we had become so fixed in your mind miss ellisonor perhaps you are referring only to papa charlotte wanted to hurt her the circumstances of our meeting were not common enough in my life for me to forget anything of them she said meeting christinas eyes icily she saw christina pale at the memory of murder but of course i learned to admire the general very much as i became acquainted with his memoirs i am sure knowing him so much better you must share my regard christinas face tightened naturallybut then he is my father that is an entirely different thingmiss ellison the color deepened in balantynes face but he seemed to find nothing to say you never read your fathers military papers my dear it was alan ross who rescued them a daughters affection is quite a different emotion from the respect of someone quite impartial the pink drained out of balantynes cheeks and he turned away quickly of course it is he said with some tartness i cannot imagine you meant that as it sounded christina miss ellison was merely being courteous he did not look at charlotte but settled himself talking instead to george emily engaged herself with christina leaving charlotte to try to balance an awkward conversation with alan ross and lady augusta she was immensely relieved when dinner was announced the table was rich and charlotte noticed emily looking it over and probably adding up what she judged it to have cost emily knew the quality of crystal silver and napery to a nicety and she was also precisely aware of what a cook was worth charlotte caught her eye a few moments after they had sat down and from the slight incline of one fair brow she gathered that in emilys opinion christina was being extravagant the first course was served and the general conversation turned to the kind of polite trivia appropriate to the importance of taking the first edge from appetite and at the same time maintaining a degree of elegance charlotte took no part in it she was not acquainted with the people referred to and could not comment upon the likelihood of one person marrying another or what a disaster it would or would not be she found her gaze straying toward general balantyne the only other person uninvolved either from ignorance or lack of interest she was a little discomforted to find him watching her in spite of the fact that christina was speaking with great animation there was a ripple of laughter around the table and suddenly christina became aware that her wit had left two of the company untouched she looked directly at charlotte pulling a little face oh i am so sorry miss ellison of course i forgot you cannot know miss fairgood or the dukes grandson how very unkind of me you must feel so left out do please forgive me nothing she might have said would be better calculated to make charlottes exclusion more obvious the conversation was tedious and charlotte had not cared before but now she felt her face burning with selfconsciousness she remained silent because if she spoke she would be rude and thus give christina yet another victory i do not know miss fairgood either balantyne picked up his glass i cannot say that i have been aware of the loss and i am as indifferent as miss ellison as to whom the dukes grandson should marry however he turned to charlotte i have recently come upon some letters of a soldier who served in the peninsular war i think you might find them interesting and most encouraging when one realizes how far we have progressed since then i remember your admiration for miss nightingales work in organizing care for the wounded in the crimea charlotte did not have to feign interest letters she said eagerly oh that is so much more exciting than a history book without a thought for emilys strategy she leaned forward a little i should be so pleased if i might see them it would be likelike holding a piece of the real past in my hands not merely somebody elses judgment of it what do you know of himthe soldier who wrote the letters i mean the stern lines of balantynes face softened and some reserve within him released itself he put the glass down he ignored the formality of saying that of course she might see the letters as if that should be assumed and need not be put into words between them he was a person of considerable intelligence he said intently it seemed he served as an enlisted man instead of as an officer by his own choice and he was obviously well able to read and to write his observations are most sensitive and betray a compassion i admit i find very moving it is hardly an uplifting conversation for the dinner table augusta looked at them with disfavor i cannot imagine that we wish to know of the sufferings of some pathetic common soldier inwherever it was the spanish peninsular balantyne explained but she ignored him i should think they are quite as uplifting as the matrimonial aspirations of miss fairgood alan ross said dryly to whom for goodness sake christina asked caustically to me ross replied to your father andunless she is being more courteous than others have been so far this eveningto miss ellison charlotte caught his eye and looked down quickly at her plate i am afraid i cannot claim credit for such delicacy mr ross she said forcing her face to remain modestly composed i am most genuinely interested how quaint christina murmured lady ashworth you were saying that you have lately made the closer acquaintance of lavinia hawkesley dont you find her quite the most entertaining creature although i am not at all sure how much she has any intention of being i fancy the poor soul is bored to weeping emily replied with a furious glance at charlotte and i cannot say that i entirely blame her sir james is a man fit to bore anyone he must be thirty years older than she is at the very least but extremely wealthy christina pointed out and with any decency at all he will the before another ten years are past oh emily rolled her eyes heavenward but what can she possibly do for another ten years a small smile flickered across christinas face she is not without imagination and that is her misfortune augusta interrupted sharply she would be much better off if she had none at all and whatever your fancy begets christina it would be more discreet if you were not to speak of it we do not wish to be the prognosticators of other peoples misdeeds christina took a deep breath that was obviously precisely what she had wished to be but curiously she did not argue in fact charlotte thought she saw a momentary pallor a tightening of her face but whether it was pity or temper she could not judge i suppose she might occupy herself in some charitable work george suggested hopefully emily frequently tells me how much there is to be done and that is it christina was suddenly savage when a gentleman is bored he may gamble at his club at dice or cards go to the races or drive his own pair if he wishes he may go shooting or play billiards or go to theatersand worse placesbut if a lady is bored she is expected to occupy herself with charitable worksgoing round and visiting the hungry or the dirty muttering soothing words at them and encouraging them to be virtuous there was too much truth in her outburst for charlotte to argue and yet she found herself unable even to begin to tell christina ross of the sense of purpose and satisfaction she herself found from working to bring about parliamentary reform there was a reality about it an urgency to life that would have made games or even sports seem divorced from the world and unbearably trivial she leaned forward searching for a way to express her feelings everyone was staring at her but nothing adequate came to her mind if you are about to expound on the delights of papas military histories miss ellison please do not bother christina said freezingly i do not wish to know about cholera in sebastopol or how many wretched souls died in the charge of the light brigade the whole thing seems to me to be an idiot game played by men who should be locked away in bedlam where they can harm no one but themselves and perhaps each other for the only time in her life to that moment charlotte felt a rush of sympathy for christina can you think of a way in which we might enforce that in law mrs ross she said enthusiastically think of all the young men who might not the if we did christina looked at her with a curious little frown she had not expected agreement from anyone least of all from charlotte she had begun by intending only to be rude you surprise me she said candidly i thought you were a great admirer of the military i hate blind vanity charlotte answered and i deplore stupidity the fact that they occur in the army more dangerously than anywhere else except perhaps in parliament does not make my respect for courage of the soldier any less in parliament augusta was incredulous really my dear miss ellison whatever can you mean a fool in parliament can oppress millions balantyne offered and god knows there are enough of them and vain ones too he looked at charlotte with complete frankness as if he had temporarily forgotten she was a woman i have not heard so much sense put so succinctly in years he added with a slight drawing together of his brows i had a feeling you were about to say something else when christina brought back the subject of the army please tell me what it was i charlotte was acutely conscious of his eyes upon her they were a brighter clearer blue than she had remembered and she was increasingly aware of his power the will that had enabled him to command men in danger and fear of death she abandoned the effort to phrase her feelings politely i was going to say that when i have time to spare i involve myself in an attempt to have some of the laws upon child prostitution reformed so that they would be a great deal more rigid than at present and it would be a very grave offense either to use children oneself or to traffic in the use of them whether they are boys or girls alan ross turned to face her his eyes keen really augustas expression was one of complete incomprehension i would not have imagined one could have any success in such a venture without considerable knowledge upon the subject miss ellison of course not charlotte accepted the challenge and stared back at her unflinchingly it is necessary to acquire it or one can have no influence at all how extremely distasteful augusta said closing the subject of course it is distasteful alan ross refused to be silenced i think that is what brandy was saying the other eveningyou remember brandy miss ellison but then if those of us who are able to reach the ears of parliament do not care about such ills who will effect any change the church augusta said finally and i am quite sure they will do a better job of it than we will by indulging in wild and unprofitable speculation over the dinner table brandon will you be so good as to pass me the mustard christina you had better have a word with your cookthis sauce is totally insipid it is no better than cotton wool do you not think so miss ellison it is mild charlotte replied with a slight smile but i do not find it disagreeable how odd augusta turned over her fork i would have expected mustard to be much more to your taste after the meal was finished the butler brought in the port augusta christina emily and charlotte excused themselves to the withdrawing room to leave the gentlemen to drink and to smoke if they wished it was the part of the evening charlotte had looked forward to least she was sharply aware of christinas dislike and now also of augustas disapproval and above either of these unpleasant feelings she felt acutely nervous about what emily might do she had come for the sole purpose of pursuing the names and characteristics of christinas less reputable friends with a view to discovering if any of them might have been seduced by max please heaven she was at least subtle about itif one could conceivably be subtle about such a thing emily gave her a warning look before they sat down you know i do so agree with you she said to christina with an air of conspiracy i long to do something a little more adventurous than calling upon people one already knows positively everything aboutand making polite and tedious conversation or else doing good works i am sure they are very worthy and i admire those who can enjoy them but i confess i do not if you attend church occasionally and look after the families of your servants that is all that is required of you augusta pointed out other good works of visiting and so on are only necessary for single ladies who have nothing else to do it keeps them occupied and makes them feel useful heaven knows there are enough of themone must not usurp their function they all seemed for the moment to have forgotten that as far as they knew charlotte fell into that category i think perhaps i shall take to riding in the park emily mused one might meet all manner of interesting people thereor so i have heard indeed christina said i know exactly what you mean but believe me there are things which one may do that have far more spirit of adventure and are a great deal more entertaining than writing letters or making social calls upon people who are inexpressibly dull it is not really improper if one does not go alone for one to visit do you paint miss ellison augusta cut across christina in a loud penetrating voice or play the pianoforte or perhaps you sing i paint charlotte replied immediately how pleasant for you christinas opinion of painting was implicit in her tone single women who could think of nothing more exciting to do than sit about with brushes and bits of wet paper were too pathetic to waste emotion upon she turned back to emily i have quite decided that i shall ride in the row every morning that the wish takes me and the weather is agreeable i am sure that with a spirited animal one might have a great deal of pleasure with a spirited animal my girl one may very well land flat on ones face in the mud augusta snapped and i would have you remember it and not behave as if taking a fall were a light thing christinas face drained of all color she stared straight ahead looking neither at augusta nor at emily if she had any rebuttal it was stillborn inside her charlotte tried desperately to think of something to say to cover the silence but everything trivial and polite seemed grotesque after the sudden reality of emotion even though she did not understand it or its cause if christina had injured herself perhaps in some recklessness on horseback it was a most indelicate subject to refer to it did flicker wildly into her mind that perhaps that was the reason she appeared as yet to have no family the uprush of pity was painful she did not wish to feel anything for christina but dislike emily plays the piano charlotte said emptily merely to change the subject and dismiss her thoughts i beg your pardon augusta swallowed there were very fine lines on her throat that charlotte had not noticed before emily plays the piano charlotte repeated with increasing embarrassment now she felt ridiculous indeed and you did not learn no i preferred to paint and papa did not insist how wise of him it is a waste of time to force a child who has no talent there was no civil answer to that charlotte suddenly ceased to feel guilty about the softness she had seen in the generals face or the quick honesty in his eyes when he had forgotten the niceties of the table and simply spoken to her as a friend with whom he might speak of things that mattered things of the mind and the emotions indeed when the gentlemen rejoined them shortly afterward she was perfectly happy to find herself almost immediately engaged in a long discussion with him about the retreat from moscow she did not need to make the least pretense to follow his every word and share his fascination with the wide sweep of history as the tide of europe turned or the wound of pity for the solitary deaths of men in the bitter snows of russia when they rose to leave it was the generals face that was in her mind not christinas it was only afterward when emily spoke to her on the way home that any sense of guilt returned really charlotte i asked you to engage the generals sympathy so that we might learn something of use to usnot enchant the man out of his wits she said acidly i really do think you might learn to control yourself that apricot gown has gone to your head charlotte blushed in the darkness but fortunately neither emily nor george could see her well there was little point in my trying to pursue christinas more flighty acquaintances she said sharply you all had me marked as a poor little creature who sits at home painting when i am not going out doing good works among the unfortunates i quite understand your disliking christina emily changed tactics and assumed elaborate patience instead i do myselfand she was certainly very rude to you but that is not the point we were there to pursue the investigation not to enjoy ourselves charlotte had no answer for that she had learned nothing whatsoever and if she were even remotely honest she had enjoyed herself indecently much at least she had at times there were moments that had been perfectly ghastly she had forgotten how very crushing society could be did you learn anything she asked i have no idea emily replied in the darkness perhaps emily had thought about all the murders and the many different tragedies that might lie behind them she was perfectly aware that a great many marriages were made quite as much for practical reasons as for romantic ones attempts either to improve positions in society or to maintain ones that were endangered sometimes such alliances worked out quite as well as those embarked upon in the heat of infatuation but where the difference of age or temperament was too great they became prisonlike she also knew the morally numbing effect of boredom that she did not suffer from it herself was due to her periodic adventures into the stimulating frightening and turbulent world of criminal tragedy but the long arid intervals of social trivia in the meantime were the more pronounced because of the contrast it was a world enclosed upon itself where the most superficial flirtations assumed the proportions of great love mere insults in etiquette or precedence became wounds and matters of dressthe cut the color the trimmingwere noticed and discussed as if they were of immense importance as christina ross had said idle men might occupy themselves with all manner of sport healthy or otherwise even finding excitement in risking money or broken limbs industrious or morally minded men might seek power in parliament or trade or might travel abroad upon missions to benighted nations somewhere or join the army or follow the white nile to discover its source in the heart of the dark continent but a woman had only the outlet of charitable works her home was cared for by servants her children by a nursery maid a nanny and then a governess for those who were neither artistic nor gifted with any particular intelligence there was little else but to entertain and be entertained small wonder that spirited young women like some of christinas set trapped in marriages without passion laughter or even companionship could be lured away by someone as raw and dangerous as max burton and of course emily had never hidden from herself the other side of the argument the fact that a number of men do not find all their appetites satisfied at home many abstained for one reason or another but of course there were those who did not one did not discuss houses of pleasureor the fallen doves who occupied them god that was a euphemism she hated and only with the most intimate friends did one speak of the various affairs that were conducted at country houses over long shooting weekends in croquet games on summer lawns at great balls in the hunting season or any other of a dozen times and places none of which was to excuse it but to understand it therefore in considering murder emily took into account the names and situations such as she knew them of christinas social circle and those who might conceivably have been involved with max there were about seven or eight she found likely and another half dozen possible though she believed they lacked the courage or the indifference to values of modesty or loyalty to have taken such a step but if nothing better presented itself she would bear in mind to suggest their names to pitt so that he might discover where their husbands had been at the relevant times and there was always the possibility of an unfortunate recognition to considera little betrayalor blackmail what of a man who took his pleasures in a whorehouse and found he had bought his own wife the permutations were legion all of them painful and desperately foolish it could be that one such woman had been used by max that one of her customers had been bertie astley and for some reason a fear or hatred had arisen that resulted in the murder not only of max but of astley also how hubert pinchin was involved however she did not yet have any suggestion the other most obvious possibility was even less pleasant to her that beau astley had read of the startling murders of max and dr pinchin and had seized the opportunity to imitate these crimes and get rid of his elder brother it would not be the first murder to ape anotherand so saddle a man guilty of two murders with the blame for one more beau astley had enough to gain from his brothers death that was certain but how much had he wanted it was he in financial straits or did he manage very well upon whatever resources he had was he in love with may woolmer in fact what kind of a person was he in general at the breakfast table emily sipped her tea george was not at his best he was hiding behind the newspaper not to read it but to avoid having to think of something to say i called upon poor may woolmer recently emily remarked cheerfully did you georges voice was absentminded and emily realized he had forgotten who may woolmer was she is still in mourning of course she continued an outright request for information would be unlikely to produce it george did not like curiosityit was vulgar and likely to offend people he did not care if people took offense when it was unwarranted but he disliked the thought of being oafish or anything that might appear ignorant of courtesy he knew very well the value of acceptance i beg your pardon he had not been paying attention and now put the paper down reluctantly as he realized that she had no intention of allowing the matter to drop she is still in mourning for bertie astley emily repeated his face cleared a little oh yes she would be pity about that nice enough fellow oh george she contrived to look shocked what he clearly failed to understand it was a harmless remark and surely astley had been perfectly amiable george she let her voice slide down and lowered her eyes i do know where he was found you know what she wished she could blush to order some women could and it was a most useful accomplishment she avoided looking at him in case he read curiosity in her eyes instead of modest horror he was found on the doorstep of a house of pleasure she voiced the euphemism as if it came to her tongue with some embarrassment where the occupants are men as well oh god how did you know that this time he needed no pretense whatever to show interest his face was startled his dark eyes very wide emily for a moment emily could think of nothing to say the conversation had taken a turn she should have foreseen but had not should she admit to having read the newspapers or should she blame charlotte no that was not a good ideait might have unfortunate repercussions george might even take it into his head that she should not associate with charlotte quite so much especially during the investigation of scandalous murders like these she had a sudden inspiration may told me goodness knows where she heard it but you know how these whispers spread why is it not true after all she met his eyes squarely and with total innocence this time she had no qualms about deceiving george in trivial mattersit was for his own good she was never less than honest in things of importance like loyalty or money but sometimes george needed a little managing his shoulders eased and he sat back in his chair again but his expression was still full of confusion two things troubled him the extremely unsavory facts concerning bertie astley and quite how much of them it was proper to tell emily she understood him very well and rescued the situation before she lost the initiative and was obliged to begin all over again perhaps i should call upon may and reassure her she suggested if it is only a malicious invention oh no he was unhappy but quite decided i am afraid you cannot do thatit is perfectly true emily looked suitably downcast as though she had actually entertained a hope that it was not george was sir bertrami mean did he have a peculiar nature good god no that is what is so damned odd i simply dont understand it he pulled a face in rare outspokenness although i suppose we seldom know people as well as we imagine perhaps he was and no one knew it emily put her hand out across the table and clasped his dont think it george she said gently is it not far more likely that some other suitor of may woolmers was so crazed he simply took the opportunity to rid himself of a rival and slander him horribly at the same time that way he could be rid of him both literally and in memory after all how could may cherish the thought of a man who practiced such indecencies he considered it for a moment closing his hand over hers there were times when he was really extremely fond of her one thing about emily even after five years of marriage she was never a bore i doubt it he said at last she is a handsome creature certainly but i cannot imagine anyone getting so infatuated with her as to do that she hasnt thethe fire and she has very little money you know i thought beau astley was exceedingly attracted to her she suggested beau he looked incredulous is he not now she was confused also i think he likes her very well yes but he has other interests and hes hardly the sort to kill his own brother there is the title and the money she pointed out do you know beau astley no she said hopefully at last they had come to the point what sort of a man is he agreeablerather more than poor bertie actually and generous he said with conviction i really think i should go and see him he let the newspaper slide to the floor and stood up i always liked beau poor fellows probably feeling terrible mourning is such a tedious businessit makes you feel infinitely worse no matter how grieved you are you dont want to sit around in a house full of gaslights and black crepe with servants speaking in whispers and maids who sniffle every time they see you ill go and offer him a little companionship what a good idea she agreed earnestly i am sure he will be very grateful for it it is most sensitive of you how could she persuade him without arousing suspicion to question beau astley a little he may very well be longing to unburden himself to someone a good friend he can trust she said watching georges face after all a great many disturbing and unhappy thoughts must have troubled him as to what can possibly have happened and he cannot be unaware of other peoples speculations i am sure if i were in his situation i should long for someone to confide in if it occurred to him that she had any ulterior motive he did not show it in his face at least she did not think his flicker of a smile was for that reason was it indeed he answered soberly sometimes it is a great relief to talkin confidence was george perhaps more astute than she had supposed and enamored of the idea of a little detective work of his own surely not watching his elegant back as he went out the door she felt a sharp tingle of pleasant surprise three days later emily had contrived to take charlotte with herself and george to a small private ball where she had ascertained in advance that the balantynes were to be present as well as alan ross and christina what excuse charlotte offered to pitt was her own affair emily was not sure quite what knowledge she hoped to acquire but she was not innocent of the general habits of the gentlemen of society she had learned to accept the extraordinary feat of mental and ethical agility that enabled a man to indulge his physical appetites in the expensive brothels near the haymarket all night and then to come home and preside over his family at a silent and obedient breakfast table where his wish was enough to produce a flurry of eagerness and his word held the force of law she had chosen to live in society and enjoy its privileges therefore though she did not admire its hypocrisy she did not rebel against it emily had no liking at all for christina ross but she could very well believe that christina had sympathy for the few women who dared to break from social confines and play men at their own game even to the point of risking everything for a wild masquerade at a house such as maxs in the devils acre emily thought it was excessively foolish only a woman with no brains at all would wager so much for such a tawdry returnand she despised such idiocy but she was aware that boredom occasionally drove out all intelligence even the sense of selfpreservation she had seen overwrought women imagine themselves in love and rush headlong like lemmings to their own destruction usually they were young a first passion but perhaps it was only the outside that changed with age habits learned a little camouflage for vulnerability the desperation inside might be the same at any time so by chance among christina rosss acquaintances tonight might there not be at least one of maxs women she wished charlotte to come also for her added ability to observe charlotte was very naive on certain points but on others she was surprisingly acute added to which christina disliked her seemed in some way to be almost jealous and in the heat of strong emotion people were inclined to betray themselves charlotte could be extremely handsome when she was enjoying herself giving someone all her attentionas she did for some quite unaccountable reason to general balantyne if anything might cause christina to lose her selfmastery her judgment it would be charlotte flirting with the generaland even perhaps with alan ross accordingly emily george and charlotte arrived at lord and lady easterbys ball for their eldest daughter they were just late enough still to be civil and yet also to cause a pleasing stir of appreciation among the guests already thronging the hall emily was dressed in her favorite delicate water green which flattered her fair skin the gentle curls of her hair caught the light like an aureole she looked like the spirit of an elusive early english summer when the blossom is still clean and the air dappled with cool and shifting light she had taken great care over charlotte she had considered deeply what would attract the general most and would therefore irritate christina thus charlotte swept into the ballroom in a swirl of vibrant and luminous gentian blue that was delicate on her throat and made her hair gleam with the shadowed luster of old copper she was like a tropical night when the gold of the sun has gone but the warmth of the earth still lingers if she had even the faintest idea what emilys intentions were she showed no sign of it whatever which was as well because emily doubted charlottes conscience would have allowed her to go along with such a planhowever much she liked the ideahad she perceived it and she was useless at flirting if she tried but it was a long time since charlotte had had the chance to dress exquisitely to be extravagant to dance all night she was not even aware of her own hunger for the excitement of it they were received with a flutter of attention georges title and the fact that charlotte was a new face and therefore mysterious would have been sufficient whatever their appearance that the sisters looked ravishing was cause for a deluge of speculation and rumor enough to keep conversations alive for a month so much the better it would add to the heat of the eveningchristina would not take well to being outshone emily wondered for a prickling moment if perhaps she had miscalculated and the results would be less informative and more purely unpleasant than she had intended then she dismissed the idea it was too late to alter things now anyhow she sailed forward with a radiant smile to greet lady augusta balantyne who was standing stiff and very regal composing her face into an answering social charm good evening lady ashworth augusta said coolly lord ashworth how pleasant to see you again good evening miss ellison emily was suddenly aware of being ashamed she looked at augusta her shoulders tight the fine tendons in her neck standing out under her ruby necklace the weight of stones cold and heavy in their blood color was augusta really so afraid of charlotte was it possible that she loved her husband that this softness about his mouth as he greeted charlotte the slightly straighter shoulders was deeper than a flirtation with an agreeable woman something that touched the emotions that endure that hurt and disturb and leave a loneliness behind that is never filled by any other affectionand augusta knew it the ballroom glittered and people laughed around them but for a moment emily was unaware of it chandeliers full of tinkling facets filled the ceilings violin strings scraped briefly then found the full rich tone footmen moved with elegance while balancing glasses of champagne and fruit punch all she had intended was to scratch the veneer of christinas temper and perhaps to learn in a moment of carelessness a little of what she knew about the society women who might have frequented maxs brothel the last thing emily wanted was to cause a real and permanent injury please heaven charlotte knew what she was doing her thoughts were interrupted by the necessities of polite conversation she attended with only half her mind making some silly observations about who might or might not win a horse race in the summershe was not even sure if it was the derby or the oaks certainly the prince of wales name was mentioned it was some thirty minutes or so before the subject exhausted itself and alan ross asked emily if she would honor him with the next dance it was an odd exercise to be so close to a person sharing a movement at times touching each other and yet hardly speaking at all they came together and swirled apart so briefly that any exchange of meaning was impossible she watched his face he was not as handsome as george but there was a sensitivity about him that became more and more attractive as she knew him better the events in callander square flashed back into her memory and she wondered how deeply he had been hurt it had been no secret that he had loved helena doran was that wound still raw was that the pain inside him that honed fine his cheeks and the lines of his mouth that could be a very good reason for christinas sharpness for her apparent need to hurt charlotte charlotte would remember about helena and was now overstepping the lines of accepted flirtation with the general by making a friend of him it was understandable if a little crude to entertain a relationship simply on the fullness of a bosom or the curve of a hip but to engage the mind the compassion and the imagination was beyond the rules what rules did christina observe what did she even know emily glanced around the room as she turned in alan rosss arms and over his shoulder saw christina clinging close to a cavalry officer in resplendent uniform she was laughing up into his eyes and she looked brilliantly alive the officer was obviously enthralled emily looked back at alan ross he must have seen it he had faced that way only the moment before but there was no change in his expression either he was so used to it that he had learned to mask his emotions or else he no longer cared the thought after that was obvious and yet it was so unpleasant that for an instant emily lost her footing and was clumsy at another time she would have been mortified but consumed as she was by the new thought the triviality of mere physical gaucheness seemed quite banal was christina herself one of maxs women alan ross was neither old nor in the slightest way boring but perhaps his very charm the unattainability of the inner man was a far sharper goad to other conquests no matter how shallow than any boredom could be suddenly emilys animosity toward christina turned to pity she still could not like her but she was forced to care she was dancing close to alan ross she could feel the cloth of his coat under her glove and she was moving in perfect time with his body although they were barely touching there was a union did he know about christina or guess was it his outraged vanity suppressed for so long that had finally murdered and mutilated max it was ridiculous here she was dressed in pale green silk dancing to violins under all these lights in and out of the arms of a man she spoke to as a friend and her mind was following him down filthy alleys to a confrontation with a footman turned whoremonger to commit a murder of hatred and obscene revenge for the degradation of his wife how could two such disparate worlds exist so closely sidebysideor even within each other how far away was the devils acrethree miles five miles how far away was it in thought how many of these men here with their spotless white shirts and precise manners went on the nights it suited them to drink and fumble and copulate in the beds of some laughing whore in a house like maxs the dance came to an end she spoke some formal words to alan ross and wondered if he had had even the faintest idea what she was thinking or if his own mind had been as far from her as hers was from this twinkling ballroom lady augusta was talking to a young man with blond whiskers charlotte had been dancing with brandy balantyne but now the general stepped forward and offered her his arm not to dance but to accompany him away somewhere in the direction of the enormous conservatory his broad shoulders were very straight but his head was bent toward her full of attention and he was talking damn charlotte sometimes she was so intensely stupid emily could have slapped her could she not see the man was falling in love he was fifty lonely intelligent emotionally inarticulateand idiotically desperately vulnerable but emily could hardly stride after charlotte now and pry her loose and kick some sense into her and worst of all when she realized what she had done she would be filled with painbecause she really had not the faintest idea she simply liked the man enormously and was unsophisticated enough to show it in the way that was natural to herthe giving of friendship george was at emilys side saying something to her i beg your pardon she said absently balantyne he repeated really quite odd for a man of his breeding emily might have her own private opinions about charlotte and at the moment they were a good deal less than charitable but she was not about to accept criticism of her from anyone else even george i cannot imagine what you are talking about she said stiffly but if you choose to apologize i shall accept he was nonplussed i thought you were interested in social reform he said with a little shake of his head it was you who brought up the whole subject in the first placeand charlotte of course now she was confused she stared back at him impatiently he did not seem to be making any sense what is the matter with youdo you feel faint he said at last then a flash of suspicion crossed his face emily what are you doing it was very seldom that george questioned her affairs but she had always contrived to provide herself with satisfactory answers beforehand and if they were less than the truth she was usually positive beyond any doubt that he would never discover it this was too short notice to invent a successful lie evasion was all that was left im sorry she said demurely i was watching charlotte and general balantyne i fear she is not aware of quite what she is doing i thought you were speaking of that now of course i realize you were not i thought that was what you intended he said sincerely you gave her the dress you might have foreseen she would look well in it it was too close to the truth for comfort and emily felt guilt sweep over her again she had planned it even if it had now gone beyond her control i did not intend her to flirt like a fool she snapped at him i think she does it rather well he sounded surprised himself he had known charlotte since the days before she married pitt she had been her mothers despair then because she simply would not conduct herself with the required charm and the mixture of frankness and deceit excitement and humor that make for a successful flirtation but time and confidence had effected a considerable change in her and she was not flirting in the usual sense the invitation she extended tacitly to balantyne was not for a little game of dalliance but for a very real friendship where pain and pleasure last and something of the inner self is given away emily had a sudden feeling that she was going to need george what were you saying about social reform she inquired maybe he sensed her unhappiness or possibly he was only exercising good manners brandy balantyne was talking about social reform he answered agreeably these disgusting events in the devils acre seem to have affected him quite surprisingly i think he really intends to do something about it she spoke spontaneously george what kind of men go to the devils acre to houses like maxs really emily i hardly think to her astonishment he looked awkward as though in spite of his more rational self he still found the subject embarrassing in front of her she gave him a wide stare do you go george no i do not he was genuinely shocked if i were going to do anything of that sort i should at least go to the haymarket or thewell i certainly would not go to the devils acre and what would you think of me if i did she asked dont be absurd he did not even consider it seriously there must be women there she pointed out or there would be no brothels she momentarily forgot to use the euphemism for such establishments of course there are women there emily he said with exaggerated patience but they are of a different sort they are notwellthey are not women that one wouldwould do anything but fornicate with she finished incisively another euphemism was abandoned quite he was a little pink in the face but she preferred to think it was due to a general discomfort for his own sex at large rather than any personal guilt she was perfectly aware that his conduct had not always been exemplary but she was wise enough not to inquire into it such curiosity would bring nothing but unhappiness to the best of her belief he had been loyal since their marriage and that was all she could reasonably ask she smiled at him with quite honest warmth but bertram astley did the shadow returned to his eyes and he looked confused odd he muttered i dont think you should inquire into that emily its really very sordid i dont mind your taking an interest in charlottes investigations when they are moderately respectableif you absolutely must he was aware of the limitations of the authority he could exercise without unpleasantness and he hated unpleasantness but i think you should not seek to know about certain aberrations it will only distress you suddenly she was overwhelmingly fond of him his concern was quite genuine he knew the world she was beginning to examine knew the frailties and the twisted hungers he did not want her to be touched by it and hurt she put her hand on his arm and moved a little closer she had no intention whatsoever of doing as he suggested she was far tougher than he supposed but it was very pleasant indeed that he imagined her so tender so untouched it was an idiotic notion but just for a little while perhaps till the end of the evening when the laughter and the lights died down she would pretend to be the innocent creature he thought she was perhaps in the hard light of truth of astleys and maxs deaths and because of his fears for alan ross whom he liked he too needed to pretend for a while alan ross did not enjoy the ball the lights and the music gave him no pleasure all he could see was christinas laughing face staring up at one man after another as she danced closely and easily in their arms he turned and saw augusta staring in the same direction she was quite still her hand was resting on the balustrade of the staircase and it was gripping so hard the fingers were crooked and clenched inside her lace gloves rosss eyes traveled past the bracelets on her wrists over her white shoulders to her face he had never realized she was capable of such emotion he did not understand what it wasdesperation fear a tenderness that made her angry beyond the dancers in their flower colors was the conservatory door where general balantyne stood leaning forward a little his face soft as he spoke to charlotte ellison rosss eyes were drawn to her because she was beautiful she had not the flawless loveliness of the young girls or the chiseled bones of classic beauty but a sheer intensity of life even across the swirl of the room he could feel her emotions and next to her so close that his hand brushed her arm balantyne was oblivious of all the world was that what augusta saw that wounded her and caused the confusion he had seen he looked again noher head was turned the other way now and she could not possibly see the general she was still looking at christina at the foot of the curved stairway leading to the gallery her mulberrycolored taffeta skirt billowing gleaming where the light caught it her cheeks flushed the man beside her put his arm around her waist and whispered something so close to her ear she must have felt his breath on her skin alan ross decided that moment that the next evening christina went out alone in the carriage whomever she was going to visit he would follow her and know for himself the truth however painful the truth must be better than the hideous thoughts that were crowding his imagination now his opportunity came almost before he was ready for it it was the following day shortly after dinner christina excused herself saying she had developed a headache and would take a short drive to get a breath of fresh air she had been in the house all day and felt the atmosphere too close she might call upon lavinia hawkesley who had been indisposed lately and ross was not to wait up for her he opened his mouth to protest then with cold fear inside him he realized she had offered the perfect opportunity very well if you think she is well enough to receive he agreed with only the smallest shake in his voice oh im sure she said cheerfully she is probably bored stiff poor soul if she has been alone all day and confined to the house i expect she will be delighted with an hour or twos company do not wait up for me no he said turning away from her no good night christina good night she picked up the ruched skirt of her dinner dress and swept out how different she was from the girl he had thought her they were strangers without humor and without trust five minutes later when he heard the front door close he stood up and went to the cloakroom where his heavy coat was hanging and put it on he added a muffler and a hat then went out into the icy street after her it was not difficult to follow the carriage it could not go quickly on the rimeencrusted cobbles and at a brisk walk he kept within twenty feet of it no one paid him the least attention he had gone over a mile when he saw the carriage draw to a halt outside a large house christina got out of the carriage and went into the house from the opposite pavement he could not distinguish the number but he knew lavinia hawkesley lived in this area so christina had come precisely as she had said for a simple call upon a woman friend he was standing here shaking with cold for no reason at all it was stupidand pathetic the carriage was moving away it was turning and coming back not round to the mews christina must have dismissed it was she proposing to remain here all night or simply to use the hawkesley coach to come home alan ross was left to wait like a loiterer on the corner and decide whether to go home himself soak the chill out of his bones in hot water and go to bed or to remain here until christina came out and to follow her again but that would be ridiculous the whole idea had been futile an aberration of his normal sanity christina was frequently selfish but she was innocent of anything worse than indiscretiona spoiled and pretty womans exercise of power the hunger to be the center of attention always lavishly admired the door of the house opened a stream of light fell on the path and christina and lavinia hawkesley came out the door closed behind them and they set off down the street on foot where in heavens name were they going ross went after them when they came to the main road and stopped a hansom cab he hailed one as soon after as he was able and ordered the cabbie to follow them the journey was farther than he expected again and again they turned corners until he lost sense of direction except that he thought they were coming closer to the river and the heart of the city the way was narrower the lights farther between a dim halo of mist reflected the glow and the damp air smelled stale high above loomed a great shadow against the sky his throat tightened and suddenly he found it hard to breathe the acrethe devils acre why in gods name was christina coming here his mind was whirling thoughts like a dark snowstorm battering him and melting into each other there was no bearable answer the cab ahead stopped and one of the women alighted she was small slight head high and feet quick on the stones christina ross opened his cab door thrust a coin into the drivers hands and stumbled out onto the dim pavement trying to discern the outline of the house christina had by now entered it was high standing straight windows glimmering in the faint gaslighta merchants house the other cab with lavinia hawkesley in it had disappeared wherever she was going it was still farther into the labyrinth of the acre for the first time he looked around at the rest of the street he had been so absorbed in watching the women he had not thought of anything else but now he saw a group of four or five men about thirty yards to the left and on the far side another three lounging in an alley entrance he turned there were more to the right watching him he could not stay here he was dressed conspicuously and his coat alone would be worth attacking for he might fight off one man even armed but not half a dozen he started to walk toward the door through which christina had disappeared after all his purpose in following her had been to learn where she was going and why the door was closed if he gained entrance and faced christina what could he say did he even want her to know he had committed this foolish act of following her here what could he do about it anyway confine her to the house withdraw all marital affection from her or put her away as aa what what was it that she was doing here the wild flights of imagining were worse than knowing he understood himself well enough not to think he could dismiss it and ever again have an unclouded moment and perhaps he was unjust to her perhaps she was innocent of the things now in his mind there was a noise behind him in the street a violent shiver of fear ran through him like a drench of cold water had the victims of the devils acre murderer been strangers like himselfmen unwanted here and hacked to pieces for their intrusion his hand lifted the knocker and crashed it down violently seconds dragged by there was the sound of shuffling feet in the street and the trickle of water ross slammed the knocker again and again then twisted his head to look behind him two of the men were closer and still moving toward him he had nothing to fight them with but his hands he had not even brought a stick sweat broke out on his body it crossed his mind to go out toward them to start the fight himself so at least it would be quick he would not think of the mutilation afterward suddenly the door opened he lost his balance and stumbled in yes sir ross collected his wits and peered at the man holding a candle in the dark hallway he was shabby his belly protruded over his trousers his slippers were loosesoled and fraying he was a big man and he stood between ross and the stairs that led upward yes sir he said again quietly ross said the first thing that came into his head i want to rent a room the man looked him up and down with narrow eyes all by yerself are yer none of your business ross gulped do you have rooms i saw a young woman come in a few minutes ago and she most assuredly does not live here none o your business the man mimicked his tone with perfect contempt people rahnd ere keeps their noses in their own muckeaps and dont go lookin trough nobody elses mister that way vey dont get nuffin cut orf like nasty fings can appen to vem as cant keep veir eyes and veir marvs to veirselves ross felt the cold run through him for a moment half his brain had forgotten murder he tried to sound calm sure of himself his throat was dry his voice higher than usual i dont care in the slightest what she came for he said trying to put a sneer in his voice whom she meets is of no possible interest to me i merely wish to come to a similar arrangement myself well vatll be kind o difficult mister seein as she comes ter see the gent wot owns ole row o ahses he gave a harsh laugh and spat on the floor nah as is bruvvers bin snuffed like reckon as ve acres slasher done im a good turn ross froze wots ve matter wiv yer scared fraid ve slashers after you too eh mebbe e is an all he sniggered mebbe yerd better scarper wile yer still got all yer partsyer dirty little git his voice was filled with disgust and ross felt his face sting as the hot blood burned up inside him this creature thought he had come sneaking here to satisfy some appetite that ross straightened up muscles tight chin high then he remembered the men outside in the street he crumpled again he could not afford pride and he most certainly dare not appear inquisitive have you rooms or have you not he asked quietly ave you money the man held out a dirty finger and thumb and rubbed them together of course i have how much ow long all night of course do you think i want to be shuffled in and out with someone waiting on my heels and looking at his watch all by yerself the mans eyebrows rose wy dontcher lock yer door an do it at ome wotever it is as takes yer fancy ross dearly wanted to hit him he resisted the temptation for a moment then anger fear and the scalding wound of christinas betrayal exploded inside him he struck the man hard with a closed fist sending him hurtling back head cracking against the wall he slithered down into a heap on the floor and lay still ross turned and pulled the door open and stepped out into the street whoever was there he had to face them he had made it impossible to stay here this time he did not hesitate his heart was racing his fists already clenched ready to strike anyone who had the recklessness to molest him he walked quickly bumping into a beggar on the corner and knocking him sidewise the man swore and ross passed on oblivious he knew the direction of westminster and he was making for welllit streets and safety footsteps echoed behind him and he increased his pace it must be only a few hundred yards now there were people huddled in doorways both men and women someone giggled in the dark there was a slap of flesh a pile of refuse fell over with a scatter of rats he ran it was late in the afternoon two days later when the maid came into his study and told ross that a mr pitt was here and would like to speak with him pitt he knew no one called pitt are you sure yes sir the maid looked doubtful he is a very odd person sir beggin your pardon but he was most insistent wouldnt give no reason sir but says as you know im he must be mistaken e wont go away sir shall i get donald to put im out sir i daresnt tell im meself es sort owell is clothes is all anyow like they wasnt properly is to begin with if you know what i mean but e speaks like a gentleman real proper suddenly ross remembered oh god yes send him in i do know him yes sir she forgot her curtsy and scurried out overwhelmed with relief a moment later pitt came in smiling casually as if he had been invited good morning mr ross nasty weather horrible ross agreed what can i do for you mr pitt pitt sat down as if the offer had been one of natural hospitality he pulled himself a little closer to the fire he must already have given the maid whatever outer clothing he had because he now wore only dark trousers a clean but rather voluminous shirt and a jacket whose pockets appeared to be stuffed with objects of awkward sizes the whole thing hung crooked and looked to be fastened on uneven buttons thank you he rubbed his hands and held them out to the flames a lot of police work is very tedious im sure it must be ross was really not interested he was unable to be sorry for the man endless questioning of not very pleasant people pitt went on and of course we have certain acquaintances who keep us informed if anything unusual happens quite but im afraid i am not one of them i know nothing that could be of use to you im sorry pitt turned to look up at him he had remarkable eyes the light shone through them like a shaft of sun through seawater i was referring to quite a different sort of person mr ross like the old fellow that told me today of a gentleman looking for rooms in drake street in the devils acre a couple of nights ago lot of gentlemen do for reasons of their own however this particular one well dressed well spoken just like most got very upset when his reasons were commented on and thats most unusual most gentlemen using such places are only too glad to be as discreet as possible he appeared to be waiting for an answer ross felt suddenly stiff as if he had walked miles and slept ill i suppose they are he said awkwardly his memory flashed back to the dim hallway the smell of dirt the mans enraging filthy leer his throat tightened completely lost his temper pitt went on with a lift of surprise in his voice hit him ross swallowed was he hurt pitt smiled pulling the corners of his mouth down in a tiny grimace pretty good crack on his skull broken collarbone hes certainly very angry about it put the word about that if the fellow comes back to the acre hes to be taught a lesson in a way he wont forget thats how i heard about itthe word around suddenly he looked directly at ross and his eyes were full of brilliance but you didnt kill him if thats what you are afraid of thank godii he stopped but it was too late i didnt go there for he could not bear anyone even this policeman to think he had intended to hire some whore and take her there pitts face was quite smooth even friendly no mr ross i didnt think for a moment that you did he said what did you go there for oh god this was even worse he could not possibly tell him about christina his heart pounded at the memory and the room seemed rededged whirling far away i cannot sayit is a private matter pitt would have to think whatever he wished the truth was worse than any imagining very dangerous sir pitts voice was getting gentler and gentler as if he were speaking to someone in great trouble three men have been murdered in the devils acre but im sure you knew that of course i knew that ross shouted pitt took a deep breath and let it out in a sigh not a place to go sightseeing mr ross its ugly and its dangerous and people have paid very highly for thenpleasures there lately what particular curiosity was it that took you to that house ross hesitated the man was like a ferret tracking him in all the tunnels of his misery to corner him into some damning truth better give him one and send him away with it that would at least guard the others the ones he could not bear to tell i had an idea whom it belonged to he lied looking pitt squarely in his bright eyes i wanted to know if it was true i hated to think any acquaintance of mine should make his living on the ownership of such places and was it true pitt inquired ross swallowed yes im afraid it was who would that be mr ross bertram astley indeed pitts face relaxed was it indeed so that is where the astley money comes from and now of course sir beau has it yes ross let his breath go he felt better pitt would never know about christina that she had gone there to meet beau astley in that filthy place his wifelying there inhe forced it from his mind drove it out any other pain was better than this yes it was he repeated perhaps that will help you in your investigations im sorry perhaps i should have told you before pitt stood up yes sir i think perhaps you should but now that i do knowhis face split in a sudden charming smileim damned if i can see where it gets me ross said nothing there was no emotion left inside him to draw on he simply watched pitt walk to the door and out into the hallway to take his coat from the maid pitt stumbled downstairs in the dark and opened the door outside on the step gleaming wet in the lamplight and the rain a constable stood water running off his cloak in streams and splashing on the stones the night was still black before even the gray smudge of false dawn pitt blinked fuzzily and shuddered with cold as the air hit his body for gods sake come in he said irritably what is it now the constable stepped inside gingerly scattering water over the floor but pitt was too cold to care gracie was not up yet and all the fires were out shut that door behind you man and come into the kitchen he led the way in enormous strides the linoleum was like ice under his bare feet at least the kitchen floor was wooden and kept the warmth of something that had once been alive and the stove would be alight it always was with a little riddling and stoking he might even get the kettle to boil the idea of a cup of steaming tea was the nearest he could get to decent sense going back to bed and the refuge of sleep was obviously impossible well what is it he demanded again pushing and pulling at the fire furiously and take that thing offhe gestured at the mans cloakbefore you drown us all the constable obediently divested himself of the cloak and set it down in the scullery he was a domestic man and normally would have known what to do without being told but the news he had brought had swept away his years of training by mother and wife its another one sir he said quietly coming back into the kitchen and handing pitt the kettle he was reaching for and its worse than before pitt knew why he had come but it would still be ugly to hear before the words were spoken there was always the hope it might be something else the pressure was mounting athelstan had called for him againthe newspapers were spreading the panic and he knew that charlotte for all her pretended innocence was using emilys social position to pursue her own suspicions about maxs women and bertie astleys life if he accused charlotte of lying they would have the sort of argument that would wound them both besides he could not prove he was right he simply knew her well enough to understand her sense of purpose and by god he was going to get the devils acre slasher before she did he was still standing in the middle of the kitchen floor with the kettle in his hand worse he said yes sir the constables voice dropped i bin round the acre ever since i joined the force but i never seen anythin like this before pitt poured the water into the pot the steam rose fragrantly into the air he took half a loaf of bread out of the big wooden bin whatever it was that waited for him however appalling would be worse on an empty stomach in the icy morning who is it the constable handed him the bread knife a man things in his pockets says es called ernest pomeroy they found im on the steps of a charity ouse sisters o mercy or somethingnot popishreglar church he explained hastily woman as found imll never be the same again in ysterics she was poor creature white as paper and screamin somethin terrible he shook his head in bewilderment and accepted the china mug of tea pitt handed him automatically he put both hands around it and let the heat tingle his numb flesh pitt sliced bread and set it on top of the cooking surface to toast he reached down two plates the butter from the cool pantry and marmalade he tried to imagine the woman dedicated to good work sheltering the homeless and uplifting the fallen she would be used to death she could hardly fail to be in the devils acre indecency would be all around her but she had probably never seen a naked man in her lifeperhaps not even imagined one was he mutilated he asked unnecessarily yes sir the constables face blanched at the memory cut to pieces e was and sort ofwelllike ed bin ripped by some kind o animalwith claws he took a deep breath the muscles in his throat tight like someone ad tried to pull is privates off im with their ands he was rightit was getting worse bertie astleys injuries had been slight almost a gesture the thought returned to him that bertie was not a victim of the same killer but that beau astley had seen the chance to step into his brothers place and lay the blame on a lunatic already beyond the pale of ordinary human decency it was a thought he tried to reject because he had liked beau astley as one likes from a distance someone one does not know but feels to be pleasant the toast was smoking he turned it over smartly and took a sip of his tea was he stabbed in the back too yes sir just about the same place as the others one side of the backbone and right about the middle must a died quick like thank god he screwed up his face wot kind o man does that to another man mr pitt it aint uman someone who believes he has been wronged beyond bearing pitt replied before he even thought i reckon as youre right an youre burnin your toast sir pitt flipped the two pieces off and handed one to the constable he took it with surprise and satisfaction he had not expected breakfasteven of rather scorched toast eaten standing up it was good the marmalade sharp and sweet maybe if someone killed my little girl id want to kill im bad enough he said with his mouth full but id never want toto tear out isbeggin your pardon siris privates like that might depend on how he killed your girl pitt replied then scowled and dropped his toast as the full horror of what he had said invaded his imagination he thought of charlotte and his daughter jemima asleep upstairs the constable stared at him his light brown eyes round i reckon as ow you could be right at that sir he said in no more than a whisper upstairs everything was silent charlotte had not stirred and the nursery had only a single light burning youd better eat your breakfast sir the constable was a practical man this was going to be no day for an empty stomach and put plenty o clothes on if you wont think me impertinent no pitt agreed absently no he picked up the toast and ate it there was no time to shave but he would finish his tea and take the constables advicelots of clothes the corpse was appalling pitt could not conceive of the rage that could drive a human being to dismember another in this way all right he said standing up slowly there was nothing more to be seen it was like those before but worse ernest pomeroy had been an ordinarylooking man perhaps less than average height his clothes were sober of good fabric but far from fashionable his face was bony and rather plain it was impossible to tell if life had fired him with any charm or humor if those unbecoming features had been transformed by an inner light do we know where he comes from he asked yes sir the sergeant on duty answered quickly got a few letters and the like on im seabrook walk quite a decent sort o place bout a couple o miles from ere i got a sister as obliges for a lady up that way not a lot o money but very respectable if you know what i mean pitt knew precisely what he meant there was a large class of people who would prefer to eat bread and gravy and sit in a cold house rather than be seen to lack for the worlds goods especially for servants to eat frugally could by stretching the imagination be a matter of taste one might even pretend not to feel the cold but to be without servants could only mean the depth of poverty had ernest pomeroy escaped a sad sham of life for a few hectic hours of indulging his starved nature only to the here in these filthy and equally deceiving streets yes i know what you mean he replied well have to get someone to identify him better not the wifeif we can find someone else maybe theres a brother or he looked down at the face again ernest pomeroy was probably nearer fifty than forty or a son well see to it sir the sergeant said wouldnt want to do that to any woman even though as shed only ave to see is face stillall the same you goin to see the wife sir yes it was inevitable it must be done and again it must be pitt yes give me that address will you seabrook walk looked fiat and gray in the thin light of morning somehow the rain did not make it clean merely wet pitt found the number he was looking for and walked up to the door as always there was no point in hesitating there was nothing that would make it hurt less and there might be something to learn somewhere there must be something that linked these men a common acquaintance an appetite a place or a time some reason they had been hated so passionately whatever the cost he must find it time would not wait for him the murderer would not wait the narrow flower beds were empty now just dark strips of earth the grass in the middle had a lifeless wintry look and the laurel bushes under the windows seemed sour holding darkness and stale water immaculate lace curtains hung at all the windows evenly spread in an hour they would be obscured by the drawn blinds of mourning he raised the polished door knocker and let it fall with a jarring sound it was several moments before a startled betweenmaid opened it a crack her pasty face peering out no one called this early yes sir i have come to speak with mrs pomeroy it is urgent oooh i dont know as she can see you now the tweeny was obviously confused she aint evenshe swallowed and remembered her loyalties to the houseeven ad er breakfast yet could you come back in an hour or two sir pitt was sorry for the girl she was probably not more than thirteen or fourteen and this would be her first job if she lost it through annoying her mistress she would be in difficult straits she might even end up wandering the streets less fortunate than the women with the skill or the personality to end up in a bawdy house with someone like victoria dalton im from the police pitt took the responsibility from her i have bad news for mrs pomeroy and it would be most cruel to let her hear it by rumor rather than to tell her discreetly ourselves oooh the girl swung the door wide and let pitt step inside she stared at his dripping clothes even in the face of crisis her training was paramount ere youre soakin wet better take off them things and give em to me ill ave cook ang em up in the scullery you wait in there an ill go upstairs an tell mrs pomeroy as youre ere an its urgent thank you pitt took off his coat hat and muffler and handed them to her she scurried out almost hidden by the bulk of them he stood obediently until mrs pomeroy should appear he looked around the room it was quite a good size the furniture was of heavy dark wood without luster in the thin light there were embroidered antimacassars on the backs of the chairs but no extra cushions on the seats the pictures on the walls were views of italy painted in hard bluesblue sea blue skywith harsh sunlight he found them ugly and offensive he had always imagined italy to be a beautiful place there was an embroidered religious text over the mantelpiece the price of a good woman is above rubies he wondered who had selected it on the chiffonier at the side there was a vase of artificial silk flowers delicate things with gay gossamer petals it was a surprising touch of beauty in an unimaginative house adela pomeroy was at least fifteen years younger than her husband she stood in the doorway in a lavender robe trimmed with froths of lace at throat and wrists and stared at pitt her hair tumbled down her back she had not bothered to dress it her face was fineboned her neck too slender for another few years she would be lovely before nervous tensions ate the lines deeper and marred the roundness of the flesh birdie said you are from the police she came in and closed the door yes mrs pomeroy i am sorry but i have bad news for you he wished she would sit down but she did not a man was found this morning whom we believe to be your husband he had letters identifying him but we will have someone make certain of course she still stood without movement or change of expression perhaps it was too soon shock was like that i am sorry he repeated hes dead yes her eyes wandered around the room looking at familiar things he wasnt ill was it an accident no he said quietly i am afraid it was murder she would have to know there was no kindness in pretending oh there seemed to be no emotion in her slowly she walked over to the sofa and sat down automatically she pulled across her knees the silk of the robe and pitt thought momentarily how beautiful it was pomeroy must have been a wealthy man and more generous than his face suggested perhaps it was not a meanness he had seen but merely the emptiness of death maybe he had loved this woman very much and saved hard to give her these luxuriesthe flowers and the robe pitt felt what could be a quite unjust dislike well up inside him that he could see no agony or grief in her how did it happen she asked he was attacked in the street he replied he was stabbed it was probably over very quickly i dare say there was only a moment of pain still there was nothing in her face then a faint surprise in the street you mean hehe was robbed what had she expected robbery was not such an uncommon crime although it was not usually accompanied by such dreadful violence maybe he carried little of value but then robbers were not to know that until too late he had no money on him he answered her but his watch was still in his pocket and a very good leather case for cards and letters he never carried much money she was still staring ahead of her as if pitt were a disembodied voice a guinea or two when did you last see him mrs pomeroy he would have to tell her the rest where he was found the mutilation better she hear it from him yesterday evening her answer cut into his thoughts he was going to deliver a book to one of his pupils he was a teacher but you probably know thatmathematics no i didnt know did he tell you the name of the pupil and where he lived morrison im afraid i dont know wherenot far away i think he intended to walk he would have a note of it in his books he was very meticulous still there was no emotion in her voice except the faint surprise as if she could not comprehend that such a violent thing should have happened to so ordinary a man she stood up and went to the window she was very slight and fragile like a bird even in this apparent state of numbness she had a grace that was individual a way of holding her head high pitt found it hard to imagine her in the arms of the man whose face he had seen in the devils acre but then so often one cannot fathom the loves or hates of other people why should this be comprehensible he knew nothing of either of them can you think of any reason he should go to the devils acre maam he asked as usual it was brutal but she seemed so emotionless perhaps this was the best time she did not turn but stayed with her back to him he was not sure whether it was his imagination that the delicate shoulders stiffened under the lavender silk i have no idea but you did know that he went there from time to time he pressed she hesitated for a moment no there was no point in arguing with her it was only an impression he remained silent perhaps in her speech she would give something away is that where he was found she asked yes was itthe samethe same as the others yes im sorry ah she stood so long he could not tell if she kept her back to him to hide some overwhelming private feelings if perhaps he should call a maid to help her to bring her some restorative or if she preferred the dignity of being left alone or was she simply waiting for him to speak again can i call your maid to bring something maam he broke the silence from his own necessity what he repeated the offer at last she turned around her face seemed perfectly composed no thank you is there anything else you wish to know from me he was worried for her this dry calm shock was dangerous he must have some responsible servant call her doctor yes please i would like the names and addresses of his pupils and any close acquaintances you believe he may have seen in the last few weeks his study is on the other side of the hall take whatever you want now if you will excuse me i would like to be alone without waiting for his answer she walked past him with a faint waft of perfumesomething sweet and mildly floweryand went out the door he spent the rest of the morning looking through the books and papers in pomeroys study trying to form some picture of the mans life his nature pomeroy emerged as a meticulous pedestrian man who had taught mathematics ever since he had graduated with academic qualifications most of his students seemed to have been aged about twelve or fourteen and of quite average ability except an occasional one of real promise he tutored families privately both boys and girls together it seemed a conscientious and blameless life without any outward mark of humor the flamboyant silk flowers in the withdrawing room could never have been his in fact the lavender silk gown with its foam of lace seemed far beyond his imaginationor his financial reach pitt was offered luncheon by a cook who burst into tears every time he spoke to her then in the afternoon he copied out all the names and addresses of the current pupils plus a few of those from the recent past and those of acquaintances and tradesmen he took his leave without seeing adela pomeroy again he went home earlier than usual he was tired and beginning to feel the chill of the day spread through him he had been woken to the news of another death had gone to see the corpse lying grotesquely on the steps of a house of charity then had had to bear the news of it to the widow whose shock he had been helpless to reach he had spent the long hours of the day intruding into the details of the mans life searching it and taking it apart looking for the flaws that had led him to the devils acre and murder he had accumulated a multitude of facts and none of them told him anything that seemed to matter he felt helpless hemmed in on every side by grief and trivia if charlotte made one cheerful or inquisitive remark his temper would explode pitt spent the next four days picking at ragged edges trying to unravel enough to find one thread sufficiently strong to evoke something better than the random destruction of a madman he spoke to pomeroys students who seemed to think well of their tutor despite the fact that he had spent his entire time instilling into their minds the principles of mathematics they stood in front of pitt each in his own separate overcrowded parlor they were sober and scrubbed and spoke respectfully of their elders as became wellbroughtup children he thought he even detected beneath the ritual phrases a genuine affection pleasant memories perceptions of beauty in mathematical reason occasionally in spite of himself ugly thoughts crossed pitts mind of intimacies between man and child of cases he had known in the past but he could discover no instance where any child boy or girl had been tutored alone ernest pomeroy emerged as an admirable man even if there was too little humor or imagination to make him likable but then it is hard to catch the essence of a man when all you know is his dead face and the memories of stunned and obedient children who had been grimly forewarned of the consequences of speaking ill of the deceasedand of the general disgrace of having anything to do with the police for any reason the majesty of the law was better observed from afar respectable people did not become involved with the less savory minions who served to enforce its rule pitt also of course asked mrs pomeroy if he might look through the dead mans personal effects to see if there were any letters or records that might suggest enmity threat or any motive at all to harm him she hesitated and stared at him out of eyes that still looked frozen in shock it was an intrusion and he felt no surprise that she should resent his request but it seemed that she realized the necessity and that to refuse would be pointless and of course if she had any guilt or complicity in the murder she would have had more than enough time to destroy anything she wished before he had first come with the news yes she said at last yes if you wish i do not believe he had much correspondence i recall very few letters but if you feel it would be useful you may have them thank you maam she made him feel peculiarly awkward because her grief was so inaccessible if she had wept there was no sign of it in her face her eyes were smooth the lids pale and unswollen and yet she did not move with the stilted sleepwalking gait of those who are so profoundly shocked that emotion is still petrified inside thembefore the shell cracks and the pain bursts free had she loved pomeroy more probably it had been one of the many marriages arranged by parents and suitor pomeroy was considerably older he might have been her fathers choice rather than her own yet even in this state of limbo between the news of death and the beginning of acceptance of life as it must become pitt could see that she was a woman of grace and delicacy her clothes were very feminine her hair soft her bones were just a little too fine to appeal to him but to many men she must have been beautiful surely pomeroy was not the best she could have done for herself had she loved him or was it perhaps a debt of honor did her parents know pomeroy and owe him something he searched through all of pomeroys rooms and read every letter and receipt as adela pomeroy had said his affairs were meticulously kept from the accounts the age and quality of the furnishings the number of house servants and the stock in the kitchen and pantry it appeared they lived frugally there was no sign of extravaganceexcept the vase of colored silk flowers in the withdrawing room and adelas gowns had he bought them as gifts for her an indulgent expression of his love he could not imagine it of a man with the face he had seen in the devils acre but by then he had already been robbed of that quickening that inhabits the flesh of the capability for passion and pain moments of tenderness dreams or illusions even in life we mask our vulnerability what right had pitt or anyone else to know what this man had felt for his wife what vain or hopeless ideas still haunted him or was her indifference apparent now because there had long ago ceased to be any real emotion between them was his death merely the formal ending of a relationship that was merely a facade they had been married fifteen years that much she had told him there were no children had there ever been could that even have been the reason she chose this plain older mana kindness to a woman whose moral character had been blemished or perhaps who already knew she was barren had gratitude turned over the years to hatred had she sought love elsewhere was that where the silk flowers and the gowns came from it was an obvious question and he would be obliged to search he asked her if she had ever heard of bertram astley max burton or dr pinchin the names produced no answering flicker in her face if she was a liar she was superb neither did he find any mention of the other victims in pomeroys papers there was nothing to do but thank mrs pomeroy and leave with a peculiar feeling of unreality as if all the time she was speaking she had barely been aware of him he was an usher in the theater and she was watching the main drama somewhere else out of his sight the next obvious thing was to try the acre again and the best source was squeaker harris pitt found him in his grubby attic hunched over the table by the windowthe cleanest thing in the placeso that the winter light could fall onto his paper too many careful suspicious eyes would examine his work it must meet the highest standards of perfection or he would not remain in his trade he glared at pitt balefully you aint got no right bustin inter a mans ouse he exclaimed as he covered the paper he was working on as inconspicuously as possible i could ave yerfer trespassin vats agin ve law mr pitt an wots more it aint right its a social call pitt replied sitting on an upended box and balancing with some difficulty im not interested in your business skills aint yer squeaker was not convinced why dont you put them away pitt suggested helpfully in case dust falls on them you dont want anything spoiled squeaker gave him a squinting glare such leniency was confusing it was very contrary of policemen to be so inconsistent in their behavior how was anyone to know where he stood however he was glad of the chance to put the halfcompleted forgeries out of sight he returned and sat down considerably easier in his mind well he demanded wotcher want ven yer aint come ere fer nuffin of course not pitt said whats the word about these murders now what are they saying squeaker the acre slasher vere aint no word nobody knows nuffin and nobody aint sayin nuffin nonsense you telling me thereve been four

ter get violent wiv me ands d ruin me touch he waved his fingers expressively like a pianist dips dont neever he added as an afterthought pitt conceded with a smile unwillingly he believed squeaker still he gave it a last try what about ambrose mercutt max was taking his trade so e was squeaker agreed better at it see an ambrose is a nasty little bastard wen es crossed as many o is girlsd tell

up and the box collapsed squeaker looked at the box and his face wrinkled up yer shouldnt ave sat on vat mr pitt yer too eavy fer itnow look wot yer done i oughta charge yer fer breakages i ought pitt pulled out a sixpence and gave it to him i wouldnt like to owe you squeaker squeaker hesitated the coin halfway to his teeth the thought of pitt owing him was extremely attractive even tempting but sixpence now was better than a debt pitt might let slip from his rather erratic mind vats right mr pitt he agreed shouldnt never owe nobody never knows as wen vey might collect at an inconvenient moment he raised candid eyes but if n i ears oo done the poor geezersfer sure likeill send and tell yer oh yes pitt said skeptically you do that squeaker squeaker spat again ope ter die oh gawdi didnt oughter said vat geez may gawd strike me ifn i dont he amendedwith greater trust in his ability to obtain mercy from the almighty than from the acre slasher he can have you after ive finished with you pitt looked him up and down if he can be bothered with whats left nah mr pitt vat aint nice yer abusin me orspitality squeaker was aggrieved but happily so it was a feeling he enjoyed ve trouble wiv you crushers is yer aint got no happreciation pitt smiled and went out the door he picked his way down the stairs carefully avoiding the rotted ones and went outside into the cold malodorous air of the alley tomorrow he would get a picture of ernest pomeroy and take it around the brothels in the acre charlotte was waiting for him when he arrived home she was beautiful her face radiant hair soft and sweet to smell she clung to him fiercely as if she were bursting with energy where have you been he asked holding her hard only to see emily she dismissed it as a trifle but he knew perfectly well why she had gone she gave him a quick kiss and pulled away youre cold sit down and warm yourself gracie will have dinner in half an hour your coat looks very dirty where have you been to the devils acre he said tartly as he eased off his boots and wriggled his toes he leaned back in his chair and stretched his feet out toward the fire charlotte passed him his slippers did you learn anything no he lied after all it was not definable her face fell into lines of commiseration oh i am sorry then she brightened as if an idea had just occurred to her perhaps it would be better to approach it from the other point of view in spite of himself he asked what other point of view and then was angry with his gullibility but she did not hesitate the point of view of maxs women she replied instantly these murders were committed with a great deal of hatred he smiled sourly it was a ludicrous understatement and sitting here in her own safe home what on earth could she know about it he had seen the corpses you should look for someone whose life has been ruined she went on if max had seduced some woman and then her husband had found out he might well hate enough to kill like thatnot only max but whoever had had anything to do with her disgrace and how would he find out he asked if she was going to play policeman let her answer all the difficult ugly questions that athelstan would have thrown at him there is no connection whatsoever between max and hubert pinchin we cant find anyone who knew them both maybe pinchin was the doctor for maxs establishments she suggested good idea but he wasnt theres a disbarred old crow who does thatand very lucrative it is too he wouldnt share his practice with anyone crow is that an underworld term for a doctor she did not wait for a reply what if the husband came as a customer and found the whore was his own wife that way he would know who the procurer was as well it was an excellently rational solution and she knew it she glowed with triumph and what about the woman he said scathingly he just bundled her up and took her back home again im sure he wanted herafter that i dont suppose so for a moment she sniffed and looked at him impatiently but he couldnt divorce her could he why not god knows he would have cause oh thomas dont be ridiculous no man is going to admit he found his wife in the devils acre working as a whore even if the police werent looking for someone with a motive for murder it would ruin him forever if there is anything worse than death for a man it is to be laughed at and pitied at the same time he could not argue no he said irritably hell probably kill her too but quietly when hes ready her face paled do you think so damn it charlotte how should i know if hes capable of cutting up her pimp and her lovers what would stop him leaving her in some more respectable gutter when hes ready so you bear that in mind and stop meddling in things you dont understandwhere you can only do damage by stirring up a lot of suspicions rememberif youre right hes got precious little left to lose i havent been for heavens sake do you think im stupid i dont know what youve been doing with emily but i most assuredly know why she sat perfectly still color high in her cheeks i havent been anywhere near the devils acre and to the best of my knowledge i havent spoken to anyone who has she said righteously he knew from the brilliance of her eyes that she was speaking the literal truth anyway he did not think she would lie to him not in so many words not for want of trying he said acidly well you dont appear to have got very far either she retorted i could give you the names of half a dozen women to try how about lavinia hawkesley she is married to a boring man at least thirty years older than she is and dorothea blandish and mrs dinford and lucy abercorn and what about the new widow pomeroy i hear she is very pretty and she knows one or two people in the fast set adela pomeroy he was momentarily startled out of his anger yes she said with satisfaction seeing his face and there are others ill write them down for you write them down then forget the whole thing stay at home this is murder charlotte very ugly and violent murder and if you go meddling in it you may very well end up dead in a gutter yourself do as you are told she said nothing do you hear me he had not meant to but he was raising his voice if you and emily go blundering about god knows what lunatic youll disturbpresuming you get anywhere near the truth far more likely its a business vengeance in the acre and nothing to do with society at all what about bertie astley she demanded what about him he owned a block of buildings in the acre a whole street thats where the astley money comes from their own private slum oh no oh yes perhaps he had a brothel as well and he was removed by a rival what are you going to do go back and look again of course what else thomas please be careful she stopped unsure what more to say he knew the dangers but the alternatives were worse another murder public outrage reaching hysteria athelstan afraid for his position putting more and more pressure on pitt to arrest someone anyone to satisfy parliament the church the patrons of the acre and other whorehouses all over london and then terror fury and guilt when there was yet another atrocity but perhaps foremost in his own mind he felt the need to solve this case himself to solve it before charlotte unwinding some thread from emilys society connections started to follow it from the other end and ran into something she could not handle he had forbidden her to meddle not only because her life could be in great danger but also because he must demonstrate that he did not need her help of course i shall be careful he said stiffly im not a fool she gave him a sidelong look and held her tongue and you stay at home and keep out of it he added youve plenty to attend to here without interfering where you can only get into trouble nevertheless when he went into the acre the next day he took even more care than usual to dress inconspicuously and to walk with that mixture of sureness of where he was going and the furtive beaten air of someone whose journey is futile and who knows it the day was cold with gloomy skies and a hard wind blowing up from the river there was every excuse to pull his hat down and wind his muffler over the bare skin of his face the sparse gaslights of the acre glimmered in the murky morning air like lost moons in a sunken crooked world pitt had a good likeness of pomeroy and he intended to find out everything he could about the brothels that catered to customers who liked children somewhere in this cesspit he expected to find pomeroys reason for being here and he believed it had to do with a need the man could not or dared not satisfy in seabrook walk nothing else would have brought such a prim almost obsessively meticulous creature into this world he had begun the day in parkins office gathering all the information the local police could give him about brothels that were known to employ children he was even offered the names of snouts and small personal secrets that might allow him to exert a little pressure to assure the truth but no one was prepared to say that he knew pomeroy or had ever catered to him by ten that night pitt was cold boneaching tired he intended to try one more house before going home there was no point in lying about who he was this time ambrose mercutts doorman knew him it was his job to remember faces wotcher want he demanded angrily yer cant come ere nah its business hours im on business pitt snapped and im perfectly happy to come and go quietly and not disturb your customers if youll treat me civilly and answer a few questions the man considered for a moment he was long and lean and he had half an ear missing he was dressed in a modishly cut jacket with a silk kerchief tied around his throat wots it worth to yer he asked nothing pitt said immediately but ill tell you what its worth to you continued employment and a nice pretty neckno ugly rope burns can ruin a mans future a hemp collar the man snorted i aint murdered no one duffed up a few wot didnt know wen theyd ad their moneys worth he tittered showing his long teeth but they aint makin no complaints gentlemen as comes to these parts never do and there aint nothin you

complain as she didnt give me value fer me money i wants as yer should make er be more obligin me lud he switched position and put his other hand on his hip looking down his nose why certainly lord mudinyereye you just tell me ow much yer paid this ere whore and were i can find er and ill see as she gives yer satisfaction ever thought of going on the halls pitt asked cheerfully youd have them in the aisles with that the man hesitated all sorts of glittering possibilities appeared in his mind he was flattered in spite of himself he had expected abuse not appreciation let alone such a golden idea pitt pulled out the picture of pomeroy whats that the man asked know him pitt passed it over there had been no picture of him in the newspapers what of it what dyou care thats none of your business just believe me i do careso much so that i shall go on looking until i find someone who catered for his particular tastes and if i keep on coming round here that wont be good for business now will it all right yer sod so we know im wot then what did he come here for the man looked incredulous wot did you say you alfwitted or somethin wot the ell dyer think e come fer e was bloody bent the dirty little sod e liked em real youngseven or eight mebbe but yerll never prove it an i aint said nothin nah git aht of ere afore i spoil your nice pretty neck with a red ring round itright from one

the man called after him yer aint liked around ere best fer yer ealth ter try somewhere else pitt had every intention of leaving as rapidly as possible he started to walk briskly hands in his pockets against the cold scarf pulled up around his ears so pomeroy was a pederast that was no surprise it was what he had expected all he had been looking for was confirmation bertie astley had owned a row of houses here in the acresweatshops tenements a gin mill maxs occupation had never been a secret all that remained was to establish pinchins reason for being here and then of course to find the common link the place or the person that bound them togetherthe motive it was desperately cold the wind with its acrid sewer smell made his eyes water he lifted his head squared his shoulders and strode out more rapidly perhaps that was why he did not hear them come up behind him in the shadowy light he had solved the mystery of pomeroy in his mind he had completed his business and had forgotten he was still well inside the acre walking like a happy man a man with purpose he was as conspicuous as a white rabbit on a newturned field the first one struck him from behind there was a stinging blow in the small of his back his feet were suddenly entangled and the pavement hit him in the face he rolled over knees hunched then straightened with all his strength his feet met flesh that gave under his weight falling away with a grunt but there was another at his head he lashed out with his fists and tried to regain his balance a blow landed on his shoulder bruising but harmless he threw his weight behind his answering punch and was exhilarated to hear the crack of bone then there was a numbing punch in his side it would have been his back had he not turned and kicked as hard as he could at precisely the moment he was struck there was nothing he could do now but run for it a hundred yards or two at the most and he would be on the edge of the acre and within hailing distance of a hansom and safety his side hurt he must have a terrible bruise there but a hot bath and a little embrocation would cure that his feet were flying over the cobbles he was not in the least ashamed to run only a fool stayed against impossible odds he was short of breath the pain in his side was sharper it seemed a mile to the lighted street and traffic the ghostly rings of the gas lamps were always ahead they never drew level now then were you goin in such an almighty urry then an arm came out and caught hold of him in a moment of panic he tried to raise his hand and strike the man but the arm was leaden what it was a constablea constable on the beat oh thank god he exclaimed the mans face grew enormous and vacant shining in the mist like the gas lamps ere guv you look rough wots the matter wiv yer eh ere you got blood all over yer side i think as id better get yer to an orspital right quick dont want yer passin out on me ere old up a bit longer cabbie cabbie through a haze of swinging lights and numbing cold pitt felt himself bundled into a hansom and jolted through the streets then helped gingerly down and through a labyrinth of bright rooms he was stripped of his clothes examined swabbed with something that stung abominably stitched through flesh that was mercifully still anesthetized by the original blow bandaged and dressed then given a fiery drink that scorched his throat and made his head muzzy at last he was courteously accompanied home it was midnight the following morning he woke up so sore he could barely move and it was a moment before he could remember why charlotte was standing over him her hair pulled back untidily her face pale thomas she said anxiously he groaned you were stabbed she said they told me it isnt very deep but youve lost quite a lot of blood your jacket and shirt are ruined he smiled in spite of himself she was very pale indeed thats terrible are you sure theyre completely ruined she sniffed furiously but the tears ran down her face and she put her hands up to cover them i will not cry its your own stupid fault youre a perfect idiot you sit there as pompous as a churchwarden and tell me what i must and must not do and then you go into the acre all by yourself asking dangerous questions and get stabbed she took one of his big handkerchiefs from the dresser and blew her nose hard i dont suppose for a moment you even saw the slasher after all thatdid you he hitched himself up a little wincing at the pain in his side actually he was not at all sure it was the acre slasher who had attacked him it could have been any group of cutpurses prepared for a fight and i expect youre hungry she said stuffing the handkerchief into her apron pocket well the doctor said a day in bed and youll be a lot better ill get up youll do as youre told she shouted youll not get out of that bed till i tell you you may and dont you argue with me just dont you dare it was three days before he was strong enough to return to the police station tightly bandaged and fortified with a flask of rather expensive port wine the wound was healing and although it was still painful he was able to move about meanwhile the threads of the devils acre murders had drawn closer in his mind and he felt compelled to return to the case ive put other men on it athelstan assured him with a worried gesture all i can spare and what have they come up with pitt asked for once permittedeven pleaded withto sit in the big padded chair instead of standing he enjoyed the sensation and leaned back spreading his legs it might never happen again nothing much athelstan admitted still dont know what tied those four men together dont know why pinchin went to the acre for that matter are you sure its not a lunatic pitt no im not sure but i dont think so a doctor could find a dozen occupations in the acre if he wasnt particularly scrupulous athelstan winced with distaste i presume so but which of them did pinchin practice and for whom do you think he procured these wellbred women for max that you insist he had possibly although there werent many society women among his patients wellbred is relative pitt almost anything would appear to be a lady in the acre pitt stood up reluctantly then id better go and ask a few more questions youre not going by yourself athelstan said in alarm i cant afford another murder in the acre pitt stared at him thank you he said dryly i shouldnt like to embarrass you damn it ill take a constable with metwo if you like athelstan pulled himself to attention its an order pittan order you understand yes sir ill go now with two constables ambrose mercutt was incensed with a mixture of outrage and very real fear that he would be blamed for pitts injury which was now common talk in the acre its your own fault mercutt said peevishly go wandering around places youre not wanted poking your nose into other peoples private businessof course you get stabbed lucky you werent garroted downright stupid if you pushed everyone around the way you did my people im only surprised you werent killed pitt did not argue he knew his own mistake it was not in having come into the acre but in having forgotten to keep up the appearance to walk like a man who belonged here he had allowed himself to become conspicuous it was careless and as ambrose said stupid and sorry too no doubt pitt said who looks after your women when they get sick what pitt repeated the question but ambrose was quick to understand not pinchin if thats what you think maybe but well speak to all your women just in case they may remember something you dont mercutts face was white all right he may have looked after one or two of them from time to time what of it he was very useful some of the stupid bitches get with child sometimes he took care of it and took his pay in kind so id be the last person to kill him wouldnt i not if he was blackmailing you blackmailing me his voice rose to a screech at the idiocy of the idea whatever for everyone knows what business im in i dont pretend to be something im not i could have blackmailed himi could have ruined his nice respectable practice at highgateif id wanted to but the arrangement suited me well enough when he was killed i had to find someone else pitt could not move him from that no matter what other questions or pressures he put forth finally he and the constables left and went to another bawdy house and another and another it was five oclock when pitt tired and sore came with the two constables to the house of the dalton sisters he had kept them until last on purpose he was looking forward to the warmth the agreeable atmosphere and perhaps a cup of hot tea both mary and victoria were present this time he was received with the same domestic calm as before and invited to the sitting room he accepted the offer of refreshment with rather more speed than grace mary looked at him suspiciously but victoria was as civil as before ernest pomeroy did not come here she said candidly pouring the tea and passing it to him the constables were in the main entrance room embarrassed and thoroughly enjoying themselves no pitt said accepting the cup i already know where he went i was thinking of dr pinchin her eyebrows rose and her gray eyes were like smooth winter seas i dont see all our customers but i dont recall him he was certainly not murdered hereor anywhere near here did you know him professionally perhaps the ghost of a smile touched her mouth his profession or mine mr pitt he smiled back his miss dalton no i have good health and when i do not i know well enough what to do for myself how about your womenyour girls no mary said immediately if anyone is sick we look after them pitt turned to look at her she was younger than victoria her face lacked the power of will the resolution in the eyes but it had the same smooth country look the short nose and soft freckles she opened her mouth and then closed it again the meaning was obvious to pitt she did not want to admit to abortion of course we have doctors sometimes victoria took charge again but we have not used pinchin he has never had anything to do with this establishment pitt actually believed her but he wanted to stay in the warmth a little longer and he had not finished his tea can you give me any reason i should believe that he asked the man was murdered you would not wish to admit acquaintance with him victoria glanced at her sister then at pitts cup she reached for the pot and filled it without asking him none at all she said with an expression pitt could not fathom except that he was a butcher and i dont want my girls cut about so they either bleed to death or are too mutilated ever to work again believe that pitt found himself apologizing it was ridiculous he was taking tea with a brothelkeeper and telling her he was sorry because some doctor had aborted whores so clumsily that they never recoveredand they were not even her whores or was she a brilliant liar ill ask them myself he drank the rest of his tea and stood up especially those whove come to you most recently mary stood up too hands clenched in her skirt you cant dont be silly victoria said briskly of course he can if he wants to weve never had pinchin in this house unless hes come as a customer id be obliged to you mr pitt if youd not be abusive to our girls i wont permit it she fixed him with a firm eye and pitt was reminded of governesses he had met in great houses she did not wait for his answer but led him into the upper part of the house and began knocking on one door after another pitt went through the routine of asking questions and showing pinchins picture to plump and giggling prostitutes the rooms were warm and smelled of cheap perfume and body odors but the colors were gay and the rooms cleaner than he had expected after the fourth one victoria was called away to attend to some domestic crisis and he was left with mary he was speaking to the last girl skinny not more than fifteen or sixteen years old and plainly frightened she looked at pinchins face on the paper and instantly pitt knew she was lying when she said she had never seen him think hard pitt warned be very careful you can be put in prison for lying to the police the girl went pasty white thats enough mary said sharply shes only a housemaidwhat would she want with the likes of him leave her alone she just dusts and sweeps she has nothing to do with that side of things the girl started to move away pitt caught hold of her arm not roughly but hard enough to prevent her going she began to cry great shuddering sobs as if she were overtaken with some desperate animal grief instantly in the bottom of his stomach pitt knew she must be one of pinchins butcheries one who had lived but so damaged she would never be a normal woman at her age she should have been laughing dreaming of romance looking forward to marriage he wanted to comfort her and there was nothing he could say or do nothing anyone could elsie it was marys voice loud and frightened elsie the little maid was still weeping clinging now to marys arm from the end of the passage came the sound of a low singing snarl pitt swung around there under the gas lamp stood a squat white ratfaced bullterrier with teeth bared and bow legs quivering behind him was the most enormous woman he had ever seen her bare arms hanging loosely her flat face like a suet pudding with eyes shrouded in creases of fat never you mind miss mary the woman said in a soft high voice like that of a little girl i wont let im urt yer yer just leavin aint yer mister she took a step forward and the dog bristling lurched a step forward with her pitt felt horror flood through him was he looking at the devils acre slasher was it this woman mountain and her dog his throat was dry he swallowed on nothing throw him out elsie mary shrieked throw him out throw him hard go on put him in the gutter set dutch on him the great woman took another step forward her face was expressionless she could have had her sleeves rolled up to do laundry or knead bread beside her dutchs snarl grew higher stop it victorias voice shouted from the head of the stairs where she had disappeared a short time before thats not necessary elsie mr pitt is not a customerand he wont hurt anyone her tone became sharper really mary sometimes you are stupid she pulled a handkerchief out of her sleeve and handed it to the maid now pull yourself together millie and get on with your work stop snifflingtheres nothing to cry about go on she watched as the girl ran away and the enormous woman and the dog turned and trundled obediently after her mary looked sullen but kept her peace im sorry victoria said to pitt we found millie in a bad way i didnt know who was responsible but perhaps it was pinchin poor little creature nearly bled to death she got with child and her father threw her out she worked herself into one of the houses where someone aborted her then when they threw her out because she was useless to them we picked her up there was nothing pitt could say the situation was beyond trite sympathy victoria led the way back toward the front rooms mary shouldnt have called elsie shes only for customers who get difficult her face was bleak i hope you were not frightened mr pitt pitt had been terrified the sweat was still standing out on his body not at all he lied glad she could not see his face thank you for your frankness miss dalton now i know what pinchin was doing in the acre and where his additional income came fromat least to furnish his cellar you dont happen to know whom he practiced for do you millie was with ambrose mercutt if thats what you want to know she said calmly i cannot tell you anything more than that i dont think i need anything more pitt came out into the main room and both constables scarletfaced sprang to their feet tipping two laughing girls off their laps pitt turned to victoria affecting not to notice thank you miss dalton good night victoria was equally imperturbable good night mr pitt general balantyne could not put the devils acre murders out of his mind he had never heard of dr pinchin or the last victim ernest pomeroy before the newspapers made them synonymous with terror and abomination in the dark but the face of max burton with its lidded eyes and curling lip raised in him disturbing memories of other murders hideous incidents from the past that he had never fully understood and bertie astley belonged to balantynes own class something less than true aristocracy but far more than merely gentry anyone might come by money and manners could be mimicked or learned wit fashion and even beauty were nothing one enjoyed them but no one worth a thought was taken in by them but the astleys had breeding generations of honorable reputation of service to church or state had made them part of a small world of privilege that had once seemed goldenand safe occasionally some knave or fool stepped out of itbut no invader had beaten his way in how had bertram astleys body come to be found in a doorway to a male brothel balantyne of course was not naive enough to exclude the possibility that astley had gone there for the obvious purpose or that he had been murdered by a chance lunatic neither could he dismiss the fear that it was not accident but design that had selected him he mistrusted the comfortable belief in a random killer that chose two men max and bertie so dramatically dissimilar yet both known to him he broached the subject to augusta she immediately assumed he wished to discuss the devils acre itself and some plan for reform of prostitution and its ills her face closed over really brandon for a man who has spent the best part of his adult years in the army you are singularly ingenuous she said with some contempt if you imagine you are going to alter the baser instincts of human nature by a little wellmeaning legislation then you belong in some nice village pulpit where you can dispense tea and platitudes to unmarried ladies of earnest disposition and do very little harm by it here in a sophisticated society you are ridiculous he was stung it was not only cruel but totally unjust and it was not what he had meant there are many words i have heard applied to the murder of bertie astley he said cuttingly but you are the first to choose sophisticated it is an allusion whose appropriateness escapes me a dull color marked her cheeks he had misunderstood her willfully and as painfully as she had mistaken him i do not appreciate sarcasm brandon she answered and you have not the wit to do it successfully bertie astley was an unfortunate victim of whatever lunatic is perpetrating these outrages what purpose took him to that area we will probably never know and it is none of our business suffer him to be buried in peace and his family to mourn him decently it is indelicate in the extreme to remind anyone of the circumstances of his death i imagine a gentleman would not do so then it is time we had fewer gentlemenand a greater number of police or whatever it is that it takes to get something done he retorted i for one do not desire to see any more mutilated corpses turning up in london she looked at him wearily we have few enough gentlemen already i would wish there were more not less she turned and walked away leaving him with the feeling that he had lost the argument in spite of the fact that he was in the right the following day christina had luncheon with her mother but declined to go calling balantyne found himself in the withdrawing room alone with his daughter the fire was blazing halfway up the chimney and the room was full of warm flickering light it seemed familiar comfortably timeless almost as if they could have slipped back into his youth and her childhood when affection was taken for granted he sat back in his chair and stared at christina as she stood by the round piecrust table her face was remarkably pretty the small features rounded lips wide eyes shining hair her figure in its fashionable dress still had the freshness of a girls she was a strange mixture of child and womanperhaps that was her charm certainly she had had many admirers before she married alan ross and to judge from the social occasions at which he had seen her she still had even if they were now more discreet christina she turned and looked at him yes papa you knew sir bertram astley didnt you he did not allow it to be a question because he would not accept denial she faced him when she spoke but bent her eyes to a china ornament on the table the subject was trivial not worth a conversation slightly she replied one is bound to meet most of the people in society at some time or another she did not ask why he had mentioned it what sort of a man was he pleasant as far as i could judge she answered with a slight smile but quite ordinary she was so confident that he could not disbelieve her and yet he knew she moved in circles that were neither bland nor artless she was far less innocent than he had been at her ageperhaps than he was even now what about beau astley she hesitated a moment was there a touch of color on her skin or was it only a reflection of the firelight charming she said without expression in her voice very agreeable although i admit i do not know him well it is something of a hasty judgment if you are expecting me to come up with any profundity papa i am afraid i shall disappoint you i had no idea sir bertram had perverted tastes i fully thought he was after that silly woolmer creature and meant to marry her and since she has no money at all and no family to speak of i can only imagine it was for the most physical of reasons she glanced over at him im sorry if i shock you sometimes i find you incredibly stuffy he was aware that she found him so but it still hurt to hear it in such words he did not wish to pursue the matter by defending himself and at the same time was conscious that he should she had no business to speak to him with so little respect then either he did not go to the devils acre for the reason supposedor else he was a man of very diverse tastes he said dryly she laughed outright her hands held the china ornament up in the air she had beautiful fingers small and slender you know i quite expected you to be furious instead you turn out to have a sense of humor a sense of the absurd he corrected which was a pleasant feeling if bertie astley was as diligent in his pursuit of miss woolmer as you suggest i find it hard to believe he was also satisfying quite different appetites in the devils acre or had miss woolmer declined him she gave a little snort far from it she grasped onto him like a drowning woman and her mother was even worse if they can manage it theyll catch poor beau now shes a great lump of a girl like clotted cream and poor beau is unwilling again she hesitated her fingers tightening on the ornament i really have no idea as i said before i do not know them except in the briefest way it is really none of my concern she set the ornament down and smiled turning from the table to come toward the fire the light shone on the satin of her dress gleaming brilliantly for a moment then falling into rich shadows again have you ever heard of any of the other victims as soon as he said it he knew it was a ridiculous question and wished he could withdraw it apart from max of course he added by way of making it at least logical within itself even if it was stupid in the whole perhaps some memory of maxs service in this house stirred in her she swallowed he felt guilty for having mentioned it hardly she said casually wasnt one a doctor and one a schoolteacher or something not exactly my social circle papa isnt there a saying about necessity making strange bedfellows or something of the sort she laughed a little harshly maybe they were all possessed of the same vice maybe they gambled in the devils acre and lost i seem to have heard that bertie astley gambled not to pay ones debt is a social sin of monstrous proportions you know didnt they teach you that in the officers mess they blackballed welshers he said soberly watching her they didnt kill them and he hesitated to use a graphic word in front of her embarrassed for himself and then ashamed of his embarrassment why should he falter around in euphemisms like an old woman why should he speak of masculinity in a whisper castrate them he finished she did not seem to notice the word the firelight on her face made her skin warm anyway he could see no extra blush we are not dealing with officers and gentlemen in the devils acre papa she pointed out with some sarcasm blackballing them would hardly serve of course she was right whatever use would that threat be to a man it would get the gambler not a penny of his debt repaid the losers would simply go to another place in futureif not in the acre then in some slum back room elsewhere and the man owed would not dare broadcast the fact or he would lose face everywhere and from then on no one would pay him actually she continued turning to look at him i would have thought that this method would be most effective im amazed it has needed four men dead to have made the point it is more than amazing he spoke slowly turning it over in his mind and finding himself inexplicably cold in fact it is incredible she was not looking at him the light on her dress accented the slender curve of her body as she turned away she did not look very different from when she had been seventeen yet he felt as if she were unreachable had she always been so and only his complacency had allowed him to imagine he knew her because she was his daughter one does not hate someone so passionately over a gambling debt he went back to the subject because he had not yet exorcised it perhaps they are mad she shrugged who knows what it was really it is a most unpleasant affair papa must we discuss it an apology was on his tongue and then he changed his mind do you find you can dismiss it he asked instead i cannot apparently she had an excellent shadow of augustas cold scorn yes i can i do not find the goingson of the denizens of the slums as fascinating as you do i greatly prefer the society in which i was brought up i thought you found it tedious he was surprised how sharp his own tongue had become i have frequently heard you say so she lifted her chin a little and moved away do you suggest i should look in the devils acre for a little variety then papa her voice was brittle i dont think alan would care for that and mama would be appalled she walked over to the bell and pulled it i am afraid that like most other women i shall just have to put up with a certain tedium and a great deal of trivia in daily life but i find your moralizing insufferably pompous you have not the faintest idea what caused these murders and i cant think why you want to go on talking about them unless it is to make yourself feel superior i dont care to discuss it anymore as mama says it is unbelievably sordid the bell was answered by the footman please call my carriage stride she said coolly i am ready to return home balantyne was filled with a mixture of relief and a sense of loss as he watched her go was it the difference between men and women or one generation and another that set the gulf between their understanding it seemed these days there were fewer and fewer people he could talk to with ease and feel that they were discussing something significant not merely exchanging conventional words that one neither believed in nor cared about why had he wanted to talk about the murders with christina or with anybody there were a thousand other things to discuss all pleasant or interestingeven amusing why the devils acre because in remembering some of the things brandy had spoken of the poverty and the pain he could understand the hatred that might drive someone to kill a creature like maxeven if the savage mutilation was beyond his understanding he would have executed the man simply with a shot through the brain but perhaps after all if it were his wife or his daughter max had used in his whorehouse he might have felt the need not only to kill but to destroy the offenders manhood the means of his power and the symbol of his abuse there was a kind of justice in it he could not put it from his mind and there was no one with whom he could discuss it without arousing anger or being accused of fatuity and empty moralizing was that how his family the women he loved saw him an insensitive man pompous obsessed with a series of sordid killings in an area that he knew nothing about surely charlotte did not see him like that she had seemed so interested could it have been only kindness he remembered the letters from wellingtons soldier in spain she had affected to find them so exciting could that light in her face have been just a politeness the thought was abhorrent he stood up and walked smartly out of the room and across the hallway to the library he pulled out paper and wrote a letter to emily ashworth she was charlottes sister she would pass on the message tactfully that the soldiers letters were available if charlotte cared to read them for herself he sent it off with the footman before he had time to reconsider whether he was being foolish the following afternoon at the earliest hour acceptable for calling the parlormaid came in with a message that miss ellison was in the morning room and did the general wish to receive her he felt a rush of excitement boil up inside him sending the blood into his face that was ridiculousshe had come to see the letters it was not personal she would have come just as quickly whoever had possessed them yes he swallowed and tried to meet the parlormaids eyes quite casually by all means she has come to see some historical documents so show her into the library and then bring tea yes sir if the parlormaid found it strange there was nothing in her face to betray it he stood up and pulled his jacket a little straighter without thinking he raised his hands to his cravat it seemed tight he loosened it a fraction and made sure in front of the glass that it was properly tied charlotte was in the library she turned and smiled as the general came in he did not even notice the warm reds of her street gown or that her boots were soaked all he saw was the light in her face good afternoon general she said quickly it is most kind of you to allow me to read the letters i do hope i have not called inconveniently nonot at all he wished she would use his name but it would be grossly familiar to ask her to he must behave with dignity or he would embarrass her he kept his face cool i have no other engagements for the meantime he was going to have late tea with robert carlton but that was unimportant they were old friends and the arrangement was quite informal that is very generous of you she was still smiling please sit down he said indicating the big chair near the fire i have asked the maid to bring tea i hope that is acceptable oh yes thank you she sat down and put her feet on the fender for the first time he noticed how wet her boots were and that they were quite worn he looked away and went for the letters out of the bookcase they studied them together for half an hour the maid brought tea charlotte poured it and they returned to the utterly foreign world of spain at the beginning of the century the soldier wrote with such intense honesty that they knew his thoughts felt his emotions sensed the closeness of other men and the impact of battle endured with him endless marches over dry hills his hunger and the long hours of waiting followed by sudden fear at last charlotte sat back her eyes wide seeing far away you know with his writing that soldier has given me a portion of his life i feel very rich most people are restricted to one time and place and i have been privileged to see another so vividly it is as if i had been there but come away without the injury or the cost he looked at her face alive with pleasure and felt ridiculously rewarded the sense of being alone vanished like night when the whole earth whirls suddenly upward toward the sun he found himself smiling back at her instinctively he put out his hand and touched her for a moment the warmth of her spread right through him till his whole body felt it then reluctantly he withdrew his hand it was a moment he dared not linger over the intensity with which he wished to was warning enough what could he say that was honest he would shatter the moment if he were to descend to platitudes ordinary and born of someone elses mind im glad he said simply it mattered to me too i felt as if i knew that soldier better than i know most of the people i see and talk to and whose lives i thought i understood her eyes moved away from his and she took a deep breath he observed the smooth curve of her body her throat the fine line of her cheek merely living close to people does not mean you know them she said thoughtfully all you know is what they look like christina came to his mind one tends to believe that other people care about the same things she went on it comes as a shock to discover sometimes that they dont i cannot get the murders in the devils acre out of my thoughts and yet most of the people i know prefer not to hear anything about them the circumstances remind us of poverty and injustices that hurt she swung around to look at him her eyes level she felt a little embarrassed im sorrydo you find it unbecoming that i should mention it i find it offensive and frightening that anyone should be prepared to ignore it he said honestly would she think him as pompous as christina did she could not be more than a few years older than christina that was a realization that shot through him with sudden and startling pain his face flushed and he felt selfconscious the past hours comfort fled he was being ridiculous general balantyne she spoke very gravely her hand touching his sleeve are you being kind to me are you sure i have not offended you by raising such a subject he cleared his throat of course im sure he leaned back hard against the upright of his chair where he could not feel the warmth of her or smell the faint aroma of lavender and clean hair a sweet musk of the skin wild sensations stirred inside him and he strained after intelligent thought to drown them he heard his voice as if it came from far away i have tried to discuss the matter brandy is most concerned and alan ross as well but it distresses the women already he was becoming pompous but she did not seem to notice it is natural christina should be upset she said quietly looking down at her hands in her lap after all she knew sir bertram astley and she knows miss woolmer whom he was engaged to marry it must be much more painful to her than to you or me and it is only natural that the police will wonder if mr beau astley could have envied his brother enough to wish him harm since he stood to inherit both the title and the estates and of course miss woolmer is very fond of him alsoi gather he is most charming as his friend christina is bound to feel for him his situation must be painful because of his bereavement and most unpleasant in the suspicions that the uncharitable are bound to exercise he considered it but christina had expressed no sympathy in fact she had given him the impression that she was impatient of the whole affair but then charlotte was crediting christina with the emotions she would have felt herself and of course that wretched creature max burton used to be footman here she continued although you can hardly care about his fate it is unpleasant to think that any human being you have known should meet such an end how did you know it was the same man he asked in surprise he did not recall any mention of callander square in the newspapers or of maxs previous career and burton was not an uncommon name the color rose in her cheeks and she looked away he was sorry for embarrassing her and yet honesty between them the ability to say what was truly in the mind was of overpowering importance to him charlotte i am afraid i have been listening to gossip she said a little defensively emily and i have been engaged in a great effort to bring the conditions of certain people especially the young involved in prostitution to the attention of those who have influence apparently one cannot legislate against it but one can move public opinion until those who practice these abuses find their positions intolerable now she looked up and met his eyes challenging him to disapprove nothing he could say would alter her beliefs in the slightest he felt a surge of joy well up inside him as he realized it my dear he said candidly i should not wish to be able to a flicker of confusion showed in her eyes i beg your pardon are you not defying me to try to change your mind to disapprove of you her face relaxed into a smile and he realized with horror how much he wanted to touch her a unity of minds was not enough there were things at once too strong and too delicate to be transmitted by such limited means as speech things long dormant inside him broke open their barrier with great currents of movement destroying the balance he wanted to stretch out this afternoon into an indefinite future with no nightfall to prevent augusta from returning and bringing back normalityand loneliness charlotte was looking at him had she seen that thought in his face the light died out of her eyes and she turned away only on that subject she said quietly because i know i am right there are plenty of other things in which i might well be obliged to agree with you if you were to find me at fault i find myself at fault he did not know what she was referring to and it would be an intrusion to ask but he did not think she was saying it for effect a false modesty there was some sense of guilt that disturbed her everyone has faults my dear he said gently in those we love the virtues outweigh them and are what matter the qualities less than good we do not choose to observe we know them but they do not offend us if people were without weakness or need what could we offer them of ourselves that they could value she stood up quickly and for a moment he thought there were tears in her eyes did she know what he was thinkingwhat he was trying to sayand at the same time not to say he loved her it was there in words in his mind at last it would be unforgivable to embarrass her at all costs he must behave properly he pulled his shoulders back and sat up straighter it sounds a most excellent work that you and emily are engaged in he prayed that his voice sounded normal not too suddenly remote too pompous yes she kept her back to him and stared out the window at the garden lady cumminggould is also concerned and mr somerset carlisle the member of parliament i think we have already accomplished something she turned at last and smiled at him im so glad you approve now that you have said so i can confess i should have been hurt had you not he felt the heat burn his cheeks again with a mixture of pleasure and pain he stood then picked up the soldiers letters from the desk he could not bear for her to go and yet it was equally intolerable now that she should stay he must not betray himself the emotion he felt was so profound and so very unreliable inside him that he must excuse her and be alone please take these and read them again if you wish she understood the convention well she accepted them and thanked him i will take the greatest care of them she said quietly i feel he is a friend of both of us i do thank you for a unique afternoon good day general balantyne he took a deep breath good day charlotte he reached for the bell when the footman came he watched her go her back straight head high he stood exactly where he had been when she left trying to keep her presence with him to wrap himself in a golden cocoon before the warmth died and he was left alone again balantyne did not sleep well that night he chose to be out when augusta returned and when he came back to the house he was already late for dinner i cannot imagine why you wish to walk at this hour she remarked with a little shake of her head it is totally dark and the coldest night of the year it is quite fine he answered i imagine presently there will be a moon it was irrelevant he had walked to put off the time of meeting her and having to step out of his dream and back into the pattern of life to try to explain that would be cruel and incomprehensible to her instead he broached another unpleasant subject augusta i think it would be advisable for you to take some counsel with christina give her a little advice augusta raised her eyebrows and sat motionless her soupspoon halfway to her mouth indeed upon what subject her behavior toward alan do you consider that she is failing in her duty it is nothing so simple he shook his head but duty does not beget love she is contrary too unkind with her tongue i have seen no softness in her she is quite unlike jemima for example naturally she carried the spoon to her mouth and ate elegantly jemima was brought up as a governess one would expect to find her manner a good deal more obedient and grateful christina is a lady it was not necessary to remind him that augustas father had been an earl and his own possessed of no distinction but a military one i was thinking of her happiness he said steadily one may be a princess and yet not necessarily inspire love she would serve herself better if she were to charm alan a little more and take him for granted a good deal less he is not a man to be dazzled by appearances or to have his affections heightened by the awareness that other men find her pleasing augusta went suddenly quite white her arm frozen fingers rigid around the spoon are you ill he said in confusion augusta she blinked no no i am perfectly well i swallowed my soup a little carelessly that is all what did you mean about christina she has always been something of a flirt it is natural for a pretty woman alan can hardly take exception to that you are talking about social customs why did she seem unable to understand i am talking about love gentleness sharing things her eyes widened and there was a shred of bitter humor in them he found confusing you are being romantic brandon she said i had not expected anything soso very young of you you mean naive on the contrary it is you and christina who are naivein imagining that a relationship can survive without honest emotion and the occasional sacrifice to unreason in the name of kindness you can argue people into a business arrangement but not into affection augusta sat still for several minutes considering what he had said and what she should reply to him i think we should be interfering where it is no longer our concern she said at last christina is a married woman now her private life is alans responsibility and you would be trespassing upon his rights if you were to offer her advice especially about such personal matters he was surprised that was the last answer he had expected from her you mean you would stand by and watch her destroy her marriage because you consider it interfering to offer her advice she did not cease to be our daughter just because she became alans wife nor did our affection stop of course our affection did not stop she said impatiently but if you regard the law as well as the practices of daily life you will find that alan is responsible for her now for a woman to marry is a far bigger change in all her circumstances than you seem to appreciate what passes between them is private and we would be deeply mistaken to interfere she smiled faintly would you have appreciated it brandon had my father offered you advice upon your conduct toward me i was speaking of advising christinanot alan would you have accepted it from your own father the thought was an entirely new one to him it had never occurred to him that anyone else might have concerned himself in the more private aspects of his life it was appallingoffensive but this was a totally different matter christina was his daughter and he was seeking for augusta as her mother to counsel her so that she might amend her behavior and forestall a great deal of unhappiness for herself he opened his mouth to point out all this then saw from his wifes expression that to her it was precisely the same he smiled in dry appreciation and looked back at her i would not have minded had your mother counseled you toward affection rather than duty if she had considered it necessary indeed i have no idea whether she did or not she did not augusta said a trifle sharply and nor shall i offer advice to christina unless she asks it of me to do so would be to assume that i know what passes between them and would require an explanation from her as to things which are extremely personal i shall not place her in that position nor do i wish her to believe me inquisitive he could think of nothing more to say they were arguing in words they were not really even speaking of the same emotions he let the silence close the subject and he did not raise it again he could not speak to christina himself he did not know how to begin how to avoid her either laughing at him or becoming offended but he could speak to alan ross feeling he could not afford to wait for an opportunity to present itself balantyne went the following day to visit alan ross at a time when he believed it likely christina would be out even if by misfortune she was at home it would not be awkward to excuse himself from her presence and talk alone with ross it was not an interview he looked forward to for he had abandoned any idea of trying to be oblique since his own emotions had been stripped of their usual protections of ritual and words he found it surprisingly easier now to contemplate speaking honestly christina was not at home alan ross welcomed him and showed him into his study where he had been writing letters it was a pleasant room entirely masculine but obviously a place where someone spent a great deal of time and kept personal possessions that were both treasured and frequently used they exchanged trivialities for a few minutes normally it would have been a comfortable introduction into any of a dozen subjects of mutual interest but today balantyne was too conscious of the reasons for his visit to descend to mere companionship as soon as the footman had left the tray with sherry and glasses he turned to ross did you know bertie astley well he asked alan ross seemed to pale not very he said quietly balantyne waited unsure how to continue was there pain underneath that polite reply the memory of christina laughing flirting being entertained somehow he imagined both the astleys as fashionable and witty amusing in a way that alan ross had never been he was a graver man deeper and infinitely harder to win i never met him balantyne went on do you think he was where they found him of his own accord ross smiled slightly and his blue eyes met balantynes i should be surprised he seemed eminently normal on the occasions i saw him you mean he flirted a great deal rosss smile widened tolerantly no more than usual for a young man who feels the noose of matrimony closing round him and wishes to taste of freedom to the full while he still may miss woolmers mother has a fearsome grip balantyne remembered his own last few weeks of freedom before he had asked augustas father for her hand he had known he was going to of course but it was still sweet to play with the idea that he might not to savor in imagination all sorts of other possibilities he would never indulge he looked across and caught rosss eyes they understood each other perfectly i suppose christina is very distressed by his death it was more an observation than a question it would account for the strain he saw in her she hated mourning and would absorb the sorrow in her own way not especially though she was rather fond of him ross replied ross had turned away and his face was tight she was fond of a number of people he said quietly balantyne felt the sweat prickle on his skin fond of was that a euphemism for something much coarser more promiscuous or was it only his own rush of feeling for charlotte the strong physical desire that made his face burn at the memory that put in his mind far uglier thoughts of christina had she been drenched with that hunger but without the love he looked at rosss face still turned toward the fire as he had observed before it was a private face strongboned but with a very vulnerable mouth to intrude into his emotions would be unforgivable in that moment balantyne believed he understood what ross would never say christina was a loose woman how it had come about he would never know perhaps ross had expected too much of her a maturity a delicacy of which she was not capable perhaps he had compared her with helena doran a mistakeyou should never compare one woman with another and yet dear god how easy to do when you have loved was there not at the back of his own mind painful and bright a memory of charlottes eyes looking at him that would forever be a comparison with every other relationshipand a damning of it he must think of christina christina as a young bride would have been confused hurt not knowing in what way she had failed to please ross a man should teach a woman gently be prepared to wait while she learned such an utterly new life the physical his thoughts stopped or was it new to christina memories floated back from the time of the murders on callander square things augusta had refused to discuss she had dealt with so much been so competentand never told him was christina seeking from other men the reassurance that she was desired because the husband she loved had rejected her shut her out or was she simply a vain and immoral woman for whom one man was not enough but whatever the desire surely faithfulness what sort of faith did he keep with augusta it was the knowledge of hurting charlotte that had kept him from excess yesterday from touching her from holding herand and what anythingeverything and it was selfishness fear of the rejection he would see in charlottes eyes her horror when she understood what he really felt it was not any thought of augusta and more than that charlotte would have been irreparably hurt to know what storms she had created in him he would lose her she would certainly never come to callander square again never be alone with him to share even the sweetness of friendship would she think him ridiculous or worse pitiful he thrust the thought away there was nothing absurd in loving but what about christina had she inherited from him this betraying hunger he had never talked to her of fidelity or modesty he had left all that sort of thing to augusta it was a mothers duty to instruct her daughter in the conduct of marriage for him to have done so would have been indelicate and would have caused only embarrassment but he could have spoken of chastitysimple morality and he had never done so perhaps he owed christina a great deal and heaven knew what he owed alan ross he looked up and saw rosss eyes waiting for him could he have any idea what had been passing through his thoughts she knew adela pomeroy ross said with a slight frown as if it puzzled him the name meant nothing to balantyne adela pomeroy he repeated the wife of the last man who was murdered in the acrethe schoolteacher ross explained oh he thought for a moment how on earth did christina come to know a schoolteachers wife shes a pretty woman ross answered painfully and bored i think she sought diversion inhe moved his hand slightlyin wider company whatever did he mean by that thousands of women were probably bored now and then you could not simply extend your social circle upward unless you were remarkably pretty and willing to then was adela pomeroy another loose woman but if so why was it ernest pomeroy who was killed it should have been adela and bertie astleyhad he been adelas lover and what connection had the doctor with any of them were they all victims of the same lunatic or perhaps was one a crime fitted in and made to look like the others an opportunity taken brilliant advantage of to inherit a title and an estate or to be rid of a tedious husband orand the sweat broke out on his body at the thoughtto avenge a cuckolder of ones bed ones home what was the doctors wife like he asked huskily swallowing ross looked away ive no idea why balantynes face was stiff no reason my mind was wandering he said lamely he forced the thought away it was unworthy of such a man ross offered him the sherry but he declined it its warmth did not reach deep enough inside him he noticed that ross himself took none either how long had he known christinas nature he cannot have understood it when he married her had the knowledge come slowly a gathering pain or in a single act of discovery like a sharp wound he looked at rosss face it would be unpardonable to discuss the subject with him it was his own private grief and no matter what balantyne might guess he must be silent he could not bear ross to knoweven for an instantthe thoughts that had come to him he wanted to run away to exist in some fantasy land where he could be with charlotte talk with her see her face touch her learn to share a multitude of things no doubt alan ross would like to be in just such a place with someone clean and generous but he understood duty and so far he had found the courage to fulfill it balantyne sat quite still his mind fumbled for something to say anything that would let ross know that he was not alone that far from pity he felt the most intense admiration for him and a regard that was perhaps as close to love as one man comes for another but no words were right they had all been used too lightly none of them conveyed the reality of the pain the two men sat for a long time the untouched sherry decanter between them the logs settling in the hearth finally balantyne stood up christina would doubtless soon be arriving home and he did not wish to see her his goodbyes were trivial the same things he always said and ross gave the same replies but once as they shook hands he had the feeling for a moment that perhaps the unsaid things had been understood after allat least the good things and there would be other times other chances to show a gentleness to allow ross to perceive that he cared not blindly but because he suffered some of the same loneliness the same ties to duty that would destroy him if he let them go good afternoon sir ross said with a faint smile thank you for calling good afternoon alan pleasure to see you neither of them mentioned the women there was no message no regards balantyne turned and walked away into the sharp winter afternoon he had not brought the carriage he preferred the isolation and the exercise the wind hard on his face and it would take longer to get home charlotte did not tell pitt that she had been to see general balantyne again in fact she had not specifically told him of any of her visits although she knew he was aware of them since he had been brought back from the hospital whitefaced his clothes soaked with blood she had realized he wanted to catch the devils acre murderer so desperately that he would take clumsy risks she still went cold at the thought of how nearly the risks had cost him his life it was something she normally refused to think aboutthe chance of his being injured or even killed to dwell on it was too frightening and there was nothing she could do to alter it she knew he disapproved very strongly of her becoming involved in the case in any way even so peripherally as visiting the balantynes and to tell the truth she felt some guilt because she had enjoyed the glamour of wearing emilys dresses of swirling around in great spaces full of lights and music and brilliant colors it was wonderful to show offjust a little she very honestly liked general balantyne that was the worst and most thoughtless thing she had done she had never considered that he might really feel anything deeper for her than a return of her friendship naturally she had wanted him to admire her to think her beautiful and exciting she simply had not believed that he would but this time she had seen in his face that soft intensely personal gaze unwavering and peculiarly naked she knew it was no longer a social game to be stepped into or out of as the occasion suited of course she could not tell pitt it was out of the question when he came in that night tired and cold his side so sore he moved stiffly she brought his supper through to the parlor for him on a tray and waited in silence while he ate at last her curiosity and anxiety overcame good sense and as usual her tongue won do you know anything yet to connect all the victims she asked trying to sound casual he gave her a skeptical look and pushed the tray away thank you that was very good she waited no he said emphatically they all had their own business in the acre and so far i dont know anyone who knew them all all had business she asked trying to keep her voice level he had not told her that before max kept a brothel but what about the others pinchin performed abortions for max she interrupted eagerly not so far as i know but its possible then maybe some society woman she stopped apart from the fact that the idea was not a very good one she had betrayed herself with her interestand cut off any more information he might have given her im sorry accepted his mouth curved in a slow smile he closed his eyes and slid farther down in his chair charlotte clung to her patience with almost infinite effort she smoothed her face into a calm expression and counted up to a hundred before she spoke again what about pomeroy dont tell me he was teaching prostitutes how to keep their accounts his smile widened in spite of himself then suddenly vanished altogether no he was a pederast poor rotten inadequate bastard another hundred seconds went by oh she said at last and bertie astley owned a whole row of tenement houses sweatshops and a gin mill he added now you know it all and there is nothing whatsoever you can do she tried to imagine pomeroy what kind of man hungered for the immature bodies of children too young to want anything but safety approval and comfort they would ask nothing of him and display neither hunger nor criticism certainly god knows they would never laugh at him if he was clumsy or inadequate and what of them dreading every night when some new man would fondle their bodies and become strangely more and more excited culminating in a final desperate and violently intimate act they would neither understand nor participate in she shivered in spite of the fire hunching up as if she were threatened feeling sick leave it pitt said quietly from the chair opposite his eyes were open now and he was looking at her pomeroys dead and youll not stop pederasty i know then leave it but charlotte could not leave it as soon as pitt had gone the following morning she instructed gracie for the day then put on her warmest cloak and walked to the public omnibus stop where she took the next bus going in the direction of paragon walk well emily asked as soon as she arrived what have you learned she told emily about pitt being stabbed she had not seen her since it happened thats terrible oh my dear im so sorry is he all right do you need anything no thank you oh it was an offer too good to decline yes if you have a bottle of good port port yes it is an excellent restorative especially in this weather wouldnt you prefer brandy emily was feeling expansive and she liked pitt no thank you port will do very well but you can make it two bottles if you like has he discovered anything was it the devils acre slasher did he recognize him he thinks it was just ordinary thieves but he does know quite a lot now she recounted the reasons pinchin and pomeroy had had for being in the acre emily sat silent for several minutes perhaps that explains why adela pomeroy looked for lovers in the fast set she said at last poor woman although whatever her husband was it hardly warrants indulging in a creature like max are you quite certain adela pomeroy looked for lovers in the fast set charlotte asked then instantly regretted it she was afraid of the answer and even if she did it doesnt mean she had anything to do with max no i know that but ive taken a lot of trouble lately to be sure just who is in that circle emily you havent no i havent emily said icily which brings me to another subject investigating is one thing charlotte but your behavior with general balantyne has been completely irresponsible you criticize christina ross for flirting quite rightly but the only difference between you and her is that you have confined your attentions to one man and that does not make it better indeed for the damage you may do it makes it a great deal worse charlotte felt the heat of shame burn inside her so painfully that she could not look at emilys face she already knew how deeply she was at fault but to have emily tell her so made it the sharper it was unintentional she said defensively rubbish emily snapped back you wanted some adventure and you took it you did not foresee the result because you did not bother to look well if you are so excessively clever why didnt you tell me charlotte demanded swallowing on the lump in her throat because i didnt see it either emily admitted how was i to know youd behave like a complete fool you never used to be able to flirt to save yourself i was not flirting yes you were emily sighed and shut her eyes maybe you are just too stupid to realize your own success i grant you that but im never going to take you out anywhere again youre a disaster yes you will because you couldnt bear to be left out of it if there were another society murder and thomas got the case emily looked around at her i know i behaved badly charlotte went on it doesnt help to have you tell me id undo it if i could you cant we might as well put it to some use what else do you know ive been wondering if all the murders were committed by the same person or even worse if only one of them really mattered what do you meanmattered how can a murder not matter if only one mattered to the murderer emily said deliberately what if beau astley wanted to kill his brother for the money i believe there is quite a lot of it if he killed bertie ordinarily he would be the first suspect himself but if bertie were only one of several deaths all the others having no connection with beau at all thats ghastly yes i know and i like beau better each time i see him but murderers even lunatics are not necessarily personally objectionable and unfortunately plenty of totally worthy and sane people are charlotte had found this painfully true bertie astley owned a whole row of houses in the acre thats where the astley money comes from oh emily let out her breath in a sigh i suppose i should have thought of that i dont see where it helps very much who does thomas think it was he wont tell me emily considered in silence for a while i wonder charlotte began what im not sure she was thinking of christina if christina had also been one of maxs womenyoung hungry dissatisfied because alan ross did not give her the fierce total love she wanted the essence of him was always just out of reachhad she looked to prove herself with other men and so been drawn into one affair after another in an endless pursuit and if ross had found outand why should he not it would surely be simple enough once he suspected dont be stupid emily said impatiently of course youre sure you may not be right but you know what you mean no i dont oh charlotte emilys face softened you cant hide from itnot once youve realized of course it could be balantyne the general charlotte was appalled oh no no it couldnt why not emily said gently if christina is one of maxs women he wouldnt be able to bear the disgrace hes used to discipline and sacrifice soldiers who disgrace themselves find a gun and take the honorable way out somehow it evens the balance for themthey can be looked on with an obscure kind of respect he would do that for christina wouldnt he but christina wasnt shot why would he do that to all those other people it doesnt make any sense it was a protest in the wind and she knew it of course it does emily put out her hand and touched charlotte he fought in africa didnt he hes seen all kinds of savage rituals and atrocities perhaps it isnt so terrible to him maybe max came back to her saw her at some party or out somewhere and approached herand she became one of his women that would be reason to kill max and dismember him that way why bertie astley it was a silly question the answer was obvioushe had been her lover emily did not even bother to reply all rightthen why pinchin charlotte went on he might have done an abortion on her and perhaps she cannot have any children now and pomeroy what about him he only liked children i dont know perhaps he knew about it maybe he saw something i dont believe it i dont believe general balantyne wouldthat he could of course you dont you dont want to but my dear sometimes people one cares for very much can do horrible things heaven knows we even do them ourselvesugly stupid and painful things perhaps this just grew from a small mistake till it became charlotte took a long deep breath and shook her head she could feel the tears aching in her throat i dont believe it it could have been alan ross he had more reason and he would be more likely to find out or it could just as easily be any other womans husband we must find out more when we do it will prove it wasnt the general or alan ross who else is in that fast set lots of people ive already told you a dozen or more then we must find out who their husbands are their fathers brothers their lovers and then establish where they were on the nights of any of the murders wouldnt it be easier to have thomas do that emily asked reasonably i cant tell him we are involved hes angry enough already with the little he knows you dont have to find out where they were on each of the nightsany one of them will do oh thank you very much that makes it so much easiera mere bagatelle and what are you going to be doing in the meantime im going to see general balantyne ill prove it wasnt him or alan ross charlottebe careful charlotte gave her a withering look and what do you imagine they are going to do to me the very worst they are likely to do is lie a little they can hardly drum me out of society since i am not in it you get started on your own investigations if you are nice to george you can persuade him to do at least half of it for you good day she arrived at the balantyne house at the appropriate hour for calling partly for the convenience of being allowed in but mostly because that was when she was most likely to find the general alone lady augusta would be out making her own calls the footman opened the door and regarded her with expectation good afternoon she said firmly for heavens sake she must remember they knew her as miss ellison she had nearly announced herself as mrs pitt that was a lie that would have to be explained but it was too painful to contend with now good afternoon miss ellison the footman said civilly if he noticed her plain clothes or her wet boots scuffed at the toes he affected not to her ladyship is not at home but the general is in and miss christina he held the door wide in mute invitation charlotte accepted with alacrity hoping he attributed it to the withering wind and the harddriving snow rather than an unbecoming eagerness to visit thank you she said with what she trusted was a compensating dignity i should be grateful to speak with the general if i may she had already thought of her excuse it is with regard to the letters from the peninsular war that he lent me certainly maam if you care to come this way he closed the door against the icewhirling dusk and led her to the withdrawing room it was empty but a fire was burning hard presumably the general was in the library and perhaps christina was with him that was a contingency charlotte had not considered she would much rather not speak in christinas presence christina would be far too quick to understand and she was possessive of her father she would end the whole visit as quickly as was decent it would descend to a painful battle of wits charlotte would have to try to bore her away with whatever details of soldiering she could bring to mind the footman left her several minutes later he returned and conducted her to the library thank heaven christina had already gone perhaps finding even the thought of charlotte and her letters too tedious to bother with general balantyne was standing with his back to the fire he was tense his eyes on the doorway waiting for her the footman disappeared discreetly leaving them alone charlotte he was unsure whether to step toward her or not suddenly he was awkward his feelings so close to the surface that they were embarrassing even frightening she had prepared some scrambled comment about the letters now they were not necessary she had no excuse to prevaricate her mouth was dry her throat tight the footman said something about the letters he was trying to help her have you discovered something she avoided his eyes and looked at the fire then he realized that she was cold and wet and that he was taking all the heat he moved away quickly his face softening come warm yourself she smiled at any other time such an act would have mattered all her life she had been accustomed to having a man automatically assume the place nearest the fire thank you she walked over and felt the heat tingle pleasantly on her skin in a moment it would penetrate through her wet skirt and boots to her numbed feet there was no point in putting it off any longer i didnt come about the letters she stayed facing the flames watching them avoiding his eyes he was close behind her and at all costs she did not want to look at him i came about the murders in the devils acre there was a moments silence for an instant her anxiety had made her forget pitt balantyne had assumed because emily had introduced her as miss ellison that her marriage had failedand she had never disillusioned him now she thought of it with a flood of shame she turned he was still looking at her the bright desperate softness in his face unmistakable and wide open to every wound and yet not to tell him now would be inexcusable every time she came here she made it worse there was nothing she could do to soften the injury everythingattempts at gentleness shame pitywould either humiliate or embarrass him she began quickly before she had time to draw back i have no excuse to offer except that i care very much about finding who killed those men in the devils acre and the whole system of prostitution and so do i he said fervently then realized the agony in her face charlotte what is it he stood still but she felt as if he had come closer so intense was his concentration his awareness of her i have been lying to you she used the harshest most abrasive word it was cowardly to look away she also needed to hurt herself she met his eyes emily introduced me as miss ellison because she wished you to think of me as a private person and i allowed her to since max used to work in this house and we thought we might learn something here still she left out their suspicions of christina slowly the dawn of a new pain came over him then a scalding embarrassment he had pushed pitt the whole episode of her marriage out of his mind he had wished somethingor dreamed something now it all shattered around him i am still married to thomas pitt she whispered and i am happy his face burned hot he turned away from her for a moment wanting to hide she had used him now she felt a bitter shame and pain because she cared for him it mattered intensely to her what he thought of her if he despised her for it she would feel the mark as long as she could imagine im very ashamed she said quietly should she pretend she did not know he loved her would that save his pride by allowing him to withdraw it as if it had not existed or would it only further insult him by devaluing what was the greatest gift he had to offer she tried to read his face but all she could see was the softness in his eyes hot confusion blurred the light of the lamp on the wall reflected on the bones of his cheek she wanted to touch him to put her arms around himbut that was ridiculous he would be offended perhaps even repelled he would not understand that although she loved pitt she also felt for him something individual and profound he might even take it for pity and that would be the most dreadful of all i lied by omission she went on to break the silence i said nothing untrue it sounded like an attempt at excuse please dont explain he found words at last his voice a little husky he breathed deeply in and out i care about the murders alsoand the devils acre i imagined you had not come about the letters what did you come for but i do care about the letters now she was sounding like a child and the tears were spilling over she sniffed and reached for her handkerchief she blew her nose and looked away from him there is some very disturbing information ii thought you would wish to know immediately i already he understood that there was something else that would hurt him something further an instinctive sense of it made him move a little away from her allowing her to sit down without seeming to rebuff him it was a delicacy of emotion he had not known before what have you discovered he asked quickly max was keeping two houses she hesitated to use the word whore it was too ugly too close just now he did not seem to grasp the meaning of it indeed the confusion showed in his voice they were being formal as if the past moments intimacy had not happened it was easier for both of them she rushed on before there was time to think of emotions one was ordinary like any in the devils acre the other was for very highclass customers she smiled bitterly although her face was toward the fire carriage trade he even provided women of good birth very good indeed on occasion he was silent she tried to imagine what was in his mind incredulity horrorknowledge pain she breathed out slowly adela pomeroy was one of them still he said nothing pomeroy was a pederast i expect she stopped she was trying to excuse the woman why to excuse christina also for him he did not deserve patronage again almost overwhelmingly she wanted to hold him tightly in her arms to touch softly the unreachable woundas if anything she could do would ease it it was idiotic she would only intrude on his embarrassment and hurt preposterously overrating the affection he had felt for her which was perhaps already destroyed by her duplicityand by this much closer threat im sorry she said still facing the fire what about the others he asked she could not read his voice dr pinchin performed abortions on prostitutes not always successfully he took his payment in kind mrs pinchin was very grim and very respectable and bertie astley he persisted he was being very objective covering his feeling for her or christina or anyone by seeking to understand the facts he owned a row of houses in the acretenements sweatshops a gin mill of course beau astley might have killed him for the money they bring in a lot she looked at him do you believe that he appeared perfectly calm except that his facial muscles were tight and his left hand was clenched by his side for an instant she caught the brightness in his eyes before he looked away no she said with an effort the door burst open and christina came in her face white her eyes brilliant she was wearing an outdoor cloak and carried a large handsome reticule why miss ellison how delightful to see you again she said a little loudly i declare you are the most studious person i have ever known you will be able to deliver lectures upon the life of a soldier in the peninsular war to learned societies that is what you are discussing again is it not the prefabricated lie came to charlottes lips instantly my knowledge is very slight mrs ross but i have a relation who is most interested i wished to show him the generals letters but before doing so i came to request his permission how diligent of you to come in person christina moved over to the desk and her eyes still on charlotte opened one of the drawers a lesser woman would have resorted to the penny post especially on such a dreadful day the streets are white with snow already and it is growing heavier by the moment you will become quite frozen going home her face twisted a little she took something from the drawer and put it into her reticule closing the catch with a snap the general was too angry at the slight to charlotte to bother to inquire what she had taken i shall send miss ellison home in the carriage naturally he snapped no doubt you brought your own and will not need one of mine of course papa did you imagine i came in a public omnibus she walked to the door and opened it good day miss ellison i hope yourrelationenjoys the peninsular war as much as you appear to do and she went out closing the door behind her a moment later they heard hooves on the pavement outside and the slam of a carriage door it seems she has borrowed something of yours charlotte remarked more to break the silence than because it mattered at all balantyne went to the desk and opened the drawer she had taken the object from for a moment his face was puzzled there were lines of pain in it a new and delicate vulnerability to his mouth christina had been one of maxs women charlotte knew now that balantyne either knew it or guessed it what about alan ross balantyne stood perfectly straight his eyes wide his skin drained of blood shes taken my gun for an instant charlotte was paralyzed then she leaped to her feet we must go after her she commanded find a hansom she has only just left there will be marks in the snowwe can follow her whatever she means to do we may be in time to stop heroror if it is good then to help her he strode to the door and shouted for the footman he snatched from the mans hands charlottes coat ignoring his own he grasped her arm and pushed her to the door the next moment they were outside in the whirling snow blinded by the dusk and the dim lamps stung by the slithering snowflakes turning to ice balantyne ran across the road onto the snowcovered grass under the trees christinas carriage was still in sight on the far side of the square slowing to turn the corner there was a hansom moving from pool to pool of light along the west side cabbie balantyne shouted waving his arms cabbie charlotte scrambled through shrubs and grass soaked to her ankles trying to keep up with him her face was wet and numb with cold and though her gloves were locked in her reticule her fingers were too frozen even to fish for them all her efforts were concentrated on keeping up with him sir robert carlton was already in the cab balantyne pulled the door open emergency he shouted above the wind sorry robert i need this and relying on long friendship and a generous nature he held out his hand and almost hauled carlton out then grabbed charlotte by the waist and lifted her in he then ordered the cabbie to follow down the far street where christinas carriage had disappeared he thrust a handful of coins at the startled man and was almost thrown to the floor as the driver was transformed into a jehu at the flash of gold charlotte sat herself up in the seat where she had landed and clung to the handhold there was no time or purpose in trying to rearrange her skirts to any sense of decorum the cab was hurtling around the corner from the square and balantyne had his head out the window trying to see if christina was still ahead of them or if in the maelstrom of the storm they had lost her the horses hooves were curiously silent on the soft padding of snow the carriage lurched from side to side as the wheels slid caught again and then swerved at any other time charlotte would have been terrified but all she could think of now was christina somewhere ahead of them holding the generals gun fear sickened her excluding all thought of her own safety as her body was flung from side to side while the cab careened through the white wilderness was it alan ross she was going to kill was it he after all who had murdered first max and then the othersand at last christina knew it was she going to shoot him or offer him suicide balantyne brought his head in from the window his skin was whipped raw from the wind snow crusted his hair theyre still ahead of us god knows where shes going his face was so cold that his mouth was stiff and his words blurred she was thrown against him as the cab wheeled around another corner he caught her held her for a moment then eased her upright again i dont know where we are he went on i cant see anything but snow and gas lamps now and again i dont recognize anything shes not going home charlotte asked then instantly wished she had not said it no we seem to have turned toward the river had he also been thinking of alan ross they were lurching through a muted world with muffled hoofbeats and no hiss of wheels there sounded only the crack of the whip and the cabbies shout vision was limited to the whirl of white flakes in the islands of the lamps followed by raging freezing darkness again till the next brief moon on its iron stand they were slowed to a trot now turning more often apparently they had not lost her because the cabbie never asked for further instructions where was she going to warn adela pomeroy of what had she hired some lunatic to kill her husband answers crowded into charlottes head and none of them could be right she put off again and again the one she knew in her heart was the truth christina was going back to the devils acre to one of the whorehouses and murder beside her balantyne said nothing whatever nightmare was in his mind he struggled with it alone one more corner another snowblanketed street a crossroad and then at last they stopped the cabbies head appeared your partys gone in there he waved his arm and balantyne forced open the door and jumped out leaving charlotte to fend for herself after him over there the cabbie waved again dalton sisters whorehouse dont know what shes doin if n yer ask me if er usbands gorn in there shed best pretend she dont knownot goin achasing after im like a madwoman taint decenttaint sense neither stillnever could tell most women nothin fer their own good ere best leave the lady in the cab gawd yer cant take er in there guv but balantyne was not listening he strode across the glimmering road and up the steps of the house where christinas footsteps still showed in the virgin snow ere the cabbie tried once more miss but charlotte was after him running with her skirts trailing wet and heavy catching balantyne on the step there was no one to bar their entrance the door was on the latch and they threw it open together the scene inside was the same large hall with its red plush furnishings gay gaslights and warm pinks that pitt had seen it was too early in the evening there were no customers here yet no lush softeyed maids only victoria dalton in her brown tea gown and her sister mary in a dress of blue with a wide lace trim and in front of them stood christina with the gun in her hands youre madwomen christinas voice choked her hands shook but the barrel of the gun still pointed at victorias bosom it wasnt enough to kill max you had to mutilate himthen you killed all the others why why why did you kill the others i never wanted thati never told you to victorias face was curiously expressionless ironed out like a childs only her eyes showed emotion blazing with hate if youd been sold into prostitution when you were nine years old you wouldnt need to ask me that you whore around for funyou let animals like max use your body but if men had relieved themselves in you since you were a child on your mothers lapif youd lain in your bed and heard through the cardboard walls your sevenyearold sister scream when they thrust into her with their great naked obscene bodiesswollen panting and sweating their hands all over youyoud take joy in stabbing them too and tearing off their christinas hands tightened and the gun barrel came higher charlotte lunged forward kicking she was too far away to reach the gun but she knocked christina off her feet and the gun fell unexploded onto the floor there was a scream of rage and charlotte felt strong clawlike hands tearing at her the floor hit her hard on the thigh skirts smothered her she reached for anything to strike or to pull her hands found hair twisted into it and jerked there was a scream of pain another body landed heavily on top of her more skirts boots in her thigh kicking hard there was more shrieking and christinas voice swearing charlotte was pinned to the ground half suffocated by mountains of fabric and the weight of bodies her hair was undone streaming down her back over her face a hand grasped at it and pulled pain ripped through her head she punched back her fists closed where was the gun stop it balantynes voice thundered above the din no one took any notice christina on hands and knees on the floor was screaming at victoria dalton her face contorted with rage mary dalton swung her hand back and slapped christina as hard as she could the ring of it singing in the air christina scrambled to her feet and aimed a kick it caught mary on the shoulder and she fell over onto her back moaning victoria lunged for the gun but charlotte threw herself on top of her jerking her head back hard by the hair charlottes skirt was torn to the waist showing her underwear and a long stretch of white thigh shouting though she was unaware of it she looked frantically for the gun suddenly it went off with a deafening roar they all froze as if each one of them had been hit stop it balantyne commanded furiously stand up ill shoot the first one to disobey me very slowly they climbed to their feetscratched clothes ripped hair wild charlotte tried to tie her skirt together to hide the expanse of her thigh oh my god balantyne was holding the gun his face so pale the bones of his cheeks looked sharp his jaw white christina took a step forward stand still his voice was like a knife cut charlotte felt the tears well behind her eyes she guessed the answers now and there was nothing she could do nothing for balantyne nothing for victoria or marynothing for alan ross these women killed max burton he was talking to christina as if the others were not there yes theyre insane they she stopped gulping horrified at his face he turned to victoria dalton why now why did you wait so long victorias face was hard glittering she paid me to she said levelly crucifyingly honest first she fornicated with max herself and then she whored with other men for him then when he started to get greedy and blackmail her she got frightened she needed to be rid of him her face twisted with pitypity for rossand contempt for christina she was afraid her husband would find out poor sod she only kept one lover beau astley charlotte stared at balantyne his face was white with pain but there was no struggle in him no attempt to reject the truth and why dr pinchin he asked still holding the gun up he deserved to die victoria replied coldly he was a butcher and what did bertie astley do that you executed him victorias lip curled in scorn he owned all that street he let it out a room at a time for rich men and their whores that wanted privacy he was collecting rent his family kept up their fine drawing rooms and their safe white ladies on the profits of our filth and his brother should have been grateful he should have paid us mary began but victoria swung around and slapped her hard across the face leaving a red welt in that instant charlotte moved forward reaching for the gun her hands clasped over balantynes and swung it around to aim at victoria victoria swept her arm over a side table there was a brief gleam of light on blades and scissors came down in christinas chest blood billowing out the gun fired into the ceiling balantyne caught his daughter as she slowly sank to her knees and crumpled down into a little huddle he held her in his arms charlotte picked up a footstool and hit victoria with it as hard as she could knocking her over and leaving her stunned and motionless on the red carpet then she stood in the middle of the room the stool still in her hands mary seized with fear now that she was alone turned and bent over victoria crying like a lost child where was pitt it was all too much the pain was too persistent and too hard she was exhausted of anger of anything but pity and her body ached with bruises tears were running down her face but she was too empty to sob balantyne let christina go gently onto the floor her eyes were closed the lace front of her gown was scarlet with blood charlotte reached out and touched her hand to balantynes head feeling the texture of his hair under her fingers she stroked it for a moment once then again more softly she turned away and saw a police constable standing in the doorway and behind him the familiar beautiful scarecrow figure of pitt of coursethe shots pitt must have left policemen outside he had worked it out without herthis had been unnecessary he came in slowly pushing past the constable who was fishing in his pockets for handcuffs for mary and victoria he did not speak to balantyne there was nothing to say that would mean anything to his horror or his grief nowand christina was beyond them all gently he put his arms around charlotte and held her he touched her hands her arms pushed back her hair you look ridiculous he said in sudden fury when he knew she was not injured when he felt her bones were whole her body strong good godyou look terrible go home and dont you ever dare do this again not ever you damn well do as youre told do you hear me she nodded too overwhelmed with horror and pity and a sense of her own safety in his love to look for any words
