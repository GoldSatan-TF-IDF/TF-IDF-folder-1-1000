greg iles dead sleep in memory of silous marty kemp i stopped shooting people six months ago just after i won the pulitzer prize people were always my gift but they were wearing me down long before i won the prize still i kept shooting them in some blind quest that i didnt even know i was on its hard to admit that but the pulitzer was a different milestone for me than it is for most photographers you see my father won it twice the first time in for a series in mccomb mississippi the second in for a shot on the cambodian border he never really got that one the prizewinning film was pulled from his camera by american marines on the wrong side of the mekong river the camera was all they found twenty frames of trix made the sequence of events clear shooting his motordrive nikon f at five frames per second my dad recorded the brutal execution of a female prisoner by a khmer rouge soldier then captured the face of her executioner as the pistol was turned toward the brave but foolish man pointing the camera at him i was twelve years old and ten thousand miles away but that bullet struck me in the heart jonathan glass was a legend long before that day but fame is no comfort to a lonely child i didnt see my father nearly enough when i was young so following in his footsteps has been one way for me to get to know him i still carry his battlescarred nikon in my bag its a dinosaur by todays standards but i won my pulitzer with it hed probably joke about the sentimentality of my using his old camera but i know what hed say about my winning the prize not bad for a girl and then hed hug me god i miss that hug like the embrace of a great bear it swallowed me completely sheltered me from the world i havent felt those arms in twentyeight years but theyre as familiar as the smell of the sweet olive tree he planted outside my window when i turned eight i didnt think a tree was much of a birthday present back then but later after he was gone that hypnotic fragrance drifting through my open window at night was like his spirit watching over me its been a long time since i slept under that window for most photographers winning the pulitzer is a triumph of validation a momentous beginning the point at which your telephone starts ringing with the job offers of your dreams for me it was a stopping point id already won the capa award twice which is the one that matters to people who know in robert capa shot the immortal photo of a spanish soldier at the instant a fatal bullet struck him and his name is synonymous with bravery under fire capa befriended my father as a young man in europe shortly after capa and cartierbresson and two friends founded magnum photos three years later in capa stepped on a land mine in what was then called french indochina and set a tragic precedent that my father sean flynn errols reckless son and about thirty other american photographers would follow in one way or another during the three decades of conflict known to the american public as the vietnam war but the public doesnt know or care about the capa award its the pulitzer they know and thats what makes the winners marketable after i won new assignments poured in i declined them all i was thirtynine years old unmarried though not without offers and id passed the mental state known as burned out five years before i put that pulitzer on my shelf the reason was simple my job reduced to its essentials has been to chronicle deaths grisly passage through the world death can be natural but i see it most often as a manifestation of evil and like other professionals who see this face of death cops soldiers doctors priests war photographers age more rapidly than normal people the extra years dont always show but you feel them in the deep places in the marrow and the heart they weigh you down in ways that few outside our small fraternity can understand i say fraternity because few women do this job its not hard to guess why as dickey chappelle a woman who photographed combat from world war ii to vietnam once said this is no place for the feminine and yet it was none of this that finally made me stop you can walk through a corpselittered battlefield and come upon an orphaned infant lying atop its dead mother and not feel a fraction of what you will when you lose someone you love death has punctuated my life with almost unbearable loss and i hate it death is my mortal enemy hubris perhaps but i come by that honestly when my father turned his camera on that murderous khmer rouge soldier he must have known his life was forfeit he shot the picture anyway he didnt make it out of cambodia but his picture did and it went a long way toward changing the mind of america about that war all my life i lived by that example by my fathers unwritten code so no one was more shocked than i that when death crashed into my family yet again the encounter shattered me i limped through seven months of work had one spasm of creativity that won me the pulitzer then collapsed in an airport i was hospitalized for six days the doctors called it posttraumatic stress disorder i asked them if they expected to be paid for that diagnosis my closest friends and even my agent told me pointblank that i had to stop working for a while i agreed the problem was i didnt know how put me on a beach in tahiti and i am framing shots in my mind probing the eyes of waiters or passersby looking for the life behind life sometimes i think ive actually become a camera an instrument for recording reality that the exquisite machines i carry when i work are but extensions of my mind and eye for me there is no vacation if my eyes are open im working thankfully a solution presented itself several new york editors had been after me for years to do a book they all wanted the same one my war photographs backed into a corner by my breakdown i made a devils bargain in exchange for letting an editor at viking do an anthology of my war work i accepted a double advance one for that book and one for the book of my dreams the book of my dreams has no people in it no faces anyway not one pair of stunned or haunted eyes its working title is weather weather was what took me to hong kong this week i was there a few months ago to shoot the monsoon as it rolled over one of the most tightly packed cities in the world i shot victoria harbor from the peak and the peak from central marveling at the different ways rich and poor endured rains so heavy and unrelenting that theyve driven many a roundeye to drunkenness or worse this time hong kong was only a way station to china proper though i scheduled two days there to round out my portfolio on the city but on the second day my entire book project imploded i had no warning not one prescient moment thats the way the big things happen in your life a friend from reuters had convinced me that i had to visit the hong kong museum of art to see some chinese watercolors he said the ancient chinese painters had achieved an almost perfect purity in their images of nature i know nothing about art but i figured the paintings were worth a look if only for some perspective boarding the venerable star ferry in the late afternoon i crossed the harbor to the kowloon side and made my way on foot to the museum after twenty minutes inside perspective was the last thing on my mind the guard at the entrance was the first signpost but i misread him completely as i walked through the door his lips parted slightly and the whites of his eyes grew in an expression not unlike lust i still cause that reaction in men on occasion but i should have paid more attention in hong kong i am kwailo a foreign devil and my hair is not blond the color so prized by chinese men next was the tiny chinese matron who rented me a walkman headphones and the englishlanguage version of the museums audio tour she looked up smiling to hand me the equipment then her teeth disappeared and her face lost two shades of color i instinctively turned to see if some thug was standing behind me but there was only me all fivefeeteight of me thin and reasonably muscular but not much of a threat when i asked what was the matter she shook her head and busied herself beneath her counter i felt like someone had just walked over my grave i shook it off put on the walkman and headed for the exhibition rooms with a voice like jeremy ironss speaking sonorous yet precise english in my headphones my reuters friend was right the watercolors floored me some were almost a thousand years old and hardly faded by the passage of time the delicately brushed images somehow communicated the smallness of human beings without alienating them from their environment the backgrounds werent separated from the subjects or perhaps there was no background maybe that was the lesson as i moved among them the internal darkness that is my constant companion began to ease the way it does when i listen to certain music but the respite was brief while studying one particular painting a man poling along a river in a boat not unlike a cajun pirogue i noticed a chinese woman standing to my left assuming she was trying to view the painting i slid a step to my right she didnt move in my peripheral vision i saw that she was not a visitor but a uniformed cleaning woman with a feather dust mop and it wasnt the painting she was staring at as though frozen in space but me when i turned to face her she blinked twice then scurried into the dark recesses of the adjoining room i moved on to the next watercolor wondering why i should transfix her that way i hadnt spent much time on hair or makeup but after checking my reflection in a display case i decided that nothing about my appearance justified a stare i walked on to the next room this one containing works from the nineteenth century but before i could absorb anything about them i found myself being stared at by another blueuniformed museum guard i felt strangely sure that id been pointed out to him by the guard from the main entrance his eyes conveyed something between fascination and fear and when he realized that i was returning his gaze he retreated behind the arch fifteen years ago i took this sort of attention for granted furtive stares and strange approaches were standard fare in eastern europe and the old soviet union but this was posthandover hong kong the twentyfirst century thoroughly unsettled i hurried through the next few exhibition rooms with hardly a glance at the paintings if i got lucky with a cab i could get back to the ferry and over to happy valley for some sunset shots before my plane departed for beijing i turned down a short corridor lined with statuary hoping to find a shortcut back to the entrance what i found instead was an exhibition room filled with people hesitating before the arched entrance i wondered what had brought them there the rest of the museum was virtually deserted were the paintings in this room that much better than the rest was there a social function going on it didnt appear so the visitors stood silent and apart from one another studying the paintings with eerie intensity posted above the arch was a lucite plaque with both chinese pictographs and english letters it read nude women in repose artist unknown when i looked back into the room i realized it wasnt filled with people it was filled with men why men only id stayed a week in hong kong on my last visit and i hadnt noticed a shortage of nudity if that was what they were looking for every man in the room was chinese and every one wore a business suit i had the impression that each had been compelled to jump up from his desk at work run down to his car and race over to the museum to look at these paintings reaching down to the walkman on the waistband of my jeans i fastforwarded until i came to a description of the room before me nude women in repose announced the voice in my headset this provocative exhibit contains seven canvases by the unknown artist responsible for the group of paintings known popularly as the sleeping women series the sleeping women are a mystery in the world of modern art nineteen paintings are known to exist all oil on canvas the first coming onto the market in over the course of the nineteen paintings a progression from vague impressionism to startling realism occurs with the most recent works almost photographic in their accuracy though all the paintings were originally believed to depict sleeping women in the nude this theory is now in question the early paintings are so abstract that the question cannot be settled with certainty but it is the later canvases that have created a sensation among asian collectors who believe the paintings depict women not in sleep but in death for this reason the curator has titled the exhibit nude women in repose rather than sleeping women the four paintings that have come onto the market in the past six months have commanded record prices the last offering titled simply number nineteen sold to japanese businessman hodai takagi for one point two million pounds sterling the museum is deeply indebted to mr takagi for lending three canvases to the current exhibit as for the artist his identity remains unknown his work is available exclusively through christopher wingate llc of new york city usa i felt a surprising amount of anxiety standing on the threshold of that roomful of men silent asians posed like statues before images i could not yet see nude women sleeping possibly dead ive seen more dead women than most coroners many of them naked their clothes blasted away by artillery shells burned off by fire or torn away by soldiers ive shot hundreds of pictures of their corpses methodically creating my own images of death yet the idea of the paintings in the next room disturbed me i had created my death images to expose atrocities to try to stop senseless slaughter the artist behind the paintings in the next room i sensed had some other agenda i took a deep breath and went in my arrival caused a ripple among the men like a new species of fish swimming into a school a woman especially a roundeye woman clearly made them uncomfortable as though they were ashamed of their presence in this room i met their fugitive glances with a level gaze and walked up to the painting with the fewest men in front of it after the soothing chinese watercolors it was a shock the painting was quintessentially western a portrait of a nude woman in a bathtub a roundeye woman like me but ten years younger maybe thirty her pose one arm hanging languidly over the edge of the tub reminded me of the death of marat which i knew only from the masterpiece board game id played as a child but the view was from a higher angle so that her breasts and pubis were visible her eyes were closed and though they communicated an undeniable peace i couldnt tell whether it was the peace of sleep or of death the skin color was not quite natural more like marble giving me the chilling feeling that if i could reach into the painting and turn her over i would find her back purple with pooled blood sensing the men close behind me edging closer i moved to the next painting in it the female subject lay on a bed of brown straw spread on planks as though on a threshing floor her eyes were open and had the dull sheen i had seen in too many makeshift morgues and hastily dug graves there was no question about this one she was supposed to look dead that didnt mean she was dead but whoever had painted her knew what death looked like again i heard men behind me shuffling feet hissing silk irregular respiration were they trying to gauge my reaction to this occidental woman in the most vulnerable state a woman can be in although if she was dead she was technically invulnerable yet this gawking at her corpse by strangers seemed somehow a final insult an ultimate humiliation we cover corpses for the same reason we go behind walls to carry out our bodily functions some human states cry out for privacy and being dead is one of them respect above all is called for not for the body but for the person who recently departed it someone paid two million dollars for a painting like this one maybe even for this one a man paid that of course a woman would have bought this painting only to destroy it ninetynine out of a hundred women anyway i closed my eyes and said a prayer for the woman in the picture on the chance that she was real then i moved on the next painting hung beyond a small bench set against the wall it was smaller than the others perhaps two feet by three with the long axis vertical two men stood before it but they werent looking at the canvas they gaped like clubbed mackerel as i approached and i imagined that if i pulled down their starched white collars i would find gills no taller than i they backed quickly out of my way and cleared the space before the painting as i turned toward it a premonitory wave of heat flashed across my neck and shoulders and i felt the dry itch of the past rubbing against the present this woman was naked as well she sat in a window seat her head and one shoulder leaned against the casement her skin lighted by the violet glow of dawn or dusk her eyes were half open but they looked more like the glass eyes of a doll than those of a living woman her body was thin and muscular her hands lay in her lap and her victorianstyle hair fell upon her shoulders like a dark veil though she had been sitting faceon to me from the moment i looked at the canvas i suddenly had the terrifying sensation that she had turned to me and spoken aloud the taste of old metal filled my mouth and my heart ballooned in my chest this was not a painting but a mirror the face looking back at me from the wall was my own the body too mine my feet hips breasts my shoulders and neck but the eyes were what held me the dead eyes held me and then dropped me through the floor into a nightmare i had traveled ten thousand miles to escape a harsh burst of chinese echoed through the room but it was gibberish to me my throat spasmed shut and i could not scream or even breathe thirteen months ago on a hot summer morning my twin sister jane stepped out of her town house on st charles avenue in new orleans to run her daily threemile round of the garden district her two young children waited inside with the maid first contentedly then anxiously as their mothers usual absence stretched beyond any they remembered janes husband marc was working in blissful ignorance at his downtown law firm after ninety minutes the maid called him knowing you could walk one block out of the garden district and be in a freefire zone marc lacour immediately left work and drove the streets of their neighborhood in search of his wife he cut the garden district into oneblock grids from jackson avenue to louisiana and methodically drove them a dozen times then he walked them he left the garden district and questioned every porchsitter shadetree mechanic cankicker crack dealer and homeless person he could find on the adjoining streets no one had heard or seen anything of jane a prominent attorney marc immediately called the police and used his influence to mount a massive search the police found nothing i was in sarajevo when jane disappeared shooting a series on the aftermath of the war it took me seventytwo hours to get to new orleans by that time the fbi had entered the picture and subsumed my sisters disappearance into a much larger case designated nokids in fbispeak for new orleans kidnappings it turned out that jane was fifth in a rapidly growing group of missing women all from the new orleans area not one corpse had been found so all the women were classified as victims of what the fbi called a serial kidnapper this was the worst sort of euphemism not one relative had received a ransom note and in the eyes of every cop i spoke to i saw the grim unspoken truth every one of those women was presumed dead with no crimescene evidence witnesses or corpses to work with even the bureaus vaunted investigative support unit was stumped by the cold trail though women continued to disappear and still do neither the bureau nor the new orleans police have come close to discovering the fate of my sister or any of the others i should clarify something not once since my father vanished in cambodia have i sensed that he was truly dead gone from this world not even with the last frame of film he shot showing an executioners pistol pointed at his face miracles happen especially in war for this reason ive spent thousands of dollars over the past twenty years trying to find him piggybacking my money with that of the relatives of vietnamera mias giving what would have been my retirement money to scam artists and outright thieves all in the slender hope that one lead among the hundreds will turn out to be legitimate on some level my decision to take the advance for my book was probably a way to be paid to hunt for my father in person to tramp across asia with an eye to my camera and an ear to the ground with jane its different by the time my agency tracked me down on a cnn satellite phone in sarajevo something had already changed irrevocably within me as i crossed a street once infested with snipers a nimbus of dread welled up in my chest not the familiar dread of a bullet with my name on it but something much deeper whatever energy animates my soul simply stopped flowing as i ran and the street vanished i kept running blindly into the dark tunnel before me as though it were nine years before during the worst of it when the snipers shot anything that moved a cnn cameraman yanked me behind a wall thinking id seen the impact of a silenced bullet on the concrete i hadnt but a moment later when the street returned i felt as though a bullet had punched through me taking with it something no doctor could ever put back or put right quantum physics describes twinned particles photons of energy that even though separated by miles behave identically when confronted with a choice of paths it is now thought that some unseen connection binds them defying known physical laws acting instantaneously without reference to the speed of light or any other limit jane and i were joined in this way and from the moment that dark current of dread pulsed through my heart i felt that my twin was dead twelve hours later i got the call thirteen months after that two hours ago i walked into the museum in hong kong and saw her painted image naked in death im not sure what happened immediately after the earth did not stop turning the cesium atoms in the atomic clock at boulder did not stop vibrating but time in the subjective sense the time that is me simply ceased i became a hole in the world the next thing i remember is sitting in this firstclass seat on a cathay pacific bound for new york a pacific rim sunset flaring in my window as the four great engines thrum their vibration causing a steady ripple in the scotch on the tray before me that was two whiskeys ago and i still have another nineteen hours in the air my eyes are dry and grainy stinging i am cried out my mind gropes backward toward the museum but there is something in the way a shadow i know better than to try to force the memory i was shot once in africa and from the moment the bullet ripped through my shoulder till the moment i came to my senses in the colonial hotel and found myself being patched up by an australian reporter whose father was a doctor everything was blank the missing events a hectic jeep ride down an embattled road the bribing of a checkpoint guard in which i participated only returned to me later they had not disappeared but merely fallen out of sequence so it was at the museum but here in the familiar environment of the plane in the warm wake of my third scotch things begin to return brief flashing images at first then jerky sequences like bad streaming video im standing before the painting of a naked woman whose face is mine to the last detail and my feet are rooted to the floor with the permanence of nightmares the men crowding me from behind believe im the woman who modeled for the painting on the wall they chatter incessantly and race around like ants after kerosene has been poured on their hill they are puzzled that i am alive angry that their fantasy of sleeping women seems to be a hoax but i know things they dont i see my sister stepping out onto st charles avenue the humidity condensing on her skin even before she begins to run three miles is her goal but somewhere in the junglelike garden district she puts a foot wrong and falls into the hole my father fell into in now she stares back at me with vacant eyes from a canvas as deep as a window into hell having accepted her death in my bones having mourned and buried her in my mind this unexpected resurrection triggers a storm of emotions but somewhere in the chemical chaos of my brain in the storms dark eye my rational mind continues to work whoever painted this picture has knowledge of my sister beyond the moment she vanished from the garden district he knows what no one else could the story of janes last hours or minutes or seconds he heard her last words he he why do i assume the painter is a man because he almost certainly is i have no patience with the naomi wolfs of the world but theres no denying statistical fact it is men who commit these obscene crimes rape stranger murder and the piece de resistance serial murder its an exclusively male pathology the hunting the planning the obsessively tended rage working itself out in complex rituals of violence a man hovers like a specter behind these strange paintings and he has knowledge that i need he alone in the world can give me what has eluded me for the past year peace as i stare into my sisters painted eyes a wild hope is born in my chest jane looks dead in the picture and the audio tour announcer suggested that all the women in this series are but there must be some chance despite my premonition in sarajevo that she was merely unconscious while this work was done drugged maybe or playing possum as my mother called it when we were kids how long would it take to paint something like this a few hours a day a week a particularly loud burst of chinese snaps the spell of the picture waking me to the tears growing cold on my cheeks the hand grasping my shoulder that hand belongs to one of the bastards who came here today to ogle dead women i have a wild urge to reach up and snatch the canvas from the wall to cover my sisters nakedness from these prying eyes but if i pull down a painting worth millions of dollars i will find myself in the custody of the chinese police a disagreeable circumstance at best i run instead i run like hell and i dont stop until i reach a dark room filled with documents under glass its ancient chinese poetry handpainted on paper as fragile as moths wings the only light comes from the display cases and they fluoresce only when i come near my hands are shaking in the dark and when i hug myself i realize the rest of me is shaking too in the blackness i see my mother slowly drinking herself to death in oxford mississippi i see janes husband and children in new orleans trying their best to live without her and not doing terribly well at it i see the fbi agents i met thirteen months ago sober men with good intentions but no idea how to help i shot hundreds of crimescene photos when i was starting my career but i never quite realized how important a dead body is to a murder investigation the corpse is ground zero without one investigators face a wall as blank as unexposed film the painting back in the exhibition room is not janes corpse but it may be the closest thing anyone will ever find to it its a starting point with this realization comes another there are other paintings like janes according to the audio tour nineteen nineteen naked women posed in images of sleep or death as far as i know only eleven women have disappeared from new orleans who are the other eight or are there only eleven with some appearing in more than one painting and what in gods name are they doing in hong kong halfway around the world stop snaps a voice in my head my fathers voice forget your questions what should you do now the audio tour said the paintings are sold through a us dealer named christopher something in new york windham winwood wingate to be sure i pull the walkman off my belt and jam it into my crowded fanny pack the movement triggers a display case light and my eyes ache from the quick pupillary contraction as i slide back into the shadows the obvious comes clear if christopher wingate is based in new york thats where the answers are not in this museum in the curators office i will find only suspicious curiosity i dont need police for this especially communist chinese police i need the fbi specifically the investigative support unit but theyre ten thousand miles away what would the boy geniuses of behavioral science want from this place the paintings obviously i cant take those with me but the nextbest thing is not impossible in my fanny pack is a small inexpensive pointandshoot camera its the photojournalists equivalent of a cops throwdown gun the tool you simply cant be without the one day youre sure you wont need a camera a worldclass tragedy will explode right in front of you move orders my fathers voice while theyre still confused retracing my steps to the exhibition room is easy i simply follow the babble of conversation echoing through the empty halls the men are still milling around talking about me no doubt the sleeping woman who isnt sleeping and certainly isnt dead i feel no fear as i approach them somewhere between the document room and this place labeled nude women in repose i shoved my sister into a dark memory hole and became the woman who has covered wars on four continents my fathers daughter with my sudden reappearance the chinese draw together in excited knots a museum guard is questioning two of them trying to find out what happened i walk brazenly past him and shoot two pictures of the woman in the bathtub the flash of the little canon sets off a blast of irate chinese moving quickly through the room i shoot two more paintings before the guard gets a hand on my arm i turn to him and nod as though i understand then break away toward the painting of jane i get off one shot before he blows his whistle for help and locks onto my arm again this time with both hands sometimes you can bs your way out of situations like this this is not one of those times if im still standing here when someone in authority arrives ill never get out of the museum with my film i double the guard over with a wellplaced knee and run like hell for the second time the police whistle sounds again though this time with a faint bleat i skid to a stop on the waxed floor backpedal to a fire door and crash through to the outside leaving a wake of alarms behind me for the first time im glad for the teeming crowds of hong kong even a roundeye woman can disappear in less than a minute three hundred yards from the museum i hail a taxi and order him not to the star ferry which someone might remember me boarding but through the tunnel that crosses beneath the harbor back on the hong kong side we race to my hotel im staying at the mandarin which is too expensive for me but has great sentimental value as a child i received several letters from my father on its stationery inside my room i throw my clothes into my suitcase pack my cameras into their aluminum flight cases and take a different cab to the new airport i intend to be out of chinese airspace before some enterprising cop figures out that while they may not have my name they have a perfect likeness of my face on their museum wall they could have flyers at the airport and the hotels in less than an hour im not sure why they would ive committed no crime other than stealing a walkman but ive been arrested for less before and in the paranoid world of the hong kong chinese my behavior around multimilliondollar paintings would make me an excellent candidate for temporary detention hong kong international airport is a babel of asian languages and rushing travelers i have a reservation on an air china flight to beijing but that plane doesnt leave for three hours the departure screens show a cathay pacific flight leaving for new york in thirtyfive minutes with a twohour layover at narita in tokyo presenting my worn passport at the cathay counter i let the ticket agent gut me for full fare on a firstclass ticket the money would buy a decent used car in the states but after what happened in the museum i cant sit shouldertoshoulder with some computer salesman from raleigh for twenty hours that potential reality brings another to mind and i ask the female agent if she can seat me next to a woman on this day of all days i cannot deal with being hit on and twenty hours gives a guy a long time to strategize last year on a flight from seoul to los angeles some drunk jerk actually asked if i wanted to go to the rest room with him and join the mile high club i told him i was already a member which was true id joined nine years earlier with my fiance in the cargo hold of a dc somewhere over namibia three days later he was captured with some swapo guerrillas and beaten to death which put me in an even more exclusive club the unofficial widows now at forty im still single and still a member the cathay pacific agent smiles knowingly and obliges my request which puts me where i am now three scotches down and my shortterm memory back in gear the alcohol is serving several functions one of them being to damp the embers of grief stirring at the bottom of my soul but nineteen hours is a long time to hide from yourself i have a supply of xanax in my fanny pack for the nights when the open wound of my sisters unknown fate throbs too acutely for sleep its throbbing now and its not even full dark yet before i can secondguess myself i pop three pills with a swallow of scotch and take the airfone out of my armrest theres really only one useful thing i can do from the plane after a few swipes of my visa and some haggling with directory assistance im speaking to the operator at the fbi academy in quantico virginia who transfers me to the offices of the investigative support unit the isu has more impressive digs than it once did but daniel baxter the chief of the unit likes the bunker atmosphere of the old days the era before hollywood overexposure turned his unit into a myth that draws eager young college grads by the thousands baxter must be fifty now but hes a lean and hungry fifty with a combat soldiers eyes thats what i thought when i first saw him a guy from the ranks who found himself an officer by default the result of a battlefield promotion but no one will ever question that promotion his record of success is legendary in a war where victories are few and the defeats almost unbearable to wit my sister and her ten sisters in purgatory baxters unit scored a big zero on that one but the grim fact is when a certain kind of shit hits the fan theres no one else to call baxter says a sharp baritone voice this is jordan glass i tell him trying to hide the slur in my voice and not doing well at all do you remember me youre hard to forget ms glass i take a quick swallow of scotch a little over an hour ago i saw my sister in hong kong theres a brief silence are you drinking ms glass absolutely but i know what i saw you saw your sister in hong kong and now im in a bound for new york youre saying you saw your sister alive no im not sure i understand i give baxter as lucid a summary as i can manage of my experiences at the museum then wait for his response i expect some expression of astonishment maybe not a gomer pyle shazam but something but i should have known better did you recognize any other new orleans victims he asks no but i never studied the photos of those beyond number six youre one hundred percent sure it was your sisters face in that painting are you kidding its my face baxter my body naked to the world okay i believe you have you ever heard of these paintings no ill talk to our fine arts people in dc as soon as we get off and well start taking this christopher wingates life apart when will you be in new york nineteen hours around five pm new york time try to get some sleep on the plane im going to book you a flight here from jfk american airlines itll be an eticket just show your license or passport ill drive up to washington and meet you at the hoover building i have to be up there tomorrow anyway and thats more convenient for you than quantico in fact ill have an agent pick you up at reagan airport do you have any problem with that yes i think they should have left it washington national ms glass are you all right im great you sound upset nothing pharmacological therapy wont cure mixed with a little of scotlands finest a hysterical laugh escapes my lips i need to take the edge off its been a tough day i understand but leave a little edge in place okay i need you sharp and thinking its nice to be needed i terminate the connection and replace the airfone in the armrest you didnt need me thirteen months ago i say silently but that was then now things have changed now theyll want me around until they get a handle on the significance of the paintings then theyll cut me off again exclusion is the worst fate for a journalist and a living hell for a victims family better not to think about that right now better to sleep ive practically lived in the air for twenty years and sleeping on planes was effortless until jane disappeared now it takes a little help from my friends as the chemical fog descends over my eyes a last cogent spark flashes in my brain and i take out the phone again im in no state to hassle with directory assistance so i plug into an entirely different connection ron epstein works page six at the new york post hes a human whos who of the city like daniel baxter hes addicted to his work which means hes probably there now despite the early hour in new york when the post operator puts me through to his section he answers ron its jordan glass jordan where are you on my way to new york he responds with a giggle i thought you were off in the hinterlands taking pictures of clouds or something i was you must need something you never call just to kibitz christopher wingate ever heard of him naturellement very chic very cool hes made fifteenth street the envy of soho the old dealers kiss his ass now and the more they do the more he treats them like shit everyone wants wingate to handle their stuff but hes very picky what about the sleeping women a coo of admiration arent you in the circle not many american collectors know about them yet i want to see him wingate i mean to photograph him i just want to talk to him id say you have to stand in line but he might just be intrigued enough to talk to you can you get me his phone number if i cant no one can but it may take a while i know hes not listed he lives above his gallery but i dont think the gallerys listed either its that exclusive this guy will skip a sale just because he doesnt like the buyer are you somewhere i can call you no can i call you tomorrow im going to sleep for a while ill have it for you then thanks ron i owe you dinner at lutece let me choose the place honey and youre on i hope youre not sleeping alone no one i know needs love more than you i glance around the firstclass cabin at a rumpled platoon of businessmen no im not alone good tomorrow then the fog is descending so fast now that i can barely get the airfone back in the armrest thank god for drugs i couldnt bear to be alert right now when i wake the museum will seem like a bad dream of course it wasnt it was a door a door to a world i have no choice but to reenter am i ready for that sure i say aloud i was born ready but deep down beneath the brittle old bravado i know its a lie two hours before the cathay pacific jet landed in new york i surfaced from my druginduced dive stumbled to the rest room and back and asked the flight attendant for a hot towel then i called ron epstein and got christopher wingates number it took an hour of steady calling to get the art dealer on the phone i had worried that i might have to mention the sleeping women to get wingates attention but epsteins hunch proved correct wingate was intrigued enough by my modest celebrity to see me at his gallery after hours without explanation i couldnt tell much about him from his voice which had an affected accent i couldnt place he did mention my bookinprogress so my guess is that he hopes im looking for a dealer to sell my photographs to the fine art market meeting wingate alone is a risk but my work has always involved calculations of risk photographing wars is like commercial fishing off alaska you know going out that you might not come back but on an alaskan boat its you against the ocean and the weather in a war zone there are people trying to kill you going to see christopher wingate could be like that i have to assume hes heard about the scene at the museum by now he wont have my name but he will know that the woman who caused the disturbance in hong kong looked exactly like one of the sleeping women does he know that one of the sleeping women looks like the photographer jordan glass he knows my reputation but its unlikely that hes seen a photo of me i havent lived in new york for twelve years and my work wasnt nearly so well known then the real danger depends on how involved wingate is with the painter of the sleeping women does he know that the subjects in the paintings are real that theyre missing and probably dead if so then hes willing to turn a blind eye to murder in order to earn a fortune in commissions how dangerous does that make him i wont know until i talk to him but one thing is certain if i go on to washington now and meet the fbi theyll never let me close to him every piece of information i get will be secondhand just like it was after jane disappeared after i clear customs at jfk i roll my bags to the american airlines gate collect my eticket to washington and check my bags on that flight then i walk out of the airport and hire a cab i dont like letting my cameras go to washington without me but later tonight when i tell daniel baxter i got sick and missed my plane hell be more likely to believe me before going to lower manhattan i have the cabbie take me to a pawnshop on ninetyeighth street there for i buy a can of fortified mace to carry in my pocket id prefer a gun but i dont want to risk it the nypd takes weapons violations very seriously when the cab pulls up to wingates fifteenth street gallery in the failing light of dusk i find a simple threestory brownstone like a thousand others in the city with a bar on one side and a video rental store on the other the tony atmosphere of the chelsea art district stays in another part of chelsea i guess after paying the cabbie to wait i get out and study the doorway from the curb theres a buzzer by the front door which looks normal enough but probably hides all sorts of security devices i slip on sunglasses as i approach in case theres a videocam there is i push the buzzer and wait who are you asks the stateless voice i recognize from my earlier call jordan glass just a moment the buzzer burps the lock disengages and i pull the door open the ground floor of the gallery is halfilluminated by fluorescent light from the second floor spilling down an iron staircase with my sunglasses its hard to see but the decor seems spare for a trendy new york art gallery the floor is bleached hardwood the walls white the paintings look modern for the most part or what my idea of modern is anyway a lot of stark color arranged in asymmetrical patterns but it means little to me ive been called an artist often during attacks by purist photojournalists but that doesnt qualify me as a judge of art im not even sure i know it when i see it do you like that lucian freud asks the voice i heard on the speaker outside theres a man standing on the landing where the iron staircase turns back on itself fixed squarely in a shaft of light he looks as though he simply materialized there he is wiry and balding but he compensates for the baldness with a shadow of trimmed black stubble in his black jeans tshirt and leather jacket he looks like the midlevel mafia thugs i saw in moscow a few years back slightly underfed but fiercely predatory particularly around the eyes and mouth not really i confess with a quick look at the painting hanging nearest me should i should doesnt come into it though it would have a better chance of impressing you if you took off those sunglasses i wouldnt like it any better im not here to see this what are you here to see you if youre christopher wingate he beckons me forward with his hand then turns and starts back up the stairs i follow you always wear sunglasses in the evening he asks over his shoulder something wrong with that its just so julia roberts thatll be the one thing we have in common then wingate chuckles hes barefoot and his pale dirty heels seem to float up the steps he passes the second floor which houses sculpture and continues up to the third this is clearly where he lives it has a danish feel all spare lines and scandinavian wood and it smells of fresh coffee standing in the middle of the room is a large unsealed wooden crate with packing material spilling out of its open end theres a claw hammer lying atop the crate a scattering of nails around it wingate brushes a proprietary hand against the wood as he passes the crate which comes to his shoulder whats in the box a painting please sit down i gesture at the crate you work up here this looks like your apartment its a special painting it may be the last time i see it in person i want to enjoy it while i can would you like an espresso cappuccino i was about to have one cappuccino good he walks to a blue enameled machine on a counter behind him and starts to fill a small mug while his back is to me i move to the open crate theres a heavy gold frame inside peeking between the box and the frame i cant see much but its enough the upper torso and head of a nude woman her eyes open and fixed in a strangely peaceful stare wingate is dispensing the cup as i back away so to what do i owe this pleasure he asks the wall ive heard good things about you they say youre a very selective seller i dont sell to fools he sprays out some steamed milk with a flourish unless they know theyre fools thats different if someone comes to me and says my friend i know nothing about art but i wish to begin collecting would you advise me this person i will help another hissing jet of steamed milk but these pretentious wasp millionaires make me puke they took art criticism at yale or their wife majored in renaissance masters at vassar they know so much what do they need me for for cachet yes so fuck them my cachet is not for sale not to them anyway he turns with a grin and offers me a steaming cup i love your accent youre from south carolina not even close i reply stepping forward to take the mug but the south where the magnolia state he looks perplexed louisiana thats the sportsmans paradise im from the home of william faulkner and elvis presley georgia im definitely in new york mississippi mr wingate learn something every day right call me christopher okay okay after ron epsteins characterization of wingate i half expected the man to make some crack about mississippi being the home of the lynching call me jordan im a huge fan of your work he says with apparent sincerity you have a pitiless eye is that a compliment of course you dont shy away from horror or absurdity but theres compassion there too thats why people connect with your work i think there would be quite a demand if you were inclined to market it as fine art not much photography really qualifies but yours no doubt about it youre not living up to your advance billing i heard you were a son of a bitch he grins again and sips his cappuccino the pure blackness of his eyes is startling i am to most people but with artists i like im a shameless flatterer i want to ask him about the painting in the crate but something tells me to wait its been said that a photograph can be journalism or art but not both such crap the gifted always break the rules look at martin parrs book he turned photojournalism upside down with the last resort look at nachtweys stuff thats art no question youre every bit as good better in some ways now i know hes bullshitting me james nachtwey is the preeminent war photographer at magnum hes won the capa five times such as commercial ways a glint of mischief in the black eyes youre a star jordan am i people look at your photos stark terrible unflinching and they think a woman was standing here looking at this recording it with a womans sensitivity a woman has stood this so i must stand this it floors them and it changes their perspective thats what art does ive heard all this before and while largely true it bugs me it smacks of not bad for a girl and then theres you wingate goes on look at you hardly any makeup and still beautiful at what forty forty youre marketable if youll suffer through a few interviews and an opening i can make you a star an icon for women you said im already a star he barely skips a beat in your field sure but whats that im talking pop culture look at eve arnold you know who she is but if i walk downstairs and ask a hundred people on the street not one will know dickey chappelle wanted to be a household name that was her dream she schlepped all over the world from iwo jima to saigon but she never became what she most wanted to be a star i havent schlepped all over the world to become a star whatever that means a feral gleam in the eyes betrays a new level of interest no i believe that so why why do you traipse from pillar to post cataloguing atrocities that would shock goya you havent earned the answer to that question he claps his hands together but i already know it its your father isnt it dear old daddy jonathan glass the legend of vietnam the shooters shooter maybe you are a son of a bitch after all the smile widens i cant help it as the scorpion said to the frog its my nature some of the biggest bastards i ever met were charismatic and wingate is no exception my gaze settles on the crate between us and the way he died wingate exults shooting a pulitzerwinning roll of film thats mythic then his daughter follows in his footsteps its a legitimate phenomenon no hype required we could do a double show talk about free publicity who controls the rights to your fathers images i dont believe my father died in cambodia i say in a flat voice wingate looks as though i just told him i dont believe neil armstrong walked on the moon you dont no okay so thats even better we could and im not interested in exploiting his work for money he shakes his head his hands imploring youre looking at it all wrong what painting is so wonderful that you have to keep it this close to you i interrupt pointing at the packing crate with my free hand momentarily off balance he answers without thinking its a painting by an anonymous artist his work fascinates me you like looking at pictures of dead women wingate freezes his eyes locked onto mine are you going to answer my question he gives a philosophical shrug im not here to answer your questions but ill answer that one no one knows if the subjects are dead or not do you know the identity of the artist wingate sips his cappuccino then sets his mug on the counter behind him i slip my hand into my pocket to feel the cold reassuring metal of the mace can are you asking as a journalist he asks or as a collector all i can afford to collect is experiences and passport stamps i figured you could tell that with one look at my shoes he shrugs again shrugs are a major part of this guys vocabulary one never knows who has money these days i want to meet the artist impossible may i see the painting he purses his lips i dont see why not since you already have he walks around to the open side of the crate braces his feet against the bottom and reaches in for the frame could you give me a hand i hesitate thinking about the claw hammer but he doesnt look like he wants to bludgeon me to death having been in situations where people wanted to do just that i trust my instincts more than some people might hold the other side while i pull he says i set my cappuccino on the floor then take hold of the other side of the crate while he slides out a padded metal frame that holds the gilt frame inside it there he says you can see it now im torn between wanting to step around the crate and wanting to stay right where i am but i have to look i might recognize one of the victims who was taken before jane the instant i see the womans face i know shes a stranger to me but i could easily have known her she looks like ten thousand women in new orleans a mixture of french blood with some fraction of african resulting in a degree of natural beauty rarely seen elsewhere in america but this woman is not in her natural state her skin should be cafe au lait here its the color of bone china and her eyes are fully open and fixed of course the eyes in any painting are fixed its the talent of the artist that brings life to them but in these eyes there is no life not even a hint of it sleeping woman number twenty says wingate do you like it better than the paintings downstairs only now do i see the rest of the painting the artist has posed his subject against a wall knees drawn up to her chest as though shes sitting but she is not sitting she is merely leaning there her head lolling on her marbled shoulder while around her swirls a storm of color brightly printed curtains a blue carpet a shaft of light from an unseen window even the wall she leans on is the product of thousands of tiny strokes of different colors only the woman is presented with startling realism she could have been cut from a rembrandt and set in this whirlwind of color i dont like it but i feel i feel whoever painted it is very talented enormously genuine excitement lights wingates black eyes hes capturing something that no one else working today is even close to all the arrogant kids that come in here trying to be edgy painting with blood and making sculpture with gun parts theyre a fucking joke this is the edge youre looking over it right now is he an important artist we wont know that for fifty years what do you call this style wingate sighs thoughtfully hard to say hes not static he began with almost pure impressionism which is dead anyone can do it but the vision was there between the fifth and twelfth paintings he began to evolve something much more fascinating are you familiar with the nabis the what nabis it means prophets bonnard denis vuillard what i know about art wouldnt fill a postcard dont blame yourself thats the american educational system they simply dont teach it not unless you beg for it not even in university i didnt go to college how refreshing and why would you american institutions worship technology technology and money are you american a bemused smile what do you think i cant tell where are you from i usually lie when someone asks that question i dont want to insult your intelligence so well skip the biography hiding a dark secret a little mystery keeps me interesting collectors like to buy from interesting dealers people think im a big bad wolf they think i have mob connections criminal clients all over do you im a businessman but doing business in new york that kind of reputation doesnt hurt do you have prints of other sleeping women i can see there are no prints i guarantee that to the purchaser what about photographs you must have photos he shakes his head no photos no copies of any kind why rarity is the rarest commodity how long have you had this one wingate looks down at the canvas then at me from the corner of his eye not long how long will you have it it ships tomorrow i have a standing bid from takagi on anything by this artist one point five million pounds but i have other plans for this one he takes hold of the metal frame and motions for me to brace the crate while he pushes the painting back inside to keep him talking i help for a series of about eight paintings wingate says he could have been one of the nabis but he changed again the women became more and more real their bodies less alive their surroundings more so now he paints like one of the old masters his technique is unbelievable do you really not know if theyre alive or dead give me a break he grunts straining to apply adequate force without damaging the frame theyre models if some horny japanese wants to think theyre dead and pay millions for them thats great im not complaining do you really believe that he doesnt look at me what i believe doesnt matter what matters is what i know for sure which is nothing if wingate doesnt know the women are real hes about to find out as he straightens up and wipes his brow i turn squarely to him and take off my sunglasses what do you think now his facial muscles hardly move but hes freaked all right theres a lot more white showing in his eyes now i think maybe youre running some kind of scam on me why because i sold a picture of you youre one of them one of the sleeping women he must not have heard about what happened in hong kong could the curator there have been afraid to risk losing his exhibit no i say softly that was my sister but the face it was the same were twins identical twins he shakes his head in amazement you understand now i think you know more than i do about all this is your sister okay i cant tell if hes sincere or not i dont know but if i had to guess id say no she disappeared thirteen months ago when did you sell the painting of her maybe a year ago to a japanese industrialist sure takagi he outbid everybody there were other bidders for that particular painting sure always but im not about to give you their names look i want you to understand something i dont give a damn about the police or the law all i care about is my sister anything you know that can help me find her ill pay for i dont know anything your sisters been gone a year and you think shes still alive no i think shes dead i think all the women in these paintings are dead and so do you but i cant move on with my life until i know ive got to find out what happened to my sister i owe her that wingate looks at the crate hey i can sympathize but i cant help you okay i really dont know anything how is that possible youre the exclusive dealer for this artist sure but ive never met the guy but you know hes a man im not positive to tell you the truth ive never seen him everything goes through the mail notes left in the gallery money in train station lockers like that i dont see a woman painting these pictures do you wingate cocks one eyebrow ive met some pretty strange women in this town i could tell you some stories man you wouldnt believe what ive seen you get the paintings through the mail sometimes other times theyre left downstairs in the gallery its like spy novels what do they call that a blind drop what legitimate reason could there be for that kind of arrangement well i thought it might be the helga syndrome the what the helga syndrome you know andrew wyeth surely of course while everyone thought all he could do was rural american realism wyeth was secretly painting this woman from a neighboring farm in the nude helga wyeth kept the paintings secret and they were only revealed years later the first sleeping woman i got was simply left here it wasnt one of the early ones it was from his nabi period as soon as i saw it i recognized the talent i thought it might be by an established artist one who didnt want it known that he was experimenting in that way not until it was successful at least how do you pay him you cant leave millions in train station lockers do you wire the money to a bank account somewhere a languid expression comes over wingates features look i sympathize with you but i dont see how this part of my business is your business okay if what you say is true the police will be asking me all this soon enough maybe youd better talk to them and i better talk to my lawyer forget i asked that okay im not trying to hurt you all i care about is my sister all these women disappeared from new orleans not one has been found alive or dead now suddenly i discover these paintings in hong kong everyone assumes the women are dead but what if theyre not i have to find the man who painted these pictures he shrugs like i said well just have to wait for the police to sort it out a buzz of alarm begins in the back of my brain christopher wingate does not look like a man who would welcome the attention of police yet he is stalling me by claiming he wants to wait until they become involved its time to get out of here who knows about all this he asks suddenly who else have you told im wishing my hand was in my pocket wrapped around the mace can but hes watching me closely and the hammer is within his reach a few people such as the fbi wingate bites his bottom lip like a man weighing options then a halfsmile appears is that supposed to scare me he picks up the claw hammer and i jump back he laughs at my skittishness then grabs a handful of nails puts a few in his mouth and begins hammering the side panel back onto the crate like a man taking maximum precautions to protect his treasure every cloud has a silver lining right the nails between his lips make him answer out of one side of his mouth the fbi starts investigating these paintings in a murder case they become worldwide news like the guy in spain who murdered women and posed them like salvador dali paintings that means money lady you are a bastard arent you its not illegal is it yes im going to make a lot more money on this painting than i thought maybe double the bid whats your commission i ask stepping out of range of the hammer and sliding my hand into my pocket thats my business whats a standard commission fifty percent so this one painting could land you a million dollars youre quick at math you should work for me the crate is nearly sealed when hes finished hell tell me to leave then get on the phone and start promoting his newly appreciated asset why are you selling these paintings in asia rather than america were you trying to delay the connection to the missing women he laughs again it just happened that way a frenchman from the cayman islands bought the first five but i found out hed spent most of his life in vietnam then a japanese collector stepped in a malaysian also a chinese theres something in these images that appeals to the eastern sensibility and its not very subtle is it dead naked white women wingate turns to me long enough to wrinkle his lips thats crude and its an oversimplification where is the painting in the crate going an auction house in tokyo why go to that trouble christopher why not auction them here in new york at sothebys or wherever pure smugness now its like brian epstein with the beatles youre number one in england but at some point you have to take them to america maybe the time has come wingates arrogance finally triggers something deep within me a well of outrage i try to keep capped but which sometimes explodes despite my best efforts or interests i was lying about the fbi i say in a cold voice i havent told them about the paintings yet i wanted to talk to you first but since youre being such a prick and you havent told me anything helpful i am going to tell them do you know what will happen then this canvas youre drooling over will become evidence in a serial murder case and itll be confiscated and you wont make jackshit off it because it wont be sellable not for a very long time christopher its like assets being stuck in probate only worse wingate straightens up with the hammer and turns to face me he still has a couple of nails in his mouth id like to shove them down his throat what do you want to know he asks i want a name i want to know who paints these pictures he hefts the hammer and drops its head into the palm of his other hand with a slap if you havent told the fbi yet youre not in a very good position to make that kind of demand one phone call now he smiles a phone call requires access to a phone do you think you can get to that one he points the hammer at a cordless phone on the counter behind him i could probably mace him and get to it but thats not really the point the point is that hes willing to hurt me maybe to kill me to protect his little art monopoly which means he probably knows a lot more than hes saying about the origin of the sleeping women well he says almost playfully i back toward the iron staircase finding the spray nozzle with my finger as i go where are you going jordan he takes three quick steps toward me the hammer held waist high as he does a new scenario hits me with chilling force what if the painter isnt the killer at all what if wingate masterminded the whole thing to earn millions in commissions what if he kills the women and merely commissions the paintings from some starving artist his dark eyes flash as he moves forward and the violence in them unnerves me in one movement i whip out the mace can and blast his face from six feet the powerful stream filling his eyes nose and mouth with enough chemical irritant to set his mucous membranes on fire he screams like a child drops the hammer and starts clawing his eyes i almost want to steer him to the sink so pitiful are his cries but im not that crazy as i whirl toward the stairs my heart beating wildly a giant hand swats me back into the room and a fusillade of distant cannon hammers my eardrums when i open my eyes i see gray smoke and a screaming man wingate is shrieking so loudly that i cant think you dont hear men scream like that except in war zones when theyre lying on the ground holding their guts or genitals in a bowl some medic gave them now wingate is running around the room like a blind rat in a sinking ship he might just go out a window i scrabble to my knees and crawl toward the staircase but the smoke only gets thicker the lower floors of the gallery are on fire is there a fire escape i shout but he doesnt hear me hes still trying to claw his eyes out to my left i see a faint blue glow a streetlight that means a window i crawl quickly to it and raise my head above the sill hoping for a fire escape i find a thirtyfoot drop instead crabbing back toward the stairs i stop halfway and wait for wingate to rush by a couple of seconds later he does and i tackle him shut up i shout if you dont shut up youre going to die my eyes he wails im blind youre not blind i maced you stay here standing erect in the thickening smoke i rush to the sink and fill a coffee decanter with water then i stagger back to him and flush out his eyes he screams some more but the water seems to do him some good more he coughs no time we have to get out wheres the fire escape bed bedroom where is it bl back wall door get up he doesnt move until i yank his arm hard enough to tear a ligament then he rolls over and starts crawling beside me as we move a roar like the voice of some satanic creature bellows from the staircase the fires voice ive heard it in lots of places and the sound turns my insides to jelly theres a reason human beings will jump ten floors onto concrete to escape being burned alive that roar is part of it i go through the bedroom door first the smoke here is not as bad theres only one window as i crawl toward it wingate grabs my ankle wait he rasps the painting screw the painting i cant leave it my sprinklers arent working the pressure of his hand on my ankle is gone when i turn back i see no sign of him the fool is willing to die for money ive seen people die for worse reasons but not many i stand in the door and try to see through the smoke but its useless forget the goddamn painting i shout into the gray wall help me he calls back i cant move the crate alone leave it no reply after a few seconds i hear something whacking the crate probably the hammer then a creaking sound like tearing wood its stuck he yells then a series of racking coughs cuts through the roar of the advancing fire i need a knife i can cut the canvas loose i dont much care if wingate wants to commit suicide but it suddenly strikes me that the painting in that frame is worth more than money womens lives may depend on it dropping to my knees i take a deep breath and crawl toward the coughing my head soon bumps something soft its wingate gagging as he tries to draw oxygen from the smoke the flames have reached the top of the stairs and in their orange glow i see the painting half out of the crate but stuck against the side panel wingate only partially removed unzipping my fanny pack i take out my canon pop off three shots then zip it back up and grab wingates shoulder youre going to die if you dont move his face is gray his eyes nearly swollen shut i grab his legs and try to drag him to the bedroom but the exertion makes me dizzy and for an instant my eyes go black im near to fainting and fainting here would mean death dropping his feet i rush to the window flip the catch and shove it upward the outside air hits my face like a bucketful of cold water filling my lungs with rich oxygen and clearing my head i have a momentary fantasy of going back for wingate but survival instinct overrides that impulse below me is the iron framework of a fire escape its the classic new york model one floor down a latched ladder awaits only my weight to send it to the pavement below but when i crawl down to the platform and pull the latch the ladder stays where it is a wave of smoke billows from the window behind me i pull down on a rung with all my strength but nothing moves i lived in new york long enough to know how to work one of these things and this one isnt functioning its fifteen feet to the cracked cement of the alley below my best target a space between some garbage cans and a steam grate a distant siren echoes up the chasm but i dont think the fire department will start their rescue work in this alley ive got to get down and theres only one way to do it crawling over the railing i lower myself until im hanging by my hands from the edge of the platform im five feet eight which shortens the drop to about ten feet no great shakes for a paratrooper but i dont happen to be one i did drop from a helicopter once in north carolina photographing an army training mission it felt like fifty feet though it was supposedly twelve what the hell a broken ankle is nothing compared with wingates fate i open my hands and drop through the dark my heels strike a glancing blow on the pavement and fly out from under me leaving my right buttock and wrist to absorb the main force of the impact i yell in pain but the exhilaration of escape is a powerful anesthetic rolling to my left i get to my feet and look back up at the platform the window i crawled through moments ago is spouting fire jesus my next instinct is to look down the alley and what i see there sends a cold ripple along my flesh theres a man standing at the far end watching me i see him only in silhouette because all the light is behind him he looks big though big enough to really mess me up as i stare he moves toward me first uncertainly then with a determined gait he does not look like a fireman my hand goes to my pocket but the mace is not there i lost it upstairs all i have is a camera which is less than useless in this situation i whirl and run toward the other end of the alley toward the banshee wail of sirens careening out of the mouth of the alley i come facetoface with a spectacle i covered dozens of times early in my career the classic fire scene engines with red lights flashing and hoses spraying squad cars and ems vehicles arriving cops yelling a crowd of spectators the eternal crowd spilling out of the bar and the video store gaping drinking and shouting into cell phones most of them poured out of the bar after hearing an explosion and the smell of liquor spices the air the police are trying to herd them back behind a taped perimeter to protect them from falling brick and flying glass but theyre slow to move i walk right past the biggest cop and point my camera at the fire hey he yells get back behind this tape the post i tell him holding up my camera let me see your card i dont have it i was having a drink in the bar with some friends thats why all i have is this crappy pointandshoot give me a break man im the first one here i can scoop everybody as the cop deliberates i turn back to the mouth of the alley forty meters away but no one comes running out of it the corner wall blurs for a moment though the vertical line of brick seeming to wrinkle in the dark was that him is he trying to figure a way to get to me even now a deep crack rumbles from the bowels of wingates building and masonry cascades into the street the crowd gives its obligatory gasp come on man im missing the show the cop jerks his head toward the building and im past him in a flash moving along the perimeter of the crowd shooting as i go no one seems to notice that im shooting the crowd and not the fire every now and then i point the camera up at the burning building but i dont waste any exposures on it the expressions on the faces are all the same primitive fascination bordering on glee a couple of female faces show empathy a sense that this destruction is a tragedy but with no shrieking mothers with infants leaping from windows no teenagers trying to climb down burning bedsheets the mood is more like a party if the guy in the alley didnt set this fire the person who did is probably in this crowd arsonists love to watch their fires burn they almost have to do it but what are the odds that this blaze was set by a firebug twentyfour hours after i discover a link between the sleeping women and the new orleans victims the only human connection to the artist is burned alive the timing is too perfect this fire was set to silence christopher wingate and the man who did it could be standing within yards of me right now i may already have his face on film from the reading i did after jane was taken i learned that serial killers often return to the scenes of their crimes to revel in their success to relive their dreadful acts even to masturbate where they listened to their victims pleas killing wingate would be nothing like killing the women in the paintings it would be a utilitarian crime an act of survival but the murderer might well wait to be sure he accomplished his goal and who knows what twisted history the two men might have shared what did wingate say to me you wouldnt believe some of the things ive seen as i turn back from the burning building a furtive movement registers in my peripheral vision wide eyes dropping below the back edge of the crowd off to my right people are standing five deep at the tape now and i cant see the eyes anymore but as i watch a sock cap begins to move along the back of the crowd coming in my direction throwing up my camera arm i pop off a shot over the heads of the crowd the head disappears then reappears still closer i squeeze the shutter release again but it wont depress and then i feel the vibration of the rewind motor in my hand the crowd noise prevented my hearing it im out of film the sock cap moves forward now pushing slowly toward me through the crowd im tempted to wait for a good look at his face but what if hes carrying a gun close enough to see is close enough to shoot and i dont want to die here jordan glass noted war photographer shot dead on fifteenth street in chelsea that headline has the ironic ring of truth and im not waiting for it to be borne out by events glancing around i rush up to the fire captain whos standing by the one of the engines talking to a cop captain he gives me an annoyed look jane adams from the post i was shooting the crowd back there and i passed a guy who smelled like gasoline when i said something about it he started following me through the crowd he was wearing a sock cap the firemans eyes go wide where i turn and point back to the spot i left moments ago there for an instant i see a pale bearded face and blazing eyes beneath the sock cap it vanishes so quickly i wonder if it was there at all there did you see him the fire captain races toward the tape followed by the cop who was standing beside him what was that asks another cop who suddenly appears at my side i smelled gas on a guy over there they went to check it out no shit good work you with the times the post i just hope they get him and what do i tell them if they do yeah this is one fuckedup crime scene he could be the guy though the cop is young and italian with a fiveoclock shadow that looks more like midnight what do you mean they just found a guy in a car across the street dead as a hammer what i whirl and try to see but the crowd obscures my view how did he die somebody cut his throat you believe that wearing a suit and tie looks like he hasnt been dead an hour something strange going on here who was he no wallet like a slaughterhouse in that car the fire captain is already pushing back toward us the cop in tow see anything the italian cop calls to them the other cop shakes his head crowds too big guy could be two feet away we wouldnt know except by the smell ill make a pass says the italian tipping his cap to me as he walks toward the tape the guy could be two feet away and there isnt any gasoline smell he could kill me before i know hes there its time to go but how my cab is long gone and walking isnt an option neither is the subway as i ponder my options a yellow taxi pulls to the end of the block and disgorges a kid with two cameras hanging from his neck the official press knowing hell ask for a receipt i start running and im at full sprint before he has it in his hand taxi i yell dont let him go for some reason maybe because hes seen my camera the photographer holds the cab thanks i tell him jumping into the backseat hey are you with a paper no i thump the plastic partition jfk move it wait dont i know you go i shout at the back of the cabbies head hey arent you with a screech of rubber the cab is rolling toward the queensmidtown tunnel my flight lands at reagan national at pm and when i deplane theres a man in a suit waiting for me at the gate hes holding a white cardboard sign that says j glass but he doesnt look like a limo driver he looks like a buffedup accountant im jordan glass special agent sims he says with a frown youre late follow me he sets off down the concourse at a rapid clip and walks right past the down escalator marked baggage and ground transportation i have some bags down there i call after him my cameras they were on the earlier flight so theyre probably in storage we have your camera cases ms glass the airline lost your suitcase great agent sims leads me through a door marked airport personnel only and a blast of cold air hits my face its fall in washington too but unlike new york the humidity here adds a taste of home to the air home as in mississippi my present residence is in san francisco but no place ive ever lived has replaced the fecund subtropical garden of creeks cotton fields oak and pine forests where i grew up the concrete is slick with rain reflecting the bright lights of the terminal and the dimmer blue ones of the runway sims helps me onto a baggage truck and signals its jumpsuited driver who takes off across the airfield my aluminum camera cases are stacked in a luggage that is well behind us i thought we were going into the city i shout over the engine noise to the hoover building the chief had to get back to quantico sims yells back thats where the meeting is now how are we getting there on that as he points into the darkness i see the sleek lines of a bell helicopter on skids the baggage truck squeals to a stop agent sims loads my cases into the chopper then returns for me hes a tall man and the bell is cramped quarters for him still he doesnt look unhappy most of his fellow agents probably make the twentymile drive to quantico in a ford taurus in less than a minute we are lifting into the night sky over the capital the pentagon receding behind us as we rotor southward over the lights of alexandria roughly parallel to i in less than ten were descending over the quantico marine base arrowing down to the fbi academy helipad theres an agent waiting to handle my baggage but sims leads me straight into the maze of the academy building after a short elevator ride and a walk along a darkened hall im escorted into an empty room sterile and white like some convention hotel meeting space wait here says sims the door shuts then locks from the outside do they think im going to prowl the halls looking for something to steal if someone doesnt show in the next two minutes i might just sack out on the table the last thing i want to do is sit down my behind feels like a massive hematoma despite my exhaustion im still nervy from the fire and the knowledge that wingate is dead the investigation will be severely handicapped without him one thing is sure though its not going to be like last year nobodys shutting me out this time the doorknob clicks then the door opens and two men walk in the first is daniel baxter looking scarcely changed from thirteen months ago when i first met him hes darkhaired and compact about fiveten and corded with muscle his eyes are brown and compassionate but steady as gunsights the man behind him is taller over six feet and at least ten years older with silver hair an expensive suit and a bluff yalie look but his grayishblue eyes hooded by flesh suggest a sinister george plimpton baxter doesnt move to shake my hand and he speaks as he takes his seat ms glass this is doctor arthur lenz hes a forensic psychiatrist who consults for the bureau lenz extends his hand but i only nod in return shaking hands with men is always awkward for me so i dont do it theres no way to equalize the size difference and i dont like them to feel they have an edge the men i know well i hug the rest can make do please sit down says baxter no thanks i suppose you have an explanation for missing the plane i booked for you well before you go any further let me advise you that christopher wingate has been under bureau surveillance since you called me from the airplane i wasnt sure whether i was going to admit being at the fire now theres no way to deny it you had people outside his gallery baxter nods his face coloring with anger weve got some nice shots of you entering the building about forty minutes before it went up he opens a file labeled nokids and slides a photo across the table there i am in lowres digital splendor i knew wingate probably had information about my sister did he yes and no baxters anger boils over at last what the hell did you think you were going to accomplish in there i did accomplish something in there and its a good thing i did because he would have been dead by the time you guys decided to question him this sets them back a little and if you had people outside the gallery i push on why didnt they bust in there and try to save us we had one agent at the scene ms glass doing surveillance from his car the fire started on the first floor and it was explosive in nature an incendiary device made of gasoline and liquid soap homemade napalm i know it well from the little wars that dont make the evening news yes the sprinkler system was disabled prior to the device being detonated the fire alarm as well weve since determined that the fire escape ladders were also wired in the up position all inoperative you think youre telling me something i had to jump to save myself your guy couldnt do anything to help our guy did do something he died there a wave of heat tells me my face is red baxters eyes are merciless special agent fred coates twentyeight years old married with three kids when the bomb went off he called the fire department he got out of his car and shot pictures of the building and the first people on the scene in case the perp stuck around then he got back into his car and called the new york field office on his cell phone he was talking to his special agent in charge when somebody reached through the window and slit his throat the sac heard him coughing up blood for twenty seconds then nothing the killer stole his credentials and camera he missed one flash memory card that had fallen between the console and agent coatess seat thats where we got the shot of you we lost his pictures of the crowd jesus im sorry baxter spears me with an accusing look you think that helps anything i told you to come straight here dont try to put this on me i didnt put that guy there okay you did whoever killed him would have set that fire whether i was there or not and i do have pictures of the crowd both men lean forward their mouths open where asks dr lenz well talk about that in a minute i want to clarify something right up front this isnt going to be a oneway conversation do you realize how important every minute is baxter asks by withholding that film my sisters been missing for over a year okay i think she can wait another twenty minutes you dont have all the facts and thats exactly what i want baxter shows lenz his exasperation could someone have killed coates for his wallet and camera i ask could his murder be unrelated to the fire why leave the cell phone behind baxter counters and the car his keys were found in the ignition what are the odds that a gardenvariety arsonist would murder someone watching a fire million to one against ms glass that firebomb was planted to do exactly what it did kill wingate and destroy his records youre lucky you didnt go up with the rest it was wingate who almost killed me he could have saved himself but he tried to save the stupid painting and like a fool i tried to save him what painting asks lenz sleeping woman number twenty it was the only one of the series he had in the place and he killed himself trying to save it i wonder why lenz says softly surely it would have been insured the insurance wouldnt have been enough why not when i told wingate i was going to the fbi that the women in the pictures were almost certainly the victims from new orleans he was ecstatic he said the new canvas would probably sell for double the standing bid on it and that was one point five million pounds sterling did he mention the bidders name takagi what did the painting look like lenz asks like the ones you saw in hong kong yes and no i dont know anything about art but this one was more realistic than the ones i saw almost photographically realistic the woman appeared to be dead absolutely baxter reaches into the file removes a photograph and pushes it across the table at me its a head shot of a young darkhaired woman a candid shot probably taken by a family member its well off horizontal which makes me think it was taken by a child but thats not what sends a shiver through me thats her damn it who is she last known victim baxter replies how long ago was she taken four and a half weeks what was the interval between her and the one before her six weeks and before that fiftyfour days seven and a half weeks this decreasing time span bears out my reading as well one theory says that as serial offenders get a taste for their work their confidence grows and they try to fulfill their fantasies more and more frequently another speculates that they begin to decompensate that the neuroses driving them begin to fracture their minds pushing them toward capture or even death and the path they choose is accelerated murder so you figure hes due for another soon the two men share a look i cannot interpret then the psychiatrist gives a slight nod and baxter turns to me ms glass approximately one hour ago a young caucasian woman disappeared from the parking lot of a new orleans grocery store i close my eyes against the fearful impact of this statement jane has another sister in the black hole of her current existence you think it was him lenz answers first almost surely where was she taken from a suburb of new orleans actually metairie he actually got the pronunciation right metaree hes picked it up from a year and a half of working the case what store in metairie its called dorignacs on veterans boulevard this time he missed it dornyaks i correct him i used to shop there all the time its a familyowned store like the old schwegmann chain baxter makes a note the victim left her house a few minutes before the store closed eightfifty pm central time to get some andouille sausage she was making dip for a birthday party at her job tomorrow she worked in a dental office as a receptionist by ninefifteen her husband started to worry he tried her car phone and got no answer he knew the store was closed so he got the kids out of bed and drove down to see if his wife had a dead battery he found her empty car with the door open baxter gives a somber nod this happened to two victims before jane it sounds like him yes but it could be a couple of other things this woman could have been seeing a guy on the side she meets him at the store to talk something over maybe even for a quickie in the car suddenly she decides to split for good leaving her kids behind it happens baxters voice is freighted with experience but talking to the detective this doesnt sound like that type of situation the other alternative is conventional rape a guy on the prowl with a van and a rape kit looking for a target of opportunity he sees her going to her car alone and snatches her has anybody like that been operating in the area over the past few weeks no did any other victims shop at dorignacs jane must have gone there sometimes several shopped there occasionally the store stocks some regional foods other stores dont the jefferson parish detectives are grilling the staff right now and our new orleans field office is already taking their lives apart with help from the quantico computers its a fullcourt press but if its like the others none of that will come to anything im about to speak when shock steals my breath wait a minute by what youve told me the man who took the woman from dorignacs couldnt have killed wingate baxter nods slowly nineoneone in new york got the call about the wingate fire at seven fiftyone pm eastern time the dorignacs victim disappeared from metairie between eight fiftyfive pm and ninefifteen central time thats a maximum difference of two hours and twentyfour minutes so theres no way the same person could have done both not even with a learjet at his disposal theres one way says baxter the incendiary device used to ignite the gallery had a timer on it if it was set long enough in advance the same person could have gotten back to new orleans in time to take the woman from dorignacs but it wasnt i think aloud he wasnt how do you know because i saw him what as quickly as i can i describe the drama of the man from the alley shooting the blind photo over the crowd and sending the fireman and cop after him wheres your film asks baxter his eyes burning with excitement not here if thats what youre thinking are you positive wingates murder was related to my sisters case virtually certain says lenz so youre saying theres more than one person behind the disappearances im not saying it the evidence is two unsubs not one unsub is fbispeak for unknown subject two killers operating as a team it happens says baxter but teams usually work side by side two excons in a van snatching and torturing women that kind of thing what im postulating would be something far more sophisticated have you ever seen anything like that before people cooperating over a long distance to facilitate serial murder or kidnapping only in child pornography says baxter and thats a different thing its unprecedented in the literature says dr lenz which does nothing to rule out the possibility harvesting womens skins was unknown until ed gein was caught doing it in the fifties then tom harris used it in a book and made it part of the national consciousness in our business you proceed from a very simple given everything imaginable is possible and may well be happening as we ponder it how would it work i ask how do you see it division of labor says lenz the killers in new orleans the painter in new york but wingate was killed in new york different motive that was selfpreservation i had the same thought up there so the new orleans guy kidnaps the women how does the new york guy do the paintings he works from photographs or he flies to new orleans to paint corpses if that scenario is the answer says baxter i pray to god he flies we can take backbearings from airline computers and work out a list of potential suspects could it really be that easy it just might be its been a long eighteen months ms glass nobody knows that better than you were due for a break i nod hopefully but inside i know better if wingate was killed to silence him how do you think it happened the logic of it baxter leans back and steeples his fingers i think wingate himself told the unsub in new york about the hong kong incident wingates phone records show a call from the curator of the hong kong exhibit to his gallery within an hour of your making the disturbance in hong kong wingate knew about hong kong while i was talking to him undoubtedly though i doubt he knew it was you who caused the disturbance if he did he was a hell of an actor did he try to get information from you asks lenz not really a hot flash brings sweat to my face what if he was setting me up for the killer and got caught in his own trap quite possible says baxter if wingate somehow knew it was you in hong kong then he knew your sister was in one of the paintings maybe he knew everything about the crimes he calls the unsub and tells him youre coming to the gallery but he doesnt want any violence there he also wants to know who youve talked to before you die wingate thinks youre going to be murdered after you leave his place but the unsub has a better idea he sees his chance to take you both out thats it i murmur jesus wingate ensured his own death almost certainly says lenz and wingate could have been the key to this whole case goddamn it im not sure he knew that much you believe what he told you to a point i dont think he knew the killers name he said he wasnt even sure if it was a man or a woman what both men ask in unison he said hed never seen the artists face it was all done with blind drops or something he used that term asks baxter blind drops he said he got it from spy movies i quickly summarize wingates explanation of how he received the first painting and the subsequent drops of cash in train station lockers i suppose it could have happened that way baxter concedes but from what ive got on wingate so far he was no font of truth what do you have on him for one thing his name wasnt christopher wingate it was zjelko krnich he was born in brooklyn in to yugoslavian immigrants ethnic serbs youre kidding krnichs father abandoned his wife and kids when zjelko was seven the boy scrapped in the streets then moved on to smalltime drug dealing then pimping he hopped a freighter to europe when he was twenty and kicked around there for a few years selling grass and coke to feed himself he hung out in resort areas and his drug business put him in contact with some trendy people he fell in with a parisian woman who dealt in paintings some genuine others not he picked up the trade from her she gave him his anglo name after a couple of years they fell out over money she claimed he stole krnich suddenly reappeared in new york legally changed his name to wingate and started working at a small gallery in manhattan twenty years later hes one of the hottest dealers in the world he was hot all right about three hundred and fifty degrees when i last saw him residential fires burn at over a thousand degrees fahrenheit ms glass baxter is not up for humor tonight not even the gallows variety his eyes are flint hard his patience has come to an end i want the film you shot tonight once i give you that youre going to cut me out thats not true says lenz youre a relative of a victim which counts for zero in my experience you werent around last year doctor back then it was like pulling teeth to get substantive information out of this guy i can assure you that wont be the case this time lenz says smoothly baxter starts to speak but the psychiatrist cuts him off with a wave of his hand arthur lenz obviously pulls a lot of weight in the isu ms glass i have a proposal for you one i think will interest you im listening fate has handed us a unique opportunity your appearance in hong kong caused a disturbance not because of the connection between the paintings and the kidnappings the people in the gallery knew nothing about that they were upset because you looked exactly like a woman in one of the paintings so imagine the reaction you might cause in the killer if you came facetoface with him i may have done that tonight right lenz shakes his head im far from convinced that the man who attacked you tonight is the man who painted this remarkable series go on forensic art analysis has come a very long way in the past twenty years not only is there xray analysis spectrography infrared and all the rest there may be fingerprints preserved in the oil paint itself we may find hairs or skin flakes now that we know about the paintings i believe they will lead us in short order to a suspect or perhaps a group of them style analysis alone could produce a list of likely candidates and once we have those suspects ms glass you are the weapon i would most like to use against them lenz wasnt kidding before they do need me they cooked all this up long before i got here how would you feel about that asks the psychiatrist posing as a special agent at suspect interviews casually walking into a room while daniel and i observe suspects shed kill to do it says baxter i know that much about her lenz fires a harsh look at him ms glass ill do it what did i tell you says baxter on one condition i add shit mutters baxter here it comes what condition asks lenz im in the loop from now till the day you get the guy i want access to everything baxter rolls his eyes what do you mean by everything i want to know everything you know you have my word that i wont reveal anything you tell me but i cant be excluded like last year that almost killed me i expect baxter to argue but he just looks at the table and says done wheres your film i dropped it in a mailbox at jfk a us postal service box yes do you remember which one it was near the american airlines gates its addressed to my house in san francisco ill give you the address i bought the stamps and envelope near a newsstand it was close to the mailbox as well well get it we can develop it at the lab right here i figured you guys had mastered mail theft baxter stifles an obscene reply and takes out a cell phone one other thing i add i shot three photos of sleeping woman number twenty before i escaped the building it was in bad light but i bracketed the exposures i think theyll come out with a look of grudging admiration baxter dials a number and tells someone to find out who the postmaster general is and get him out of bed when he hangs up i say i want digital copies of those pictures emailed to the new orleans field office and a set printed for me ill pick them up in the morning youre going to new orleans asks lenz thats right its too late to get a flight tonight then i expect you guys to get me a plane i only came here at your request i need to tell my sisters husband whats happened and i want to tell him facetoface my mother too before they hear about it some other way they wont hear anything says baxter why not whats happened really you upset a few art lovers in hong kong nothing that would hit the papers what about the fire in new york your dead agent wingate was reputed to have mob ties fbi surveillance would be expected one reporter has already speculated that wingate torched the place for the insurance and killed himself in the process are you saying you intend to keep this investigation secret as far as possible but you must be trying to gather all the paintings right for forensic analysis wont that get out maybe yes maybe no look arthur is going to new orleans in the morning to speak to some art dealers there why dont you fly down with him then id be happy to fly down tonight lenz says if ms glass feels such urgency can the plane be made ready baxter considers this i suppose but ms glass please urge your brotherinlaw to be discreet and as for telling your mother perhaps you should wait a bit on that why weve had some contact with her in the past year shes not in the best shape she never was shes drinking heavily i dont think we could rely upon her discretion its her daughter mr baxter she deserves to know whats going on but what do you really have to tell her nothing encouraging dont you think it might be better to wait ill make that decision fine he says wearily but your mother and brotherinlaw are the limit of the circle i know you worked for the timespicayune in new orleans years ago im sure you have friends down there if youre going to be effective in our investigation no one can know youre in town no drinks with old friends no humaninterest story about the pulitzer prizewinning photographer back on her old beat well be glad to put you up in a hotel ill probably stay with my brotherinlaw i havent seen my sisters kids in a long time all right but you agree about the isolation until we have suspects and youve confronted them you talk to nobody who knows you and you stay out of sight agreed but i want a full update on the plane thats our deal right baxter sighs and looks at lenz as if the psychiatrist has named his own poison arthur can handle that dr lenz stands and rubs his hands together and i notice again how tall he is why dont we get some coffee and doughnuts he says theres no inflight service just a minute arthur baxter says he looks at me his eyes glacier cold ms glass i want you to listen to me nothing about this case fits known parameters our new orleans unsub is not some lowselfimage maintenance man with a gimp leg and a collection of mutilated barbie dolls were dealing with at least one highly organized personality a man who has kidnapped and probably killed twelve women without a trace you may be on his radar we dont know we do know youre about to enter his territory be very careful ms glass dont let your mind wander for a moment or you could join your sister a lot sooner than god ever intended despite the melodramatic tone baxters warning gives me pause this man does not speak lightly of danger do you think i need protection im inclined to say yes ill make a final decision on that before you land in new orleans just remember secrecy is the best protection i hear you he stands and gives me a curt nod i appreciate your willingness to help us you knew i would its personal for me baxter reaches into the nokids file and tosses out a photo of a brownhaired man in his late twenties an allamerican boy smiling like its his first job interview special agent fred coates no doubt its hard to picture him with his throat cut spitting blood into a cell phone its personal for us too says baxter he speaks softly but behind his eyes burns a volcanic fury daniel baxter has tracked and caged some of the deadliest monsters of our time until tonight the one that took my sister was merely one among others still at large but now special agent fred coates lies on a cold morgue slab somewhere fbi blood has been spilled and the situation has most definitely changed the fbi learjet hurtles into the virginia sky at three am after a long wait for mechanical checks refueling and a fresh flight crew i should have waited for morning but i couldnt i learned unflappable patience during twenty years of globetrotting and thousands of hours behind my camera but janes disappearance robbed me of that i can no longer bear waiting if im standing still i have too much time to think motion is my salvation the interior of the jet is strangely comforting to me ive done a fair amount of corporate work in my career mostly shooting glossy annual reports and corporatejet travel is one of the perks some of my purist colleagues have criticized me for this but when all is said and done they have to worry about paying their bills and i dont i grew up poor i cant afford to be a snob the interior of this lear is configured for work two seats face each other over a collapsible desktop and dr lenz has chosen these for us he seems accustomed to the cramped quarters of the cabin despite his heavy frame i imagine he once shuttled between murder scenes the way i shuttled between wars lenz looks at least sixty and his face has begun to sag with a look of permanent weariness that i recognize from certain men i know men who have seen too much and run out of emotional energy to deal with the burdens they already carry much less those of the future he looks in short like a man who has surrendered i dont judge him for it im twenty years younger and ive come near to cracking myself ms glass he says we have a little over two hours together id like to spend that time as profitably as we can i agree interviewing you particularly since youre an identical twin is almost like being able to interview your sister before the fact id like to ask you some questions some of them very personal ill answer what i think is relevant he blinks once slowly like an owl i hope youll try to answer them all by withholding information you may prevent my learning something which could advance our efforts to find the killer youve been using the word killer since i arrived you believe all the women are dead his eyes dont waver i do daniel holds out some hope but i do not does that bother you no i feel the same way i wish i didnt but i cant imagine where they could possibly be eleven women maybe twelve now all held prisoner somewhere for up to eighteen months without one escaping i cant see it and the women in the later paintings look dead to me and you have seen much death yes i do have one question though are you aware of the phone call i received eight months ago the one in the middle of the night that you thought might be from your sister yes the bureau traced it to a train station in thailand lenz grants me a smile of condolence im familiar with the incident its my opinion that the guess you made the following morning was correct that it was someone youd met during your efforts to locate your father someone from an mia family i just thought maybe me finding the paintings in asia were certainly looking into it rest assured but id like to move on now if we could what do you want to know i understand you werent that close to your sister as an adult so id like you to tell me how you grew up what shaped janes personality and yours its times like now i wish i smoked okay you know who my father was right jonathan glass the renowned war photographer yes and there was only one war in mississippi the one for civil rights he won his first pulitzer for that then he went off to the other wars which meant he was almost never home how did the family react to that i handled it better than my sister or mother did i understood why he went even as a child why would you hang around the mississippi backwoods if you could be roaming the world going the places in his pictures you wanted to travel to war zones as a child dad shot all kinds of pictures in those places i didnt see any of his war stuff until i was old enough to go down to the public library and read look and life for myself mom wouldnt keep those shots in the house why did your mother marry a man who would never be home she didnt knowthat when she married him he was just a big handsome scotsenglish guy who looked like he could handle anything that came along and he could pretty much he could survive in the jungle with nothing but a pocketknife what he couldnt survive was married life in mississippi a ninetofive job that was hell for him he tried to do right by her to keep her with him as his career took off he even moved her to new york she lasted until she got pregnant during her eighth month he went on assignment to kenya she went down to grand central station with six dollars in her purse and rode a train all the way to memphis then the bus from memphis to oxford mississippi if she hadnt been pregnant when she left dad probably never would have come back home but he did not that often but when he did it was paradise for me there were some glorious summers what about jane not so much for her we were twins but emotionally we were different from early on some of it was just bad luck how so jane was mauled by a dog when she was four it really tore up her arm i close my eyes against that memory a vicious attack i watched from forty yards away by the time my mother reached her the damage had been done she had to go through rabies shots the whole thing it made her fearful for the rest of her life did your mother dress the two of you identically all that she tried my father always resisted it when he was home so i did too he wanted us to be individuals thats the photojournalist ethos in a nutshell rugged individualism he taught me that and a lot more photography not so much that he taught me to hunt and to fish a little about the stars trees wild plants you could eat he told me stories about all the faroff places hed visited strange customs things youd never read in national geographic did he teach jane those things he tried but she wasnt open to much she was like my mother that way i think his stories reminded them that he was only home for a little while that one day theyd wake up and hed be gone you were his favorite yes and jane was moms but somehow that didnt count for as much because dad was the dominant personality even when he wasnt home he was a doer my mother just tried to cope and didnt succeed very well at that jane resented his absences more as time passed yes i think she got to hate him before he disappeared because of how sad mom was and because money was so tight your father didnt earn much money i dont really know some of the leading photojournalists of the vietnam era worked for almost nothing whether my father did or not he never sent much money back to us he was big on bringing presents though im not saying he was a great guy okay im just saying he and i had a bond did your mother work for a while waitressing a laundry menial stuff after she started drinking not even that why did your father marry her i honestly think he did it because it was the only way she would have sex with him lenz smiles wistfully that was common in my generation your mother was beautiful yes that was the irony that crippled the marriage she looked exotic but she wasnt that was her alsatian blood i guess the exotic part outside a mysterious princess inside plain as pabulum all she wanted was a man to build her a house and come home from work every day at fivethirty and jane wanted the same thing absolutely from her father and her husband when she found one dad never gave it to her but she found a husband who did lenz holds up his forefinger a few moments ago you used the word disappeared about your father isnt it generally accepted that he died in vietnam yes cambodia actually but ive never accepted that i never felt that he was dead and over the years thereve been occasional sightings of him in asia by former colleagues ive spent a lot of money through the years trying to find him what sort of scenario do you envision if your father survived that might mean that he chose not to return to america that he chose to abandon you your sister and your mother probably so do you think he was capable of that i pull back my hair digging my fingernails into my scalp as i go i dont know i always suspected that he had a woman there in vietnam maybe another whole family lots of servicemen did why should photographers be any different lenzs bluegray eyes flicker with cold light could you forgive him that the central question of my life ive spent a lot of time in distant countries photographing wars just as he did i know how lonely it can be youre cut off from the world sometimes from any friendly contact you might be the only person for a hundred miles who understands english living in a hell no one else will ever really see its a loneliness thats almost despair but vietnam wasnt like that it was bursting with americans dad worked a lot of other places if i find out hes alive or that he did survive for a while ill deal with it then you said you never felt your father was dead what about jane do you feel shes dead i felt it twelve hours before i got the call so you two shared the sort of intuitive bond that many twins speak of despite our differences we had that its a very real thing in my opinion i dont dispute it youre being very forthcoming with me jordan and i appreciate that i think we could save a lot of time if you would just describe what you consider the seminal events in your lives as siblings i dont recall any particularly seminal events lenzs eyes appear soft but there is a hardness beneath them a cruelty even and it shows now perhaps thats a requirement for his type of work this is not psychotherapy jordan we dont have weeks to labor through your defense mechanisms im sure if you think about it certain events will come to mind i say nothing for example i noticed in your file that you never graduated high school jane graduated with honors participated in all sorts of extracurricular activities cheerleading debate et cetera you did none of that you guys really dig dont you i also discovered that you had the highest act score in your school so he folds his arms and raises his eyebrows why would such a student drop out the small jet suddenly seems smaller look i dont see how questions about my high school life are going to help you understand jane what happens to one child happens to the other think back the two of you are twelve years old your father has died your mother cant cope theres no money to buy necessities youre twins you have the same teachers yet you turn out opposites whats the story you just summed it up doctor lets move on to something that might actually help you find janes killer thats the goal here right lenz only watches me youre a photographer you use filters to produce certain visual effects yes to modify light before it reaches the film yes human beings use similar filters emotional filters theyre put in place by our parents our siblings our friends and enemies will you concede that i guess daniel and i intend to use you for a critical purpose in this case but before we bring you into contact with any suspects i must understand you i need to be able to correct for your particular filter i look at the porthole window to my left theres not enough moonlight to show clouds we could be at five thousand feet or thirtyfive thousand thats how i feel in relation to my past and future unanchored floating between the unknown and the knowntoowell lenz wants my secrets why psychiatrists like photographers are essentially voyeurs but some things are between me and my conscience no one else not even god if i can help it still i feel some obligation to cooperate lenz is the professional in this sphere not me and he is trusting me not to screw up his investigation i suppose i have to trust him a little the years after my father disappeared were difficult the truth is jane had been living as though he were dead for several years before that her strategy was assimilation conformity she studied hard became cheerleader then head cheerleader and kept the same boyfriend for three years i give her a lot of credit being popular isnt easy without money money seems to be a recurring theme with jane not only with her before dad was gone i didnt realize how poor we were but by thirteen you start to notice material things are part of high school snobbery clothes and shoes what kind of car you have your house mom wrecked our car and after that we didnt have one she drank more and more and it seemed like the power company cut our electricity every other month it was embarrassing one day prowling through the attic i discovered three footlockers filled with old camera equipment mom told me that when she got pregnant with us she persuaded dad to open a portrait studio to try to make their lives more stable i dont know why he went along with her it never came to anything of course but he kept the equipment a mamiya largeformat camera floodlights a background sheet darkroom equipment the works mom wanted to sell it all but i threw a fit and she let me keep it over the next few months i taught myself to use the stuff a year later i was running a portrait studio out of our house and shooting snaps for the oxford eagle in whatever spare time i had our lives improved i was paying the light bill and buying the groceries and because of that i could pretty much do what i wanted lenz nods encouragement and what did you want my own life oxfords a college town and i rode all over it on my tenspeed bicycle watching people shooting pictures sony introduced the walkman in my junior year of high school and from the moment i got one i lived with a soundtrack pouring into my ears and a camera around my neck while jane and her friends were dancing to the bee gees i listened to homemade tapes of my fathers records joni mitchell motown neil young the beatles and the stones it sounds like an idyllic childhood lenz says with a knowing smile is that what it was not exactly while other girls my age were riding out to sardis reservoir to fumble around in backseats with guys from the football team i was doing something a little different a deep stillness settles over lenzs body like a priest he has heard so many confessions that nothing could surprise him yet he waits with a receptivity that seems to pull the words from my mouth the first week of my senior year our history teacher died he was about seventy to fill his shoes the school board hired a young alumnus named david gresham who was teaching night classes at ole miss gresham had been drafted in and served one tour in vietnam he came back to oxford wounded but his wounds werent visible so the school board didnt notice them after a few days in his class i did sometimes he would stop speaking in midsentence and it was clear that his mind was ten thousand miles away his brain had skipped off track jumped from our reality to one my classmates couldnt even guess at but i could i watched mr gresham very closely because hed been to the place where my father vanished one day after school i stayed to ask him what he knew about cambodia he knew a lot none of it good except the beauty of phnom penh and angkor wat when he asked why i was interested i told him about my father i hadnt meant to but when i looked into his eyes my pain and grief poured out like a river through a broken dam a month later we became lovers how old was he asks lenz twentysix i was seventeen and a half a virgin we both knew it was dangerous but there was never any question of him seducing an innocent child yes there was a void in my life because of my fathers death yes he was a sympathetic older man but i knew exactly what i was doing he taught me a lot about the world i discovered a lot about myself about my body and what it could do for me and for someone else and i gave some peace to a boy who had been broken in some fundamental way that could never be corrected only made less painful its amazing that you found each other lenz says without a trace of judgment in his eyes this did not end well of course we managed to keep our relationship secret for most of the year during that time he opened up about vietnam and through his eyes i experienced things my father must have seen as well seen but kept out of his letters even out of his photographs in april one of davids neighbors saw us kissing at the creek behind his house with my flannel shirt open to the waist no less and took it on himself to report it to the school board the board called a special meeting and during something called executive session gave david the option of resigning and leaving town before they opened an investigation that would destroy both our futures to protect him i denied everything but it didnt help i offered to leave town with him but he told me that wouldnt be fair to me ultimately we were incompatible he said when i asked why he said because you have something i dont what i asked a future lenz finishes right two nights later he went down to the creek and managed to drown himself the coroner called it an accident but david had enough scotch in him to sedate a bull im sorry my eyes seek out the porthole again a round well of night i like to think he was unconscious when he went under the water he probably thought his death would end the scandal but it only got worse jane had a breakdown brought on by social embarrassment my mother just drank more there was talk of putting us in foster homes i went back to school with my head high but it didnt last my star student award was revoked then my appointment book went blank no one wanted me shooting their family portraits id done a lot of the senior pictures but people didnt even pick them up they had them reshot elsewhere when i refused to abase myself in contrition various mothers told the school board that they didnt want their daughters exposed to a teenage jezebel they really called me that before long the ostracism bled over onto jane she was cut dead a hundred times on the street by parents who thought she was me at that point i did what david should have done i had three thousand dollars in the bank i took two thousand packed my clothes and cameras rode the bus to new orleans got a judge to emancipate me and scratched up a job developing prints for the staff photographers at the timespicayune a year later i was a staff photographer myself did you continue to support your family financially yes but things between jane and me only got worse why she was obsessed with being a chio she thought excuse me a what a chiomega its a sorority the apogee of southern womanhood at ole miss blueeyed blondes raised with silver spoons in their mouths like that song summertime your daddys rich and your mamas goodlookin ah several of her cheerleaders friends were going to pledge chio their sisters were already in or their mothers like that legacies says lenz whatever jane really thought she had a chance she thought i was the only obstacle to her getting it she claimed active chios had seen me around oxford on my bike looking ratty and saying whatever i felt like and thought i was her that probably did happen but the truth was she never had a chance those bitches wouldnt have given her that they got their selfesteem from excluding girls like jane who wanted it terribly but had some flaw and jane had several she had no money therefore no highend clothes car or any of the other trappings her father had been a celebrity but not the right kind and then there was me jane was prettier than all of them too you hear beauty is its own aristocracy but thats not always true a lot of attractive women fear beauty interesting isnt it lenzs eyes play over my body in a strange way not lustfully but in a coldly appraising manner jane broke down after the scandal over you and the teacher she wouldnt leave the house but when they started talking about making us wards of the state she went back to school she graduated salutatorian but she never got to be a chio she pledged delta gamma which was considered decent but definitely second tier youve asserted how beautiful jane was youre her identical twin how do you feel about your own looks i know im attractive but jane cultivated her looks in a way i never have toward the ideals of southern beauty you know thats a weird thing that extends from your appearance right into your personality for me looks are secondary ive used them to gain advantage in my work id be a fool not to but it makes me uncomfortable beauty is an accident of genetics for which i deserve no credit thats disingenuous to say the least this makes me laugh youre a man okay you dont know how many times ive listened to my mother whine about how much potential i have that if id just do something with it fix myself up a little like jane is the subtext id find a wonderful provider whod marry me and take care of me for the rest of my life well wake up mom i dont need a goddamn provider okay i am one for whom do you provide jordan myself i see lenz looks at his watch then taps his knees jane married a wealthy attorney thats right jump to her disappearance you didnt handle it well the file says you interfered with the investigation i dont take exclusion well okay im a journalist this was my sister and the fbi was getting exactly nowhere with the case i badgered them for the victims families walked the streets worked my old contacts at the timespicayune but none of it did any good so what did you finally do took off and tried to bury myself in work literally i went to sierra leone i took crazy risks had some close calls word got back to my agency they begged me to slow down so i did i slowed down so much that i couldnt get out of bed i was sleeping around the clock when i finally came out of that i couldnt sleep at all i had to have prescription drugs just to close my eyes without seeing jane being raped tied hand and foot in some dark room was rape a particular fear of hers its a particular fear for every woman what about you you must have placed yourself in some very dangerous situations visavis rape war zones full of men teenagers with guns i can take care of myself janes a lot softer lenz nods slowly if we found jane tomorrow alive what would you say to her in other words what have you most regretted not saying to her thats none of your business ive explained why some things are too personal doctor lets leave it at that lenz rubs his face with his hands then inclines his head to me some years ago i worked a very difficult murder case i lost my wife during that investigation she was murdered violently viciously and i felt responsible perhaps i was we had grown apart in our marriage but that hardly lessened the agony weve all done terrible things to the people we love jordan its our nature as humans if theres something like that between you and your sister it would help me to know to see her as she really was the pain in lenzs eyes looks genuine but hes an old hand at this game he could have a stock of stories like this one barter beads he uses to elicit intimacies theres nothing like that he takes a frustrated breath through his nose and im reminded of a surgeon working to remove a bullet his gloved thumb and finger in forceps trying first one angle and then another probing for a route to the heart of the wound certain types of people become targets for predators lenz says the same way that injured or weak animals are chosen as prey by leopards certain types of children tend to be molested for example the shy ones those who dont fit in who play at the edge of the group who separate themselves for various reasons the same holds true for adults im currently profiling every known victim in this case some had very low selfimage but others were superachievers some had siblings others none some were housewives others career women i must find ive told you all i know doctor you havent begun to tell me what you know he shifts in his seat and the cruelty reappears in his eyes why have you never married jordan i was engaged he was killed end of story killed how he was an itn reporter he was shot down in a helicopter over namibia and tortured to death youve lost your father your fiance and your sister to violent death bad things come in threes right youre forty years old there must be more to your romantic life than one engagement ive had lovers does that make you happy did jane have lovers one boyfriend through high school like i said she never had sex with him how do you know i just know okay after him she dated around but nothing serious then in college she met a guy from a wealthy family in new orleans married him his senior year of law school she found the handsomest most reliable provider she could married him had two kids and lived happily ever after for some reason this inaccurate summary brings a wave of tears to my eyes i need a drink do you think they have any of those little airplane bottles stowed on this plane no jordan i want you to get off it okay you wanted our story youve got it were poster girls for nurture in the natureversusnurture debate were identical right down to our mitochondria but emotionally were opposites jane acted like she despised me but she was so jealous of me it made her sick she was jealous of my name she thought jordan was exotic while hers was literally plain jane i called her that when i was angry she hated having to depend on me for money for her cheerleading outfits and expenses she wanted izod shirts and bass weejuns and i made her wear jc fucking penney thats how petty it was okay but to girls in our situation that was a big deal was she weak or frail in some way yes but weaker people cant help being weak you know i tried to protect her until she stopped wanting me to and even then i tried jane became a southern belle because it was the only choice she was capable of making she had to feel safe were all defined by the choices we make to survive lenz says in a fatherly voice the walter mittys and the monsters his paternalistic bit finally snaps my patience is that supposed to be profound doctor you may have lost your wife to a killer but i suspect that most of the trauma youve encountered was vicarious told to you by patients or prisoners it can be tough to hear things i know ive heard some bad things myself but i have also endured some bad things i have descended into the pit of hell if you want to know i have seen some shit and all this talk were doing means nothing jane is alive or shes dead either way i have to know thats the way im built but your games arent taking us any closer to an answer i dont think anything connects all these victims except the fact that theyre women jordan dont you want to what i want is what baxter promised me a complete breakdown of the fbis investigation so far i want it clear and concise and i want it now lenz splays his agespotted hands on the desktop and leans back did that outburst make you feel better start talking damn it theres not much to tell were now gathering every known painting that belongs to the sleeping women series where the national gallery in washington how many do you have so far none four will arrive by plane tomorrow several more the next day some collectors have refused to ship their paintings but agreed to allow bureau forensic teams and art consultants to travel to their collections first well try to match the paintings to the known victims in new orleans in some cases it should be easy harder with the more abstract canvases but we have some ideas about that then well establish the order in which the canvases were painted if we can it may differ from the order in which they were sold while this is being done well be searching the canvases for fingerprints hairs skin flakes other biological artifacts the paint itself will be analyzed and lot numbers traced if possible brush fibers may be found and traced connoisseurs will make studies of the painters style and try to draw comparisons with known artists and thats only the beginning of what the paintings will go through whos in charge of the case for the bureau overall responsibility will be held by the director tactically there are different tracks to the investigation daniel will run the washington track hell be in charge of all profiling with me consulting the new orleans sac will run that end of the case whos the sac same one as last year no patrick bowles hes a competent man lenz looks as though hes about to continue but he stops himself what is it another man in new orleans may be playing the primary role in the investigation at this point thats one of the things im going down there to address who lenz sighs his name is john kaiser hes a journeyman agent now but two years ago he was a member of the investigative support unit in quantico with baxter yes why is he in new orleans he transferred out of the unit at his own request daniel tried to get him to take a leave of absence and come back but kaiser refused he said if he didnt get journeyman duty hed resign from the bureau why what happened to him ill let him tell you if he will why would kaiser have the primary role in this case the atmosphere in new orleans has become highly charged over the past year you can imagine victim after victim being taken no progress by the police not even a lead the nopd is under tremendous pressure complicating the issue is the multijurisdictional nature of the investigation what people think of as new orleans is actually a group of communities i know all about it jefferson parish slidell kenner harahan sheriffs departments and cops all mixed together yes and the only man in the area with any real experience in cases like this full time on the ground is john kaiser its my understanding that he resisted involvement when he arrived but as more victims were taken he began to work the case now hes obsessed with it has he made any headway no one had until you found those paintings but ive no doubt that john kaiser knows more about the victims and attacks than any man alive except the killer of course and perhaps the painter depending on the degree to which they interact you really believe this is some sort of team a conspiracy i do it helps explain the extreme professionalism of the kidnappings in new orleans the fact that we have no witnesses and no corpses im starting to think the painter in new york is masterminding the operation and merely paying a pro to snatch the women for him whos a professional at kidnapping lenz shrugs perhaps the painter spent some time in prison he might know a convict from new orleans or perhaps hes originally from new orleans himself he may have many contacts there that would explain the selection of the city in the first place the psychiatrists theory makes logical sense yet i feel that its wrong somehow was this kaiser good when he was at quantico lenz looks over at the porthole he had a very high success rate but you dont like him we disagree about fundamental issues of methodology thats psychobabble to me doctor ive learned one thing in my business like it or not whats that you dont argue with results lenz keeps looking out his window what do you think about baxters theory catching one of the guys by using airline computers tracing passengers on new york flights im not hopeful i lean back in my seat and rub my eyes how much longer to new orleans about an hour its too late to call my brotherinlaw i think ill get a room at the airport hotel call him tomorrow im staying at the windsor court why dont you sleep there i hope ive misunderstood his tone in your room he wrinkles his mouth as though the idea were absurd for gods sake at the hotel as i recall the windsor court is about five hundred dollars per night im not going to pay that and i know the fbi wont no but ill treat you are you rich my wifes insurance policy has made a certain standard of living possible one i never enjoyed before thanks but ill stay at the airport lenz studies me with a strange detachment in the dim light like an anthropologist studying some new primate you know i used to ask everyone i interviewed three questions what were they the first was what is the worst thing youve ever done did people answer that a surprising number did what was the second what moment are you proudest of in your life and the third whats the worst thing that ever happened to you i force a casual smile but something slips in my soul at his words why didnt you ask me those things i dont ask anyone anymore why not i got tired of hearing the answers he shifts in his seat but his eyes never leave my face but in your case i think id like to know youre old enough to be accustomed to disappointment he waves his hand something tells me that before all this is done im going to find out anyway a high beeping sounds in the cabin lenz reaches into his jacket removes a cell phone and presses a button yes as he listens he seems to shrink in his seat when he says at length yes yes right what is it i ask as he drops the phone in his lap whats happened twenty minutes ago two teenagers found the body of the woman taken from dorignacs grocery store her body lenz wears an expression of deep concentration she was lying on the bank of a drainage canal nude the kids climbed a wall behind some apartments to drink beer and heard noises by the water she was lying in the weeds a nutria was feeding on her whatever that is the police sealed the crime scene for a bureau forensic team her husband just identified the body its a big water rat what ah lenz says his mind a thousand miles away this news nauseates me but not because of its ugliness it wasnt him i say quietly if they found a body its unrelated not necessarily it could still be him lenz nods with a strange intensity think about it its been four and a half weeks since the last victim the new orleans unsub was on the prowl tonight maybe all afternoon he may have known what happened in hong kong but he didnt know what his partner did that wingate was about to be silenced along with you he snatches the woman from dorignacs and takes her back to his house when he arrives he finds an urgent message on his machine from his partner or maybe he gets a call the victim was found what lenz checks his watch seven hours after he took her plenty of time his new york partner tells him wingate is no longer a problem and also that jordan glass got away the investigation is about to get very hot so instead of painting this woman he kills her and dumps her in a canal sometime in the last seven hours lenz slaps his knee with excitement seven hours by god i wont be surprised if theres staging not at all whats staging i ask searching my memory for remnants of the crimeclassification manuals i read in the month after jane vanished lenzs eyes are glowing like all of baxters team hes a hunter at heart staging is an attempt to mislead investigators by altering the crime scene or the corpus the unsub may mutilate the body in an attempt to create the impression of a violent rape a satanic murder any number of things no we cant discount this victim just because we found her body i want to believe him but for some reason i dont but we know hes smart enough to dump the body without it being found thats the point lenz snaps hes letting us find her in order to confuse the trail but isnt that risky if hes actually had her in his possession i mean with all the forensics at your disposal the psychiatrist smiles for the first time in a long while yes it is we can establish a baseline of hair and fiber evidence perhaps theres even semen for dna and if were very damned lucky some biological artifact from one of the paintings will match something we find on or in the body thats a long shot if the painter and kidnapper are two different men but its possible it would be one hell of a start god forgive me i hope it was him that took her lenz squeezes his left hand into a fist if it was this is the turning point of the case because you have a body no because hes no longer calling the tune hes reacting to us to me i remind lenz finding the paintings images of the canvases i saw in hong kong float through my mind with eerie clarity what makes this guy tick doctor hes trying to recreate some fantasy right what is it an odd serenity eases the lines of lenzs face if i knew that hed be in custody right now the psychiatrist closes his eyes and lays his hands on the armrest of his seat please dont speak i need to think shit i reach into my fanny pack open my trusty pill bottle and swallow three xanax by the time i hit the airport hotel ill be like a zombie and glad for it the last thing in the world i want to do right now is think this morning i slept in and im glad except for my right flank which feels like a mule kicked it my muscles have that deliriously liquid feeling that only sex or too much sleep can give its been a while since i had the former so i owe my thanks to a quiet hotel room in america which can be quite a luxury for me i ate breakfast in the lobby then called budget and rented a mustang convertible after traveling in the east for months riding in underpowered taxis cyclos and even rickshaws an american muscle car feels exactly right its late october in new orleans but i have the convertible top down the leaves are green and still on the trees and the morning sun tells me the temperature could hit eighty by lunchtime thats the way this city is heat and rain rain and heat when winter finally comes the humidity makes it cold but winter doesnt last long im late for my meeting with the fbi because nobody bothered to tell me they moved the field office from downtown where they were forever to a brandnew building on the south shore of lake pontchartrain between lakefront airport and the university of new orleans its a massive fourstory brick structure designed to look like a college campus building but the closer i get the more it looks like a fortress in disguise set far back from the main road the building is surrounded by a heavy iron fence topped with sharp fleurdelis and fronted by a guardhouse with antiterrorist barriers embedded in the concrete road the armed gate guard checks my drivers license radios upstairs then raises the barrier and waves me into the parking lot as i lock the mustang and walk toward the entrance i sense that im being watched on screens inside i wont win any fashion awards today jeans a silk blouse espadrilles and my fanny pack no purses for jordan glass unless im doing a formal party i know how to dress up but i dont do it for the fbi the entrance is also built on the heroic scale with flags and black marble inscribed with the fbi motto fidelity bravery integrity other lawenforcement agencies have come up with more derogatory words for the acronym but ill reserve my opinion today a metal detector at the door leads me into a small vestibule not unlike a doctors office where a female receptionist waits behind glass when i give her my name she pushes a sheet through a slot for me to sign and assures me someone will be down for me in a minute thirty seconds later the door opens and a tall man with deepset eyes and a days growth of beard steps through the door by her window jordan glass yes sorry im late i went to the federal building downtown thats our fault then im john kaiser this guy does not look like the fbi agents ive known hes six feet two lanky and looks as comfortable in his white buttondown shirt and sport jacket as a cowboy in a tuxedo his dark brown hair is past the unwritten regulation length and his aura is about as unofficial as anything i can imagine he looks like a law student whos been studying for three days without sleep a fortyfiveyearold law student as if reading my mind he pulls out his wallet and flips it open to reveal his fbi credentials his bona fides are there in black and white special agent john kaiser his photo looks much neater than the man standing before me but its him all right he cleans up well you dont look like an fbi agent a lopsided grin my sac is fond of telling me that why did they move the field office after the bombing in oklahoma city the government mandated a hundredfoot setback from the road this office has twice as much space as downtown and a hell of a lot better view they moved last september a month before i got here are we going upstairs he lowers his voice to tell you the truth id rather talk to you alone first do you like chinese food i havent eaten since last night so i ordered some i ordered for two i like chinese but why dont you want to eat it in your office kaiser has hazel eyes and they focus on mine with subdued urgency because id rather talk without any interference from whom you met him last night doctor lenz he nods so the dislike is mutual afraid so you cant keep lenz out of your office im not sure but i can definitely keep him off a picnic table on lakeshore drive especially if he doesnt know im going there ill go if we take my car you read my mind ms glass kaiser collects his sacks and follows me through the main doors he tries to match his stride to mine but with the height differential its a struggle we got your film from the fire scene he says what did it show you got some good crowd shots new york is busting its collective ass trying to trace every face in them its a big job the good news is the video store had a list of members and the bartender says a lot of his patrons that evening were regulars i thought maybe i got a shot of the guy who set the fire it would have been a downward shot fortyfive degrees toward the back of a crowd kaiser gives me a strange look youre not going to believe this what you got the top of some heads and a caucasian hand flipping you the bird flipping youre kidding me my sense of humor doesnt extend to cases like this one do you think it was him or just some kid photo analysts say its an adult hand likely but not positively male you think the unsub saw what you were doing in time to duck down and flip you off he saw what i was doing all right he was moving along the back of the crowd following me i think he was trying to get close enough to kill me thats why i got the firefighters after him that was smart i thought i got that camera up quick enough damn its in the past he says you cant change it so forget it you make it sound easy is that what you do when you screw up do as i say not as i do this is it he stops beside the red mustang and flashes a broad smile of pleasure pony car i unlock the mustang with the remote climb in and put the top down kaiser drops his takeout sacks on the tiny backseat and folds his long frame into the passenger seat beside me in seconds were roaring down lakeshore drive headed for the green expanses beside lake pontchartrain he leans his head back and looks up at the sky damn this feels good what riding in a ragtop with a pretty girl its been a long time despite the strangeness of the situation i feel a little flush of pleasure being noticed by john kaiser is a lot different from objectively discussing my looks with dr lenz a long time since youve been in a ragtop or close to a pretty girl he laughs i plead the fifth kaiser looks a few years older than i but hes aged well and though i hate to admit it he reminds me a little of david gresham the history teacher i told lenz about something about the way he carries himself more than physical similarity theres a wariness in his motion as though hes always aware of exactly where he is and of his immediate surroundings i wonder how much lenz told him about last nights interview on the plane braking to a near stop i nose the mustang into a cement semicircle by a wooden bench on the lake side of the road while i put up the top to keep the gulls from trashing the interior kaiser carries the food to the bench straddles one end and lays out the cardboard containers and drinks in front of him as he sits his pant legs ride up his ankles revealing a black holster with the butt of an automatic pistol protruding from it i got peking chicken and spicy beef he says also some shrimp fried rice egg rolls and two iced teas unsweetened take whatever you want peking chicken i straddle the other end of the bench and reach for one of the cups go for it he says i spread some white rice onto a tiny plate top it with the spicy chicken and zucchini and dig in do you want to start he asks or do you want me to i will i want you to know this is a strange situation for me i didnt handle janes disappearance well but in the past year ive managed to deal with it on some level i accepted that id never see her again and that the case would never be solved now all that certitude has been taken away and im glad it has its just disturbing i feel vulnerable again i understand believe it or not ive seen similar things happen before missingperson cases that have lain dormant for years then suddenly the child or husband turns up its disorienting to people homo sapiens survived by adapting rapidly to change even terrible change being forced to reverse an adaptation youve made to survive can cause a lot of strange feelings a lot of resentment i dont feel any resentment he watches me his eyes full of kindness i wasnt saying you did ive just seen it in other cases i take a long sip of tea and i feel the caffeine in my skin and heart id like to know where you are on the case and what you think the odds are of solving it kaiser has already polished off an egg roll now hes exploring the spicy beef i dont like giving odds ive been disappointed too many times do you believe the death of christopher wingate is part of my sisters case yes you believe theres more than one person behind all this kaiser cocks his head to the side yes and no what do you mean you dont share lenzs theory the kidnapper in new orleans and the painter in new york no i dont why not instinct mostly its an elegant theory and it explains a lot the reason we cant find any common factors among the victims for example lenz would say that since the new orleans unsub is being paid to kidnap the women he simply chooses them at random but thats not how this kind of thing is done predators will take targets of opportunity yes but theres always an underlying pattern beneath the victims selection even if its just geographic you think something links all the victims something always does serial murder is sexual murder thats axiomatic it may appear otherwise but always at bottom lies serious sexual maladjustment and the criterion for victim selection usually arises from this the victims are from new orleans my gut tells me the selections are being made here and not randomly either we just dont understand them yet have you formed some picture of this guy then of what drives him ive tried but theres not much to go on the normal rules are out the window organized versus disorganized personality comparing this guy to ted bundy who was classified as organized is like comparing stephen hawking to mister rogers no corpses no witnesses no evidence the victims might as well have been kidnapped by aliens and that frightens me more than anything why because its hard to hide a body well especially in an urban environment corpses stink dogs and cats root them out homeless people discover them passersby report suspicious actions more often than youd think and nosy neighbors see everything theres a lot of swamp around new orleans i point out i have nightmares about that jane wedged under a cypress stump somewhere kaiser shakes his head weve been dragging the swamps for months with no results lake pontchartrain too and those swamps arent empty there are hunters fishermen oil people game wardens families living in shacks on the water think about it if the unsub dumps a woman off a causeway shes going to float within sight of somebody eleven bodies in a row forget it and if he goes deep into the swamp carrying a dead body in a boat he almost has to do it at night do you see an artist talented enough to paint these pictures striking out into a swamp full of snakes and alligators in the dead of night i dont if theyre dead i think hes burying them and the safest place to do that is beneath a house a house hes living in a basement or a crawl space new orleans houses dont have basements the water tables too high thats why they bury people above ground that was always more out of custom than necessity he says and the water table has fallen considerably in recent years he could be burying them under a house and they would stay buried and dry toss in a little lime every now and then they wouldnt even stink a beeping sound comes from kaisers pocket he takes out a cell phone and looks at its led screen thats lenz trying to find me well let him keep looking excuse me you just said if theyre dead kaiser carefully formulates his reply thats right doctor lenz is positive theyre dead the doctor and i disagree about a lot of things youre the first lawenforcement officer whos expressed any real doubt baxter says hell hold out hope until he sees an actual body but hes just being courteous baxters a nice guy kaisers eyes bore into mine but he thinks theyre dead and you dont ive never seen a case like this eleven women vanish into thin air absolutely no word from the unsub normally a guy who snatched that many women and got away with it would be taunting us some way but what makes you think they might be alive where could they possibly be its a big world ms glass theres something else though the autopsy on the dorignacs victim is mostly complete externally the body was clean but we took some skin from beneath her fingernails theres nothing to compare that to right now but later it could be very important toxicology will take a little longer all thats great but why does that make you think the victims could be alive it doesnt but we also found a strange burn on her neck the kind of contact burn consistent with an electrical stun device like a taser my pulse quickens what does that tell you that while the snatches were previously thought to have been blitz attacks the force used was not necessarily deadly force that means the unsub may not have wanted to risk killing his victims even by mistake oh god please let that be it i dont want to create false hope but its a good sign in my book by the way were telling the media that we dont think the dorignacs victim is part of this case were playing it as a random rapemurder the dumping of the body supports that story i hope that fairy tale doesnt come back to haunt you kaiser takes another bite of spicy beef and gives me a measuring look a couple of other things make this unsub very interesting to me like what one hes the only serial offender i know of to earn enormous profit from his crimes most serials dont profit in any way from what they do money isnt part of the equation for them but for this guy it is okay two hes not after publicity not the usual kind anyway if the victims are dead hes not leaving the bodies where theyll be found and cause big news and if theyre not dead hes not sending severed fingers to relatives or the tv stations so for him the women are simply part of the process of creating the paintings thats what the murders are about the paintings but arent the paintings a kind of publicity in themselves yes but a very specialized kind publicity and profit are linked here if the artist were painting these images solely to fulfill his private needs he wouldnt need to sell them think of the risk hes taking by putting them on the market thats the only way weve learned anything about him if he hadnt sold any paintings wed be as lost today as we were after the first kidnapping how are profit and publicity linked he wants the art world to see what hes doing maybe critics maybe other painters i dont know the money might not be important in and of itself it wouldnt surprise me if he hasnt spent a dime of it he probably knows that in our society the value of art is determined by what people pay for it therefore if the world is to pay attention to his work it must sell for a great deal of money thats why he took the risk of dealing with christopher wingate or dealing with whoever killed wingate for him im only speculating of course it makes more sense than what ive heard so far what does he want people to get from his work why paint the women dead and why start with almost abstract faces then paint women who look asleep and only later get to explicit views of death id just as soon not speculate about that yet kaiser looks at his watch id like to ask you about something personal if you dont mind what the phone call phone call the one you got from thailand today i woke up thinking about that call it was the most unsettling experience of my life im not surprised i know you gave us a statement when it happened but would you mind telling me about it not if you think it might help you it might it was five months after jane disappeared a bad time for me i was having to sedate myself to sleep i dont remember if i told them that in my statement you said you were exhausted thats one word for it i wasnt too happy with the bureau then anyway the phone rang in the middle of the night it must have rung a long time to wake me up and when i finally got to it the connection was terrible what was the first thing you heard a woman crying did you recognize the voice right at that moment no it made me more alert but it didnt zing straight to my gut you know yeah what then the woman sobbed jordan then there was static then i need your help i cant then there was more static like a bad cell phone connection then she said daddys alive but he cant help me then please like she was begging at her wits end at that point i felt that it was jane and i was about to ask where she was when a man in the background said something in french that i didnt understand and dont remember even now in seventydegree sunlight a chill goes through my body at the memory and i thought for a second what i thought he sounded like my father i look defiantly at kaiser daring him to call me a fool but he doesnt part of me is glad yet another part wonders if hes a fool go on he says then in english the man said no cherie its just a dream and then the phone went dead my appetite is gone a clammy sweat has broken out under my blouse sending a cold rivulet down my ribs i press the silk against my skin to stop it do you have a clear memory of your fathers voice not really more an impression i guess i think the voice on the phone reminded me of his because dad spoke a little french sometimes he learned it in vietnam i think he called me cherie sometimes did he what happened next to be honest my brain was barely functioning i thought the whole thing was probably a delusion but the next day i reported it to baxter and he told me they had found a record of the call and traced its origin to a train station in bangkok when you found that out what did your gut tell you i hoped it was my sister bu the more i thought about it the less i believed it i know a lot of mia families from searching for my father for so long what if it was a female relative of an mia in the middle of a search they go over there all the time you know a wife or daughter of an mia in trouble and needing help maybe shes drunk and depressed she pulls my card out of her purse the conversation fits if you fill in the blanks a certain way jordan i need your help my daddys alive but he referring to her father cant help me but mia relatives go over to try to help the missing soldier right not the other way around yes did you check with the mia families you knew yes the fbi did too we never found anyone who would admit to calling me but there are more than two thousand mias still unaccounted for thats a lot of families and at the meetings they all talk to me because im well known and because ive traveled in the east so much if that were the case who would the mans voice have belonged to a husband a stepfather who knows but i thought of another possibility what if it was the killer playing a trick on me using some woman he knows to upset me kaiser shakes his head no other relatives of victims received such calls i checked so what do you think he idly pokes a leftover slice of beef i think it might have been your sister i take a deep breath and try to steady my nerves im telling you this he says soberly because baxter told me you were tough i dont know if im that tough he waits letting me work through it this is why you didnt want lenz here isnt it partly when i asked lenz what he thought about the phone call he brushed it off kaiser looks at the ground the consensus in the unit is that your mystery caller was a member of an mia family just as you guessed lenz didnt ask you about it because hed seen the statement you made at the time and hed consider that a more reliable description of the event than what you remember now that sounds like an official reply whats your personal opinion if your sister is alive it throws lenzs present theory whatever that might be into question lenz talks a lot about how everything is possible how there are no rules but deep down hes wearing blinders i dont think he always did but these days hes prejudiced toward the tragic ending im open to something else thats it in a nutshell why are you open to something else a wistful smile touches the corners of kaisers lips and eyes because i know the world obeys no laws i learned that the hard way he picks up a plasticwrapped fortune cookie then discards it lenz probably asked you about all sorts of family stuff right intimate stuff yes thats the way he works he likes to know all the underlying relationships hes upset a lot of the victims families doing that im not criticizing him for it he did some groundbreaking work early in his career thats pretty much what he said about you really well i wont kid you i dont think he should be involved in this investigation why not i dont trust his instincts or his judgment he was involved in a case a while back that turned into a real clusterfuck and baxter places too much weight on what he says because of their history lenz told me his wife was killed during a case is that what youre talking about yes did he tell you why no he just said it was a vicious killing it was that all right and it happened because lenz did something supremely arrogant and stupid he got there five minutes after she died on her own kitchen table god he retired after that hes done some consulting for baxter since but i dont think he learned the right lesson from what happened he still has too much faith in his own abilities what do you think about his plan to use me to rattle any suspects you dig up it could work but its not as simple or safe as it sounds the results could be inconclusive and the strategy could put you right in the killers sights kaisers cell phone beeps again he lifts it from the detritus of the meal and scans the lcd lenz again are you going to answer no since kaiser took the conversation into personal territory i feel justified in doing the same youve told me lenzs dirty laundry what about yours why did you leave quantico what did lenz tell you nothing he said hed leave it for you to tell me if you would kaiser looks off toward a stand of palm trees where two lovers and a dog lie on a blanket an ice chest beside them its pretty simple really i burned out it happens to everyone in that job sooner or later i just snapped a little more spectacularly than most what happened after four years at quantico i was pretty much baxters right hand i was handling far too heavy a load over a hundred and twenty active cases child murders serial rapes bombers kidnappings the whole sick spectrum you cant assign priorities in a situation like that behind every single case every photo is a desperate family distraught parents husbands siblings frustrated cops aching to help them it got to where i was actually living at the academy when my personal life fell apart i hardly noticed then one day the inevitable happened this vague reference to his personal life makes me check his left hand theres no wedding band there what was that i ask the inevitable baxter and i were out at the montana state prison interviewing a deathrow inmate hed raped and murdered seven little boys tortured most of them before they died it was no different from interviews id done a dozen times before but this guy was really enjoying telling us what hed done a lot of them do of course but this time i just couldnt detach myself i couldnt stop thinking about this one little boy six years old screaming for his mother while this guy shoved power tools up his rectum kaiser swallows hard like his mouth is dry and i lost control what did you do i went over the table i tried to kill him how close did you come i broke his jaw his nose and assorted other facial bones i damaged his larynx and put out one of his eyes baxter couldnt pull me off he finally clubbed the base of my skull with a coffee mug stunned me long enough for him to drag me out the guy was hospitalized for twentysix days jesus how did you keep your job kaiser slowly shakes his head as if gauging how much to tell me baxter covered for me he told the warden the con jumped me and i defended myself kaisers eyes search out the lovers again i guess youre going to go all liberal on me now tell me i violated his civil rights well you did you know that but i understand why ive made myself part of the story before instead of covering it it sounds to me like you had a delayed reaction to something else he looks back at me as though surprised thats what it was all right id lost a little girl a week before working a rapemurder case in minnesota i was advising minneapolis homicide and we were close to getting the unsub really close but he strangled one more little girl before we did if id been one day faster well you know its in the past isnt that what you told me you cant change it so forget it glib bullshit his honesty brings a smile to my face a while ago you said clusterfuck thats a vietnam term isnt it he nods distractedly yeah were you there yeah you look too young for it i was there at the end seventyone and two which makes him fortysix or fortyseven if he went over when he was eighteen the end was seventythree i remind him seventyfive really there was still a lot of ground fighting in seventyone thats what i meant the end of the fighting what branch of service army were you drafted i wish i could tell you i was but i volunteered every civilian was trying like hell to stay out of the military every soldier was trying to get out of vietnam and i was trying to get in what did i know i was a kid from rural idaho i went to ranger school the whole nine yards how did you feel about journalists over there photographers they had a job to do like i did a different job true i met a couple who were okay but some of them just stayed in the hotels and sent vietnamese out to get their combat shots i didnt care much for them that still happens in some places ive seen your name under some pretty rough pictures are you a lot like your father i dont know to tell you the truth all i know is what people have told me about him guys who worked with him in the field i think were different as photographers how so wars attract different kinds there are the hotel guys you talked about who dont even count there are the hemingway wannabes out there to test themselves then you have the ones who get off on the danger who live for the rush theyre the crazy ones like sean flynn riding hellforleather through firefights on a motorcycle with a camera in his hand and then there are the good ones the ones who do it because they feel its the right thing to do they know the danger theyre scared shitless but they do it anyway they crawl right into the middle of it where the mortar rounds are dropping and the machine guns are churning up the mud thats the kind of courage i respected over there kaiser says quietly i knew some soldiers like that his face is lined with silent grief i wonder if he knows it something tells me you were a soldier like that he doesnt respond thats the kind of courage my father had i tell him he wasnt that gifted a photographer when you get down to it his composition was never that great but he would get so close to the elephant that the crazies wouldnt even go there and when youre that close composition doesnt matter just the shot and that made his pictures unique he went into laos and cambodia he spent twelve days underground at khe sanh during the worst of the siege i have a photo a marine shot of him peeing in the middle of the ho chi minh trail kaisers eyes flick toward me at last who told you that about the elephant my dad when i was a kid i asked him why he did such a dangerous job and he tried to make out like it wasnt dangerous at all he said the soldiers called combat seeing the elephant that it was like a big circus it was in a lot of ways later when i got a taste of it myself i understood better if youre not like him what kind of photographer are you why do you do it because i have to i dont even remember making a conscious choice are you trying to change the world i laugh again in the beginning i was im not that naive now youve probably changed it more than most people ever will you change peoples minds make them see things in a new way thats the hardest thing to do in this world if you ask me will you marry me he laughs and hits me on the shoulder are you that starved for affirmation this past year has really sucked the past two have sucked for me welcome to the club kaisers cell phone rings again he ignores it but this time it does not relent and he finally picks it up and looks at the lcd thats baxter at quantico he presses send kaiser his face grows tight as he listens okay i will he hangs up and gathers the leftovers into the bags what happened baxter wants me back at the field office why i dont know but he said to bring you with me theyre setting up a video link to quantico and he wants you there my heart stutters oh god do you think theyve found out something about jane no point in guessing he tosses the bags one after another at a metal trash can ten feet away they bang in without touching the rim baxters voice was on edge though somethings popped somewhere the fbi field office is run from the fourth floor which was designed so that you see nothing but hallways and doors unless you walk through one of the doors a few of the doors are open and as i walk past them i sense people watching me at a door marked patrick bowles special agent in charge kaiser gives me a look of encouragement dont be shy just say what you think i usually do he nods and ushers me into a large lshaped room with a broad window overlooking lake pontchartrain theres a desk in the dogleg of the l and sitting behind it is a florid man with quick green eyes and silver hair on the way over kaiser told me that sac bowles is the senior fbi official in the state of louisiana in charge of field agents and support personnel trained as an attorney bowles has served in six other field offices and has supervised several major investigations fashionwise the sac is the antithesis of john kaiser hes wearing a threepiece suit that never hung on any department store rack silver links on his french cuffs and a silk tie when he gets up to greet me i see that his shoes are johnston amp murphy at the least ms glass he says offering his hand patrick bowles a little irish in his voice it makes me think of the irish channel but of course the channel is now home to black and cuban families not irish immigrants to avoid awkwardness i shake his hand and give him a guarded smile take a seat here he says motioning toward a leather chair in a group glancing to my left i see arthur lenz on a sofa in a private seating area in the deep leg of the l the good doctor doesnt look happy but he stands and walks over to us he and kaiser do not exchange greetings kaiser sits in a chair opposite mine and lenz claims the sofa against the wall to my right sac bowles retakes his place behind his desk he looks like a nononsense kind of guy which is fine with me have you learned something about my sister i ask youve met daniel baxter asks the sac ignoring my question of the investigative support unit you know i have he glances at his watch mr baxter wants to discuss something with the four of us well have a satellite video link in about thirty seconds bowles pushes a button on his desk and a threefoot section of wall above dr lenz slides back revealing a large flatpanel lcd screen just like james bond i say softly lenz gets up with an irritated sigh and leans against the long window to the right of bowless desk i glance over at kaiser who gives no indication of his feelings i guess theres a lot of hurryupandwait in the fbi theres a lot of it in photojournalism too after a moment the lcd screen goes blue and numbers begin flickering in the bottom right corner theres a camera above the screen says bowles baxter can see us all in a wideangle shot suddenly daniel baxters face fills the screen and his voice emanates from hidden speakers hello patrick hello ms glass john arthur the video feed isnt jerky like some homecomputer hookup it has the seamless resolution of corporate americas teteatetes the isu chief looks directly at me as he speaks which gives me the feeling that hes actually standing in the room ms glass from the moment you called me from your return flight from hong kong weve been using the combined weight of the departments of justice and state to gather the sleeping women paintings for forensic analysis negotiations like these usually take weeks but the exigencies of this situation allowed us to apply unprecedented pressure we now have six paintings in our possession weve already begun our analysis using both our own technicians and outside consultants the bad news is weve found no fingerprints preserved in the paint damn curses bowles there are hundreds of prints on the frames of course but theyre probably meaningless we have found traces of talc in the paint which suggests that the artist wore surgical gloves while doing his work we have what we believe to be the first painting and it tests positive for talc which means the unsub was intent on protecting his identity from the start this guy doesnt learn as he goes hes a savant were xraying the paintings to find out if there are any hidden messages or ghosts but we whats that asks bowles a ghost a painting beneath a painting says lenz speaking for the first time x rays might also detect fingerprints on the canvas beneath the paint baxter continues our unsub may not have been so careful as he made sketches knowing that the surface would soon be covered with paint i wouldnt count on that kaiser says artists know about xray analysis im glad youre letting me in on all this i say to the screen but whats it leading to whats the urgency bear with me says baxter weve made arrangements for eight paintings to be shipped to us in washington the owners of six more all in asia have given us permission to send forensic teams to their homes or galleries to make the necessary studies those teams are en route now that leaves five says kaiser nineteen total right baxter nods the remaining five are owned by a man named marcel de becque a frenchman asks bowles something ticks in my brain something christopher wingate said its more complicated than that says baxter de becque was born in algeria in but reared in vietnam his father was a french colonial businessman who put his money into tea plantations and he lives in the cayman islands i finish how did you know that baxter asks sharply wingate mentioned him de becque wont send us his paintings asks kaiser hes not only refused to ship his paintings to us but also refused to allow our forensic teams to go to his estate on grand cayman to study them kaiser and lenz share a look what reason did he give asks the psychiatrist he said it was inconvenient frog son of a bitch growls bowles whats he doing in the caymans probably running from something he is baxter confirms in while we scraped the last americans off the saigon embassy roof by helicopter de becque was slipping out in a private plane hed sold his plantations just before the tet offensive which is suspicious in and of itself he was tied to intelligence people on both sides and he undoubtedly played both ends against the middle when he could word is he was heavily involved in the unofficial war economy throughout the conflict black marketeer kaiser says with obvious distaste four years ago says baxter marcel de becque was implicated in a stockfraud scheme on the paris bourse the scam involved a fraudulent platinum discovery in africa he had to flee but he netted close to fifty million from the deal bowles whistles from his desk the french cant extradite him from cayman because at some point he established residency in quebec and obtained canadian citizenship canada and the caymans have no extradition treaty we can extradite from cayman but de becque has committed no crime on us soil hes immune to pressure from us as far as we know says bowles if we got enough evidence to issue an arrest warrant on conspiracy we could go in and bring him back under the new laws thats not an option at this time pat says baxter kaiser unexpectedly voices my thought for me what does all this have to do with jordan glass baxter turns to me again monsieur de becque has made a very unusual proposition he personally told me that he would allow his sleeping women thats how he refers to them as though theyre real women he would allow them to be photographed not forensically examined mind you but only if the photographer was jordan glass the room goes silent and cold apprehension climbs my spine why in the world would he ask for me i was hoping you could shed some light on that says baxter maybe de becque is the killer suggests bowles he killed jane lacour and now hes discovered she has a twin sister he wants to do her as well make a set in a voice dripping with disdain lenz says please confine your theories to subjects with which youre familiar like bank robbery arthur baxter warns bowles is so red he looks ready to pop a blood vessel de becque is seventy years old says baxter he falls well outside all profiles for serial murder this may not be serial murder says kaiser earning odd looks from the other men and de becque could easily be behind the selections we need to find out if hes come to new orleans in the past eighteen months and if so how often de becque owns his own jet says baxter a cessna citation kaisers eyebrows go up were trying to trace its movements now lenz focuses on kaiser do you really think a murderer or a kidnapper whos been so careful up to this point would invite his next victim to his lair through the medium of the fbi he might says kaiser as a joke a final joke hes getting old he knows weve discovered the link between his victims and the paintings he killed wingate or ordered his death so his marketing conduits shut down one way or another he knows he hasnt got much time so he decides to immortalize himself by the way he goes out murdersuicide with a celebrity despite the antipathy between kaiser and lenz the psychiatrist seems to be weighing this theory if hes the suicidal type why bother to kill wingate at all kneejerk response like people who kill every snake they see he perceived a threat and neutralized it before fully exploring how it would affect his situation lenz purses his lips in thought did de becques jet fly to new york yesterday no says baxter it was on grand cayman for the past twentyfour hours weve confirmed that we are checking commercial carriers you can forget that mutters lenz de becque says hell send his jet to pick up ms glass and her equipment says baxter the catch is she has to go alone kaiser looks incredulous youre not actually considering this john we have to look at kaiser whirls on lenz how long have you known about de becque i heard what you did when you did lenz says quietly which is not exactly a denial ill do it i tell them the room goes quiet again if you do says baxter it wont be under de becques conditions under no conditions says kaiser we have no control down there we have to see those paintings john if she took one of our planes says bowles we could put the hostage rescue team inside she goes in wired and if it starts going south they can bust in and bring them both out glass and de becque if it starts going south echoes kaiser you mean like if de becque shoots her in the head then hrt which is at the airport starts for the estate dont waste your breath scoffs lenz hes talking about invading a foreign country wed talk to the brits first says bowles cayman is still a british colony good god mutters lenz as though rendered speechless by the ignorance around him either the psychiatrist has forgotten whose territory hes on or he feels that baxters patronage makes him bulletproof let me get this straight i say to kaiser you think a seventyyearold man is going around new orleans kidnapping women in their twenties and thirties without leaving a trace my sister ran three miles a day and worked out with weights she could kick the crap out of most seventyyearold men pardon my french seventy isnt that old says lenz playing devils advocate there are seventyyearold men in excellent health and youre forgetting the taser wound on the dorignacs victim says kaiser but if de becque is behind it i see him commissioning the paintings paying one or more men to take the women for him and one artist to paint them a guy like that a wanted expatriate he probably has all kinds of bodyguards on his property retired israeli commandos exparas or foreign legion maybe even gign an elegant scenario says lenz you think de becque could paint them himself asks bowles hes a collector not a painter lenz sighs dismissively but if he commissions them why does he only own five paintings why wouldnt he have them all he could be selling them says baxter a guy worth fifty million asks bowles an elaborate hoax suggests kaiser turning the art world upside down for kicks for some twisted fantasy we dont yet understand i cant tell whos arguing for what though lenz and kaiser dislike each other they clearly respect each others opinions and baxter respects them both because hes letting them run with the ball as they bat it back and forth something occurs to me wingate told me de becque bought the first five sleeping women i tell baxter so how did you test the first painting for talc the paintings didnt sell in the order they were painted he replies we tested the first one painted one of the more abstract ones it was the realistic ones that sold first and started the phenomenon his nabi period says lenz the nabis i echo wingate mentioned them hebrew for the prophets just so did de becque know im already involved with you i ask he seemed to says baxter how the hell would he know that kaiser asks i dont know john kaiser turns to bowles how tight have you kept this the irishmans lips tighten he is after all kaisers boss if theres a leak its not our people kaiser doesnt look convinced neither does lenz so what are we going to do asks the sac im going to grand cayman i tell them one way or another lenz nods approval but kaiser gives me a hard look this isnt some jaunt through somalia with a press pass in your pocket now my face is red im flattered by your desire to protect me agent kaiser but i dont think its going to advance this investigation shes right says lenz what were going to do baxter says in a conclusive tone is let ms glass go about her business we know her wishes its up to us to decide what strategy makes the most sense she needs protection says kaiser we have no idea whats going on in this case no idea about motive de becque could have people in new orleans right now they could snatch or kill her any time agreed says baxter patrick could you put one of your agents with ms glass until we contact her bowles nods assent ms glass baxter says in a conclusive tone i appreciate your willingness to go through with this and if agent kaiser knew you like i do hed know theres no point in arguing with you bowles looks at kaiser take her outside and find her some protection john somebody youll be satisfied with kaiser gets up and walks out without a glance in my direction i stand and say gentlemen with the panache ive developed over twenty years working in a profession dominated by men then follow him out kaiser is waiting in the hall his jaw tight your work has dulled your ability to assess risk he says you think because youve tromped through a few battlefields a visit to the cayman islands is nothing but theres a difference in a war zone a journalists enemy is bad luck you might take a stray bullet or a piece of shrapnel but nobodys trying very hard to kill you de becque may have nothing else on his mind but killing you do you get that you could walk in the front door and he could stick a knife in your throat and laugh in your face are you through not if you still think youre going we can get pictures of those paintings some other way you have no business taking that kind of risk do you have a sister agent kaiser no a brother yes so why are we arguing he sighs and looks at the floor i start past him but he takes hold of my shoulder what about the protection find me somebody whos not a robot and im fine with it i touch him lightly on the elbow im not stupid okay what do you plan on doing his afternoon buying presents for my niece and nephew im supposed to stay with them tonight my brotherinlaws house thats where your sister disappeared the garden district which proves no neighborhoods safe right unless you move across the lake with all the white flight where do you live across the lake most of the agents here do what does that say about your crimefighting efforts kaiser turns and starts toward the elevators and i follow homicides dont fall under our jurisdiction he says except very special ones right i dont guess youre available to guard me this afternoon he chuckles no ive got someone good in mind though is he tough why do you assume its a man okay is she tough her hobbys competitive pistol shooting shes a member of our swat team is she going to make a pass at me kaiser frowns but his eyes are smiling if you were in the bureau youd be disciplined for that remark but im not are you suggesting that aggressive career women are sometimes gay ive run across it in my time he pauses in the corridor and looks me up and down you fit that category pretty well yourself ms glass i do dont i now hes looking at my left hand it takes men longer to wonder about the marriage state seeing no ring he raises his eyebrows i cant help but smile dont worry agent kaiser i like my bread buttered on the traditional side now introduce me to my bodyguard he walks past the elevators and into the stairwell we need the exercise i ask the elevators are painfully slow i follow him down one floor and we emerge into a beehive of activity a wideopen cube farm of glasswindowed partitions with welldressed men and women hurrying between the workspaces ten seconds into the room i realize something they managed to conceal upstairs the new orleans fbi office is a building under siege the agents faces look hunted their smallest movements marked by frustration the airconditioning is running full blast but it cant drive out the reek of desperation for a year and a half two sweltering summers these men and women have labored in vain as an evergrowing string of victims generated fear and then panic in a city that in the early nineties grew inured to the highest murder rate in the nation outside this building my sister is a dim memory a blurred element of the freefloating paranoia tainting the streets of this usually laid back city but here in this seemingly corporate cube farm jane is remembered here the shame of impotence weighs heavily on civilian soldiers who have no idea who their enemy is as i move through the room at kaisers side the looks i get run the scale from awe to resentment there she is they say to themselves the one who found the paintings the photographer the one whose sister got it the one who was in the fire in the corner of the huge room is an office with four real walls and an open door kaiser leads us inside where a man in shirtsleeves sits behind a desk talking on the phone his office is a quarter of the size of the sacs upstairs but his voice carries the weight of authority when he hangs up he winks at kaiser whats up john he says his eyes ready for anything bill this is jordan glass ms glass bill granger head of the violent crimes squad granger leans forward and shakes my hand im sorry about your sister ms glass weve been doing everything we can thank you i understand the sac wants to put an agent with ms glass for a few hours says kaiser maybe for the night theres no imminent threat but we want someone armed with her i was thinking of wendy travis can you spare her granger bites his bottom lip then nods and picks up the phone i think we can spare her for a few hours he taps his fingers on his knee then says could i see you for a moment thanks when he hangs up he gives kaiser a knowing look i heard weve got a quantico shrink upstairs and baxter himself may be flying down you guys have a plan working on one anything for my people to do i sure as hell hope so theres a knock behind us and i turn to see a young woman a couple of inches shorter than i but twice as fit shes attractive in a wellscrubbed american way dressed in a navy skirt cream blouse and a matching jacket that looks like liz claiborne she could be an accountant for a big five firm but for the pistol i see through the opening in her jacket ms glass says granger this is special agent wendy travis agent travis jordan glass id like you to spend the day with her its a protective detail agent wendy gives me a pert smile and offers me her hand when i take it she shakes with a firmness two levels above that of most female professionals let me get my purse she says and im ready to go i expect her to leave but she remains in the doorway her eyes on john kaiser kaiser smiles and says thanks wendy i knew you were the one for this practically glowing with pleasure agent wendy nods and walks briskly toward one of the glass cubes when i turn back to the desk kaiser is blushing and bill granger is smiling wryly and shaking his head im sitting on st charles avenue in my rented mustang trying to work up the courage to knock on my brotherinlaws door i parked a little way up from the house in case my niece and nephew are watching through the windows my female bodyguard is standing thirty yards away beneath a spreading oak her hands hanging loosely at her sides agent wendy has turned out to be all right and i feel safer than i have in years wendy would think jane was a lightweight for running only three miles a day its not hard to imagine her standing on a shooting range next to pound men annoyed that a goddamn girl is outshooting them she entered the fbi academy in which tells me shes probably one of the starlings who signed up for the bureau after seeing jodie fosters inspiring portrayal of a fictional agent trainee in the silence of the lambs im not knocking her after i saw annie hall i walked around in floppy pants a mans necktie and a hat for three weeks at least wendy picked something worthwhile to emulate she also kindly followed me around town while i searched for presents for my niece and nephew henry is eight and named after the father of my brotherinlaw marc lacour lyn is six and named after my mother ive only seen them once since i left new orleans eleven months ago i promised myself i would visit more often but that was a hard promise to keep the reason is simple i look exactly like their missing mother and no matter what their father says to prepare them for my visits they end up confused and crying wendy is staring at the mustang willing me to get out she knows im nervous about the visit an hour ago i persuaded her to take me to a funky little bar on magazine she didnt drink but i had two ginandtonics to keep my mind off what was coming i asked her about the new orleans field office she started with sac bowles who initially found the ambiguities of louisiana crime and politics at one time virtually the same industry a bit slippery but now he has trials pending against a former governor and assorted other luminaries the interesting thing was the way wendy talked about john kaiser she didnt volunteer information i had to ask and her selfconscious glances told me she was trying to gauge the nature and level of my interest kaiser it seems is the resident hunk of the office all the assistants and secretaries flirt shamelessly with him but he has never asked one for a date patted a rump or even squeezed a shoulder which impresses agent wendy to no end kaisers biography is interesting too he was sheriff in idaho when daniel baxter was called in by a neighboring sheriff to consult on a string of murders that overlapped kaisers county with baxters help kaiser ultimately caught the killer proving exceptionally adept at interrogating suspects and extracting a confession duly impressed baxter encouraged the young sheriff to apply to the fbi academy against the odds the country boy from idaho won admission and after serving in the spokane detroit and baltimore field offices kaiser was tapped by baxter for the investigative support unit his record there was stellar until he snapped under the pressure when i told wendy i knew that part of the story she couldnt hide her suspicion how she wondered had i learned something in one day that it had taken her weeks to discover his wife left him she said did he tell you that no a satisfied smile she couldnt take the hours he put in thats pretty common were getting more and more intrabureau marriages now but he didnt even stop working then to sort it out he just let her go kids i asked she shook her head he told me he served in vietnam do you know anything about that he doesnt talk about it but bowles told my swat commander that hed seen johns service record and that he has a bagful of medals bowles thought we ought to try to get john on the swat team my commander approached him but he wasnt interested what do you think about that it doesnt surprise me men whove seen a lot of combat dont have many illusions about solving problems with weapons wendy bit her lip and wondered if that was an insult youve seen it she asked combat i mean youve taken pictures of it and all yes you ever get shot yes i instantly went up two notches in her estimation did it hurt i dont recommend it i took a piece of shrapnel in the rear end once too that hurt a lot worse than the bullet did talk about hot wendy laughed i laughed with her and by the time we finished talking i knew she was more than half in love with john kaiser and that though she liked me she viewed me as an interloper of the first order now the gin is wearing off and if i dont get out of the mustang immediately i never will i sense wendys relief as i climb out with my giftwrapped packages and walk up the block to my brotherinlaws house house is actually a misnomer jane and her husband settled in one of those massive st charles avenue homes that would be called a mansion anywhere else on this part of st charles the wroughtiron fences cost more than houses in the rest of the city i mount the porch and swing the brass knocker against the knurled oak door the resounding bang announces the acres of space that lie behind the door i expect the knock to be answered by annabelle the lacour family maid now inherited by the scion but its marc himself who opens the door youd think people would be blessed with money or looks not both but marc lacour shatters that assumption he has sandy blond hair blue eyes a chiseled face and a muscular frame that looks ten years younger than its fortyone years after the kids were born he put on twenty pounds but janes disappearance knocked them back off as he manically exercised to combat depression tonight hes wearing blue wool trousers cordovan wing tips and a brooks brothers shirt he smiles when he sees me then pulls me to him for a hug which i return he smells faintly of cologne jordan he says as i draw back im glad youre here he pulls me into the huge central hall then closes the door and leads me to a formal living room that looks like a layout from architectural digest theres not a castaside toy or empty pizza box in sight i feel almost guilty setting my presents on the floor as though im disturbing some hidden plan jane kept things looser i suppose the life of the house has begun to revert to the patterns marc knew in childhood he has no other map of course but the sterility of the environment makes my heart hurt for the kids are henry and lyn upstairs i ask perching on a wing chair that looks like it should have a braided museum rope tied across its arms theyre at my parents house marc sits opposite me on a sofa oh when will they be back my folks bought a place down the street theyll bring the kids as soon as i call okay whats going on marc i wanted to talk to you before you see them is something wrong no but theres something you need to know what he takes a lawyerly pause then speaks in the deepest voice he can muster the kids know jane is dead jordan what i had to tell them i had no choice its amazing really the degree to which we deceive ourselves for months ive been telling myself that ive mourned and buried my sister in my heart but now confronted with a concrete act based on that assumption i want to scream denial the voice that emerges from my mouth sounds like a stunned fouryearolds but you dont know shes dead marc shakes his head how long are you going to wait before you accept it your fathers been dead almost thirty years and youre still looking for him i have to raise these kids and they cant wait that long its not right marc what is then they thought jane was out there suffering somewhere at the mercy of some bad person that she couldnt get away or find her way back home it was driving them crazy they couldnt do their schoolwork couldnt sleep couldnt eat all they did was sit at the window waiting for jane to come home i finally told them that god had taken mama to heaven to be with him she wasnt with any bad person she was with god and his angels how did you say she died they must have asked i told them she went to sleep and didnt wake up jesus what did they say did it hurt i cant even respond to this marcs face is resolute its for the best jordan and i dont want you saying anything to them about whats going on now the paintings the investigation none of it nothing to give them some crazy hope that she might come back because you know she wont those women are dead every one of them maybe its that i have no kids of my own maybe the daily demands of raising children simply cant be handled with a giant question mark hanging over everything i want you to be part of their lives marc says but you have to understand the ground rules in this family jane has passed away we had a memorial service for her what you never called me you were in asia no one knew where my agency could have found me i thought it would be less confusing if their mothers mirror image didnt suddenly fly in from parts unknown to be at her funeral i cant believe this suddenly a decision i made months ago seems like a bad one theres something i never told you marc i got a phone call eight months ago from thailand there was a lot of static and i could have been mistaken but i thought it might be jane what she said she needed help but that daddy couldnt help her then a man came on the phone and said something in french then in english he said its just a dream and hung up the phone and you thought that was jane calling from thailand i wasnt sure not at the time but now that ive found these paintings in hong kong i mean dont you think that puts it in a new light why didnt you tell me about this call before i didnt want to upset you when did the call come daytime or the middle of the night why because eight months ago was when you couldnt get out of bed wasnt it your little prescription vacation my anger flares but i press it down yes but i had the fbi check with the phone company i really did get a call from thailand in the middle of the night from a train station marc looks at me a bit longer then turns to a portrait of his parents on the wall they look wealthy and distant you do what you have to jordan thats what we all do but i dont want to know about it not unless you get positive evidence that jane or one of the other women is alive anything short of that is all pain no gain spoken like a true lawyer his cheeks color you think i dont miss her ive suffered more he stops takes a cell phone from his pocket and hits a speeddial number its me ill meet you at the door he hangs up and stands from the sofa im surprised youre letting me see them at all i told you i want you to be part of this family thats why i asked you to stay with us youre a great person and youre a terrific role model for lyn do you really believe that look lets forget the other stuff and concentrate on the kids the other stuff being his missing wife ill wait in here marc sighs and leaves the room the truth is i really dont know much about jane and marcs relationship jane liked to project an image of perfection they married young but marc wanted to postpone having children until hed put in the years of hundredhour weeks required for making partner that worried jane who wanted kids almost immediately more to cement the relationship i feared at the time than for the children themselves but when she finally got them she proved a wonderful mother creating the warm secure environment that she and i had never known the sound of the front door opening reaches me then subdued voices a society matrons cigaretteparched drawl rises above the others i just dont think its the proper thing to do theyve been through too much already the muted drone of marcs lawyer voice assures his mother that he knows exactly what hes doing then god help me comes the patter of small shoes on the hardwood floor followed by the percussive clack of marcs wing tips i feel more acute anxiety than i have waiting to meet heads of state the steps grow louder then stop but the doorway remains empty go ahead says marc from somewhere in the hall its okay nothing happens she brought presents he says in a singsong voice a small face appears from behind the door post lyns face a physical echo of my own with her large dark eyes she looks like a fawn peeking from behind a tree as her mouth falls open henrys blond hair and blue eyes appear above her henry blinks then disappears i smile as broadly as i can and hold out my arms lyn looks behind her presumably at her father then steps into the open and runs to me it takes a supreme effort to keep from crying as her little arms wrap around my neck like a drowning childs and she says mama mama in my ear i gently pull her back and look into her wet eyes im jordan sweetie im she knows says marc ushering henry toward me with his hands on the boys shoulders she said mama lyn do you know who this lady is she nods solemnly at me youre aunt jordan ive seen your pictures in books but you said mama you remind me of my mom shes gone to heaven to be with god i put my hand over my mouth to hold my composure and marc helps out by pushing henry forward this big guy here is henry aunt jordan i know that hello henry i got a firstplace trophy in soccer he announces you did you want to see it of course i do but i brought you a present would you like to see that first he looks back at his father for permission lets see it marc says i point to the wrapped package by the door are you big enough to open that henry yeah he practically attacks the package and in seconds exposes a hardcover booksized box that says panasonic its a dvd player dad look one for the car a little extravagant isnt it says marc arching an eyebrow at me thats a maiden aunts privilege looks that way lyn is standing quietly at my knee watching me she doesnt even ask if i got her anything and this is for you i tell her handing her the smaller box from the foot of the chair what is it look inside she carefully removes the bow and sets it aside and by this simple act breaks my heart again she learned that frugal habit from jane as jane learned it from our mother my sister lives on in ways large and small at last the box becomes visible and lyn studies it intently what is it lets see if you can figure it out can you read the box nick on nikon coolpix nineninezero perfect let me get it out for you i open the box remove the foam from the oddshaped plastic housing and hand it to her what do you think it is she studies the twopiece body then focuses on the small lens is it a camera yes her lips pucker in an unreadable expression is it a kids camera or a grownup camera its a grownup camera a very good one you have to be careful while you learn to use it wear the strap so you dont drop it but dont be too careful its only a tool whats important is your eyes and what you see in your head the camera just helps you show other people what you see do you understand she nods slowly her eyes bright dad cries henry theres two dvds in here iron giant and el dorado are you really spending the night with us tonight asks lyn i am will you teach me how to use this i sure will the pictures from this camera go into a computer before they go onto paper ill bet you have a computer my dad has one well just borrow his until he gets you your own right dad marc shakes his head but hes smiling right okay whos ready for supper did you actually cook are you kidding annabelle after thirty seconds or so the clicking of heels comes up the hallway followed by an elderly black womans voice what you hollerin about mr lacour hows supper coming almost ready annabelle appears in the doorway not heavy and slow like i pictured her but thin and tall and efficient she has a warm smile on her face until her eyes settle on me it fades instantly replaced by a mix of wonder and fear annabelle this is jordan says marc lord i see that she says softly child you the spittin image of she glances at the kids and trails off as though impelled against her will annabelle advances across the room until shes standing over me i reach up and take her hand and she squeezes mine with remarkable strength god bless you she says then she goes to henry and lyn bends nearly double gives each a hug and walks back to the door you can go on when suppers done marc says have a good night soon as i get the biscuits out the oven she says in a faraway voice ill be gone home when she disappears i say i didnt think they still made them like that youve been out of the south too long marc replies annabelles the best this family couldnt function without her i think you gave her a shock though by the time we reach the dining room the table is laden with food a pork loin with what smells like honeyandbrownsugar glaze cheese grits cathead biscuits and a token salad after months of asian food these smells from childhood nearly overwhelm my senses jane is everywhere around me she and i were raised knowing nothing of fine china so naturally she spent months deciding on the fine old royal doulton pattern that sits before me now same with the waterford crystal and reed amp barton silver it looks terrific doesnt it i tell henry here come sit by me lyn you sit on this side but your settings at the end of the table she says pointing id rather sit by you lyns smile could split the world she and henry take the chairs on either side of mine and we all dig in its surprising how quickly we fall into a natural rhythm of conversation and the only awkward moments come in the silences the children look at me as though theyve lost all sense of time and i know they are reliving hours spent at this table with their mother once even marcs eyes seem to glaze over as he slips into the same dimension the kids visit so much more easily i cant blame them thirteen months ago a divine hand reached into the norman rockwell painting of their life together and rubbed out the mother figure leaving a painful puzzling space now magically that space has been filled again by a woman who looks exactly like the one who was erased its getting close to bedtime marc says no the children cry in unison how about cutting them a little slack this first night marc looks like hes getting tired of my interference but he agrees we retire to the living room and i give lyn an introductory lesson on the digital nikon while henry loads el dorado into his portable dvd player lyn is deft with her hands and a proprietary glow of pride takes me by surprise after she shoots a few test shots i load them into marcs notebook computer the results are good and lyn practically bursts with pleasure marc tries again to get the kids to bed but they refuse crawling into my lap for me to argue their case i oblige and before long henry is zonked out and both my legs are asleep marc sits in a chair across the room his legs draped over an ottoman as he halfwatches a stock market report on cnbc so he doesnt notice when i look down and see lyn staring up at me her chin quivering what is it honey i whisper she closes her eyes tight squeezing out tears as she turns her face into my breast and sobs i miss my mama this time theres no stopping my tears i have never known a protective instinct as powerful as the one that suffuses me now not even when i was practically raising jane in oxford i would kill to protect these children but who can i kill to protect them from the loss of their mother all i can do is caress lyns forehead and reassure her about the future i know you do baby i do too but im here for you now think about happy times are you going to stay with us i sure am how long her eyes are wide and fragile as bubbles as long as you need me as long as it takes marc looks over at us his eyes suddenly alert whats the matter nothing a little hugging wont fix i tell him rocking lyn as best i can with henry weighing me down but what im hearing in my mind is the voice on the telephone eight months ago god let that have been jane i pray silently these children need more than i can ever give them a half hour later marc and i carry the kids to their beds theyve slept together since jane disappeared insisting on the room next to marcs rather than the larger but more isolated ones upstairs when we get back to the living room he opens a second bottle of wine and we methodically drink most of it while reminiscing about jane marc wasnt lying when he said he missed her as he drains the last of the bottle his eyes mist over i know you think im a bastard for telling them shes dead im just trying to make things as easy on them as i can i give him a conciliatory nod now that i see them i understand better why you did what you did but what will you do if it turns out youre wrong he snorts you dont really think those women are alive do you i honestly dont know i had convinced myself that jane was dead but now i wont give up until i see her body just like with your father he mumbles you never give up i wish you wouldnt either in your heart at least my heart he gestures toward his chest with the goblet and wine sloshes onto his shirt for the last thirteen months my life has been shit if it werent for those kids i might not even be here marc i know i know selfpitying slob thats not what i was thinking hes not listening anymore he has covered his eyes and begun sobbing alcohol and depression definitely dont mix i feel a little awkward but i get up walk over to him and lay my hand on his shoulder i know its hard ive had a tough time myself he shakes his head violently as though to deny the tears then sits up and wipes his face on his shirtsleeve goddamn it im sorry i got like this i sit on the ottoman and put my hands on his shoulders hey youve been through one of the worst things anyone can go through youre allowed his bloodshot eyes seek out mine i just cant seem to get it together maybe you need a break have you taken a vacation since it happened no work helps me deal with it maybe work helps you not deal with it have you thought of that he laughs like he doesnt need or appreciate amateur psychology privileged men are masters of ironic distance im just glad you came he says i cant believe how the kids responded to you i cant believe how i responded to them i almost feel like theyre mine i know his smile vanishes just thanks for coming he leans forward and embraces me the hug does me good too i must admit i havent had many these past months but suddenly a current of shock shoots through me theres something moist against my neck hes kissing my neck and theres nothing brotherly about it i go stiff in spite of my desire not to overreact marc he takes his lips away but before i can gather my thoughts hes kissing my mouth i jerk back and put my hands on his arms to restrain him his eyes plead silently with me you dont know what its been like without her its not the same for you i cant even make myself look at another woman all i see is jane but watching you tonight at the table with the kids you almost are her im not jane i know that but if i let my mind drift just a little its like you are you even feel like her he pulls his arms free and squeezes my hands your hands are the same your eyes your breasts everything his blue eyes fix mine with a monks intensity do you know what it would mean to me to have one night with you just one night it would be like jane had come back it would stop i hiss afraid the children will wake do you hear yourself im not jane and i cant pretend to be not to ease your grief not for the kids and especially not in your bed in her bed my god he looks at the floor then back up at me and his eyes shine with an unpleasant light it wouldnt be the first time you pretended to be her would it its as though he flushed liquid nitrogen through my veins i am speechless unable to move only when he squeezes my hands do i yank them away in reflex what are you talking about he smirks like a little boy with a secret you know without knowing how i got there i find myself standing three feet away from him with my arms crossed over my breasts im leaving im going to stay at a hotel tell the kids ill be back during the day he blinks then seems to come to his senses a bit or at least to feel some sense of shame dont do that i didnt mean to upset you youre just so damn beautiful he stumbles over the ottoman as he comes toward me my instinct is to jump forward and help him but i dont i dont want things to get any worse than they already are im going upstairs to get my bags you stay here while i do it dont be melodramatic you dont have anything to worry about i mean it marc without waiting for a reply i run up the stairs and grab my suitcase thanking god i didnt unpack yet when i go back down hes waiting at the foot of the stairs what am i supposed to tell the kids he asks dont you dare use them against me like that tell them i got called away to a photo shoot ill be back to see them i just wont be spending the night he looks penitent now but the sense of entitlement i heard in his voice only moments ago still haunts me before he sinks into drunken apologies i push past him and leave without a word as i hit the sidewalk a car door opens a few yards away and a dark figure floats onto the sidewalk jordan says a female voice whats the matter im fine wendy im just staying elsewhere what happened my joke to kaiser about wendy making a pass at me comes back to me like instant karma someone made a pass tonight all right but i could never have imagined it would come from my sisters husband men problems i murmur gotcha where are we going a hotel i guess she takes my suitcase and starts toward the mustang then pauses um look i dont know how you feel about hotels but ive got an extra bedroom at my apartment ive got to stay with you no matter where you go so you know its up to you but that way wed have food and coffee toiletries whatever you need there have been nights i would have killed for a hotel room ive slept in shell craters and been grateful for them but tonight i dont want a sterile empty place i want real things around me a humanly messy kitchen and cds and a crocheted comforter on the couch i hope wendy isnt a compulsive cleaner that sounds great lets go im about to start the mustang when a soft beeping sounds in it whats that i ask looking around in confusion cell phone she announces a nokia i recognize the ring we use some at the office oh i grab my fanny pack from the backseat unzip it and remove the phone kaiser gave me back at the fbi office hello ms glass daniel baxter whats up ive been negotiating with monsieur de becque of the cayman islands and he says you can go on our plane and you can bring one assistant to help with lighting et cetera great when do i leave tomorrow a few of us have spent the last half hour arguing over who your assistant should be im backing a member of the hostage rescue team if things take a nasty turn hed have the best chance of getting you out of there alive is someone arguing with your choice agent kaiser has a different opinion i smile to myself who does the sheriff want to send baxters hand covers the mouthpiece but despite his effort i hear him say she just called you the sheriff when the isu chief removes his hand he says the sheriff doesnt want to send anybody he wants to go himself you should let him go then is that who you want absolutely i feel safer already okay youll probably leave tomorrow afternoon ill call you in the morning to give you the travel details ill talk to you then and wendys taking good care of me good see you tomorrow whats happening wendy asks after i hang up im going to the cayman islands oh she shifts in her seat what was that about a sheriff a joke i was talking about kaiser she guessed as much hes going with you it looks that way for security she looks out her window lucky you she says finally the eternal plight of women a minute ago we were fast friends now shed like to revoke her offer to share her apartment but her manners are far too good for that id like to reassure agent wendy that she has nothing to worry about but i dont want to insult her intelligence i start the engine and pull into st charles avenue give me some directions its time to get some sleep straight she says ill tell you where to turn i start down the treelined avenue the streetcar tracks gleaming silver under the lights as the mustang swallows them the leaves on the trees look gray but only a small part of my brain registers this the rest is rerunning marc lacours remark again and again it wouldnt be the first time you pretended to be her would it and then dr lenzs voice out of the dark whats the worst thing youve ever done if only you could plead the fifth with your conscience most flights to the cayman islands stage out of houston or miami but with the fbi lear things are simpler its kaiser me and two pilots up front for the twohour run from new orleans to grand cayman largest of the three islands that make up the british colony the last time i made this flight my knuckles were white for half the journey i was covering the air convoy that american pilots take to the caymans for the annual air show there one highlight of which is the provocative overflight of communist cuba fifteen years ago this was no joke and im happy to be cruising along with nothing more to worry about than a seventyyearold frenchman who for some unknown reason has requested my presence weve been in the air for an hour and kaiser is uncharacteristically quiet i dont suppose theres much to say or perhaps im radiating enough hostility to discourage conversation i can still feel my brotherinlaws lips against my neck and the emotional fallout is hard to shake most difficult of all is the remark marc made as i rebuffed him it wouldnt be the first time you pretended to be her would it id hoped that particular chapter of my life was shared only by my sister but apparently i hoped for too much the fact that jane told her husband about it reveals a piercing truth she never really believed my side of the story whats the worst thing youve ever done dr lenz used to ask his patients a simple but devastating question and the other one what was it whats the worst thing that ever happened to you several terrible things have happened to me none of which i want to dwell on now but in making choices about my behavior i havent often gone against the dictates of my conscience on the most painful occasion when i did i was eighteen years old its almost embarrassing that twentytwo years of posthigh school living havent given me some greater claim to infamy but the journey through adolescence is one of the hardest we ever make and the wounds sustained along the way last a lifetime years of simmering tension between my sister and me came to a boiling point during our senior year just weeks before my affair with david gresham became the sensation of the school jane was riding her high horse chattering endlessly about how she was going to be a chiomega the next year and asking why i didnt get my act together fix up a little and try to be halfway normal whatever that meant to her when i wasnt worrying about how i was going to pay her expenses at ole miss i was shooting portraits in my tiny studio or sneaking through the woods to my history teachers house looking back on it i was like a ghost silent during classes vanishing after school skipping pep rallies and ball games never going to high school hangouts jane suspected i was involved with someone but i had no idea of the shape of her suspicions one day during an argument over something stupid i realized she thought i was gay that i was slipping off at all hours to meet a woman it was funny really but when i treated it as such she started screaming about how strange i was how i was ruining her chance to become a chio and have a normal life i told her that her idea of a normal life wasnt anything to aspire to i also told her i wasnt gay and that i knew more about men than she ever would she smirked in a superior way that dismissed me completely i said if circumstances had been slightly different it could be me dating bobby evans her wealthy boyfriend of three years and her doing the work that paid the light bill she looked at me incredulously and said bobby and you together youve got to be kidding and then she laughed for some reason that really cut me to the quick why not i asked because youre so weird she said looking at me with pity i understood then that she saw me exactly as others did as some sort of selfexiled outcast all id done to keep our family together she simply took as her due two days later i got home from school and found a note taped to janes window it was from her boyfriend and it said to meet him that afternoon in the woods behind the coliseum i threw away the note put my hair up in a ponytail slipped on a pair of janes earrings and one of her precious lacoste sweaters and rode her bike down to the woods bobby evans was waiting there in his letter jacket he looked a like a young robert redford standing there though his iq left a bit to be desired i played jane to perfection wed been impersonating each other since we were babies it was easy why did i do it i wanted to know what lay behind that smirk shed given me and i suppose i was jealous of her in my own way the road of the nonconformist is a lonely one and id been walking it for a long time bobby evans was one of the rewards for being a good girl which meant following every hypocritical southern folkway and more with the rigidity of a victorian virgin as we talked bobby steered us over into the trees and i realized this was a ritual of theirs he kissed me in the shadows first delicately then with passion it was typical high school stuff or what i imagined that to be anyway all rushed and breathless and intense him crushing my breasts from outside my sweater and pressing his pelvis against mine very different from my experiences with david gresham when i let him put his hand inside her sweater i could tell that was as far as they ever went the way he slowly lowered his hand toward my waistband told me that he was waiting for a no a not yet or an i want to but we just cant i didnt say any of those things a few minutes of touching me there was more than he could handle afterward he sat down at my feet too embarrassed to look at me and stared down at the ground it was like someone had finally given him the keys to paradise he asked why i had let him to that and i said id just decided that today was the day it was getting dark by then he looked up like a puppy and said do you have to go back now i said the only person who would notice i was late was jordan and who cared about her he laughed this time when he touched me i touched back im not sure why id already gotten whatever petty revenge i wanted against jane it was a hormonal thing by that point i think i was eighteen and experienced he was eighteen and goodlooking and things took their natural course when we were half undressed i almost stopped pretending there didnt seem much point anymore and i didnt want him thinking he had deflowered jane but i couldnt bring myself to tell him the truth i kept my blouse on to hide the arm where jane had her scars and kept my mouth over his to keep from talking once he was inside me he did the opposite of what i expected he didnt close his eyes and flail away he went very slowly and looked right into my eyes pure rapture on his face part of that i realized was his belief that the girl he had put on a pedestal for three years was finally giving herself totally to him i wanted to stop then but there was no graceful way to do it instead i tried to make it end faster as i did he looked down with a strange light in his eyes and said youre not jane are you it was the most chilling moment of my life he knew if he hadnt he wouldnt have risked saying that no i said terrified that he would jump up and start screaming to the trees that i was a slut i should have known better i learned a lesson about men that day there was hardly a hitch in his rhythm his eyes got bigger he groaned in ecstasy and enjoyed it twice as much it was the biggest ego trip of his young life and i was a fool to think for an instant that he would be able to keep quiet about it he didnt tell his friends which would have been bad enough he did something infinitely worse the next time he was with jane he acted as though she had made love with him the last time they were together and insisted that she do it again she flew into a rage and demanded an explanation and he let her figure it out for herself she didnt speak more than ten words a month to me for three years afterward i tried to explain why id done it and what had really happened but it was useless for jane to accept the truth about bobbys actions would have made the betrayal complete and thus unbearable two months later my relationship with david gresham went public and i left for new orleans the obvious rancor slowly faded bobby evans was consigned to the past with the other trappings of high school he now sells residential real estate in oxford i continued to help jane financially until her junior year of college when she found some other source of money i next saw her at her wedding though i was not invited to be maid of honor that office went to marc lacours sister but in the twenty years since we slowly but surely made overtures that bridged the chasm that once divided us in the three years before she disappeared we were closer than at any time in our lives thanks to janes efforts more than mine and i came to believe that the bond we shared formed in the face of paternal abandonment and maternal incapacity was stronger than a break over any man and perhaps it was perhaps she revealed my betrayal in the early days of her marriage to marc looking back now its easy to see janes entire life as a flight from the family fate had handed her all her efforts to reach out to join to belong to the cheerleaders school clubs church groups sororities all seemed part of a desperate attempt to find a surrogate family to become part of the brady bunch perfection so prevalent on the television of our youth which our home environment resembled not at all in that context my oneday fling with bobby evans was no simple sexual betrayal it was an arrow in the heart of janes illusions of progress and since our illusions are always our most precious possessions how could she ever forgive me but the final terrible irony of her life was worse having succeeded in her impossible quest having attained a rich and handsome husband a mansion and two beautiful children all the hallmarks of gentility and security she was plucked from the heart of her fantasy by some tortured soul undoubtedly born into a family even more dysfunctional than ours if jane is dead i cannot imagine what her last thoughts must have been if shes alive are you sleeping i blink from my trance and look across the narrow aisle at john kaiser who is studying me with a worried gaze hes wearing navy slacks a polo shirt and a tan suede jacket that perfectly fits his shoulders i dressed for this trip myself in tailored black silk pants and a matching jacket with a linen blouse cut low enough to reveal a swell of cleavage a kinky old frenchman might just respond to some tasteful decolletage hey he says you in a trance no just thinking what about we dont know each other well enough for you to ask that question he gives me a tight smile youre right sorry i straighten up in my seat you probably have some grand plan for this meeting right a strategy nope doctor lenz would have one but i go on instinct a lot of the time were going to play it by ear you must have some idea about what de becque wants with me either de becques been behind this whole thing from day one every disappearance or its some sort of diversion for him a rich mans game if its a game i figure he knows youre a double for one of the sleeping women maybe he saw janes portrait when wingate put it up for sale then when he heard about what happened in hong kong a twin of one of the sleeping women showing up he put two and two together but how unless he had prior knowledge how could he make the leap from one of the faces on the paintings in hong kong to me to knowing my name youre a celebrity of sorts if he had a print of janes painting he could have scanned it and emailed it around asked if anyone recognized you there are no prints of the sleeping women wingate told me no photos nothing then maybe someone in hong kong recognized you knew you were in town i wasnt there on assignment im doing a book i go where i want and only a few friends ever know where i am then maybe he did have prior knowledge if thats the case were walking into something complicated like kaiser bites his lip and looks at the seat back ahead of him what is it i wasnt going to say anything before the meeting but this might help prepare you for what we could encounter what the vietnam connections are starting to bother me how so your father disappeared in vietnam in right on the cambodian border same thing and de becque lived in vietnam for years and the sleeping women are sold exclusively in the east and your mystery call came from thailand which is practically next door to vietnam i did randr there myself in catch any embarrassing diseases no but not for lack of trying how could vietnam play into this i dont know but the coincidences are starting to build you thought you might have heard your fathers voice during that thailand phone call right a strange and disturbing buzz has started in the back of my head what are you saying agent kaiser im just pulling threads together are you suggesting my father could have taken jane and the others too you believe hes still alive right im the only person who does but even if he is he wouldnt wouldnt what go on say it if hes still alive he wouldnt take jane to be with him right he would take you i guess thats what i was thinking hoping but how could that even be possible hed have to be in the us theres a plane every day if he is alive you have to accept two things one hes chosen not to contact you for almost thirty years two you know nothing about him other than what a twelveyearold girl knew about her young father i cant believe what youre suggesting my father was an awardwinning photojournalist what motive could he possibly have to get involved in some sick situation like this kaiser sighs and lays his hands on his knees look all this is speculation its almost certain that your fathers dead i know that though i feel an irrational anger toward kaiser in this moment i cant dismiss his ideas but im sitting here trying to remember if my father ever painted anything he watches me for a few moments did he no only photography good because the connoisseurs studying the sleeping women say they were painted by someone with enormous ability and classical training thank god how old was your father when he disappeared thirtysix and hed never painted anything id say that lets him off the hook right there i nod agreement but new fears arent so easily banished the vietnam coincidences are indeed starting to build and the image of a conspiracy has been taking shape almost from the beginning what ties the sleeping women to asia theres really no use trying to puzzle it out now but perhaps marcel de becque the colonial french tea planter and black market trader can shed some light on the question grand cayman lies miles south of cuba fifteen years ago it was an unspoiled paradise now its not much different from cancun heavily commercialized and functionally americanized though it is more upscale parts of the island are still undeveloped but to get the flavor of the old caymans you have to fly a puddlejumper east to the smaller more primitive island of cayman brac our fbi pilot swings once around north bay to show us de becques estate a gated compound that stands on a jutting point of land near the marina the frenchman is apparently unconcerned with keeping a low profile or he would have settled in the more discreet community of cayman kai near rum point looking down at the emerald water white beaches and stunning homes i expect to hear the voice of robin leach in my ear but instead i hear our pilot instructing us to belt in for landing at the airport near georgetown a white range rover awaits us on the runway and the small matter of customs has been taken care of in advance by the justice department the british governor of the islands knows we are here and should anything questionable happen during our stay there will be no doubt as to who was at fault a caucasian driver and his caymanian associate load my camera and lighting equipment into the back of the rover and after leaving the airport we swing northward how far to monsieur de becques estate i ask a few minutes the driver replies in a french accent kaiser says nothing in the caymans as in the united kingdom all traffic proceeds on the left every few seconds our driver wheels into the right lane to pass colorful jeeps vans and scooters all driving at a leisurely vacation speed mixed with the tourist vehicles is a healthy contingent of mercedeses and bmws the cayman islands have been wealthy ever since king george iii absolved their citizens from taxation for their heroism during the tragic wreck of the ten sails this status along with airtight banking secrecy laws has made the caymans an international tax haven and the fifthlargest financial center in the world unlike the rest of the caribbean where beggars can be a nuisance the caymans boast natives richer than many tourists a high wall surrounds de becques estate but when our driver opens an iron gate with a coded remote i see a larger version of what i saw from the air a british colonial mansion that like some embassies gives the impression of a fortress the driver pulls the rover into a crescent drive and stops before wide marble steps his assistant gets out opens our doors then motions us upward the massive door opens before we ring the bell and i find myself facing one of the most beautiful women i have ever seen with fine black hair lightbrown skin and almond eyes she possesses that rare combination of asian and european features that makes it impossible for me to guess her age she could be thirty or fifty and her selfpossession is remarkable she stands utterly still and gives the impression that she could remain so for an hour or a day its almost a surprise when she speaks bonjour mademoiselle glass hello i am li please come in i step inside followed by kaiser who with the driver brings in the aluminum flight cases after they set them down in the granitefloored foyer li says i must ask that you leave any weapons with these gentlemen she says this as easily as another hostess would ask for our coats im not armed says kaiser me either please forgive this imposition the drivers caymanian assistant walks in with a black wand and sweeps it over the length of kaisers body then he scans mine and nods to li who smiles at us if you will follow me sil vous plait your equipment will be taken to the proper room kaiser shrugs and follows the softspoken apparition our journey through de becques mansion is an education in understated elegance theres a zenlike simplicity to the spaces and to the furniture that adorns them all lighting is indirect and the few visible beams fall upon paintings spaced at tasteful intervals i dont know enough about art to recognize the works but i have a feeling that someone who knew what she was looking at would be suitably shocked our destination is a large highceilinged room with a massive wall of glass facing the harbor its furnished with pieces of southeast asian provenance but the theme isnt overdone beyond the glass wall lies an infinity lap pool one of those indigo things which seems to bleed right into the sea beyond it in the distance a dozen boats ply the waters of north bay and as i watch them i realize a man is standing at the lower right edge of the glass watching me i didnt notice him at first because he stands with the same stillness and selfpossession exhibited by the woman who met us at the door of medium height and deeply tanned he has piercing blue eyes and a full head of closecropped silver hair bonjour he says in a soft but masculine voice i am marcel de becque i was just recalling happier days i trust your trip was not too bumpy it was fine he walks forward and before i know what hes doing takes my hand bends and kisses it with courtly grace you are far more beautiful in person ma cherie i thank you for coming despite the strangeness of the situation i feel my face flush this is my assistant john kaiser de becque smiles in a way that lets us know he will play along with this fiction but also that he recognizes it as such then he waves his hand toward the wall to my right which holds a large display of blackandwhite photographs most of them appear to date from various phases of the vietnam war and each is clearly the work of a master photographer do you like them de becque asks theyre remarkable where did you get them i knew many journalists during the war many photographers as well they were kind enough to give me prints from time to time not all the photos are of military subjects several are studies of vietnamese men women or children others show temples and statuary still others groups of khakiclad men with the stateless look of war correspondents on closer inspection i recognize several photographers sean flynn dixie reese dana stone larry burrows the best of the best capa is there too the archetype of them all his rakish grin giving him a youthful glow even in middle age as i move to the next photo my blood goes cold in my veins standing alone by a stone buddha is my father jonathan glass unable to find my voice i lean closer to the photograph on the french expatriates wall my father is wearing a leica on a neck strap and carrying a nikon f in his hand the same camera i own today that means the photo was shot in the year that camera was released and also the year he supposedly died where did you get this i finally whisper pointing with a shaking finger terry reynolds shot that in seventytwo says de becque before he himself disappeared in cambodia i knew your father well jordan he says my name with a soft j i straighten up and try to maintain my composure as i speak you did de becque takes me by the elbow and leads me to a table where a bottle of wine and three glasses have been placed he pours a glass of white wine which i drink in two swallows then offers one to kaiser who declines de becque pours for himself and takes a small sip only in moderation he says my liver is trying to tell me something monsieur he stops me with an upraised hand im sure you have a thousand questions why dont you photograph my paintings first then you may return here and satisfy your curiosity my face feels hot my throat unable to open please says de becque there is time tell me one thing first is my sister alive or dead he shakes his head je ne sais pas ma cherie that i do not know photographing de becques paintings is a simple exercise technically speaking before we left new orleans i made a list of equipment which baxter sent fbi agents out to procure the main piece was a mamiya mediumformat camera shooting x film negatives which gives superior image quality without compromising portability the difficulty is the human factor kaiser does his best to follow my orders in setting up the lighting but its clear to li whom de becque sent along to make sure we dont get too close to the canvases that my assistant has never handled a softbox or barn door in his life im not in top form myself the prospect of picking de becques brain about my father is so tantalizing that it pushes my concern for jane almost out of my mind and makes the simplest tasks like attaching strobe heads to poles difficult kaiser is soon distracted by other things the bulk of de becques art collection is displayed in three large museumstyle rooms and his sleeping women are merely part of it the rest date from several different periods according to kaiser who has apparently given himself a crash course in art history over the past two days the majority date from about to the present and include several pieces by the nabis kaiser moves methodically through the rooms memorizing what he can once returning to me to whisper that some of the paintings might have been stolen by the nazis during the second world war he asks li if we can photograph the entire collection but she demurs saying that de becque specifically restricted our activities to the sleeping women i shoot the paintings with a thoroughness bordering on compulsion but i try not to look too hard at them in one sense each of these women is jane to me yet theres no denying their remarkable power unlike the painting i saw in wingates gallery the women in these canvases are saturated in color rather than surrounded by it vivid blues and oranges highlighted with whites and yellows two are lying in bathtubs posed much like the woman in the first painting i saw in hong kong but their faces are less defined than hers if i didnt know these women might be dead i would believe them asleep for their skin fairly hums with light but i do know the man who painted these images sat or stood before petrified human beings absorbing the hard metallic odor unique to sweat produced by terror unless the women were already dead when he painted them how long could he have stood that staying in the room with dead women while they decomposed ive photographed a lot of corpses and close proximity with them isnt something easily endured but perhaps for some people its no hardship perhaps for some its actually pleasurable though after a while even a necrophiliac would have to be driven off by the smell alone or is even that a naive assumption how long would it take to paint these i ask kaiser sotto voce experts say two to six days i dont know what theyre basing that on i read in a book last night that the impressionists believed you should start and finish a painting at one sitting if the women are dead do you think he could be preserving them somehow before painting them embalming them its possible i fire off two more shots of the last painting look at this picture what do you see is this woman dead or alive he walks closer to the canvas and studies the woman i cant tell he says at length theres nothing obvious that says death to me her eyes are closed but thats not conclusive he turns back to me his face thoughtful i mean wheres the line between sleep and death how far apart are they really ask the dead i cant theres your answer i cap the mamiyas lens and remove the last exposed film im done lets go see de becque li appears silently in the archway to my left like an escort to some other world the old frenchman is waiting in the glasswalled room he stands with his back to us a wineglass in his hand and watches a yacht sail out of the bay into the caribbean hello i call he turns slowly then gestures toward a matched pair of sofas that face each other before the great window li pours wine for us then vanishes without even a sound of slippers on the granite floor you wish your assistant to join us de becque asks one eyebrow arched i turn to kaiser who sighs and says im special agent john kaiser fbi de becque walks forward and gives kaisers hand a light shake isnt that a relief deception is a wearying art and foolish deception the most wearying of all please sit kaiser and i take one sofa de becque the one facing us why have i brought you here the frenchman says to me that is question number one thats a good place to start youre here because i wanted to see you in the flesh as they say its that simple i knew your father in vietnam when i learned you were involved in this case i took steps to meet you how did you learn ms glass was involved asks kaiser de becque makes a very french gesture with his opened hands which i translate as some things we must accept without explanation kaiser doesnt like it but theres not much he can do about it how did you meet my father i collect art and i consider photography an art at least when performed by certain people i owned a tea plantation in a strategic part of vietnam it provided a good base for those journalists whom i allowed to use it my table was famed throughout the country and i enjoy good conversation and access to information kaiser asks bluntly de becque shrugs information is a commodity agent kaiser like any other and i am a businessman what do you know about my fathers death im not at all sure he died when and where the world believes he did there it is spoken by a man in a position to know how could he have survived first he disappeared in a very embarrassing place embarrassing for the american government i mean second while the khmer rouge generally killed journalists out of hand not all cambodians did i believe jonathan was shot yes but he could well have been nursed back to health and like you ive heard reports over the years that he has been sighted if he survived says kaiser and he considered you a friend why wouldnt he seek you out he may have but i had sold my plantation by the time he went missing if he went there in search of me he would not have found me but theres a simpler answer by late vietnam was not a place anyone would want to return to neither was cambodia i point out if he didnt get out before pol pot started his genocide he couldnt possibly have survived another shrug it is a mystery but ive heard jonathan was twice sighted in thailand and by reliable sources do you think he could still be alive a smile of condolence that would be too much to hope for i think how recent were the sightings you mentioned the first around the last in more than twenty years ago were here for another reason of course but would it be all right for me to telephone you later for specifics ill make sure you have my numbers before you go kaiser leans forward his wineglass between his knees id like to ask you a few questions of course but i may be selective about my answers do you know the identity of the artist who paints the sleeping women i do not how did his paintings first come to your attention i was acquainted with christopher wingate the art dealer im in the habit of buying new artists whose work catches my eye its a risk but all life entails risk no is this purely a business endeavor de becques eyes shine with humor it has no connection whatever to business if i wanted to make money there are much surer ways so wingate introduced you to the sleeping women and i told him i would buy all he could get me and he got you five yes i made the mistake of letting certain asian acquaintances see my paintings the price skyrocketed overnight after the fifth wingate betrayed me and began selling to the japanese but de becque turns up his hands who expects honor from a serb what initially attracted you to the paintings the frenchman purses his lips hard to say did you have any idea that the subjects might be real women i assumed they were models of course did you have any idea that they might be dead not at first i assumed the poses were of sleep as everyone else did but after i saw the fourth i began to get a feeling then i saw the genius of these paintings they were paintings of death but not in any way that had been done before how do you mean in the west the attitude toward death is denial the west worships youth lives in terror of age and disease most of all in terror of death in the east its different you know you were there this statement throws kaiser off his rhythm how do you know that youre a soldier i saw it when you first came in i havent been a soldier for twentyfive years de becque smiles and waves his hand i see it in your walk your way of watching and since youre american your age tells me vietnam i was there so you know how it is in america someone gets bitten by a rattlesnake they move heaven and earth to race to the hospital in vietnam a man gets bitten by a krait he sits down and waits to die death is part of life in the east for many its a sweet release that is part of what i see in the sleeping women only the subjects arent asian theyre occidental thats interesting says kaiser no ones mentioned that interpretation before de becque touches the corner of his eye everyone has eyes young man not everyone can see you know that at least one of the subjects in the paintings is missing and probably dead yes this poor girls sister how do you feel about that im not sure i understand the question morally i mean how do you feel about the fact that young women may be dying to produce these paintings de becque gives kaiser a look of distaste is that a serious question mon ami yes such an american question you fought in a war that cost fiftyeight thousand of your countrymens lives a million asian lives beyond that what did those deaths buy other than misery thats a separate discussion youre wrong if nineteen women die to produce eternal art then in the historical sense the price was cheap laughable really unless you loved one of those women i say quietly quite so concedes de becque thats another matter entirely i merely point out to monsieur kaiser that many human endeavors are begun with the knowledge that they will cost human lives bridges tunnels pharmaceutical trials geographic exploration and of course wars none of these goals even approaches the importance of art kaisers face is reddening if you knew for a fact that women were being murdered to produce these paintings and you knew the identity of the murderer would you report him to the authorities happily i do not find myself in that dilemma kaiser sighs and puts down his wine why wouldnt you send your paintings to washington for study i am a fugitive i dont trust governments particularly the american government i had many dealings with it in indochina and i was always disappointed i found american officials naive sentimental hypocritical and stupid thats something coming from a black marketeer de becque laughs you hate me young soldier for the black market you might as well hate rainfall or cockroaches im no fan of the french thats for sure i saw what you did in vietnam you were a lot worse there than we ever were we were brutal yes but on a small scale the american infantry handed out chocolate bars while their air force killed civilians by the tens of thousands you were glad enough when we did it in germany this isnt getting us anywhere i cut in giving kaiser a sharp look after years of traveling the world ive learned to avoid conversations like this one most europeans will never understand the american point of view and even when they do theyll loudly condemn it at the bottom of their fervor i believe lies jealousy but theres nothing to be gained by arguing with them i would have thought kaiser knew that youve seen me in the flesh now i tell de becque what do you think his blue eyes twinkle like maurice chevaliers i would love to see you au naturel cherie youre a work of art would naked be enough or would naked and dead be better dont be ridiculous i am a libertine i celebrate life but he holds up his glass in a silent toast death is always with us did you commission the painting of my sister his humor vanishes no did you try to buy it i never had the chance i never saw it would you have known who she was i would have thought she was you kaiser says when did you first become aware of ms glasss existence when i saw her name beneath a photo in the international herald tribune the early s it would have been de becque chuckles i nearly jumped out of my skin the credit read j glass same as her fathers i did that as an homage to him and a fine one it was but a bit of a shock to those who knew him that happened to a lot of people after a few years i started using my full name unable to focus on the task at hand i steel myself and ask de becque the question foremost in my mind what kind of man was my father in the beginning a wideeyed american like a thousand others but he had eyes to see you only had to tell him a thing once he had tasted little of asia but he was open to it all and the vietnamese loved him i presume that included women another gallic gesture this one i translate as men will be men was there one woman in particular isnt there always but in jons case i dont really know dont you did he have a family over there monsieur de becque a vietnamese family how would you feel if he did im not sure i just want to know the truth you saw li yes shes frenchvietnamese theyre the most beautiful women in the world did my father have a woman like her he was certainly exposed to them at your plantation of course de becque is a man who speaks between the lines im normally good at reading such men but in this case im lost if my father had a vietnamese family there why not tell me outright have you considered this asks de becque the year your father disappeared look and life folded and they were the great picture magazines that was the end of an era jonathan never had to live through shrinking markets the dominance of television the humiliating transformation of the industry in which he made his name are you saying he had nothing to come back to i merely point out that professionally speaking the best years of photojournalism were in the past jon had won all the awards there were to win he had experienced life on the razors edge with a rebel band of brothers they photographed the horrors of the century then moved on to the next before the last could crush their spirits they were glorious in their way they owned nothing yet they owned the world they were a cross between young hemingways and rockandroll stars but their day was over thats what youre telling me the world changed after vietnam america changed france too kaiser puts down his wine and says id like to return to ms glasss sister i would as well says de becque his eyes on me what exactly do you hope to gain by being part of this investigation jordan do you have some fantasy of justice i dont think justice is a fantasy what would justice be in this case to punish the man who has painted these women the man who stole them from their homes to immortalize them is he one and the same i ask is the kidnapper the painter i have no idea but is that your desire to punish him id rather stop him than punish him de becque nods thoughtfully and your sister what are your hopes along that line im not sure do you think she might be alive somewhere i didnt until i saw her painting in hong kong now im not sure when de becque makes no comment i ask do you think the women are alive or dead the frenchman sighs dead i would say for some reason his opinion depresses me far more than that of someone like lenz but he adds i would not assume all these women share the same fate why not asks kaiser things happen no plan is perfect i wouldnt think it absurd to hope one or more out of nineteen is alive somewhere is it nineteen women kaiser asks weve been trying to match the paintings to the victims but were having trouble there are only eleven victims in new orleans if each painting is of a different woman then there are eight victims we dont know about perhaps those seven are simply common models de becque suggests paid off long ago and forgotten have you thought of that wed like that to be true of course but the abstract nature of the early paintings has made it impossible for us to match the faces to victims we havent even matched them to the eleven known victims yet the early paintings arent abstract says de becque they were done in the impressionist or postimpressionist style this involves using small drops of primary colors in close proximity to produce certain hues rather than blending colors it produces an effect much closer to the way the human eye actually perceives light he probably painted them very quickly and merely meant to suggest their faces rather than to clearly depict them or he may have meant to conceal their faces says kaiser this also is possible if any of these women are still alive i ask where could they possibly be why wouldnt they have come forward by now the world is very wide cherie and full of people with strange appetites im more concerned with you i think this is an unstable time for the man painting these pictures de becques eyes burn into mine i also think your involvement with the fbi may bring you to his attention i would not have anything happen to you shell be protected says kaiser good intentions arent enough monsieur she should consider staying here with me until this thing is over what i ask you would be free to come and go of course but here i can protect you i havent much confidence in the fbi to be frank i appreciate your concern monsieur but i want to remain part of the effort to stop this man then take a word of advice be very careful these paintings show an artist in search of himself his early work is confused and derivative important only for what it led to the recent paintings give us a certain view of death where is this man going no one knows but i would not like to see you come up for auction anytime soon if i do buy me id rather hang here than in hong kong a white smile cracks the frenchmans tanned face i would top any price cherie you have my word upon it de becque stands suddenly and looks through his great glass window at the bay i have photographed several prominent prisoners in my life and something in the frenchmans stance throws me back to those occasions here in his multimilliondollar mansion with a fortune in art hanging on his walls this expatriate shares something with the poorest convict pacing out a cell in angola or parchman i think its time to go i tell kaiser i wait for de becque to turn back to me but he doesnt as i walk to the door he says in a melancholy voice despite what your friend says jordan remember this the french know the meaning of loyalty ill remember li will show you out merci at last de becque turns to me and raises a hand in farewell in his eyes i see genuine affection and im suddenly sure he knew my father far better than he claimed your numbers i call i never got them theyre waiting in your plane of course they are the range rover hums steadily toward the airport bright sunlight glints off the hood and the road signs chasing a blue iguana beneath a green roadside bush as the reptile vanishes the sleeping women i saw in de becques gallery flash through my mind and a minor epiphany sends a chill along my skin i just realized something important before i can continue kaiser grips my thigh behind the knee and nearly cuts off the circulation to my lower leg i remain silent until we reach the plane where our escorts load the equipment cases for us then vanish without a word what is it asks kaiser what did you think of the paintings i know where theyre being done what not exactly where but how i told you i dont know anything about art but i do know about light light those women are being painted in natural light its so obvious that i didnt notice it in hong kong not even today not at first but a minute ago it registered why how can you tell twentyfive years of experience light is very important to color to the natural look of things photographic lights are colorbalanced to mimic natural light ill bet artists are even pickier about it i dont know how important that is to the case but doesnt it tell us something if youre right it could help a lot is light shining through a window natural light that depends on the glass if hes painting the women outdoors that would mean a really secluded place theres lots of woods and swamp but getting there with a prisoner or body could be tough a courtyard i tell him new orleans is full of walled gardens and courtyards i think thats what were looking for kaiser squeezes my upper arm youd have done well at quantico lets get on board i dont move you know you werent very helpful back there what was all that crap about france he shrugs you dont learn anything about a man in a short time by having a polite conversation with him you push buttons and see what pops out de becque just wanted to stroll down memory lane no it was more than that tell me lets get on board first he hustles me onto the lear then goes forward to confer with the pilots after a moment he walks back to my seat ive got to call baxter it may take a while tell me about de becque first he was making some kind of decision about you what kind of decision i dont know he was trying to read you to understand you he knows a lot about my father i know that he knows a lot about more than that hes in this thing up to his neck i can feel it maybe the women really arent being killed maybe theyre being held somewhere in asia moved there on de becques jet you mean maybe have you traced its movements over the past year were having some trouble with that but baxter will stay on it hes a bulldog with that kind of thing kaiser walks forward takes the seat by the bulkhead and in moments is holding a special scrambled phone to his ear i cant make out his exact words but as the conversation progresses i see a certain tension developing in his neck and arm the jet begins to roll and soon were hurtling north toward cuba again after about ten minutes kaiser hangs up and comes back to the seat facing me theres an excitement in his eyes that he cant conceal whats happened its something good isnt it we hit the jackpot the dc lab traced those two brush hairs they took from the paintings theyre unique the best you can buy they come from a rare type of kolinsky sable and the brushes are handmade in one small factory in manchuria theres only one american importer based in new york he buys two lots a year and theyre sold before he gets them he has specific customers repeat customers most are in new york but there are several sprinkled around the country any in new orleans kaiser smiles the biggest order outside new york went to new orleans the art department of tulane university my god its the third order thats gone there in the past year and a half baxters meeting with the president of the university right now by the time we land hell have a list of everyone whos had access to those brushes in the past eighteen months wasnt one of the victims kidnapped on the tulane campus two another from audubon park near the zoo which is very close to tulane jesus thats only three out of eleven the grid analysis alone didnt point to tulane but this definitely changes things where was the next closest order of these brushes to new orleans taos new mexico after that san francisco my stomach feels hollow this might really be it kaiser nods lenz told us the paintings would lead us to suspects i was skeptical but the son of a bitch was right you were more right than he was you told me yesterday you thought the killer or kidnapper was based in new orleans that the selections were being made there and that the killer might be the painter lenz had the painter in new york kaiser sighs like a man whose premonitions are often borne out but bring little pleasure when they are you know something what de becque lied to us in there how he told us he never saw the painting of jane this is a guy who can get on his private jet and fly to asia anytime he wants hes pissed at wingate for selling the later sleeping women out from under him to asian collectors even if he didnt see those paintings when they were offered for sale you think he didnt fly to hong kong the minute they went on exhibition there its hard to imagine him not doing that and did you notice that he sent li with us to see the paintings he didnt come himself yes youd think he would have wanted to show off his collection and to watch your reaction hes got a thing about those paintings and a thing about you de becque is a different breed of cat ill bet hes got a streak of kinkiness thats off the chart and he may have watched your reactions i didnt see any obvious surveillance cameras but that doesnt mean anything these days so what are you saying kaiser looks out the porthole window his face blue in the thickly filtered sunlight this is like digging up a huge statue buried in sand you uncover a shoulder then a knee you think you know whats down there but you dont not until its all out of the ground he cuts his eyes at me you know what feeling this gives me the conspiracy angle i mean what it makes me think of what white slavery women kidnapped from their hometowns sent far away and forced into prostitution it still happens in various ways even in america but its big business in asia especially thailand crime syndicates steal young girls from the mountain villages and take them down to the cities they lock them in small rooms advertise them as virgins and force them to service dozens of clients a day i close my eyes and press down a wave of nausea the mere mention of this horror forces me to accept that it is one of janes possible fates but even if it isnt the image created by kaisers words makes me shiver with fear and outrage i can walk through a corpselittered battlefield and hold in my lunch but the thought of a terrified young girl locked in some cubicle of hell until she contracts aids is too much for me im sorry kaiser says lightly touching my knee my head is full of stuff like that and sometimes i forget its all right its just of all the bad things thats the toughest for me though he tries to conceal it the question in his mind shines through his eyes dont ask okay okay look were a lot closer to finding him closer to stopping him focus on that okay can i get you some water or something yes please he gets up and goes forward and i snatch up a copy of the jets safety card from the seat back across the aisle anything to focus on to keep my mind from following its own dark course whats the worst thing that ever happened to you lenz asked his patients whats the worst thing in the main conference room of the new orleans field office a strategy meeting is deciding what direction the nokids case will take from here i am not at that meeting ive been banished to sac bowless office once again exclusion defines my status as an outsider the meeting is being chaired by a deputy director of the fbi and includes the us attorney for new orleans the new orleans chief of police the sheriff of jefferson parish and various other big shots its amazing how they come out of the woodwork when theres a whiff of success in the air while i wait my mind whirls with memories of marcel de becque his paintings his beautiful vietnamese servant and the photo of my father on his wall but these memories are only static crackling around the electric knowledge that if daniel baxters plan is not overruled i will soon be facing suspects men who may have killed my sister in the hope of rattling them into betraying themselves this prospect does more to settle my soul than anything ive tried in the past year agent wendy my bodyguard has walked in twice and tried to make small talk but i couldnt concentrate and she took the hint this time when bowless door opens john kaiser walks in his face all business as the door closes behind him i catch sight of wendy looking in from the hall you ready he asks whats happened so far lots of nothing the bureaucrats had to weigh in beaucoup jurisdictional asses to kiss on this one the deputy director and the us attorney are gone they wanted to meet you but i told them you werent a big fan of the justice department there are certain elements i like better than others kaiser smiles the big news is we have four suspects and all of them were here in town the day wingate died in new york well both hear the details in there when we get done id like to talk to you alone we never got dinner maybe we can have a late meal if youre up for it sure wendy too he blows air from his cheeks ill handle that lets go its a quick walk to the conference room which is stunning in size and decor i expected a tenfoot table and some doctors office chairs what i find is a fortyfootlong room with a window running the length of it giving a panoramic view of lake pontchartrain recognizable in the dark by the receding lights of the causeway the conference table is thirty feet long and surrounded by massive blue plush executive chairs with the fbi crest embroidered in the upholstery where a tall mans head would rest at the near end of the table sit the usual suspects daniel baxter sac bowles dr lenz and bill granger the head of the violent crimes squad piles of paper and files are spread out between styrofoam coffee cups halfempty water bottles and a triangular speaker phone kaiser takes a seat beside granger opposite bowles and lenz and i sit beside him baxter looks tired but resolute at the head of the table like a sea captain who has spent days riding out a hurricane but has now come within sight of his home port when he speaks his voice is hoarse ms glass weve made phenomenal progress in the past eight hours the sable brush hairs led us to the tulane university art department with the help of the president of the university weve determined that this particular order was placed by one roger wheaton the artistinresidence at newcomb college which is part of tulane the name sounds familiar wheaton is one of the most highly regarded artists in america hes fiftyeight years old and he came to tulane just two years ago about the time the disappearances started says bill granger wheaton was raised in vermont baxter continues and except for four years spent in the marine corps lived his life between vermont and new york city for the past ten years hes been besieged by offers like the one that brought him to tulane but hes something of a recluse and he always rejected such offers before but two years ago he accepted the position at tulane why well get to that in a minute the main point is that wheaton didnt order the special sable brushes only for himself he has three graduate students taking studio classes for full credit and theyve been studying under him since he arrived two are male and followed him down from new york the other is a woman a louisiana native one of your suspects is a woman she has access to the sable brushes and the taser used in the snatch of the dorignacs victim makes a female perpetrator possible as unlikely as this sounds to me i go right to my next question wheaton brought his own students with him tulane hired roger wheaton for his reputation its a feather in their cap to have him and he was given absolute discretion over whom he would select for his program wheaton also teaches a lecture class fiftyone students and any of them could conceivably have got hold of these brushes but were not going to use you in that phase of the investigation wheaton and the three graduate students will be our targets when are we talking to them tomorrow all of them no matter how long it takes i want to minimize any chance of interaction between them prior to questioning before we go into details though you should understand our position in the present climate the investigative support unit normally works in an advisory capacity for state or local police agencies we provide expertise relating to serial offenders but the police do the legwork they conduct the interviews make the arrests and get the credit however in a longrunning case like this one where we have knowledge that crimes will likely be committed in the future we become heavily involved in all aspects of the investigation i understand we have a unique situation here in new orleans the spreadout nature of the city has created a jurisdictional nightmare there are seven separate police departments involved in these disappearances and though not all of them have homicide detectives there are over two dozen detectives working this case were presently leading the joint task force but all these police detectives would like to interview wheaton and his students however the most potent weapon anyone could have in such an interview ms glass is you and to put it bluntly youre on our team for the moment baxter gives kaiser a quick glance but kaiser remains expressionless weve also managed to gather many of the sleeping women at the national gallery in washington something metropolitan police agencies could never have managed because of this and because of jurisdictional rivalry were going to be given the first shot at these suspects all four have been under surveillance from the time they were identified but they wont be approached until after we go in tomorrow the pressure on this investigation is enormous the victims in this case come from affluent families one of the tulane students was is the daughter of a federal judge in new york so while we interview roger wheaton at the university nopd will be searching his residence from top to bottom were already turning his life inside out insofar as it exists on paper his three students get the same treatment though im not optimistic in two cases investigating art students is like investigating waiters they almost dont exist on paper right now none of the four has a paper alibi for the dorignacs snatch all four were at an opening at the new orleans museum of art until seventhirty pm the chancellor verified that beyond that we know nothing baxters dark eyes burn into mine tomorrow ms glass we are the point of a very bulky spear we have to hit our target if we miss we lose the best chance well ever have to surprise our unsub into a confession i get it lets have the details baxter shuffles a stack of papers im going to give you a quick sketch of each says baxter this is for johns benefit too sac bowles gets up and kills the lights and a large screen hanging from the ceiling at the end of the room comes alive with white light i want you to see all four first baxter says see if any look familiar then well break them down these images are being relayed from our emergency operations center which is also on this floor baxter leans forward and addresses the speakerphone on the desk give us the composite tom four photos appear simultaneously on the screen none looks familiar or even like what i expected but why would they my mental picture of artists comes from books and films mostly images from other centuries when i hear the word students i think of people in their twenties the oldest here roger wheaton i presume is wearing bifocal glasses and reminds me of max von sydow the actor severe and scandinavianlooking with shoulderlength gray hair beside his photo is a fortyish guy who looks like an exconvict holloweyed unshaven tough then i realize hes actually wearing prison garb is that guy a convict hes done two stretches in sing sing says baxter well get to that weve got a real grabbag of weirdos here i kid you not is that a scientific description asks kaiser bowles bellylaughs these faces ring any bells asks baxter cutting his eyes at me not so far the other man in the composite is stunningly handsome and my sixth sense tells me hes gay i generally make this judgment based on physical appearance speech and behavior all i have here is a photograph but ive spent most of my life studying photographs and this guy i feel certain about the woman is also attractive with long black hair light skin and black eyes but despite her skin tone something about her features suggests african blood the older man is roger wheaton says baxter the convict is leon isaac gaines age fortytwo raised in queens new york the third man is frank smith hes thirtyfive and also a new york native the woman is thalia laveau thirtynine a native of terrebonne parish here in louisiana now ive got it thalia laveau is a sabine a racial group the fbi has probably never even heard of all four suspects lived in new york for a time says baxter so all could have ties to whoever killed wingate he leans toward the speakerphone put up wheaton alone the composite vanishes replaced by a candid shot of roger wheaton the artist has deepset eyes behind his bifocals and a long strong face he looks more like a craftsman than a painter a genius with metal or wood before we do his bio says baxter lets deal with why wheaton came to new orleans three years ago this reclusive artist of international reputation was diagnosed with scleroderma a potentially fatal disease baxter turns to dr lenz arthur lenz sniffs and inclines his head toward me as he speaks scleroderma is commonly thought of as a womans disease but it does affect men and usually with more severity the external symptoms such as hardening of the facial skin et cetera are not always obvious or even present in men but the internal damage is accelerated scleroderma is vascular in nature and causes scarring and eventual failure of the internal organs including the lungs one particularly important symptom in wheatons case is called raynauds phenomenon this is a spasm and constriction of the blood vessels of the extremities usually the fingers but sometimes the nose or the penis which is caused by contact with cold temperature usually air or water these attacks completely cut off circulation to the digits sometimes for long enough to cause irreversible tissue damage amputations arent uncommon sufferers frequently wear gloves for most of the day wheaton moved south to avoid this i ask apparently though that kind of move isnt advised by physicians its pointless in a way theres more airconditioning in the south and even opening a refrigerator can bring on an attack but the university has taken great pains to accommodate wheatons special needs the artist paul klee suffered from scleroderma later in life it greatly affected his work his paintings became very dark in content and the damage to his fingers forced him to change his painting style completely he baxter has raised his hand we need to stay macro here arthur theres a lot to cover lenz likes to hear himself talk and does not take kindly to interruptions but daniel baxter doesnt hesitate to cut him off roger wheaton baxter says in the tone of a man reading from a cue card born in rural vermont youngest of three brothers his brothers joined the service upon graduating high school one army one navy wheaton had no formal training as a child but in interviews of which hes done damned few he says his mother was a great lover of classical art she bought him supplies and encouraged him to imitate the old masters copying color plates from a book she bought him he showed phenomenal talent and at seventeen he left home for new york we dont have a lot of information on this period of his life but in interviews hes said he supported himself doing odd jobs and painting portraits on the street he was unsuccessful as an artist and in he joined the marine corps he did two tours in vietnam earning a bronze star and a purple heart i glance at kaiser who steps on my foot beneath the table wheaton also instituted a disciplinary action against two members of his platoon for raping a twelveyearold vietnamese girl he pushed it to a courtmartial and the men did time in leavenworth any thoughts john kaiser nods in the halfdark that would have made wheaton about as popular as trench foot in his platoon it tells us something about him but what im not sure either what he saw was really bad and he felt morally compelled to push it or the guy has some kind of hero compulsion this remark rankles me what rape wouldnt be really bad to see i ask trying to keep my voice under control why couldnt wheaton simply have been doing the right thing by pushing it baxter answers for kaiser i served in vietnam myself ms glass most soldiers coming upon the situation ive described would have been offended and outraged but they would have looked the other way a few would have participated but very few would have bucked the chain of command and forced disciplinary action its not pretty in hindsight but at that time no one was inclined to discipline our own troops for anything short of a massacre wheaton transferred out of his unit after that and its not hard to guess why still he had a spotless record with several commendations from his commanders we should track down the names of men he served with says kaiser not just his officers were on it baxter replies you should also note that wheaton lost one brother in vietnam killed in a saigon bar by a terrorist bomb the other died in from a stroke baxter shuffles some papers after vietnam wheaton returned to new york enrolled in the art program at nyu and slowly made a name for himself painting portraits he supported himself this way for years while he worked on his private obsession which is landscapes for the past twenty years hes painted the same subject over and over again its a forest clearing and every painting in the series is called the clearing he began in a very realistic style but over the years hes gone more abstract the paintings are still called the clearing but theyre not recognizable as such the early more realistic ones showed a vermontstyle forest clearing but also jungle foliage typical of vietnam and sometimes the two mixed so theres no telling about the real origin of the image or its significance when asked about it in interviews wheaton says the paintings speak for themselves a progression from realistic to abstract says kaiser the exact opposite of the sleeping women wheatons progression is much more marked says lenz his style is so defined now that its spawned a genre or school in the worldwide art community they call it dark impressionism not because the paintings themselves are necessarily dark though most of his recent work is but because of their content he uses impressionist techniques but the original impressionists tended to paint what you might call happy subjects pastoral tranquil themes think of manet renoir monet pissarro wheatons work is very different de becque said the sleeping women artist uses impressionist techniques i tell lenz in the way he lays down color anyway thats true says lenz but he abandoned the pure style very quickly many beginning artists emulate the impressionists just as young composers imitate the popular composers of the past but impressionism in the pure sense is passe wheaton succeeds because hes brought something new to the style as for him painting the sleeping women though two connoisseurs have already told us that the sleeping women share no similarities whatever with the paintings of roger wheaton could one man paint two radically different styles and an expert not be able to tell he did both asks baxter if he did it to prove a point probably what about to avoid detection says baxter probably but over the course of a body of work certain idiosyncrasies reveal themselves weve got hold of several portraits wheaton painted years ago to compare his execution of skin eyes hair et cetera with that of the sleeping women artist its all very technical but the final answer is no he couldnt hide himself that way of course well analyze the paints canvases and all other materials to be sure have you found these kolinsky sable brush hairs in wheatons paintings yes weve also found them in the paintings of smith games and laveau dating how far back two years when they came to tulane wheaton just started using these special brushes apparently so well have to ask him why lets move on i could talk for an hour about wheaton alone but we have a much more viable suspect in this bunch baxter says to the speakerphone put up gaines tom the photo of wheaton is replaced by a mug shot of the convict this guy i would walk across a busy interstate to avoid crazed eyes pasty skin tangled black hair a stubbled face and a broken nose the only paintbrush i can see him holding would be six inches wide leon isaac gaines says baxter if i had to lay odds right now this is our man in new orleans his father and mother were both drunks the father did a stretch in sing sing for carnal knowledge of a juvenile paving the way for junior i guess male or female juvenile asks kaiser female age fourteen leon was arrested repeatedly as a juvenile burglary assault peeping you name it he did juvy time for starting fires and was in and out of reformatories until he was twenty kaiser grunts and i know why childhood arson is one leg of the homicidal triangle of indicators for serial killers as children bedwetting arson and cruelty to animals i remember them all from my reading last year he rings the chimes on animals too says baxter when he was twelve he buried a neighbors cat up to its neck in a sandpile and rolled over it with a lawn mower enuresis asks kaiser no record of it both parents are deceased but they werent the kind to have sought medical care for that still were trying to track down physicians working in the area at the time more shuffling paper in the semidark gaines is a twotime loser once for aggravated battery once for attempted rape jesus mutters bowles no gang affiliations while incarcerated but he was part of a bad riot at sing sing were tracking down his cellmates and sending agents to interview them gaines never picked up a paintbrush in his life until his first term in sing sing he showed so much promise that the warden showed his stuff to some new york dealers they apparently kept an eye on him because during his second hitch they made some sales for him he attracted the attention of the new york art community much as jack henry abbott attracted the attention of norman mailer and those other chumps with his belly of the beast nonsense is that when wheaton first heard about gaines asks kaiser wheaton isnt mentioned by anyone at that time in connection with gaines wheatons always been a recluse associates with no other artists since his diagnosis hes broken off all contact with everyone but his dealer and his students local patrons of the arts in new orleans have invited him for parties dinner like that but he always declines the president isnt happy about that what does gaines paint asks kaiser he started with prison scenes now he paints nothing but his girlfriend whatever girlfriend he has at the time as far as we can tell hes regularly abused every woman hes ever been with he paints that as well by the way reviews of his stuff call it violent and thats a quote how many applicants did wheaton have to choose from when he picked this guy more than six hundred jesus why did he pick gaines you can ask him that tomorrow kaiser tenses beside me im doing the interview well get to that after we cover these bios baxter says quickly the rivalry between kaiser and lenz will surely come to a head over this so gaines is essentially painting a series as well i ask the same subject again and again just like wheaton and the unsub the others are too in their ways says lenz wheaton apparently used this as a criterion in his selection hes on record as saying that only deep study of a particular subject can produce new understanding deeper levels of truth that and fifty centsll buy you a cup of coffee cracks bowles im inclined to agree says baxter but they pay wheaton very big bucks how much asks kaiser his last painting went for four hundred thousand dollars thats not even close to the sleeping women prices true but wheatons a lot more prolific than our unsub you should note that nopd has been called to leon gainess duplex several times by neighbors but the girlfriend has yet to swear out a complaint gaines is usually drunk when they get there i think weve got the picture on gaines says kaiser not quite he owns a dodge utility van with tinted windows all around the room goes silent anybody else have that kind of transport asks kaiser in a soft voice no says lenz weve got to get inside that van if we find biological trace we can compare it to samples from our victims dna bank where did you get dna from the victims i ask you have no bodies for four victims we have locks of hair saved from childhood says kaiser two victims were breast cancer survivors and have bone marrow stem cells stocked at hospitals for future transplant two victims have eggs stored at fertility clinics and two stocked umbilical cord blood when their youngest children were delivered thats not a direct match to the mother but it could be helpful im impressed john put that together baxter says proudly all grist to the mill as an identical twin says kaiser you could add to the bank for your sister i meant to ask you before anytime as soon you conclude gainess interview tomorrow says baxter nopd will confiscate the van whats the deal with the utility van good way to move a body kaiser turns to me his face a shadow with glinting eyes rapists and serial killers favor this type of vehicle by a huge margin its the most important part of their equipment a means to quickly get the victim out of sight even in a public place later it often becomes the scene of the final crime i try in vain to shut out images of jane being raped and cut up inside a dark and stinking van my moneys on leon gaines says baxter but we need to cover everybody lets have frank smith tom gainess face is replaced by the almost angelic visage i saw earlier in the composite this ones a riddle says baxter frank smith was born into a wealthy family in westchester county in he focused on art from an early age and took an mfa degree from columbia smith is openly gay and hes painted homosexual themes usually nude men from his college days not nude sleeping men asks kaiser if only says baxter by all reports smith is enormously talented and paints in the style of the old masters his paintings look like rembrandt to me really unbelievable more like titian actually says lenz earning a snort from the sac frank smith stretches his own canvases and mixes his own pigments the mystery is what hes doing in wheatons program at all hes already famous in his own right wheaton has far more stature of course but im not sure what smith could learn from him ill ask smith tomorrow says kaiser lenz sighs and looks at baxter who gazes pointedly at the table the blue light of the projector beam highlights the fatigue lines in the isu chiefs face smiths paintings now sell for upwards of thirty thousand dollars lenz adds oh i forgot says baxter wheatons currently working on a painting that takes up a whole room over at the woldenberg art center at tulane you mean a whole wall asks kaiser no a whole room multiple canvases stretched over curved frames to form a perfect circle hes painted on curved canvases for years to create a feeling that youre walking into this clearing hes painting monet tried this as well but this new thing is a complete circle huge takes up half of a thirtyfivehundredsquarefoot gallery i know photographers whove tried this for exhibitions it usually comes off as cheap and contrived like some clunky diorama exhibit does smith have a jacket asks kaiser he got popped a couple of times for unnatural acts in his twenties during park sweeps nothing major his parents made the sodomy charges disappear but hes mentioned the arrests in interviews he seems proud of them i got the old arrest records from new york to verify them what about alibis for these people i ask for all the disappearances is anybody checking that about two hundred cops growls bowles plus us thats something the police know how to do but until they actually interrogate the suspects they can only do so much its all paper trails credit card charges like that so far all the suspects appear to have been in the city during the kidnappings after your interviews tomorrow the gloves come off these people will go under the hot lights then theyll hire lawyers and the whole thing will become a media nightmare what about the girl says kaiser whats her story waste of time lenz says theres no precedent for a woman committing this type of murder we dont know they are murders kaiser says with restrained anger until we find some bodies even one definite we dont know what were dealing with im not ruling out anybody based on standard profiling techniques look at roger wheaton the guy is well over our age limit but based on what ive heard i have questions thalia laveau says baxter trying to tamp down the flaring tempers born on bayou terrebonne in father a trapper mother a housewife what did he trap asks kaiser anything that didnt trap him first i answer bowles bellylaughs again you know about these people baxter asks we did a couple of stories down there when i was on the timespicayune troubles in the shrimp industry its another world down there the whole place smells like drying shrimp you never forget it chime in with anything relevant baxter squints down at a file racially laveau is part french part africanamerican and part native american a redbone asks bowles no thats different i tell him whats a redbone asks kaiser like leon redbone redbones are part black part indian i reply theyre settled all over western louisiana and east texas thalia laveau is whats called a sabine thats not right says baxter misunderstanding my pronunciation yes it is in lafourche and terrebonne parishes they say sobeen not saybeen or saybine like the ones you learned about in roman history i have no idea why thats just the way it is that girl didnt look black to me says bowles or indian says kaiser who grew up in the west put her picture back up lets have laveau tom says baxter in the next photo this one color thalia laveau is not merely attractive but beautiful her eyes and hair are so black and shiny they seem to float off the screen while her skin has the look of buttermilk youre the expert baxter says to me tell us about these people the sabines are trappers and fishermen i answer thinking back shrimpers they live in shacks along bayous that lead to the gulf of mexico theyre not cajuns but at her age she would have grown up speaking french they used to have to be taught english at school theyre catholic but they have strange superstitions theres some voodoo in there i think inbreeding too they range from whiteskinned like this woman to very dark they can have kinky hair or straight like hers theyre tough people but they love to dance and play music theyre clannish not likely to go to the authorities over trouble in the eighties they had problems with vietnamese refugees coming into their shrimping grounds to compete there were shootings and boatrammings it was big news thats more than i have here says baxter as far as we know thalia laveau had no formal training as an artist she just started drawing one day and showed a knack for it eventually she moved on to painting mostly watercolors of the bayous and the gulf she quit school in the tenth grade and at seventeen went to new york just like wheaton i say quietly yes and like wheaton she had no early success she supported herself in various ways from waitressing to working in art galleries a female art professor thought she heard laveau say something about stripping for money in new york but later decided shed misunderstood laveau has worked as a model for a graduate painting class at tulane and some of that is nude work the most significant thing weve heard so far is that shes a lesbian is that rumor or fact i ask unconfirmed we didnt want to question students at this point wed like these people to be totally unprepared at their interviews tomorrow what does laveau paint asks kaiser nude women no she goes into the homes of strangers lives there for a while then starts painting their lives like the documentary photographers of the sixties i think aloud gordon parks all her paintings are finished at one sitting baxter goes on shes attracted a lot of print media attention but her work doesnt sell for much not remotely in the class of wheaton or frank smith how much asks kaiser a thousand bucks apiece ahh seven hundred is the highest sum paid to date do leon gainess pictures sell i ask somebody paid five thousand for one he could make a living at it if he wasnt so deep in debt hes borrowed to the hilt on student loans and he owes bookies as well one former cellmate said he picked up a serious heroin habit in prison i get the feeling laveau and gaines live pretty close to the bone says kaiser so where are the millions earned from the sleeping women good question dr lenz says right now i like wheaton or frank smith theyre already wealthy so they would have the knowledge to hide the money or know people with that knowledge gaines is a violent selfabsorbed punk the attempted rape is an indicator but hes too obvious too coarse for the crimes were dealing with and laveau is a woman im not excluding anybody says kaiser after visiting cayman im convinced marcel de becque could be behind it all he could easily be commissioning someone to paint the pictures and paying them peanuts compared to the overall take that includes thalia laveau or a skell like gaines if de becque is behind this lenz counters why draw attention to himself by demanding that we send glass to see him in exchange for photos of his paintings hes a ballsy guy hes not scared of us not one bit i confirm but what about thalia laveau what would be her motive do you really think a womans going to paint dead women for money i havent talked to her yet says kaiser so i dont know but the kind of people you described sabines they tend to stay where they grow up right yes so why did she leave was she a brilliant kid with ambition or was she running from something kaiser looks at baxter without waiting for an answer how are we going to handle the approach whos going in baxter walks to the wall and switches on the overhead lights lenz blinks against the brightness but he looks set for battle john says baxter i know youve been point man on this thing for a long time and against your own wishes which counts for a lot in my damn it kaiser mutters baxter implores kaiser with his hands listen john because of wheatons artistic stature and because of his medical condition im inclined to let arthur take the lead on this one he has a broad knowledge of art and hell be able to question wheaton intelligently on his disease gauge his mental state related to it and kaiser sits in silence as baxter drones on the decision has been made and the medical angle makes argument pointless normally i would be going in as well baxter concludes but because i think you should be there john im going to send you in in my place if you feel that some path is being left unexplored you can go down it youll be there okay its just that arthur will take the lead on the questions where will you be kaiser asks in a taut voice surveillance van outside arthurs going to wear a wire kaisers mouth falls open its a major break with bureau policy says baxter but the director has personally approved it the police insisted on live transmission and tapes as a condition of letting us handle the interviews alone and glass kaiser says without looking at me shell be in the van with me until arthur cues her the code phrase is im sorry our photographer was supposed to be here ten minutes ago thats the story for the suspects were not confiscating their paintings just photographing them once weve finished though nopd will be confiscating everything in sight these suspects are going to be totally alienated after that and theres nothing we can do about it weve got one shot at each of them wheaton we treat with kid gloves gaines is second and we go in hard john youll take the lead with gaines because you have more experience with convicts smith and laveau we play by ear but in every case when ms glass comes in please just call me jordan i cut in ms glass is getting old baxter nods gratefully when jordan comes in she wont look directly at the suspect this will make someone whos shocked by her appearance have to work harder to confirm what his eyes are telling him the innocent people wont look at her twice though im sure gaines will ogle her a little but the guilty one should look like hes seen a ghost which in a sense he will have or she says kaiser or she baxter concedes gaines will ogle me a little i echo he looks like hed walk up lick my face and dare me to slap him if he does says bill granger the violent crimes supervisor kick him in the balls baxter frowns if gaines does do something like that dont overreact we have no idea what could happen when you walk into these situations the painter could be the killer if the women are being killed and he could decide the game is up the moment he sees you he could do something totally crazy for this reason john will be armed going in baxter looks hard at his former protege use your best judgment about force this part of the plan clearly makes lenz nervous even i see a mental image of kaiser leaping over a metal prison table and trying to strangle the deathrow inmate he told me about but baxter is showing clear support for kaiser and lenz doesnt question it not in front of him anyway if either of you comes out and says somebodys dirty says baxter we bring them in for interrogation before the police get in on the act he looks around the table okay well have another strategy meeting tomorrow morning here seven am from eight oclock on well have police observers with us everybody good to go lenz sniffs and gives baxter an ironic smile i try to catch kaisers eye but he gives me nothing i need a bite to eat and some sleep i tell them rising from my chair take agent travis with you baxter says meaning wendy i will the camellia grill is still open kaiser says in an offhand voice you know it i probably ate there a hundred times in my younger days what do you keep in that waist pack asks lenz its my genies lamp i rub it and whatever i need comes out it must weigh a lot sac bowles says dryly it does but arent you glad i had a camera in there during the gallery fire yes we are says baxter get some sleep jordan tomorrows a very big day ill see you here at seven kaiser gives me a wave as i depart but dr lenz only watches his wise eyes missing nothing the camellia grill stands at the intersection of carrollton and st charles with the river rolling past just beyond the levee like many new orleans institutions its a modest place an oldtime grill with pink walls aproned employees and stools at the bar agent wendy and i have been here long enough to get menus when john kaiser walks through the door and scans the room he comes straight to us and looks down at wendy whose expression quickly morphs from surprise to discomfort could i see you alone for a minute he asks she gets up without a word and follows him outside through the window i see kaiser speaking wendy listening attentively when they come back in wendy goes to the far end of the bar while kaiser takes her stool beside me that didnt look very smooth i tell him what did you say to her that i needed to talk to you without lenz hearing i see shes got a terrible crush on you i never encouraged it you think that makes it any better for her kaiser picks up a menu shes a good girl and shes tough she can handle it he glances up at me and his eyes seem to hold more understanding than his words the skin around his eyes is dark with fatigue okay i say looking at my own menu what are we doing here this is our first date isnt it he says it deadpan and i laugh in spite of myself come on whats going on just what i told wendy i want to talk to you without lenz around or baxter for that matter i have a certain amount of anxiety that were behind the curve that whoevers running this thing is ahead of us maybe way ahead i sense the disquiet in him in the way he holds himself okay tell me about it i cant explain it its a feeling i want to do something about it though what well get to it lets order kaiser signals a waiter and he comes almost immediately we order omelets and orange juice and i ask for cafe au lait as well its nice to be in a place where theyd look at you like an idiot if you asked for some fancy latte or exotic extras glancing to my left i catch wendy watching us over her shoulder what will baxter say about you talking to me alone i dont think wendy will tell him shell give us the benefit of the doubt this time but he wouldnt like it would he he trusts me to a point he wouldnt like what im going to say which is kaiser puts his elbows on the counter and rotates his stool so that he faces me more directly have you ever fired a handgun yes an automatic or a revolver both if i got you one would you carry it what would baxter think about that he wouldnt like it and the office of professional responsibility would probably fire me so why are you suggesting it because i think youre in danger if the unsub wants you he could shoot wendy before either of you knew he was there then it would just be you and him if youre armed you might have a chance to react in time you mean kill him could you do it if he shot wendy in front of me youre damn straight what if he just knocked her out and tried to pull you into a car would you shoot him then a wave of discomfort rolls through me flashes of memory that i thrust back into the dark ill do what i have to do to save myself kaisers eyes never leave my face have you ever shot anybody before ive been shot before lets leave it at that i get the feeling your life has been exciting even by the standard of war correspondents it hasnt been dull has it taken a lot out of you i look away and focus on wendys straight back the more i watch her the more i like her the path she chose is much more regimented than mine but she brings to it the passion i brought to mine when i was younger yes it has thats why you took time out to do this book you were doing yes youve been wanting to do that for a long time yes i look back at kaiser into the hazel eyes that appear to hold genuine curiosity but once i really started i wasnt sure it was going to give me what i wanted out of it what was that im not sure our omelets and juice arrive but neither of us lifts a fork may i ask you a personal question he says you can ask youve never been married thats right does that shock you it surprises me not many heterosexual women who look like you make it to forty without getting married at least once is that a nice way of asking whats wrong with me kaiser laughs its a nice way of being nosy youd think id be a prize catch wouldnt you yes i would a lot of guys think that from a distance whats wrong up close im not like most women how so well it goes like this i meet a guy goodlooking successful independent doctor journalist investment banker alist actor whatever he cant wait to go out with me im a notsougly woman in what a lot of people see as a glamour job the first few dates he shows me off to his friends we like each other we get intimate then in a week or a month i get a new assignment afghanistan brazil bosnia egypt and not a flyinandout dan rather junket a month on the ground schlepping cameras maybe this particular guy is making international partner the next week and wants me at his celebration party maybe the oscars are next week but i take the assignment i wont even discuss turning it down and by the time i get back hes decided maybe the relationship isnt working out after all why do you think that is because most guys have the oneup gene the what the oneup gene they have to be in the superior position they love the idea of being with me but the reality is far from what they envision some dont like that i make more money than they do the ones who make more money than i do dont like it when their friends act like my job is more important than theirs some cant take the fact that i have a higher priority than them in my life i dont mean to complain about it i just want you to understand i make sixtyeight thousand dollars a year says kaiser i know you make more than that how do you know i saw your tax return you what we had to rule you out as a suspect that was part of it great but i dont think your job is any more important than mine he picks up a fork and takes a bite of his omelet do you no and i know im not the highest priority in your life true and im perfectly okay with that i watch him as he pours hot sauce on his omelet but i cant read anything in his eyes what are we talking about i think you know well at least were on the same page he smiles and this time his white teeth show and his eyes sparkle i didnt really come here to say that but im glad i did i feel awkward because of your sister that has nothing to do with my sister what happened to jane only confirmed something i learned a long time ago if you wait to do things you want to do or ought to do you may be dead before you get the chance i learned that too in vietnam but its easy to lose sight of it in the rush of everyday life to get so caught up in what youre doing people depending on you that you develop tunnel vision you know that feeling for a long time the only part of the world i saw was through a lens and now now im drifting until i found the paintings anyway but beneath that im not really tethered to anything can you handle another personal question might as well lenz told me you werent close to your sister yet youre doing far more than any relative involved in this case youve made it your mission to find her or to find the truth how do you explain that how do i explain that i didnt tell lenz everything jane and i had problems growing up yes some of those problems lasted into adulthood but about three years ago i had a bad health scare id gone to the emergency room for pain and the next thing i knew i was in the oncology ward they thought i had ovarian cancer i was lucky it happened in san francisco and not while i was on assignment somewhere but my friends were on assignment i was alone and scared to death i pause and swallow fighting the lump rising in my throat sometime in the middle of the night i woke up to find jane standing beside my bed holding my hand i thought i was dreaming she said shed awakened from a dead sleep the night before she felt a painful shock go through her like a labor contraction and her mind filled with an image of my face she called my house and got my machine then she called my agency and found out i was in the hospital she left the kids with marc and flew straight out to be with me she slept in that hospital room for four days she wheeled me to the tests handled the doctors and nurses everything she never left my side you hadnt been close before that no and im not saying the sins of the past were magically redeemed but she told me some things she said that as she got older shed begun to understand the sacrifices id made to take care of her when we were kids that she knew id only wanted the best for her even if i didnt always know what that was i told her i respected the life shed made for herself even though id belittled it before it meant a lot to her i pick up my fork and draw imaginary circles on the countertop its easy to feel independent when youre young that you dont need anybody but as time passes family starts to matter and with our mother in the shape shes in jane and i only had each other youre speaking in the past tense i dont know what i believe right now all i know is that i have to find her dead alive whatever shes my blood and i love her its that simple i have to find my sister kaiser reaches out and gently squeezes my wrist you will jordan thanks have you ever wanted your own family to settle down have kids the whole thing every woman i ever knew wanted that in some form or fashion and you i hear the clock ticking i visited my nephew and niece last night and my feelings for them overwhelmed me he glances down the counter wendy said there might have been some trouble over there at your brotherinlaws you know i can take you guys in my life up to a point but theres a line you dont cross she only told us because its her job to protect you i wont give up all my privacy to be protected i take a long sip of my coffee and try to keep my temper in check just what do you know about me anyway my medical records everything down to my bra size i dont know your bra size his face is absolutely serious do you want to i think im up to investigating the question given adequate time you mean naturally he takes a sip of juice and wipes his mouth with his napkin how much time do you think that would be at least four hours uninterrupted we wont get four hours tomorrow and we dont have it tonight he looks again at wendy whos making a point of not looking at us no we dont the task force is meeting right now in the emergency operations center i have to get back and i dont know when i can get out of it speaking of that you told de becque youre having trouble matching the abstract faces in the paintings to victims right kaiser nods eleven victims nineteen paintings two major problems there must be victims we dont know about murders or disappearances that dont match the crime signature exactly maybe they were hookers or runaways rather than society women and nobody reported them missing maybe weve actually found their bodies but since they match the more abstract paintings we cant tell but a jefferson parish detective and i have gone over every homicide and missing person in new orleans for the past three years and we only have a handful of possibles none very likely how many paintings have you matched to known victims six definitive matches out of eleven two strong probables but the faces are so vague in some of the paintings or so distorted that we just cant get anywhere with them who do you have working on them the university of arizona theyve done great work for us in the past digital photo enhancement but not this time not so far i think thats because what you want in this case isnt really photo enhancement the distortions you want to correct arent the result of blur or a lack of resolution that masks reality theyre distortions created in the mind of a human being perhaps an insane one they may have little or no correspondence with reality kaiser watches me with an unblinking gaze what do you suggest i know some photographers who work exclusively in the digital domain i dont want to mention names but i recall one of them talking about a system that was being developed for the government the cia or nsa or somebody for satellite photo interpretation its purpose was to try to bring visual coherence out of chaos he couldnt say much about it and i wasnt that interested but i remember that much how long ago was this two or three years did this system have a name at the time he called it argus you know the mythical beast with a hundred eyes ill ask baxter to talk to the other acronym agencies and see what he can find out okay theres my contribution is the bureau buying this breakfast i think the bureau can afford it apropos of nothing kaiser reaches out and touches my hand and the thrill that races up my arm sets an alarm bell ringing in my brain look he says with another glance at wendy why dont we i pull back my hand lets dont push it okay its there we know its there lets see what happens he nods slowly okay its your call we eat the remainder of our meal in silence watching each other and the gentle comedy of late diners around us im grateful that he doesnt feel pressured to make small talk it bodes well after he pays the check he leads me over to wendy and thanks her for the time she gave us he speaks and moves with such professional detachment that wendy seems to take heart this is no reflection on her intelligence all of us see what we want to see until were forced to see otherwise outside amid a throng of partying tulane students kaiser bids us farewell and leaves for the field office wendy doesnt talk much on the way back to her apartment and im glad for it as much as i like her i think tomorrow would be a good day to find a hotel im sitting in a cramped fbi surveillance van on the campus of tulane university home of the green wave a fitting name for teams whose campus has the verdant look of a garden even in october the oaks are still in leaf the palms flourishing and the lawns shine like freshly mown meadows in the sun twenty yards away from the van stands the woldenberg art center a stately old brick complex that houses the universitys art departments and the newcomb art gallery thirty seconds ago john kaiser and arthur lenz went through the doors of the gallery to meet roger wheaton the artistinresidence at the university dr lenz is wearing a concealed microphone and transmitter which he tests repeatedly as he walks deeper into the building arthur has no faith in technology says baxter who is sitting beside me wearing a headset mike by the way i checked on that computer program you told john about argus it does exist the national reconnaissance office uses it for satellite photo interpretation its been crunching on digital photos of the unidentifiable sleeping women for the past two hours has it come up with anything baxter gives me a keep your chin up smile they tell me its been spitting out faces that look like picasso drew them but theyre going to keep running it maybe well get lucky i also got you set up at a hotel the doubletree just down the lakefront from the field office they think youre with a corporation so dont mention the bureau no problem i appreciate it the interior of the van is uncomfortably warm even at nine am one reason is the outside temperature another body heat and compounding them convection from the electronic equipment lining the walls of the econoline theres a batterypowered fan perched on a cooler filled with dry ice to provide relief but its rattling blades barely cut the dense atmosphere before there were female agents says baxter we stripped down to our shorts in these things dont hesitate on my account ill strip myself if i have to stay in here much longer baxter laughs at his request im wearing a skirt suit and heels so that ill look more feminine to the suspects when i go in a female field agent was dispatched to dillards department store this morning with a list of my sizes getting the store to open early was apparently no trick for sac bowles but trying on the various selections caused me to miss most of this mornings strategy meeting how much notice of this interview did wheaton get an hour the president of the university handled it hes deep into cya mode if a university employee turns out to be behind the disappearance or death of a student the legal exposure would be considerable he told wheaton to cooperate with us even though the idea that he could be involved in any crime was patently absurd he didnt mention the sable brushes or the sleeping women only that we had evidence connecting the tulane art department to a murder wheaton had no problem with being questioned not so long as we talked to him while hes working hes apparently obsessive about his work schedule were going in says lenz through a crackle of static baxter checks the meters on an adat to make sure the psychiatrists words are being recorded a knocking sound reverberates from the small monitor speaker mounted on the console before us then the sound of a door opening what the hell says kaiser its the painting says lenz keep going there to your right baxter says we want to get you in there pretty quickly jordan before wheaton gets too comfortable are you roger wheaton asks kaiser theres a pause then a man with a deep avuncular voice says yes are you the gentlemen from the fbi im special agent kaiser this is doctor arthur lenz doctor lenz is a forensic psychiatrist how curious well good day to you both how can i help you we have some questions for you mr wheaton they shouldnt take too long good i like to get the paint on quickly this painting is stupendous says lenz his voice filled with awe its your masterpiece i hope so wheaton replies its my last the last clearing you mean yes its a monument to your entire body of work thank you but why stop now theres another pause and when wheaton answers his voice is heavy with regret my health isnt what it once was its time for a new direction i think you have some questions the president said it all sounded very mysterious mr wheaton says kaiser over the past year eleven women have disappeared from the new orleans area without trace are you aware of that how could i not be there are safetyawareness meetings twice a week for the female students here flyers on every wall thats good were here about those disappearances you see several of the victims have turned up in a manner of speaking i read that the woman taken from the grocery store was found but the paper said the fbi doesnt think she was taken by the same man kaisers voice takes on a tone of confidence the media has its uses im sure you understand after a pause wheaton says i see well you said several of the victims have turned up youve discovered more bodies not exactly weve discovered a series of paintings that depicts these women paintings paintings of the missing women correct in these paintings the women are nude and posed in positions of sleep possibly in death my god and youve come to ask me about this yes why were the paintings discovered nearby no in a museum in hong kong hong kong i dont understand i touch baxters arm i thought dr lenz was going to take the lead on the questions arthur wanted it this way he wants john to ask the questions that have to be asked hell jump in when hes ready arthurs a subtle guy mr wheaton says kaiser in examining these paintings forensically weve recovered some hairs from them the hairs come from a special type of paintbrush kolinsky sable youre investigating every artist in america who uses kolinsky sable brushes no that would be too big a job even for us but these werent ordinary kolinsky sable theyre a very fine grade the finest actually produced by one small factory in manchuria theres only one us importer and he sells a very limited quantity to select customers and tulane university was one of those customers now i see of course i placed that order for obvious reasons i hope could you tell us why obvious as it may be theyre the finest brushes in the world highly resilient theyre generally used for watercolor but theyre adaptable to any medium i use them for fine work in my oils your students use them as well had i not ordered them for this program two of my students wouldnt be able to afford such tools thats one of the benefits of an academic setting that would be ms laveau and mr gaines wheaton chuckles yes frank could buy a manchurian sable ranch if he chose to youre referring to mr smith asks kaiser yes frank smith is that a kolinsky brush youre using now no this is hog bristle crudesounding isnt it but a fine brush all the same have you always used the rare kolinsky brushes no this time the pause seems interminable three years ago i was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease that affects my hands and fingers ive had to alter the mechanics of my brush stroke to remain consistent with my own style i experimented for a while and finally discovered the special kolinskys they worked so well that i encouraged my students to try them i see how many people have access to these brushes my graduate students of course anyone else well this isnt a highsecurity area as you can see anyone could walk in here and take one if they really wanted to undergraduates frequently come through to see my work in progress wed have to have twentyfourhour guards to keep them out mr wheaton kaiser says in an apologetic tone i hesitate to ask this but would you have any trouble providing alibis for a group of dates over the past eighteen months id have to see the dates are you saying im a suspect in these terrible crimes anyone with access to these brushes is by definition a suspect do you know where you were three nights ago after the opening at the museum say from eight fortyfive to ninefifteen i was at home and i foresee your next question i was alone as it happens should i contact an attorney thats your prerogative sir i wouldnt want to influence you either way i see wheaton is answering more slowly now his words preceded by careful thought would you mind telling us how you selected each of your students asks kaiser i suppose not each applicant submitted paintings for review there were quite a lot to go through i initially looked at photos sent through the mail then i flew down and examined a group of paintings by each of the finalists did you use any criteria other than the applicants paintings none did you have biographical information on the applicants i believe i had a brief sheet on each one a cv of sorts though with artists thats not a very formal document leon gainess resume made interesting reading i imagine it did kaiser is trying to sound friendly but theres no hiding the fact that this is an interrogation what was it about the work of each that impressed you i dont think i can give you a short answer to that wheaton replies could you give us a verbal sketch of each student i really dont know that much about them frank smith say another long silence but whether its caused by reluctance to comply or by wheaton searching for words is unknowable from the isolation of the van im very fond of frank wheaton says finally hes a talented boy hes never known financial hardship but i think his childhood was difficult he had one of those fathers you know great expectations of the conventional kind franks talent and dedication are unbounded and hes only going to get better hes meticulous in technique and fearless in dealing with his subject matter i dont know what else to say im not a critic and im certainly no detective of course have you ever seen frank smith get violent violent hes passionate about his work but violent no he hasnt much respect for other artists work i can tell you that he rubs a lot of people the wrong way frank knows just about everything there is to know about art history and he doesnt suffer fools gladly you can imagine how that affects a man like leon gaines why dont you tell us leon would probably have killed frank by now if it wouldnt put him in angola penitentiary for life it would make him a threetime loser you see theyd never let him out again tell us about gaines wheaton sighs loudly enough for it to reach us over the transmitter leon is a very simple man or very complicated i havent been able to decide hes a tortured soul wholl never rid himself of his demons not even through his art which is certainly violent enough to exorcize a few demons are you aware that gaines beats his girlfriend i have no idea what leon does in his spare time but nothing would surprise me and his paintings are full of that kind of thing do you think hes capable of murder were all capable of killing agent kaiser surely you know that you served in vietnam kaiser says taking a cue from wheatons reply is that right you must know i did you had quite a distinguished record i did what was asked of me you did more than that you won a bronze star do you mind telling me how you got that surely youve got hold of the citation somehow daniel baxter shakes his head beside me wheatons getting comfortable hes turning the questions back on john citations never quite tell the story do they asks kaiser you were there werent you wheaton replies yes i was a ranger h company ninth cav you were a marine third division they didnt hand out medals for digging foxholes no it was a straightforward enough action my company was pinned down in a paddy near quang tri our sergeant had stepped on a mine that took off his leg above the knee two men went out after him both were shot dead by a sniper in the tree line the weather was too bad to call in napalm on the sniper but it was clear enough for him to shoot our artillery couldnt seem to get him either the sergeant screamed that if anyone else came out after him he was going to pull the pin on one of his own grenades i thought he might actually do it but he was bleeding to death so i went and got him just like that thats how it is sometimes isnt it the sniper shot at me but missed the citation said you killed the sniper as well i think getting the sergeant back alive gave me delusions of invulnerability did you ever get that feeling over there only once thank god its a dangerous feeling yes but i used it i borrowed a grenade launcher from a corporal and made a dash across the paddy which was mined yes but as i zigged across the paddy the sniper kept shooting and missing that allowed me to get a fix on his muzzle flash when i got within range it was too late for him to move he was stuck up in his tree tied in actually i just planted my feet and gave it to him i was lucky that day he wasnt thats the way it was all right what about the rape incident more dead air as wheaton adjusts to the shift of conversational gears kaiser has gone from comradeinarms to adversary in two seconds what about it asks wheaton it must have cost you some friends in your company to push it as far as you did i didnt have any choice what do you mean i was raised to treat women with respect agent kaiser no matter what language they speak or what color they are i feel like cheering aloud and this wasnt a woman he adds she was a child was it an attempted rape or a fait accompli i walked in on the crime in progress we were checking a ville for weapons caches and i heard screams from a hootch near the back i see two perpetrators thats right one was sitting on her chest with his knees on her arms holding her down the other was committing the act and what did you do i told them to stop but one of them was your superior right a corporal thats right did they stop they laughed what did you do then i held up my weapon and threatened to shoot them your m i carried a swedish k at the time sounds like you knew your weapons i didnt want to die because my m jammed when i needed it i bought the k off a lurp on leave in saigon what happened next they cursed me and threatened to kill me but they stopped would you have shot them id have wounded them you reported the incident right then thats right did you make any attempt to comfort the girl no i didnt want to turn my back on those two sounds like a smart decision the girls mother was in the hootch theyd knocked her cold but she was waking up by then is this relevant to your investigation i have no idea mr wheaton but we have to ask about everything i appreciate your being frank with us though that says a lot in your favor does it the sound of fabric rubbing against the mike tells me lenz is moving around the room get ready says baxter beside me mr wheaton says lenz i must tell you im floored by this workinprogress a return to your original inspiration will turn the art world on its ear at this remove its easy to hear the culture and education in the psychiatrists voice as compared to kaisers thats something i wouldnt mind doing says wheaton i dont think about critics much but i dont like them theyve always been kind to me but they have savaged work by people i admire and i wont forgive them that what did wilde say about critics asks lenz those who find ugly meanings in beautiful things are corrupt without being charming yes cries wheaton bright pleasure in his voice you sound like frank hes a big fan of wilde really im sure well get along splendidly then more shuffling from lenzs clothes mr wheaton as a forensic psychiatrist im also a medical doctor if you dont mind id like to ask about your disease and how its affected your work thats something id prefer not to talk about lenz doesnt immediately reply but i can imagine the laserlike stare that must be searching roger wheatons face at this moment i understand the psychiatrist says finally but im afraid i must insist such diagnoses deeply affect human psychology as you know too well im sure did you know that paul klee also suffered from scleroderma yes his work suffered equally i see youre wearing gloves has the move south relieved your raynauds phenomenon to any degree somewhat but more because the university has done so much to protect me a prerequisite of joining my lecture class was an agreement to attend it in a hall without airconditioning in new orleans that can be quite a hardship but no one seems to mind too much i wouldnt think so youre a very famous man in some circles i still have frequent episodes of raynauds to answer your question have you had permanent tissue damage to your hands again id prefer not to discuss it ill be as brief as possible are you being treated here in new orleans i visited the rheumatology department at tulane once i was not impressed surely there were other university cities you could have gone to where autoimmune diseases have more of a priority did you consider other offers wherever i go the treatments are essentially palliative you must know that doctor i find that i do better by simply living in denial and doing the best i can i see have you been tested for organ function in the past year no do you have your blood pressure checked regularly at least no you realize that accelerating hypertension is a hallmark of im not a fool doctor id rather move on to something else please my time is too short to spend it discussing what is killing me a wave of pity rolls through me at lenzs relentless questioning why doesnt he leave the guy alone he feels hes onto something baxter says in a taut voice do you think he is diagnosis of a terminal disease is a major stressor it could initiate homicidal behavior in a predisposed individual are you aware that there are some revolutionary new treatments being tried lenz asks in seattle for example theyre using autologous bone marrow transplant im aware of all this doctor lenz doctor lenz thank you i fully understand my situation i wonder if you do im an artist i have no family my priority is my work i shall do the work i am strong enough to do for as long as i can do it when i die my work will live after me thats more satisfaction than most men will ever know wheatons voice is a knife blade of truth and it demands respectful silence the way a prayer does come on baxter says anxiously tapping the console before him get her in there but lenz doesnt know when to quit id like to move on to i apologize mr wheaton kaiser says sharply our photographer was supposed to be here ten minutes ago if go baxter says slapping my knee i throw open the vans rear door and in seconds im clacking across the sidewalk toward the newcomb art gallery fighting to keep my balance in unfamiliar heels my heart pounding against my sternum the smell of oil paint hits me as i go through the door and grows stronger as i move toward the main gallery guided by my memory of a floor plan baxter showed us in the van the entrance area is ornamented with tiffany stained glass panels mounted on both sides of a wide doorway when i walk through i find myself facing a curved white wall then i see wooden framing im looking at the back of wheatons roomsize canvas circle to my right is an opening in the curved wall as i go through i concentrate on baxters instructions to act detached and professional but my first sight of the painting stops me in my tracks the circle of joined canvas panels is eight feet high and at least thirtyfive feet across the scale alone inspires awe but its the image itself that takes my breath away i feel as though ive walked into j r r tolkiens mirkwood a shadowy world where roots wind around the feet and gnarled limbs bind the throat where tangled vines and deadfalls conceal things we wish would remain out of sight through this dark world winds a narrow black stream occasionally rippling white over rocks or fallen branches the scene shocks me because i expected something abstract as all wheatons later work has been this is what lenz meant by a return to your original inspiration i feel i could reach into the painting pick up a twig and snap it in two with a loud crack were the smell of paint and linseed oil not so strong i think i would smell decaying leaves only one curved panel is unfinished and before it stands wheaton himself paintbrush and palette in his whitegloved hands the size of the artist is my second shock the head shot i saw last night gave me the impression of a slight man but that merely proves how deceptive photographs can be wheaton is but an inch shorter than kaiser who stands sixthree he has wiry arms but large hands with long fingers and shoulders only slightly bowed by age his face is so strong that the wirerimmed bifocals he wears i can see the lines on the lenses from here seem merely an ornament rather than functional spectacles at fiftyeight he has a full head of silver hair that sweeps back from his forehead some of it reaching his shoulders and his skin is remarkably smooth he gives the impression of a man who has reached a place of extraordinary peace though from the little i know about his history that is a misconception is this your photographer he asks and then he smiles at me wheatons smile fades as he turns to lenz who like kaiser has not even heard the artists initial question so intent is he on picking up signals of recognition in wheatons face i could save them the trouble this guy has never seen me before in his life yes sir i say loudly trying to snap them out of it wheaton turns back to me what are you here to photograph your work well fire away as long as your pictures will be held by the fbi that is i dont want any reporters seeing this painting until ive completed it absolutely kaiser says finally theyll be held in the strictest confidence kaiser glances at me and i see instantly that he too shares my judgment of wheaton the big vermonter has no idea who i am after this initial moment of confusion i realize how hot it is in the studio kaiser has removed his coat revealing a pointillist abstract of sweat on his shirtfront but lenz still has his jacket on probably to hide a suspicious bulge or trailing wires with the mamiya i used at de becques i take a few flash shots of various panels of the painting but its all a sham many of wheatons paintings will be confiscated as soon as this interview ends which in the true sense it already has i feel guilty being part of this charade knowing how the subsequent acts will affect and confuse the artist who appears willing to do all he can to help us as i work wheaton drags a ladder to the unfinished panel laboriously climbs it then begins painting with small strokes about seven feet up a few times in my career ive sensed i was in the presence of true greatness i have that feeling now i have a powerful desire to shoot wheaton to document the artist at work after a moments hesitation i take a few shots of him and he doesnt seem to mind theres spare film in my fanny pack and in less than a minute im reloading so caught up am i in the essential act of my profession wheaton has a gift that many great men possess the ability to carry on with what hes doing as if no camera were there even as i shoot i know these pictures will be remarkable and some corner of my brain hopes the fbi wont insist that the negatives remain their property lenz and kaiser have moved across the room to confer quietly and i sense that theyre ready to move on to leon gaines sure enough kaiser catches my eye and nods at me to wrap it up theres more film in the van so i finish out the roll before i walk up to the ladder and offer wheaton my hand i dont usually shake hands but in this case i feel i should make some gesture of thanks for his generosity leaving his brush and palette atop the ladder wheaton climbs down and gives my hand a gentle shake even through the cotton gloves i can tell his hand is soft as a womans his disease must keep him from any sort of manual work other than painting thanks for making that easy for me i say the artist smiles shyly its very easy to tolerate the attentions of a pretty girl thank you he looks up his eyes narrowed behind the bifocals have you always worked for the fbi no i was a photojournalist before this is not exactly a lie he studies me a bit longer then smiles again please stop by and tell me about it sometime photography interests me i rarely have visitors anymore mostly due to selfimposed restrictions im afraid ill try to do that mr wheaton says kaiser i want you to know how much we appreciate your help the new orleans police will probably want to talk to you as well my advice is to cooperate as fully as you can despite whatever inconvenience they cause that will end the ordeal sooner than anything else wheaton sighs as though he has some inkling of what is to come dr lenz says we must also ask you to refrain from contacting your graduate students about this or speaking of it in the next few days im sure you understand the artist looks as if he understands all too well good day gentlemen he says and then he turns to me good day my dear kaiser turns to go but lenz hangs back theres one question i forgot to ask is the clearing a real place somewhere near your childhood home in vermont perhaps or is it a place in vietnam wheaton hesitates as though deciding whether to answer at all at length he says ive known several places like this in my life they seemed a sort of nexus to me a place where the power of nature is focused the forest or jungle is there but held in abeyance so that you can see sun and sky theres water but not an overpowering amount of it and then theres the earth you make it sound peaceful says lenz but your paintings arent peaceful some are says wheaton others not nature isnt a kindly force she has many faces and none cares a thing for us or our needs true enough lenz says oh one thing more if you dont mind i want to slap him for his stupid columbo tactics leon gaines paints women exclusively sometimes nude sometimes not frank smith paints nude men have you ever known him to paint nude women wheaton shakes his head frank adores women but only with their clothes on kaiser looks ready to drag the psychiatrist out of the room at last lenz offers wheaton his hand but the artist merely inclines his head in acknowledgment and goes back to his ladder causing me to smile we are nearly to the door when wheaton calls thalia laveau paints women is that important kaiser and lenz are back to him in seconds what do you mean asks kaiser women working in their homes like that no her documentary paintings actually surprised me because the audition paintings she submitted were nude studies of women lenz almost whispers exclusively lenz looks at kaiser who asks do you have any of those paintings no but im sure she does are you going to talk to her kaiser and lenz are staring at each other like hunters who have walked into a thicket after a lion and found a unicorn come on baxter shouts from the open door of the surveillance van get in kaiser and lenz are lost in thoughts of thalia laveau and her nudes but something in baxters voice brings them out of it we scrunch into the cramped van and squat in the heat our faces inches apart ten minutes ago says baxter a finance company repossessed leon gainess van damn it snaps kaiser murphys law the repo guy had apparently tried to get it before and gaines ran him off today he just walked up to the house popped the lock and drove off before the nopd surveillance team could do anything wheres the van now jefferson parish deputies stopped it on veterans highway theyre going to take it to their impound lot and seal it for our evidence team does gaines know the van is gone lenz asks oh yeah hes fighting with his girlfriend right now they can hear him yelling out in the street and parabolics have picked up the sound of slaps and blows lenz shakes his head do we know if he has a gun in there this is louisiana says kaiser assume he does what do we know about the girlfriend names linda knapp baxter replies shes twentynine a barmaid hes been with her on and off for a little over a year so do we talk to him now or do we wait now says kaiser while hes pissed go in hard settle him down then bring jordan in baxter turns to me and when he speaks i smell coffee on his breath this isnt like talking to roger wheaton gaines is a violent felon i signed your release this morning kaisers armed and therell be cops outside im ready baxter hesitates a moment longer then slaps the panel separating us from the vans driver the motor roars and we lurch backward then forward as we roll off of the campus kaiser catches my eye and gives me a nod of gratitude leon gaines lives in a shotgun house on freret street beyond the terminus of st charles and carrollton very near the river its a mostly black neighborhood behind an old shopping center where people mind their own business and a prison record carries no stigma old people sit on screened porches some drinking from paper bags others rocking slowly and watching the cars go past kids too young for school play in tiny yards or the street and knots of schoolage kids stand on the corners our driver circles the block once for us to get a look then stops a couple of driveways up from gainess place baxter opens the door remember whats at stake john this is our only clean shot at him kaiser nods then gets out and starts up the cracked sidewalk dr lenz working hard to keep pace with him after a few seconds kaisers voice comes from the speakers dont react to anything i do act like you expect it even if youre shocked what are you going to do lenz asks whatever feels right and dont let me forget to ask if he knows marcel de becque we forgot to ask wheaton youre right huffs lenz beside me baxter says you missed most of the meeting this morning we confirmed that there was bad blood between de becque and christopher wingate most of the art community knew about it when wingate sold those paintings hed promised de becque de becque retaliated by spiking some big investment deal wingate was involved in we dont have the details yet i can hear gaines yelling from here says lenz sounding nervous here we go says kaiser their shoes bang on plank steps then a screen door slaps against its frame and a hard knocking echoes through the van leon gaines shouts kaiser open up fbi theres a pause then a muffled shout of challenge baxter says this is going to be tricky the unmistakable sound of a door being jerked open comes from the speakers then a new york accent laced with alcohol booms who the fuck are you pencildicks from the finance company if you are i got something for you im special agent john kaiser fbi and ive got something for you leon a search warrant step back from the door fbi a puzzled silence search warrant for what step back from the door leon what is this man this is my house a faint female voice says something unintelligible get back in the bedroom gaines yells i told you twice to clear the door says kaiser do it now or i move you out hey no problem but i need to see that warrant first a scuffling noise is drowned by a grunt of shock by lenz and vocal complaint by gaines what did kaiser do i ask gripping a metal rack rail moved him out of the door says baxter like he said he would with a con you have to establish dominance quickly weve got two choices here leon kaiser says in a voice i hardly recognize we can talk to you or we can search this dump right now i want to talk if i like what i hear we might not have to search if i dont like what i hear well have to search and we might conceivably stumble across some drugs or a gun either beef would put you right into angola what do you want to talk about art art who art leon your paintings oh eleven women have disappeared from new orleans over the past year and a half you know about that yeah so what do you know about it what i see on tv we found a series of paintings that show these missing women in the paintings the women are nude and posed like theyre asleep or dead eyes closed skin pale like that so the last sold for over a million bucks do i look like i just made a million bucks to you your paintings reveal a predilection for violence says lenz who the hell are you this is doctor lenz leon says kaiser you speak to him with respect or youll be funding the vaseline concession at angola thats the only real selfhelp program that means anything there gaines says nothing the artist painting these pictures doesnt sign his work but weve found some rare sable brush hairs in the paint on some of them sound familiar theres a pause as gaines works it out its those expensive brushes wheaton got us right right you tracked brush hairs from hong kong to tulane thats what we do leon we can track pubic hairs from an algiers whorehouse to your ass if we need to i want some answers you waste five seconds of my time youre on your way up highway sixtyone gaines says nothing where were you three nights ago after the opening at the museum right here can anybody verify that linda gaines yells clipping the mike lenz is wearing theres a pause then kaiser says ms knapp whos asking says a scratchy female voice im with the fbi could you tell us tell these guys we were here after the noma thing gaines cuts in they dont believe me shit mutters baxter thats right the woman says we came straight home i was bored everybody thinks theyre hot shit at those art things we were here all night can anyone else confirm that asks kaiser no says gaines we were having some quality time you know right kaiser says wearily thats all gaines says dismissing his girlfriend as he would a waitress she your steady alibi leon asks kaiser dont know what youre talking about tell me about roger wheaton what about him why did you want into his program rogers the man what do you mean he does his thing and doesnt give two shits what anybody thinks about it and because hes done that his whole life hes now a rich and famous man you want to be rich and famous too leon whatever do you like wheaton whats to like or not like the guy paints thats it do you respect him the guys dying but he keeps working and he doesnt bitch i respect that you see the piece hes doing now the room thing yes its tearing him up doing that hes got all kinds of joint problems his tendons or something enthesopathies lenz says whatever he has to climb that ladder and sit there for hours holding his neck in one position its worse than the sistine chapel michelangelo had scaffolding so he could lay on his back you know and wheatons hands sometimes his fingers turn blue man blue first white then blue sometimes even kind of black theres no blood going to them and he cant paint or anything else its agony but he just sits down and waits until it stops then goes right back to work you clearly respect him says lenz and i suspect you dont give respect easily you got that right i think roger saw a lot of shit in the war hes got wisdom and he knows how to pass it on by example what about frank smith asks lenz gaines makes a spitting sound you dont like smith frankies a silverspoon butt pirate from westchester he walks like he has a dildo stuck up his butt and he preaches every time he opens his mouth what about his paintings gaines laughs in derision the nude fag series very tasty you seen any of them he cops the old masters so the stuff looks less like porn then pawns it off on ignorant queens from new york its a sweet scam ill give him that id try it myself but i have this aversion to anal penetration you know but hey maybe thats just me what about thalia laveau asks lenz another pause as though gaines is debating whether to answer shes a tasty piece if you like dark meat which on occasion i do she doesnt look black but shes got the blood all right darker the berry sweeter the juice right what about her paintings asks kaiser she paints the poor and downtrodden who wants to buy that a few guilty liberals from new england she ought to go back to stripping she told you she stripped for money asks lenz a newcomb art history chick told me she and thalia munch carpets together on occasion dont tell me you guys didnt know do you know a man named marcel de becque asks lenz never heard of him were going to want to take some pictures kaiser says in a detached voice our photographer was supposed to be here already but im sure we can find something to talk about in the meantime baxter slaps my knee go and if it gets rough hit the floor he opens the door and im on the concrete moving up the line of shotgun houses to the sound of r kelly coming from a boom box i nod to the porchsitters wholl assume from my clothes and the camera around my neck that im what i used to be a newspaper photographer sent down here for pictures of a corpse or drug activity the green paint is peeling from the walls of gainess house and the screen on the door is a rusted patchwork of orange and black i feel a moments trepidation as i reach for the handle but the knowledge that kaiser has a gun settles me enough to knock and go through the door the first thing that hits me is the smell the scents of paint and oil that made wheatons studio so pleasant are here smothered by the stink of mildew stale beer rotting food tobacco and marijuana kaiser lenz and gaines practically fill the front room which is long and narrow and throws me back to the countless shotgun houses i visited when i worked for the timespicayune whos this asks gaines theres a strange caesura as kaiser and lenz judge his reaction to me i force myself not to look at him by busying myself with my camera past the camera i see a brown sofa pitted with cigarette burns and a threadbare carpet stained with drops of oil paint the walls are bare but for an airbrushed elvis on one wall and a small but elegant abstract over the sofa a large easel stands the corner nearest me a dirty cloth thrown over it shes our photographer says kaiser he points at the easel is that painting yours yeah gaines replies and from the sound of his voice i can tell hes still looking at me i give him my face searching his eyes for signs of recognition theyre dark coals set in yellow sclera and they look permanently wide like a hyperthyroid patients the effect exaggerated by dark halfmoons beneath them a limp black perm hangs over his forehead and three days growth of beard stubbles his face in person his skin has the sickly white pallor of a snakes belly its not hard to imagine him rolling a lawn mower over a live cat take the sheet off the painting so she can shoot it kaiser orders maybe i dont want it shot till its finished maybe somebody somewhere gives a shit what you want kaiser walks over to the easel and yanks off the sheet because i expected so little gainess painting is startlingly powerful a lankhaired blond woman with a hard face sits at a kitchen table in the harsh light of a bare bulb shes surrounded by dirty cereal bowls and fastfood bags and her shirt is open to the waist revealing small sagging breasts her hollow eyes look out from the canvas with the sullen resignation of an animal that has helped build its own cage its hard to imagine such truthful art coming from the creature standing across the room but talent isnt handed out on a merit system i set the flash on the mamiya and start shooting doing my best to ignore gaines whose eyes i feel like greasy fingers on my skin after ten shots i turn to the small abstract on the other wall its different from gainess work but it looks like an original some female art student probably gave it to him after he slept with her who painted that i ask shooting a snap of the small canvas roger gaines replies roger wheaton asks lenz yeah gaines moves closer to me i can tell you like my picture you ought to come back later and let me paint you i would laugh were the situation not so grave shut up you cheating bastard i whirl to find the blond woman from the painting charging into the room wild eyes flash in her pale face and a livid red mark the size of a fist covers one cheek from eye to mouth the center of it already turning dark get back in there gaines yells his right hand balled into a fist kaiser interposes himself between gaines and the girl whos wearing only a thin nightgown has this man assaulted you miss he fucked me over is what he done hes a goddamn liar he said i was gonna be a model have you modeled for him without clothes hell yes he hardly lets me put anything on but he dont want to paint he just wants to fuck that and get stoned all day every day and once he gets stoned he cant even do that get out goddamn it gaines screams raising his fist the girl looks at me with a defiant rage dont let them crazy eyes get you honey hes a loser like youd know gaines yells this ladys got class the woman laughs yeah that means she dont lay down with trash like you gaines lunges at her but kaiser does something with his foot and suddenly gaines is on the floor clutching his knee with both hands the girl laughs hysterically and points at gaines i think youd better come with us kaiser tells her i got nowhere to go he cant find me we can arrange a shelter a protected place for real you try it slut gaines groans kaiser looks over at lenz you have any questions the psychiatrist shakes his head maybe i will go with you the girl says to kaiser when he nods she runs into the back of the house and after a crash and some scuffling sounds returns with a purse and a grocery bag filled with clothes you can forget what i said before she says i dont know where he was three nights ago he was supposed to come back after the noma opening but he never did gaines stares up from the floor with murder in his eyes well leon says kaiser i think youve got a problem the nopd will be in touch just a second says the girl she reaches down beside the sofa and comes up with half a glass of what looks like flat beer she gives gaines a vicious look then splats the beer against the painting on the easel you got all youre gettin out of me scumbag gaines roars in fury and she darts through the front door lenz follows her and im close on his heels surprised by how badly i want out of this selfcreated hell hey picture lady gaines calls after me you know where to find me when you get an itch i turn back in time to see kaiser crouch beside gaines blocking my line of sight at first i think hes whispering something but then gaines screams like a woman and the girl starts laughing on the porch lenz sticks his head back through the door and stares transfixed as kaiser stands face placid and walks toward us what the hell was that lenz asks i dont have the patience i used to kaiser mutters once on the sidewalk kaiser signals to someone i cant see a man in plainclothes and a shoulder holster jogs up the street confers with kaiser then leads gainess girlfriend away the three of us gather by the opened rear door of the van and baxter looks expectantly at his two emissaries what do you think its not gaines says lenz baxter looks at kaiser john i dont know lenz snorts weve already wasted too much time lets go see frank smith he sure reacted to me i say softly like a hound to a bitch says lenz thats all that was you didnt spook him a bit hed never seen you before baxter is watching me what did you think about him i know he seems too obvious but there was something in him that scared me like all that attitude was covering up something else something that repelled me on a whole other level does that make sense yes says kaiser i felt it too the quality of his painting surprised me he really sees into the women he paints baxter says he had a painting by roger wheaton on his wall he did kaiser replies im surprised he hasnt sold it for dope already wed better check with wheaton to make sure he didnt steal it adds lenz drop all that says baxter nopds ready to go in now and tear the place apart is that what we want theyre bound to find drugs or weapons says kaiser we could put him in angola and see if the kidnappings stop do you really expect more kidnappings i ask now that were this close we dont know how close we are says lenz our interest might cause a more conventional serial offender to slow down but whoevers behind this has no reason to for all we know the painter is a replaceable element in the equation if they want another woman theyll take one they might even do it just to show they can no one questions lenzs use of the plural pronoun dont arrest gaines kaiser says if hes involved well learn more by trailing him than jailing him baxter looks at lenz who nods baxter presses a button on the console and speaks into his headset mike ed roust gaines but if you can keep from arresting him wed like you to leave him in place same search everything just leave him home thanks ill see you at the four oclock meeting baxter takes off the headset and looks at me ready for frank smith hes got to be an improvement over gaines cleaner anyway says kaiser baxter knocks on the front panel and the van screeches onto freret street headed for the more agreeable ambience of the french quarter roger wheaton called smith and warned him were coming baxter says pulling off his headset wiretap just picked it up were parked across the street from a beautiful creole cottage on the downriver side of esplanade the eastern border of the french quarter for the past two years its been the home of frank smith why wouldnt wheaton warn him asks kaiser we asked him not to says lenz and now theyre tearing his house apart and informing him hes going to have to supply skin and blood for dna testing to compare to the skin we took from under the dorignacs victims fingernails the call actually makes wheaton look less suspicious kaiser says hes not stupid he knows hes a suspect which probably means a wiretap but he made the warning call anyway thats what somebody does when theyre innocent and pissed off unless they do it to look innocent says lenz why didnt he warn gaines i ask maybe he doesnt like gaines kaiser says with a laugh thats not hard to imagine did he warn thalia laveau asks lenz not yet baxter replies only smith im very fond of frank says kaiser those were wheatons words in the interview i wonder if there could be a homosexual link lenz says wheaton has never married says baxter why didnt you ask him if hes gay hes never married he may be in the closet says lenz i didnt want to burn my bridges with him entirely we can find that out elsewhere kaiser moves to the rear door frank smith is openly gay maybe hell tell us he looks at me see you in a few minutes he and lenz leave the van and slam the door baxter presses his face to the vans tinted porthole window the house doesnt look as fancy as i pictured it youre looking at the back i tell him most of these houses face inward some onto courtyards others onto fantastic gardens of tropical plants john told me about your natural light theory this house does have a courtyard smiths the only suspect who has one wheaton has an outdoor garden but no walls hey look at this i put my cheek to his and my eyes to the darkened porthole frank smith stands waiting for kaiser and lenz on his porch hes sleek and handsome his dark tan set off by white tropical clothing linen or silk he has large vivid eyes and an ironic smile on his lips look at this guy says kaiser over the monitor speaker a smartass i can tell already ill be primary lenz says through the speakers frank smiths voice has the festive tone of a man greeting party guests hello are you the gentlemen from the fbi when do the storm troopers arrive jesus mutters kaiser there arent any storm troopers mr smith because of certain evidence youve become a suspect in some very serious crimes theres no way to sugarcoat that were here to ask you some questions youre not here for a blood sample urine perhaps no were here to talk well i dont have an alibi for the night the woman was taken from dorignacs i was here alone listening to music through the window i see smith hold out his hands as if for handcuffs lets get it over with were just here to talk kaiser insists foreplay for the police smith asks in a taunting voice we dont control the police in this town i thought after all the corruption scandals here you did beside me baxter says hes pretty wellinformed for a recent transplant not many years ago police corruption and the citys homicide rate were at an alltime high two police officers actually committed murder in the execution of a robbery and the chaos that followed almost resulted in the justice department federalizing the new orleans police force we can talk here in a civil manner says kaiser or the police can haul you downtown smith laughs my god its humphrey bogart in elevator shoes why dont we go into the salon ill have coffee brought in footsteps and a closing door echo in the van then more footsteps please sit smith says theres a groan of springs compressing under dr lenzs weight juan three coffees please si the guy has a servant says baxter shit my student days were a little different mr smith lenz begins im arthur lenz a forensic psychiatrist this is special agent john kaiser hes a psychological profiler for the bureau two van helsings in my salon should i be flattered or insulted whats he talking about asks baxter van helsing was the professor who hunted dracula i tell him this is going to be fun i can tell put the tray there juan thank you theres a pause then smith halfwhispers im still training him he has a long way to go but hes worth it how do you take your coffee doctor black please same for me says kaiser theres a tinkle of china more groaning of springs im not sure where to begin lenz says we let me save you both some time smith interrupts youre here because of the women whove been vanishing youve discovered that the series of paintings known as the sleeping women depicts these women some bit of evidence has led you to roger wheatons program at tulane youre now questioning wheaton and the rest of us before turning the police loose on us and ripping our lives apart roger is very upset and that upsets me id very much like to hear the details of this supposed evidence you sound as if you were already aware of the sleeping women says kaiser i was how did you learn about them from a friend in asia you have a lot of asian friends i have friends all over the world friends colleagues clients lovers about three months ago i heard that paintings from a new series were topping a million in private sales then i heard some were to be exhibited in hong kong ive been thinking of going to view them you were aware of the subject matter asks lenz nude women sleeping was what i understood in the beginning i only recently heard the rumors about the death theory how did you feel about the prospect that women might be dying to produce those paintings a long pause i havent seen the paintings so thats difficult to answer lenz sips from his coffee cup we can hear it over the mike do you mean the quality of the paintings would determine your view of the morality of women dying to produce them to paraphrase wilde doctor theres no such thing as a moral or immoral painting a painting is either well done or badly done if the paintings are beautiful if they are indeed great art then they justify their own existence any other circumstances involved in their creation are irrelevant that sounds familiar says kaiser how so asks smith do you know a man named marcel de becque no hes a french expatriate who lives in the cayman islands i dont know him but theres a certain irony in the name whats that asks lenz emil de becque was the french expatriate in south pacific son of a bitch hisses baxter i can feel lenzs embarrassment through the ether youre right he says id forgotten perhaps this man took the surname as an alias de becques father went to southeast asia in the s says lenz maybe michener heard the name and gave it to one of his island characters ill tell you someone i did know says smith this should get you hot and bothered christopher wingate this time the silence is longer why would you bring up christopher wingate asks lenz lets not play games doctor i heard about wingates death i knew he was the dealer for the sleeping women i thought nothing of it at the time but now that the paintings are connected with possible murders i see his death in a different light how did you know wingate asks kaiser a mutual friend introduced us at a party in new york i was considering switching from my present dealer to him why because he was in a word hot im going to ask you a sensitive question says lenz please dont take offense this is very important im on pins and needles lenz is probably furious at being mocked but he soldiers on is roger wheaton gay smith barks a little laugh thats hard to read did you ask roger that no i wasnt sure and i didnt want to offend him im offended for him not because of anything to do with being gay but because of the invasion of his privacy when people are dying private matters often must become public if you wont answer the question i will have to ask wheaton is that what you want me to do no very well after a thoughtful pause smith says i wouldnt say roger is gay what would you say hes a complex man ive only known him personally for two years and all that time hes been seriously ill i think his illness has caused him to concentrate on nonsexual areas of his life have you ever seen him out with a woman lenz asks or with a woman at his home roger doesnt go out hes either home or at the university and yes he has female guests overnight i dont think so does he have particular male friends i flatter myself that im his friend have you been his lover no would you like to be asks kaiser yes i would listen to this guy says baxter cool as they come would you have any problem giving us your whereabouts on a particular set of dates asks kaiser i wouldnt think so but let me be frank about something gentlemen ill cooperate with this investigation up to a point but if the police upset my life to an inordinate degree without direct evidence against me ill institute legal action against both the police and the fbi i have the resources to vigorously pursue such an action and with the recent history of the nopd in this town id say my chances were good so be forewarned theres a silence i can only interpret as shock i doubt that representatives of the fbi are accustomed to being talked to in this way by serialmurder suspects psychology happens to be a particular interest of mine doctor smith goes on i happen to know that the incidence of homosexual serial killers is zero so i think youd have some difficulty persuading a jury that im a good candidate for harassment in this case we dont necessarily believe the painter is the killer in this case lenz says but were not focusing on you as a suspect youre simply one of four people with access to particular brush hairs taken from sleeping women canvases tell me about these hairs kaiser quickly summarizes the link between the factory in manchuria the new york importer and wheatons special orders when he finishes smith says so many questions behind your eyes agent kaiser like little worms turning you want to know everything how exactly does it work does frank really take it up the bum is he promiscuous you have images of the old bathhouse scene in your mind i was there for it all right the tail end of it i was only seventeen i sucked till the muscles in my face cramped does that make me a killer listen to this guy says baxter why do you live in the french quarter rather than close to tulane asks kaiser the lower quarter is a haven for gays didnt you know there may be more of us here than there are of you you should come back on gay pride day and see me with my entourage im quite a celebrity down here tell us about your fellow students says lenz what do you think of leon gaines pond scum roger gave him a matched pair of abstracts as a gift small but very fine leon sold one of them two weeks later for heroin im sure i didnt have the heart to tell roger and gainess work his work another laugh the violence has a certain authenticity but i think of leon as a graffiti artist a boy painting dirty words and symbols on a wall he wants desperately to shock but he has no real insight so the ultimate effect is flat what about thalia laveau thalias a lovely creature lovely and sad why sad have you talked to her yet no she suffered terribly as a child i think she carries a great deal of pain around what about her paintings theyre charming a sort of tribute to the nobility of the lower classes a myth to which i dont happen to subscribe but one she somehow manages to bring to life on canvas have you seen any of her nude work i didnt know she did any what do you think of her skill as an artist thalia has a gift she works very fast probably because she sees to the heart of things so quickly shell do well if she sticks with it why wouldnt she as i said she has a certain fragility fragility at the center of toughness like a nautilus hidden within a shell what about roger wheatons work asks kaiser rogers a genius smiths tone is matteroffact as though hed said the sky is blue one of a handful ive met in my life why is he a genius asks kaiser have you seen his work some of it you dont think hes a genius im not qualified to make that judgment well i am roger isnt like the rest of us he paints from within utterly and completely i try to do it and i like to think i occasionally succeed but the external is an important part of the process for me i plan i use models rigorous technique i strive to capture beauty to freeze and yet animate it roger doesnt use models or photographs or anything else when he paints the divine simply flows out through his brush every time i look at his canvases i see something different particularly the abstract ones do you know anything about the clearing he supposedly paints is it a real place i assume it is or was but i really have no idea i dont think it matters its just a point of departure for him the way a cliff might be the point of departure for an eagle it may well matter in relation to these crimes says lenz are you really looking at roger as a suspect thats ludicrous hes the gentlest man i know also the most ethical did you know he killed several men in vietnam asks kaiser i know he was in the war he doesnt talk about it but surely you dont consider killing in combat to be murder no but a man whos killed once can kill again perhaps more easily than some others perhaps have you ever killed anyone agent kaiser yes in war yes as a civilian in the line of duty yes ill bet you have theres violence in you i can see it id like to paint you sometime im not available youve seen some terrible things havent you its a tough world frank isnt it dr lenz has seen things too but they dont affect him the same way evil and brutality offend you you have a strong moral streak a compulsion to judge this is a waste of time kaiser says testily our photographer should be here any minute baxter takes hold of my elbow move go go go outside the van i look both ways then cross esplanade my eyes on frank smiths cottage it presents a simple face to the street four windows three dormers and a gabled roof with a door where the porte cochere would have been a century ago my knock is answered by a beautiful hispanic boy of about nineteen juan i presume jes he says im from the fbi im here to take some pictures si follow me as he leads me through the entrance hall i realize that smiths creole cottage has been transformed from humble nineteenthcentury abode into a showplace for antiques and art to my right is a luxurious dining room with a regency table empire chandeliers and a huge mirror over a french commode on the wall above a hunt board hangs a lifesize portrait of a nude man reclining on a chaise he looks vaguely familiar largeboned but not wellmuscled yet his face has a remarkable nobility the picture is languidly erotic with full frontal nudity and looks as though it could have been painted in the s senora juan says please a few steps and a left turn take us to the salon where the others sit drinking coffee this room too is stunning with oriental wood screens and an aubusson rug the size of a wading pool frank smith looks up as i reach the door and though i intended to keep my eyes on my camera i find myself looking square into smiths face the young painter has seagreen eyes an aquamarine shade ive only seen in the eyes of women theyre set in a deeply tanned face above a roman nose and sensual mouth both his face and body have a remarkable symmetry and he looks lean and muscular under his white linen clothes suddenly recalling my purpose for being here i blink and turn to kaiser im sorry im late what do you want me to shoot anything by mr smith here frank smith hasnt taken his eyes off me and im eerily certain that he has seen me before me or my sister that possibility closes my throat and brings sweat to my face the nude in the dining room is mine smith says i nod and manage to speak one sentence i wont be a minute i beg your pardon he says have we met i clear my throat and look at kaiser half hoping hell draw his gun i dont think so in san francisco perhaps have you been there i live there when im not working yes but not for my god youre jordan glass kaiser lenz and i stare at one another like fools you are smith says i might not have recognized you but with the camera something just clicked my god what are you doing here dont tell me youve joined the fbi no well what in the world are you doing here the truth has a voice of its own my sister was one of the victims smiths mouth drops open oh no oh i see he gets to his feet and looks as though he wants to hug me as though the tragedy had just happened actually thats not true i dont see at all kaiser is glaring at me like i shouldnt have given away the game but once smith recognized me there was really no point in continuing we were identical twins i explain the artists eyes narrow as he tries to understand it doesnt take him long youre a stalking horse theyre using you to try to panic the killer into revealing himself i say nothing smith shakes his head in amazement well im happy to meet you despite the circumstances i love your work i have for years thank you how did you recognize her asks lenz smith directs his answer to me someone pointed you out to me at a party in san francisco i stood within three feet of you for twenty minutes talking to someone else i wanted to meet you but i didnt want to intrude as i look back at smith the portrait in his dining room clicks in my mind is the man in the dining room painting oscar wilde his eyes light with pleasure yes i used the photo on the cover of the ellmann biography for his face and various other photos to get an idea of the rest of his body wilde is a hero of mine i love the cottage i tell him laying a hand on his arm to gauge his reaction he clearly enjoys it do you have a garden smith beams of course follow me without paying the slightest bit of attention to kaiser or lenz he escorts me to the front door which leads to a walled garden filled with citrus plants roses and a gnarled wisteria thats probably as old as the house one wall of the garden is formed by an old servants quarters which appears to have been converted into a wing of the cottage rushing water from a threetiered fountain fills the courtyard with sound but what holds me rapt is the light glorious sunlight falling softly through the foliage with the perfect clarity i remember from marcel de becques sleeping women its lovely i say softly wondering if my sister ever lay unconscious or dead on the paving bricks before me you have a standing invitation id love to entertain you please call anytime my second invitation today i just might do that footsteps sound on the porch behind us kaiser says mr smith wed like you to keep ms glasss presence in new orleans to yourself spoilsport smith retorts cutting his eyes at me theyre no fun at all are they and please do not contact thalia laveau about his visit anger flares in smiths eyes stop giving me orders in my own house in the awkward silence that follows i suddenly want out of this place away from this man who could have been the last person my sister ever saw we really must go lenz says no rest for the wicked smith quips his humor inexplicably back in gear taking my arm he leads me back through the house to the porch facing esplanade avenue remember he says youre always welcome i nod but do not speak and without a word to kaiser or lenz smith turns and goes back into his cottage leaving us on the small porch so much for the element of surprise kaiser says as we cross through traffic to the van how about that picture of oscar wilde beautifully done says lenz who appears preoccupied by something smith reminds me of dorian gray i think aloud a beautiful amoral man who will never age why amoral asks kaiser not because hes gay no its something i sense about him hes like de becque yet different somehow what do you think doctor lenz has a strange smile on his face you know what no one remembers about dorian gray what he murdered a man then bribed a chemist to come to his house and destroy the body the chemist used special compounds to burn the corpse until there was nothing left youre kidding says kaiser no wilde was ahead of his time in many ways dorian grays theory of murder was no corpse no evidence no crime thalia laveau lives on the second floor of a threestory victorian rooming house near tulane university nine other women and two men live in the house which is a nightmare for the nopd surveillance team seven doors twentyone groundlevel windows and two fire escapes parked on the studentdominated block we hunch inside the fbi surveillance van like j edgar hooverera gmen spying on outside agitators the plan is for john to take the lead on laveau baxter says looking at dr lenz does anybody want to change that before you go in kaiser and lenz glance at each other but neither speaks i do i tell them all three men look at me in confusion what do you mean asks baxter i want to go in alone what they cry in unison this is a woman guys maybe a gay woman ill get twice as much out of her as you could the point isnt to get something out of her baxter reminds me its to find out whether shes seen you before and therefore your sister and since no one else seemed to recognize you except smith who didnt try to hide it this interview may be critical i look him dead in the eye do you really believe a woman is behind all these disappearances or even involved let her do it says dr lenz surprising me the odds that laveau is involved are low and her nude paintings will probably tell us more than she will but if jordan can gain her trust we might learn something valuable about one of the men you saw how smith responded to me i press baxter i think he would have opened up to me if id been alone wheaton too smith was responding to your fame says kaiser who looks uncomfortable with the idea not your gender if you went in alone what would you say asks baxter i wont know that until i get there thats the way i work the isu chief looks tempted but worried jesus the liability what liability im a private citizen walking up to someones door if she invites me in so what what if she sees you and freaks asks kaiser attacks you if shes involved thats a real possibility i wouldnt turn down a gun if you offered me one baxter shakes his head we cant give you a gun how about some mace we dont have any this is a bad idea says kaiser its better than sending you and lenz in there i insist look ill know whether shes seen me before as soon as she answers the door then ill tell her you guys are outside ill tell the truth im the sister of one of the victims trying to find some answers and the fbi is kindly providing some protection for me let her go lenz says we need to know what laveau knows this is the best way to find that out he looks at kaiser you disagree kaiser looks like hed like to argue but he doesnt put the wire on her and ill stand just outside the house with a receiver he watches me his hazel eyes intense if you sense it going bad in any way yell for help and i mean yell no codes that can be misunderstood that works for me baxter says lets move before laveau decides to go out and get her hair done get the t off kaiser tells lenz who removes his coat and starts unbuttoning his shirt his elbows bumping us in the tight quarters baxter unstraps the tape from lenzs ribs and kaiser chuckles at the psychiatrists grimaces shell see that transmitter under this blouse i point out holding out the thin cotton youll have to wear it under your skirt says lenz cradling the transmitter dangling antenna and microphone in his hands do you have more tape baxter digs into a metal drawer and comes up with a roll which he hands awkwardly to me this is no time to be shy i tell them pulling my skirt up i am wearing underwear and very nice underwear it is says dr lenz looking at the cream silk bikinis come on tape it on i dont really know what im doing lenz protests give me that snaps baxter he takes the transmitter from lenz and under the close scrutiny of the other two leans over and tapes the transmitter and antenna securely to my inner thigh high enough to give me goose bumps despite my bravado about modesty when hes done he hands me the tiny microphone which is connected to the transmitter by a thin wire run that under your waistband and up to your bra why dont you guys shut your eyes for this part they do and i secure the mike between the cups of my maidenform with the tiny clip attached to it ready or not i say softly lets do it they open their eyes and kaiser opens the back door remember says baxter you get a weird vibe sing out and the cavalry will bust in there nothings going to happen laveaus rooming house needs a new roof and a coat of paint neither of which its likely to get in the next ten years the door to her secondfloor apartment stands at the head of some rickety wooden steps attached to the peeling clapboard exterior of the house i cling to the handrail as i climb the steps since im about as comfortable in heels as i would be in snowshoes the door and facing are scarred from years of careless tenants i knock loudly and wait after a moment i hear footsteps who is it calls a voice muffled by the wood my name is jordan glass i want to talk to you about your paintings silence then i dont know you how did you know where to find me roger wheaton sent me theres a sound of bolts sliding back then the door opens to the length of a chain lock one dark eye peeks out and examines me who did you say you are so much for my face rattling her into a confession ms laveau do you know about the women whove been disappearing from new orleans over the past eighteen months two were taken from tulane do i know about them ive been carrying a gun for three months what about them one of them was my sister the dark eye blinks im sorry but what does that have to do with me i found some paintings of the victims the paintings were in hong kong but the fbi found special sable paintbrush hairs stuck in the paint and they traced them to roger wheatons program at tulane the eye widens then blinks twice thats crazy paintings of the kidnapped women yes theyre all nudes and the women are posed like theyre either asleep or dead ms laveau im trying to find out if my sister is alive or dead and the fbi is helping me or letting me help them rather why would they do that i feel odd talking to a crack in a door but ive done it more than once in my life and you work with what you have because my sister and i were identical twins the fbi is parading me in front of suspects hoping ill rattle the killer into revealing himself or herself asks laveau is that what youre telling me that im a murder suspect because of some brush hairs no one really believes youre involved but the fact that you have access to these special brushes forces the fbi to try to rule you out i guess you want to come in id like to if youll talk to me is my choice you or the fbi thats pretty much it yes the eye disappears and i hear her sigh the door closes the chain rattles and then the door opens again i slip through before she can change her mind and she shuts it behind me facing thalia laveau at last i realize how misleading the photograph of her was in the pictures i saw last night her black hair looked cornsilk fine but it must be kinkier than that because today its done in long thick strings that look like dreadlocks but arent and that hang almost to her midriff her skin is as light as mine despite her african blood but her eyes are a piercing black shes wearing a colorful robe that looks caribbean and her expression is that of a woman comfortable in her own skin and amused by the pretensions of others the overall effect is exotic as though she were a beautiful priestess of some obscure tribe why dont you come into the back she says waving at the tiny front room theres not enough room in here to cuss a cat without getting fur in your mouth her voice is throaty and devoid of accent which tells me shes worked hard to get rid of the sound of her childhood i follow her through an empty door frame into a larger room i half expected a den filled with beads incense smoke and voodoo charms but instead i find a conventional room furnished with rather spartan taste theres a comfortable sofa which she motions me to and a chair with an ottoman which she takes after she sits a heavy striped cat that looks half wild creeps out from behind her chair it gives me a suspicious glare then leaps onto laveaus thighs preens and settles into her lap laveau tucks her feet beneath her and strokes it between the ears she sits with remarkable ease watching me as though she could wait forever for me to explain myself on the wall behind her is a painting of the st louis cathedral in jackson square this surprises me because the cathedral is probably the most overpainted image in new orleans done and redone by students and hacks who hawk them to the tourists in jackson square it seems an unlikely adornment for the apartment of a serious artist though this rendering seems several cuts above the usual did you paint that i ask laveau chuckles softly frank smith painted it as a joke a joke i told him he wasnt a new orleans artist until hed painted the cathedral so he took an easel walked down to the square and sat for four hours you never saw anything like it by noon all the artists in the square had gathered round him like the pied piper they couldnt believe how good he was that sounds like him youve talked to frank yes suddenly selfconscious i pull my skirt down over my knees to be sure she cant see the transmitter taped to my thigh who else roger wheaton gaines so you saved me for last is that good or bad the fbi suspects you the least she smiles revealing white teeth with a hint of gold toward the back thats good to know did your plan work did any of the others freak out when they saw you its hard to say laveau nods acknowledging the fact that i cant be completely candid about some things were you close to your sister the question takes me aback but i see no reason to lie not in the way most sisters would say they were but i loved her good what was your name again jordan jordan glass i like that however things were between my sister and me i have to find out what happened to her i understand do you think she could still be alive i dont know will you help me find out how can i by telling me what you know about some things her lips disappear between her teeth and for the first time she looks uncomfortable talk about my friends you mean is leon gaines your friend she wrinkles her lip in distaste may i call you thalia yes i wont lie to you thalia after i leave the police are going to come here and question you about your whereabouts on the nights the women disappeared will you have any trouble giving alibis for those nights i dont know i spend a lot of time alone what about three nights ago after the noma event confusion clouds her eyes the papers said the woman taken that night was unrelated to the others i know the fbi has its own way of working then oh god hes still taking them and you think i i dont think anything thalia i was just asking a question and hoping you had an answer that could keep the police off your back i came straight home and did some yoga it was a weeknight and i wasnt feeling well did anyone see you or call you anyone who could confirm that lines of worry now i dont remember i dont think so like i said im alone a lot i nod uncertain which way to go with her you are too arent you she says my first instinct is to change the subject but i dont sitting here facing this woman ive never met it strikes me that ive been surrounded by men ever since i arrived from hong kong theres agent wendy of course but shes fifteen years my junior and seems almost like a kid thalia is close to my age and i feel a surprising comfort with her a kind of relief in the essentially feminine security of her home i am i concede what do you do how do you know i do anything how do you know im not a housewife because you dont act like one and you dont look like one even in that skirt you should pick a better disguise than heels next time unless you have plenty of time to practice in them i cant help but laugh my sister was a housewife before she disappeared i mean im a photojournalist successful yes she smiles ill bet it feels good doesnt it that validation it does youll get there too i wonder sometimes thalia strokes the cats back and with each caress it rises against the pressure of her hand i see you want to ask me questions go ahead ill tell you if i mind some of these questions are the fbis but if i dont ask you they will id rather have you ask them why did you leave terrebonne parish and go to new york have you ever been to terrebonne parish yes surprise flickers in her eyes really i worked for the newspaper here once a long time ago i spent a few days down there then you know why i left what i remember is people who didnt have much in the way of material things but loved the place they lived she sighs bitterly you werent there long enough why did you want to study under roger wheaton are you kidding it was a oneinamillion opportunity i always loved his paintings i couldnt believe it when he selected me you submitted female nudes for your audition paintings yes her hand goes to her mouth my nudes make me look like a suspect dont they to some people why did you switch from nudes to painting people in their homes i dont know frustration i guess my nudes werent selling except to businessmen who wanted something for their offices something arty with tits you know i wasnt put on earth to fulfill that function no have you seen any of my work no its just a feeling i have about you thats interesting thalia do you know a man named marcel de becque she shakes her head who is he an art collector what about christopher wingate no hes a big art dealer in new york then i definitely dont know him i dont know any big dealers youll never know this one he was murdered a few days ago this sets her back a little was he part of this the disappearances hes the man who sold the paintings of the victims the series is called the sleeping women may i see one do you have a photo or something no i wish i did are they good connoisseurs say they are do they sell the last one sold for two million dollars god she closes her eyes and shakes her head and the woman looked dead in that picture yes the buyer was a man of course yes a japanese isnt that typical what do you mean a dead naked woman sells for two million dollars do you think another type of painting by the same artist would have sold for that a landscape an abstract i dont know of course it wouldnt rogers paintings dont sell for that they sell for a lot a quarter of that and hes been working for decades now that i think about it youre right this artists first paintings were more abstract and they didnt sell what started the phenomenon were the ones where it was clear the women were occidental nude and asleep or dead thalia sits with her mouth shut tight as though she refuses to lower herself to discuss what makes her so angry tell me about leon gaines what do you think about him leons a pig hes always sniffing around telling me what hed like to do to me he offered me five hundred dollars to model nude for him i wouldnt do it for ten thousand would you model nude for frank smith for five hundred id model for frank for free but he only paints men what about roger wheaton a strange smile touches her lips an emblem of private thoughts that will not be shared roger would never ask me to model for him hes still distant after two years i think i intimidate him maybe hes attracted to me and doesnt want to cross some line i dont know hes a complex man and i know hes sick he doesnt talk about it but i can read the pain in his face once i walked into his studio when he was buttoning his shirt and his chest was covered with hemorrhages from coughing its in his lungs now whatever it is he feels something for me but i dont know what hes almost embarrassed around me i think he may have seen some grad students paintings of me in the nude does he know youre gay thalias body stiffens and her eyes go on alert has the fbi been spying on me no but the police have you didnt notice them i saw some cops watching the house i thought they were narcs staking out the two guys who live here no theyve only been on you for one day though she looks relieved the fbi does want to know whether youre gay or not they do a lot of psychological profiling in these cases and they feel thats important she purses her lips and looks at the coffee table between us then raises her eyes to mine do you think im gay yes she smiles and strokes the cat im strange i dont really fit anywhere i have a sex drive like anyone else but i dont trust it it betrays me it makes me want to use sex to get noticed so when i need someone i go to women what about love and tenderness i have friends mostly women but men too do you have a lot of friends not really i have colleagues people who do what i do and understand the demands of my life we share experiences but its not you know the real thing and i spend so much time traveling that its hard to make new friends i have more exlovers than friends she smiles with empathy friends are hard to find when youre forty you really have to open yourself up to people and thats hard to do if you have one or two friends left from childhood youre lucky i left the place i grew up like you did do you have friends left back home one shes still down on the bayou we talk on the phone sometimes but i dont go back to visit do you have any kids no you i got pregnant once when i was fifteen by my cousin i had an abortion that was that oh i feel my face growing hot im sorry thats why i hate the place my father abused me from the time i was ten my cousin later it really messed me up i ran away when i was old enough but it took me a long time to come to terms with it ive never really gotten over it i cant have a man on top of me no matter how much i might care for him thats why i choose women its a safe harbor for me i used to think that might change but i dont think it ever will i understand she looks skeptical do you yes were you sexually abused not like that not by family but im suddenly hyperconscious of baxter and lenz and kaiser in the surveillance van monitoring every word i feel like a traitor both to thalia and to myself and i want to yank off the transmitter im wearing but if i did thalia couldnt possibly understand take your time she says would you like some tea i was raped i say softly not quite believing the words as they fall from my mouth it was a long time ago time doesnt mean anything when its that youre right was it a friend no i was in honduras during the war in el salvador i was just starting out really id been photographing this refugee camp with a couple of print reporters and we got separated they left without me and i had to walk back to the town this car came along and stopped for me there were government soldiers in the car four of them one an officer they were polite and smiling they said theyd take me into town i was always really careful but it was a long way back to town i took the ride a mile down the road they turned off and drove me into the jungle so far that no one could hear me screaming i know because i lost my voice that night its all right thalia murmurs im here with you i know but its not all right its never gotten all right im more ashamed of that than anything ive ever done you didnt do anything jordan what did you do you accepted a ride from men who said theyd help you tears of anger and selfdisgust sting my eyes im not talking about the rape im talking about after before they started they tied my hands behind my back there was no way to fight and it went on for hours at some point during the night i passed out at dawn i woke up with my arms numb but my hands free i followed the tire tracks out to the road then limped into town bleeding and crying i didnt tell a soul what theyd done i thought i was so tough but i didnt have the nerve even to go to a hospital i thought if the people i worked for found out what had happened theyd pull me out of there before i knew what hit me not to protect me but because theyd think i couldnt handle myself you know i hate myself for that fear ive been haunted ever since by the women who might have been raped after me because i didnt report those men thalia slowly shakes her head there were probably women before you and women after but its over now youve punished yourself enough those soldiers are dead if theyre not physically dead their souls are what matters is how you are now thats the only thing you can change i know that your head knows it but not your heart thats where you have to know it jordan i know i try youre afraid for your sister arent you afraid shell have to go through something like that or worse okay but look what youre doing youre doing everything humanly possible to find her more than any other relative of these women ill bet i have to know thalia you will honey youll know she lifts the enormous cat and sets it on the floor then walks over and pulls me to my feet come in the kitchen im going to make you some green tea im sorry i did this youre the first person i ever told that to and i dont know why i did i dont even know you thalia laveau places both her hands on my shoulders and looks deep into my eyes you know what what you just found a friend at forty a strange feeling akin to religious absolution rolls through my chest now come on in this kitchen girl thirty minutes later i walk down the rickety stairs and hear john kaiser whispering to me from the corner of the house this way jordan i dont want to see him but theres no avoiding it when i go around the corner he falls into step beside me im sorry we heard that he says im sorry it happened to you i dont want to talk about it i must be walking very fast because even with his long stride kaiser is having trouble staying beside me im sorry about the way i talked about the rape roger wheaton stopped in vietnam he says the van comes into sight rolling slowly toward us along the street what do you want jordan just tell me i want to go to my hotel and take a shower youre on your way and i dont want to ride in the van ill get a car here ill wait with you then drop you okay i dont look at him i feel a powerful irrational anger toward him and at the knowledge that he desires me he wants to hold me now to comfort me but he cant only a woman i foolishly believed could have been involved with my sisters disappearance could comfort me and she has already done what she could the surveillance van stops and its rear door opens kaiser trots over behind the door then jogs back to me a surveillance car is on the way in one minute youll be on your way to your hotel okay i fix him with a level gaze thalia didnt know me shed never seen me before in her life which means shes never seen jane you got that right right good in the shower in my hotel room my composure finally blows apart spinning images through my head without coherence wingate trying to save his painting flames licking at his feet soldiers tying my hands and pressing my face into the jungle floor my brotherinlaw kissing my neck trying to bed the ghost of his wife de becque watching me with a glint in his eye as he doles out bits of information about my father i turn the water as hot as i can stand it my eyes closed against the spray even as i see the four strange souls i encountered today a dying man a violent man a feminine man and a wounded woman yesterday i had some hope of resolution i was fooled by the confidence of men in their systems and their evidence by the illusion of progress by the belief that time must inevitably yield some answer but deep down i know that time like fate operates under no imperative what are those men saying now after the failure of their grand plan baxter lenz kaiser they paraded me past their suspects and saw not one flicker of panic not even a flinch at my face a telephone is ringing at first i think its in my head because its impossibly loud then i pull back the shower curtain and see a phone mounted on the wall low by the commode i press my right palm into the white towel on the rack then pick up the receiver yes its john john kaiser he sounds uncomfortable oh what is it im still downstairs why were about to have a meeting before the official task force meeting baxter lenz bowles and me i know youre upset but i thought you might be more angry if you missed it im in the shower its basically going to be a wake right i dont think so i just spoke to baxter on my cell he says he has a couple of new things what things i wont know till i get to the office as badly as i want to crack open the minibar and flop onto my bed wrapped in towels i know hes right ill feel worse if i dont go give me five minutes kaiser hangs up undoubtedly thinking that no woman he ever knew could go from naked in the shower to ready in five minutes hes about to get a lesson this time we meet where we did the first time sac bowless office kaiser leads the way with a perfunctory knock and though i hear voices the office appears empty through the long window to my right lake pontchartrain looks gray against the afternoon sky dotted with a few lonely sails walking farther in i see baxter lenz and sac bowles waiting in the private seating area in the deep leg of the l bill granger the violentcrimes supervisor shakes kaisers hand on his way out and gives me an embarrassed nod clearly he was in the loop that heard the transmission from thalia laveaus apartment wonderful kaiser and i sit side by side on a sofa facing baxter and lenz sac bowles has a chair to himself on my right no one looks happy but neither do they look as dejected as i would have expected they do look surprised to see me you did a firstrate job today jordan baxter says in a chamberofcommerce voice too bad i didnt shake anybody up he looks at kaiser weve got forty minutes before the joint task force meets and i want to go in there solid as of now we have two agents on separate planes escorting all the evidence the nopd gathered today to the lab in washington everything from paintings to dna samples the director himself put an expedite on it which means a twelvehour turnaround on some tests twentyfour to fortyeight on others three days on the dna if were insanely lucky three days says kaiser id have been shocked at three weeks couple of the victims families have a lot of stroke and thank god for it baxter glances at me as though wondering whether to reassure me that the fbi works every case with equal fervor but he doesnt everyone in this room knows that if the eleven missing women were crack whores the evidence on those planes could languish in the lab for weeks before we decide where were going he says lets take stock of where we are todays interviews didnt produce the result wed hoped for why not two possibilities says lenz one none of the four suspects is the unsubpainter this theory is unanimously supported by our art experts who say the sleeping women werent painted by any of the suspects two one of the suspects did recognize jordan but fooled us by keeping his cool when she came in or her cool baxter reminds him nobody fooled us says kaiser except maybe frank smith he was startled by jordans face but he explained it by saying hed seen her at a party some time ago a virtually uncheckable explanation baxter looks at lenz what did you think about smith brilliant gifted sure of himself of the four hes the most capable of putting this thing together what about the first possibility none of the four is our unsub the brush hairs brought us to these four says kaiser i trust physical evidence more than i trust art experts the evidence brought us to those four and the fifty undergraduates who could get access to the special brushes lenz points out how are we coming with them no student has been questioned directly baxter replies because of their age and because so few could be talented enough to have painted the sleeping women theyre a lowpercentage shot also the minute we start interrogating tulane undergrads the medias going to blow this case wide open weve been lucky so far very lucky i say quietly i wonder why the new orleans medias not that aggressive says bowles i dont know why they could push a lot harder than they do but once they get hold of it says kaiser itll be a feeding frenzy and with roger wheaton involved not to mention rich pissedoff parents and their lawyers youll get national press dont forget jordan says bowles with a nod in my direction she adds a little marquee value forget the media for now says baxter nopd says none of the suspects seemed anxious about providing a dna sample if one of them had snatched the dorignacs woman he wouldnt have been cool about doing that if the painter just paints says lenz and someone else does the snatches the painter would have nothing to fear from a dna test even if the unsub only does the painting says kaiser he should have been stunned by jordans face true kaiser looks at baxter whats the new development you mentioned on the phone i would have led with this question but i guess these guys have their own rhythm even though the timing of wingates murder and the dorignacs snatch were only two hours apart says baxter ive had a halfdozen agents working around the clock checking flight manifests and interviewing passengers who traveled between new york and new orleans in surrounding hours it finally paid off what do you have one hour after wingate died a lone man paid cash for a flight from jfk to atlanta then cash again for a flight to baton rouge on a different airline who was he i ask dr lenz crosses his legs and answers in a pedantic voice a false name of course it could be that the unsub who killed wingate was already in new york when you upset the applecart in hong kong he silenced wingate then flew straight or almost straight to new orleans to warn his partner if you study the timing it could be that he arrived only six hours after the dorignacs woman was taken the plan may have been to paint her but the new york unsub made the prudent decision do her and dump her baxter gives the psychiatrist a sharp look thats possible but no matter who the new york unsub is or what he did after the dorignacs victim was kidnapped someone already in new orleans had to kidnap her probably the painter a few moments of silence pass as this sinks in you have a description of the new york unsub asks kaiser very general midthirties to midforties muscular hardlooking face casual dress clothes hes probably the guy who flipped jordan the bird after the fire sock cap i ask half jokingly theres something else says baxter linda knapp gainess girlfriend the one who trashed his painting and left with you guys turned back up at gainess place thirty minutes ago nopd wouldnt let her near gaines but she told them that whatever nights they needed alibis for he was home with her getting drunk or screwing her silly i recall how angry and desperate to get away from gaines the woman had looked now shes back with him protecting him from the police this is a common mystery ive never understood and am not sure i want to has knapp been with gaines for the past eighteen months no says baxter gaines named another girlfriend as his alibi for the murders that predate his relationship with knapp were trying to locate her now as far as the others alibis heres where we are based on creditcard activity roger wheaton and frank smith were both in town for every murder leon gaines and thalia laveau dont even have credit cards initial questioning by nopd hasnt turned up any rocksolid alibis its not surprising really almost all the kidnappings happened during the week between ten pm and six am what about smith asks lenz surely he has some sleepover lovers who could alibi him for at least one murder none he named today baxter replies maybe hes protecting somebody someone in the closet says sac bowles what about juan i ask the butler or whatever he was we didnt know about him till today says baxter nopds talking to him now he tried to slip out but they got him looks like an illegal salvadoran now i realize why he looked familiar i spent a good bit of time in el salvador seeing faces much like his what else do we have asks kaiser what about soldiers wheaton served with convicts gaines shared cells with ive got two lists says baxter i thought you might want to talk to the vietnam vets as the men work out these details a strange epiphany occurs at the dark center of my mind the paradox of expert opinion versus physical evidence has been slowly working itself out there ive thought of a third possibility i say quietly kaiser waves his hand to silence the others and they turn to me what is it he asks what if one of the four suspects we saw today is doing the murders but doesnt know hes doing them no one responds baxter and kaiser look stunned by the suggestion but dr lenz is sanguine how did you come up with that asks the psychiatrist the old sherlock holmes theory after you exclude all impossibilities whatever you have left is the solution however improbable it may seem we havent excluded the other possibilities says baxter not by any means were not getting anywhere with them either kaiser looks thoughtfully at lenz what about that the psychiatrist makes a noncommittal gesture with his hands as though considering the idea for the first time youre talking about mpd multiplepersonality disorder its extremely rare much rarer than films or novels would have the public believe in all my time at quantico i never saw a proved case kaiser says when it does happen says bowles what causes it severe sexual or physical abuse during childhood says lenz exclusively what do we know about the childhoods of the three men i ask recalling thalias confession of sexual abuse we know laveau had that kind of problem not much says baxter wheatons childhood is pretty obscure all we really have is the standard bio that appears in articles certainly nothing about abuse we do know his mother left the home when he was thirteen or fourteen which could be a sign of some kind of abuse but we dont have details and if the children were being abused why not take the children with her we should ask wheaton that says kaiser what about leon gaines i ask ill bet there was some abuse there undoubtedly says lenz he spent time in a juvenile reformatory which is a highpercentage indicator for abuse but the kind of radical psychological break im talking about has its roots much earlier in a childs life i look at baxter didnt you say his father did time for carnal knowledge of a minor a fourteenyearold girl baxter nods thats right wed better dig deeper on the father frank smith says kaiser what do we know about his childhood wealthy family says lenz not the kind where abuse would be reported ill try to contact the family doctor as we ponder this angle in silence the sacs phone rings bowles goes to his desk then motions baxter to the phone baxter identifies himself asks some questions i cant quite hear then hangs up and returns to us a tight smile on his lips what is it asks kaiser frank smiths salvadoran butler just told nopd detectives that roger wheaton has visited frank several times for extended periods at night hes stayed over twice kaiser whistles no kidding baxter nods and get this on those nights hes heard them screaming at each other heard it through the walls this image is hard for me to reconcile with what ive seen of both men but dr lenz looks more excited than ive seen him to date weve got to see both of them again he says no doubt agrees baxter how should we approach them lenz purses his lips but says nothing i think i should talk to frank smith i say firmly they all look at me alone asks baxter he invited me back didnt he thats your best shot of finding out about those visits she got laveau to trust her kaiser reminds them i say let her do it baxter looks uncomfortable and turns to lenz for an opinion the psychiatrist shrugs i know youd prefer some other way but smith really responded to her we have to go with the best odds baxter sighs okay jordan will talk to smith arthur and i can see wheaton kaiser says we should have the phone company fault their lines we dont want any more warnings passing between them sounds like a plan baxter concludes how much of this do we give the task force all of it says kaiser theyve proved trustworthy so far if we hold out without reason were only screwing ourselves the multiplepersonality theory as well asks lenz no says baxter thats the kind of exotic speculation they rib us about so lets play it down unless we have some reason to think its the right track he glances at me something other than the sherlock holmes theory at least a belated smile tells me he said this in fun any last questions kaiser flicks up his hand like a schoolkid this morning you said you had that argus computer program chewing on digital photos of the abstract sleeping women has it turned up any recognizable faces theyre looking more human says baxter but none matches any murder victim or missing person in the new orleans area over the past three years whos making those comparisons couple of agents i borrowed from counterintelligence answers the sac good men twenty years in between them id like to see whatever argus spits out says kaiser ive studied a lot of victims faces in the past few months will you see to that patrick says baxter bowles nods well get you copies of every image emailed from washington as we decrypt them i hope youve got a lot of time on your hands baxter looks at his watch we need to go turning to me he says jordan more than ever we need you to stay isolated from any friends from your former life here no problem im beat im going back to my hotel ordering room service and racking out do you trust your brotherinlaw to keep quiet no problems there his eyes linger on mine ive already gotten wendy a room next door to yours just yell out if you need help i nod preferring wendy travis to a stranger though i sense potential complications from her presence baxter slaps his thighs and stands and the other men follow suit like football players rising from a huddle lets go talk to the boys in blue says baxter black and blue says kaiser the nopd wears black and blue baxter leads the way to the door headed for the emergency operations center which i have yet to see bowles follows and lenz falls into line behind him only kaiser hangs back contriving to walk beside me as i move toward the door so youre going to bed early he says softly yes i pause at the door and watch the others move down the hall but maybe not to sleep call me from the lobby looking up the hallway he touches my hand and squeezes slightly then without a word follows dr lenz i give him a few seconds then go around the corner to the elevators where i find wendy waiting for me ive been asleep for a while when the phone rings beside my bed the tv is still on set to hbo but the sound is muted i shut my eyes against its harsh light and pick up the phone hello its me im downstairs john kaisers face appears in my mind what time is it well after midnight god the meeting went on that long the police questioned each suspect for hours and we had to hear it all i rub my cheeks to get the blood moving is it still raining it finally stopped you were sleeping werent you half sleeping if youre too tired thats all right part of me wants to tell him im too tired but a little tingle between my neck and my knees stops me no come on up you know the room number yes will you get me a coke or something on the way up i need some caffeine regular coke or diet what would you guess regular good guess on the way i hang up and stumble into the bathroom the fuzzy heaviness of fatigue telling me the last few days have been more stressful than i thought leaving the bathroom light off i brush my teeth and wash my face for a moment i wonder if i should put on some makeup but its not worth the trouble if he doesnt like me as is it wasnt meant to happen i am going to have to do something about the babydoll nightgown though the short pink horror looks like something a s sorority girl would have worn when i first saw it i wondered if the fbi agent who bought it for me was playing a joke on me but she probably has one just like it in her closet at home i slip off the gown and replace it with a white cotton tshirt and the jeans i wore yesterday kaiser knocks softly to keep from alerting wendy next door i check the peephole to make sure its him then quickly open the door he steps inside then smiles and sets two sweating coke cans on the desk he opens one and hands it to me thanks i take a long sip that stings the back of my throat you tired pretty tired how do you feel about the case he shrugs not great do you think wheaton and frank smith are lovers i dont know what else those visits would be they could be anything discussions about art thats not what my gut tells me mine either whats the deal with lenz he doesnt want to say much in front of you does he since leaving the bureau hes found out how quickly you can be forgotten hed like to show that what quantico has now is the second string he wasnt surprised when i asked if one of the suspects could be killing people without knowing it he didnt seem to be kaiser gives me a knowing look do you like that theory no its hard for me to picture someone that messed up pulling off eleven abductions and possibly painting like rembrandt as well but im going to research it anyway try to find out if any of the three males suffered sexual abuse he opens his coke and takes a sip are we going to talk business all night i hope not i go to the far wall and open the sleep curtains exposing a huge window that overlooks lake pontchartrain from fourteen floors up a slightly different version of the view from the fbi field office to the east the lake is a black sea now but for the line of fluorescent lights marking the causeway as it recedes northward into the mist i walk back and sit on the foot of the bed kaiser takes off his jacket and drapes it on the chair back then sits opposite me about two feet away his gun still on his belt what should we talk about he asks why dont you tell me whats on your mind a hint of a smile you are why do you think that is he shakes his head i wish i knew you know how sometimes when you lose something its only when youre not looking for it anymore that you find it yes but sometimes by then you dont need whatever it was this is something everybody needs i think youre right i feel warm inside but a deeper hesitation keeps me from giving in completely to the moment i take another sip of coke i told you about some of my problems with men with dating guys thinking they want me but finding they dont want the reality of my life i remember i want to know about you youre no quitter what really drove you and your wife apart he sighs and sets down his drink can as though it has grown too heavy to hold up it wasnt that i let my work take over my life though i certainly did that if id been a doctor or an engineer she wouldnt have minded it was that the things i saw every day simply couldnt be communicated to someone normal conventional is probably a better word it got to where we had no common frame of reference id come home after eighteen hours of looking at murdered children and shed be upset that the new drapes for the living room didnt quite match the carpet i tried more than once to explain it to her but when i told the unvarnished truth she didnt want to know who would if they didnt have to she had to shut all that out and i got shut out with it do you blame her for that no it showed she had good survival instincts its a lot healthier not to let those things into your head because once theyre in you cant ever get them out you know youve probably seen more hell than i have i dont think you can quantify hell but i know what you mean about communicating it ive spent my whole career trying to do it and i sometimes wonder if ive succeeded even once the pictures ive put on film dont convey a fraction of the horror of the pictures in my head kaisers eyes hold an empathy i havent seen in a very long time so here we sit he says damaged goods what i feel for this man is not infatuation or some neurochemical attraction that compels me to sleep with him its a simple intimacy that ive felt from the hour we first rode together in the rented mustang he has an easiness and also a wariness that draws me to him john kaiser has looked into the deep dark and is still basically all right which is a rare thing i dont look to men for protection but i know i would feel as safe with this man as it is possible to feel so you want kids he says picking up last nights conversation from the camellia grill i think of my niece and nephew and curse their father for screwing up my time with them yes i do youre what forty now yep have to start pretty soon you thinking about the jodie foster solution finding a donor you like not my style do you want kids he looks back at me his eyes twinkling hes clearly enjoying himself yes how many one a year for five or six years my stomach flips over i guess that lets me out of the race im kidding two would be nice though i might be able to handle two after a few silent moments he says what the hell are we talking about the stress maybe were both under a lot of pressure ive seen that start relationships before they dont usually end well you think thats whats happening here no ive been under worse pressure than this without reaching for the nearest woman thats good to know i look him in the eye hoping to read his instinctive response to what im about to say maybe we should spend the night in this bed together if were still happy in the morning you can pop the question he barks a laugh jesus were you always like this no but im getting too old to waste time an absurd image of agent wendy travis comes into my mind shes crouching on her bed next door her ear pressed to a drinking glass that shes pressed against my bedroom wall if youre just up here to get laid i think youll have better luck next door his smile vanishes i like this room just fine i prop my elbows on my knees and set my chin in my hands which puts my eyes inches from his are we nuts no sometimes you just know i think so too i let my right hand fall forward and touch his lower lip so what are you thinking about what your hair smells like he reaches out and touches my hair at the shoulder and i suddenly wish it were longer for him what your mouth tastes like i suspect youre wondering more than that yes but its hard to think about the conversation we just had as foreplay were both in strange businesses you know what they say whats that he asks embrace the weirdness who says that i dont know hunter thompson maybe just lean over here and kiss me instead he takes hold of my wrists and pulls me to my feet which brings my face to the level of his chest then he slips his arms around my waist and looks down at me but does not kiss me he peers into my eyes and pulls my waist to his which leaves me in no doubt about his need for me my skin feels hot and tight itches for the flow of cool air or the touch of his skin im thinking of taking his hand and placing it over my breast when it finds its way there on its own as though moved by the impulse in my mind he gives me a gentle squeeze as if to say here we are we are real in this space and arent we lucky to be here then he lowers his face and touches his lips to mine my heart thumps against my sternum as i knew it would but its nice to have my instinct confirmed how long do we have i ask all night thats the right answer i kiss him again opening my mouth to his then i pull back maybe i should start using your first name now his eyes shine with delight whatever you want well make the first occasion momentous ready ready make love to me john he smiles then lifts me into his arms the way they do in old cowboy movies and i sense the strength in his body i expect to be lowered onto the bed but instead he carries me into the bathroom its been a long day youd like me better after a shower or maybe during one i reply laughing he laughs and sets me on the counter then turns the shower taps steam begins to fill the room as he takes off his shoes jesus i forgot this theres a rip of velcro and then hes holding a small revolver in a ballistic nylon holster the sight of the gun makes something inside me go cold this is for you he says its a smith and wesson thirtyeightcaliber featherweight you know how to use it yes good ill put it out on the desk when he returns i try to shake off the weight of dark memories you know what i like about american hotels i ask what he asks putting his hands on my knees the unlimited supply of hot water you can take a twohour shower if you want to ever done it you better believe it when i land in the us after coming in from the middle east or africa i open a cool bottle of white wine and just sit on the floor of the shower until i wrinkle into a prune well then id better take a quick look before you hit the prune stage he takes the hem of my tshirt in his hands and waits for me to lift my arms i smile and oblige and he slips off the shirt then unbuttons his own and pulls my chest to his this time i initiate the kiss and he breaks it only to say i think the waters ready i wriggle out of my jeans pleased by the fact that i feel no shyness in front of him and step toward the curtain as he slips off his trousers his eyes take me in from head to toe youre beautiful jordan the truth of his belief is plain in his face i feel beautiful right now he takes my hand then pulls back the curtain and helps me into the tub even though i showered only hours ago the shock of the hot water is wonderful and having him under it with me even better he soaps my back and i soap his then we soap fronts which is much more interesting i put my arms around his waist and pull him against me which requires some adjustment on his part its been a pretty long time for me i tell him for me too thats what wendy tells me what she says all the women at the field office lust after you but you havent given in to one of them you know what i like about showers in good hotels he asks with a teasing smile the nozzles are high enough for me to get my head under them i see well are you too tall to put your head down here where it can do some good he laughs then leans down and gently kisses my breast his tongue cool against my nipple in the steam i reach down and run a fingernail along him are you in agony mmhmm he moans good as the hot spray pours over my face and neck one of his hands flattens in the small of my back and the other searches lower then he is murmuring in his throat passing the vibration into me i lean back against one hand and settle upon the other and in this exquisite embrace feel myself becoming as liquid as the water his lips slide up my neck to my chin then my mouth and then a clamorous ringing shocks us motionless fire alarm he asks but the sound dies bathroom phone who the hell is that fifty bucks says its wendy it rings again a maddening klaxon in the tiled cubicle he sighs youd better answer it i reach around the curtain and dry my hand then pick up the phone hello jordan its daniel baxter i mouth baxter to john who quickly turns off the water whats going on ah is john up there with you just a second the tvs too loud i press my hand over the transmitter he wants to talk to you my cell phone battery must have died or you just didnt hear it which would mean baxter knew to try my room second john shrugs hes not stupid you want me to say youre not here he shakes his head and takes the phone whats up boss as he listens his eyes flick back and forth with growing intensity when he asks then he listens some more and i see in his face that we wont be spending the night in each others arms something terrible has happened ill be right there he says right ill leave wendy in the room with her he hangs up his eyes cloudy with confusion what i ask fighting my rising fears they found bodies they found my sister no he takes my hands in his thalia laveau has disappeared daniel thinks shes been taken by the unsub nausea rolls through my stomach thalia but she was under surveillance she purposefully evaded it what he wouldnt give me the details over an unsecure phone i wont know anything more till i get there jesus why her several answers come to me but all i can think of is johns use of the singular pronoun till i get there what was that about leaving wendy in the room with me his eyes dont waver and if he tells me im not going back to the office with him that in essence i am good enough to sleep with but not to take into a meeting where i may not be wanted by some people my mouth and breast are the only parts of me he will ever taste get your clothes on he says youre coming i dont move and neither does he standing naked in the tub with water dripping off us baxters revelation doesnt seem quite real but it is and i have the strange sensation that once we step out of this tub it may be a long time before were this intimate again you okay he asks touching my cheek i guess what about you can you wait until whenever we get back here he nods but his heart is not in his answer do we have thirty seconds to spare he nods again stay here on the counter by the sink is a sampler pack of soap shampoo conditioner and hand lotion i uncap the lotion and get back into the tub im breaking one of my own rules i tell him but you can pay me back later he groans as i close my moistened hands around him but in the few seconds it takes him to lose consciousness my head fills with images of the empathetic woman i met this afternoon the semilesbian sabine artist thalia laveau and my heart balloons with terror for her a woman who fled her home and family to escape sexual abuse who is now at the mercy of a man without mercy a woman i am unlikely ever to see again the emergency operations center which has been kept from me until now is the pounding heart of the nokids investigation its huge more than three thousand square feet with long rows of tables marching toward the front of the room like a high school science lab built to heroic scale behind each row of tables sit rows of men and women with banks of phones before them the unused ones showing bright red decals reading not secure john posts wendy at the door then leads me into the eoc wendy was quiet during the ride over and even when john tried to draw her into our conversation her answers were clipped and professional i felt for her but theres more to worry about now than hurt feelings as john and i reach the first table at least twenty faces turn to mine then look at each other with puzzlement the unspoken question might as well be painted on the air what the hell is she doing in here but after a few seconds they go back to their work at the front of the operations center facing the tables is an array of oversized computer monitors showing views of various buildings the buildings are the residences of the four main suspects plus the woldenberg art center at tulane as i watch a car drives past frank smiths cottage on esplanade im looking at live television surveillance of various parts of new orleans beyond the monitors hangs a massive wallmounted screen with lines of type scrolling down it a few clicks at a time there are time notations beside each line its an unfolding timeline of the entire investigationinprogress reporting everything from the movements and phone calls of the suspects to the activities of the various lawenforcement agencies investigating thalia laveaus disappearance i feel like im standing in the headquarters of big brother in orwells so this is it i say softly where are baxter and lenz baxters right here says a voice behind me as is lenz says the psychiatrist joined at the hip i say turning to face them the isu chief looks as though he hasnt slept for thirtysix hours the dark circles under his eyes have become black bags and his skin has a prison pallor he gives john a reproving glance but voices no displeasure at my presence dr lenz appears to have changed suits and freshened up since this afternoon he probably had an agent chauffeur him over to the windsor court for tea and scones and a midnight rubdown how did she do it asks john ill show you baxter replies he walks up to a technician near the monitors and says something then returns one of the screens goes dark and then were looking at a frontal view of the victorian house in which thalia rented rooms its night and sheets of rain cloud the view as we watch a woman wearing a floppy hat and carrying an umbrella runs out of the house and gets into a white nissan sentra parked on the puddled street thats jo ann diggs says baxter one of the women who rents a room on laveaus floor the sentra pulls quickly away from the curb but a few yards down the street it skids to an abrupt stop then backs up diggs gets out runs back to the house and disappears inside looking for all the world like a woman who forgot her purse or the dvd she was supposed to return to blockbuster about twenty seconds later she hurries back out of the house with a book in her hand trots to her car and drives away that says baxter was thalia laveau the roommate helped her says john laveau was waiting just inside the door she took the hat and umbrella and ran out to diggss car while diggs went back up to laveaus apartment and watched television to cover how did you figure it out i ask earlier today laveau called a woman friend from the campus and made an appointment to meet her at eleven tonight the woman lives on lake avenue on the orleansjefferson parish line when laveau didnt show by midnight the friend called the nopd nopd called us the woman claimed laveau was coming over for tea and sympathy says lenz but obviously it was more than that she evaded our surveillance to protect her lovers identity maybe it wasnt sexuality she was hiding says john laveau could be involved strictly as the painter todays police interrogation could have scared her enough to make her bolt by setting up a meeting with this other woman then missing it she leads us to conclude that shes become a victim baxter starts to speak but exasperation makes me jump in first you guys need a woman on your team around the clock why is that asks lenz to keep your heads out of your asses im going back to my hotel you dont have a prayer of finding thalia with this kind of thinking john says baxter arthur wasnt guessing laveau did evade the surveillance to protect this woman shes gay but very private they had a longstanding relationship only her fear for laveau made her tell us the truth she can alibi thalia not only for the dorignacs snatch but also for at least five of the other abductions i shake my head fighting unexpected tears of helplessness im sorry john says i cant help thinking that way its a habit working out the logic its not you i tell him neither baxter nor lenz speaks and im not sure whether its because of my tears or because they sense our new intimacy i think i have to go i walk past them toward the wide door but baxter calls after me what would you do jordan to find thalia i stop and turn but i dont go back to them id assume the obvious one of the male suspects has been lusting after thalia from the start our questioning rattled him he knows its a matter of time before hes nailed faced with that he decides he has nothing to lose by indulging himself with thalia all three were under roundtheclock surveillance says lenz thalia didnt have any trouble eluding it baxter sighs and turns to john frank smith was in a restaurant at the time laveau left her house and afterward it couldnt be him wheaton and gaines gaines was at his shotgun on freret by the way forensics says his van was clean no blood hair fibers nothing like it was steamcleaned in the last day or two john nods suspiciously but his mind has already gone past this information what about wheaton wheaton was painting at the woldenberg center what about jordans idea of natural light have we got aerial shots of all the courtyards or enclosed gardens in the city thats just not practical says baxter this city stretches over two hundred square miles and thats being conservative the killing house or painting house i guess could be anywhere in that area and owned under a name we cant possibly trace to one of the suspects the painter wouldnt want to drive twenty miles every time he wanted to work on a painting its human nature he wouldnt want to drive any farther than he absolutely has to granted says lenz wheaton and gaines live within a mile of the university frank smith lives at the edge of the french quarter lets get aerial photos of every square block of those areas and throw in the garden district then well look for sheltered courtyards where the painter would have good natural light the leaves are still on the goddamn trees baxter argues we could miss a hundred courtyards in the french quarter alone then get architectural plans john snaps we should have agents at the courthouse doing title searches on every building in those two areas we may find some connection to one of the suspects baxter looks around the operations center and two dozen shocked faces quickly turn back to their work i guess thats all weve got he says other than wheatons nocturnal visits to frank smith and were on that in the morning john says with a tone of finality i do believe the man wants to come back to the hotel with me i just might forgive him his earlier fuzzy thinking about thalia laveau but daniel baxter has other ideas john you coordinate with the aerial surveillance unit if you start making calls now you can have the assets in the air at first light this is obviously a job someone else could do but john has no trouble reading baxters intent he nods wearily then glances my way with a look of apology what time are we talking to smith and wheaton i ask be here by eight am baxter replies agent travis will drive you over the informality of wendy has disappeared baxter obviously foresees potential conflicts developing out of the intimacy between john and me eight then i feel a strangely proprietary urge to give john a kiss on the cheek but hed probably faint from embarrassment so i spare him if you want those pictures to be worth the trouble i tell baxter you should get your planes up tonight with thermal imaging cameras brick and stone will have enough temperature differential with trees and foliage to make plant cover irrelevant you can shoot the same grids in the morning with infrared film for backup detail by ninetwenty you should have sunlight at thirty degrees on both horizons but not much cloud cover thats the best time while the three men stare in amazement i say good night boys and walk to the door where wendy awaits new orleans steams in the morning after rain even with a nip of fall in the air the humidity wilts starched collars almost on contact on this wet morning dr lenz has decided that he wants me in on the second wheaton interview after all im not sure why and i didnt have time to question him about it when i arrived at the field office the building was besieged by camera crews sometime before the early news shows ran the sheriff of jefferson parish announced to reporters that his office working closely with the fbi had developed strong suspects in the series of kidnappings that had plagued the city for over a year thalia laveaus disappearance has already started a new wave of panic across the city this mornings interview will not happen at tulanes woldenberg art center where we last met wheaton today were parked in front of the artists temporary residence on audubon place a private street adjoining the tulane campus audubon place has a massive iron gate complete with stone guardhouse in the tradition of world war ii blockhouses and the massive homes that line it stand out even compared to those on st charles avenue which audubon place intersects the one roger wheaton occupies is owned by a wealthy tulane alumnus whos been living abroad for two years its a palatial house that combined with the lot and its location looks like about two million dollars of real estate but thats here in san francisco the place would cost nine million john lenz and i approach the front door together before we reach it roger wheaton walks onto his porch in blue pajama pants a tulane sweatshirt his wirerimmed bifocals and his trademark white cotton gloves i saw you through the window he says as we mount the steps to the front gallery i saw a report on television about an hour ago has thalia really disappeared im afraid so says john may we come in of course wheaton leads us through a foyer into a magnificently appointed drawing room with his long frame pajamas and toolong hair he looks incongruous in the luxurious chair into which he folds himself only his white gloves fit the room giving him the appearance of a newly wakened reveler sober enough to have removed his tux after a mardi gras ball but too drunk to have remembered to remove his gloves but the gloves are no accoutrements of style they are soft armor for hands that cannot function in the slightest cold john and i sit together on a sofa opposite the artist and lenz takes a chair to our right hello again wheaton says as i sit his long face conveying silent grief are you taking more photographs today i wish i was youre a wonderful subject we just came from working another case says lenz agent travis was with us and we didnt want to leave her in the car agent travis why am i really here is lenz testing wheatons reaction to me yet again gentlemen says the artist do you believe thalia was taken by the same person who took the others yes says john we do wheaton sighs and closes his eyes i was very angry yesterday because of the invasion of my privacy the police caused me considerable inconvenience and they werent even civil all that seems a small thing now what do you require of me john looks at lenz who decides to lead with his chin mr wheaton were told youve made several lengthy visits to the private residence of one of your students frank smith wheatons face tightens this was clearly the last thing he expected to hear did frank tell you that lenz does not respond directly were also told that you argued vehemently with him on these occasions wed very much like to know the reason for these visits and for the arguments wheaton shakes his head and looks away his desire to help apparently gone or at least tempered by disgust i cant help you with that john and lenz look at each other all i can do is assure you that those visits have nothing whatever to do with the crimes youre investigating youll have to trust me that far im sure suspects must frequently refuse to answer fbi questions but its hard to imagine them doing it with such sincerity and gentility id feel almost embarrassed to insist at this point but lenz doesnt im afraid in these circumstances he says your word as a gentleman will not be enough wheaton gives lenz a look hard enough to validate his history as a combat soldier i understand the urgency he says quietly but i cant answer your question john glances at me as though seeking help but i dont see any way to spur the artist into further revelations mr wheaton says lenz i personally dislike having to bother a man of your stature with intrusive questions however the situation is grave and i can assure you that all answers you give will be held in the strictest confidence this of course is a baldfaced lie wheaton doesnt respond i am a psychiatrist lenz says with apparent faith that this assertion should win the day i also dont believe what youre hiding is anything to be ashamed of the artist looks at me with his clear eyes and says why are you really here i am a photographer mr wheaton but i dont work for the fbi and my name isnt travis my sister was one of the victims of whoever is taking these women she disappeared last year and ive been hunting for her ever since wheatons lips part in amazement im so sorry what is your name jordan glass jordan glass well let me assure you ms glass before i ask these men to leave that if i had information which could possibly help those women i wouldnt hesitate to give it to you i hope you believe that i do believe him and i tell him so john gives me a dark look mr wheaton he says i appreciate your desire for privacy but it might be that you have information you arent qualified to judge the importance of wheaton looks at the ceiling and lets his gloved hands fall beside the chair youre saying i might possess information that proves frank smith is behind these disappearances and not know it its possible its not possible frank couldnt have anything to do with these crimes wheatons face is red now and he fixes john with his deepset eyes however because ms glass has made me acutely aware of the stakes in this case i will tell you something thats been bothering me since we last spoke i hesitated before because leon makes such an easy target hes often unpleasant but i think he had a tough childhood and sometimes thats the result lenz is practically licking his chops on the few occasions when i brought my graduate students together says wheaton both at the university and here at this house i observed leon making inappropriate remarks to thalia he also touches her without any sort of permission what kind of remarks asks john overt sexual remarks things like you look like you know your way around a cajun hot link mama it sounds ridiculous doesnt it but thats the kind of thing leon says ive seen him say similar things to female undergrads but with thalia it was something more once i saw him wait for her by her car it was several weeks ago around dusk what happened she handled him with the firmness she always used thalia is a beautiful girl and she seemed accustomed to putting off that kind of attention she drove away alone on that occasion yes i think leon kept at her because he knew she posed nude for a graduate painting class he took this as some sort of sexual advertising he would i think do you recall anything else between the two of them asks john something odd or awkward wheaton looks reluctant to continue on a couple of occasions as i left the art center i saw leon following thalia across the quad closely or from a distance from far enough back to avoid easy detection as though he meant to follow her a long way that could be an incorrect assumption on my part they could both have simply been headed for the university center but that wasnt your impression says lenz no you were right to tell us says john i hope so i strongly believe in the right to privacy as ive already made plain wheaton leans slowly forward then as though the simple act scrapes cartilage from his knee joints he stands and now gentlemen unless you have another warrant up your sleeves i must ask you to leave i need to go to work the artist folds his arms and the white gloves disappear behind his biceps again i hate to intrude says lenz but were unclear on some biographical points in your life wheaton bunches his brows in consternation published interviews say very little about your background beyond a certain point but we know for example that you were reared in a rural part of vermont windham county your father was a farmer wheaton sighs with irritation and a trapper what did he trap beaver fox he raised some mink unsuccessfully thalia laveaus father was a trapper i believe yes thats something we shared stories about could you share some with us not today we also know your mother left home when you were thirteen or fourteen wheaton looks ready to throw lenz bodily from the house i realize this is painful says the psychiatrist but we need to know why did she leave without taking her children with her wheaton swallows and looks at the floor i dont know my father believed she met a man and ran away with him i never did its certainly possible that she fell in love with another man my father was unpleasant to be frank far too coarse for mother but she would never have left me us behind my throat feels tight pressed mercilessly by lenz roger wheaton is articulating my own deepest fear and hope i think she put herself into a vulnerable situation he says and something bad happened to her and either my father didnt tell us about it or no one knew who she really was if she were hiding her identity to be with someone else in new york for example i can see how it would happen was your father unpleasant to the degree that he abused your mother asks lenz by todays standards undoubtedly but this was the s the middle of nowhere did he abuse you and your brothers wheaton shrugs again by todays standards yes he hit us with a razor strop birch rods anything close to hand what about sexual abuse the artists deep sigh conveys utter contempt for the psychiatrist nothing of the kind wheaton wipes his forehead with a gloved hand now i really must insist that you go lenz fires a last shot as he gets to his feet mr wheaton would you simply tell us whether youre homosexual or not it would prevent a lot of further prying into your life bothering of your friends et cetera wheaton seems to sag under the weight of the question the answer is academic im afraid my disease rendered me impotent over two years ago he looks at lenz do you have your pound of flesh now the artist glances at me and the wounded pride in his face makes me look at the floor thank you for your time i say before lenz can press him further i back toward the hallway i appreciate your honesty about gaines it really might help find thalia and my sister wheaton steps forward and takes my hand between his two white gloves i hope so is there really some hope that theyre still alive not much but some he nods maybe someday ill find a way to explain why i couldnt answer the other question so youll know i did all i could i care a great deal for thalia shes a wounded soul you call me if you need to talk or if youd like to take more photographs id like to paint you we could do an exchange i thought you only painted landscapes i was quite a portraitist in the old days he laughs it kept me in pea soup and ramen noodles how is your painting coming the final clearing it looked almost finished when i saw it im very close a day maybe two the president had to close the gallery word has leaked out that im nearly done and all manner of people are showing up to gawk reporters students collectors soon ill attach the final canvas panel to the circle which means youll have to climb scaffolding and descend a ladder to get inside itll be a relief to have it done i would like you to paint me sometime id like to see how you see me frank would do a more professional job but i might see you more honestly than he john and lenz watch wheaton as though each word and gesture are fragments of some code well thanks i gently shake his hand thank you my dear wheaton moves from the door so that john and lenz can get into the hall goodbye gentlemen dr lenz tries to shake the artists hand but wheaton takes a step backward and gives him a tight smile then the three of us are outside again walking toward the fbi sedan parked on the street he just told us to go to hell says john very smoothly lenz agrees but he certainly pointed his finger at gaines after saying nothing yesterday i wonder why he told you why i say irritably he doesnt like talking about anybodys personal business even an asshole like gaines he knows the fbi will turn gainess life into a living hell because of what he just told you yes lenz says thoughtfully he does what did you think about his answers about his mother asks john lenz adopts his professorial tone he doesnt know why she left but he cant let it be because she loved a paramour more than her children as for childhood abuse i dont know denial is classic adaptive behavior without more time with him ill have to think about that one john opens the front door of the car holds it for me and looks into my eyes i hope you have better luck with frank smith i make my own luck he smiles i believe you they faulted smiths phones both home and cell no warning from wheaton this time you still want to go in alone absolutely lets get to the quarter then the medical tape holding the t transmitter at the small of my back chafes as i climb the steps of the creole cottage on esplanade and knock at frank smiths door from the transmitter a thin wire runs around my ribs and up to a microphone clipped to the v of my bra this time the door isnt answered by juan but by the owner himself frank smith smiles broadly revealing the gleaming white teeth of an affluent childhood and leans against the doorjamb with languid grace is this visit social or government business i wish i could say the former but its not smith arches his perfectly plucked eyebrows well then i dont think im at home his moviestar handsomeness is starting to irritate me have you watched any tv this morning no read the timespicayune i took a long bath and had coffee in the garden thats the sum of my morning why may i come in his seagreen eyes narrow dont tell me hes taken another one thalia laveau smith looks confused what about thalia he took thalia last night this is the first time ive seen frank smith lose his perfect control may i please come in he steps out of my way and i walk inside instead of waiting for him to lead me to the salon i walk through the house and make my way to the garden the fountain that filled the courtyard with sound yesterday is switched off now and a blackbird perches on the highest tier theres a small wroughtiron table under the gnarled wisteria and i take a seat there smith sits across the table from me in his fine trousers and royal blue polo shirt he looks less like an artist than a model but theres no denying the quick intelligence in his eyes how could thalia be kidnapped when she was under surveillance he asks why do you think she was under surveillance well i am where are your fbi friends today working but they sent you here to ask me something because i responded to you yesterday i asked to come alone he mulls my answer so im still a suspect what is it you want to know i quickly explain that the bureau knows roger wheaton spent several evenings at this house and also that he and smith argued on some or all of those occasions i wondered why juan didnt show up this morning smith says i suppose they threatened to deport him i dont know what they did frank im sorry and i dont like butting into your personal business but this is life or death thalia could still be alive and we have to try to help her do you really believe that that she could still be alive yes im glad but what youre asking has nothing to do with this case thats what wheaton said smith turns up his palms as if to say next subject look it seems to me there could only be a couple of innocent reasons for holding out one wheaton is gay and you guys have a relationship and two i cant think of a second drugs maybe i think the first reason is it smith is wearing a smug smile and if it is admitting it is the quickest way to get the fbi out of your life they honestly dont care what you or wheaton do for sex what worries them is other possibilities like like you being involved in a conspiracy to produce the sleeping women ridiculous i think so too but i dont run the fbi come on frank whats the deal is roger wheaton gay have you asked him he evaded the question well he would wouldnt he why would he roger grew up in rural vermont hes fiftyeight years old for gods sake hes another generation altogether youre saying hes gay of course he is of course he is smith runs a manicured fingernail along the wroughtiron scrollwork in the tabletop hes simply not comfortable with the kind of attention that comes with being gay and famous are you and he lovers smith shakes his head with what looks like regret no then how do you know hes gay he told you roger ran away to new york when he was seventeen or eighteen how do you think he lived certainly not by selling his paintings are you saying he sold himself we all sell ourselves in one way or another here was this talented handsome kid schlepping his derivative paintings around to all the galleries he got noticed but not for the paintings before long the old queens were fighting to give him a place to live and work they took care of him until he joined the marines you seem to know more about him than anyone else roger confided these things because he knew i would understand and im telling you so that youll do all you can to get the fbi off his back his life is hard enough without that i agree and i will but im not completely clear here if the visits were about friendship what were the arguments about the yelling smith shakes his head again i cant answer that the fbi cant know about that jesus frank i wont give them details ill just tell them im satisfied that the arguments and visits mean nothing i cant do it filled with frustration but also understanding smiths reluctance to violate wheatons privacy i lean forward pull the tail of my blouse out of my jeans and rip the medical tape from the skin of my back as the transmitter falls against the iron seat of my chair i picture daniel baxter panicking in the surveillance van outside i hope he has the sense not to come charging in with his gun drawn im switching off i say loudly dont come in smith gapes as i reach into my blouse and pull the tiny mike from my bra unthread the wire then drop the transmitter on the table between us and switch it off were no longer live frank its you and me he looks ready to throw me out of his house listen to me i say with the conviction of my own pain my sister has two small children that she loves more than her life she was yanked off the street by some predator and shes probably rotting in the swamp somewhere right now there are eleven other women just like her one of them a friend you say you cared for and admired the clock is ticking down on thalias life is it an invasion of privacy for the fbi to learn roger wheaton is gay yes is it a tragedy no if your arguments with wheaton have nothing to do with this case all the effort the fbi puts into investigating them is wasted do you want that wasted effort to cost thalia her life i think youre exaggerating my importance bullshit the fbi doesnt have much to work with and they wont drop this angle until they understand it tell me the truth about the arguments and if its innocent ill tell them to leave you the hell alone smith closes his eyes takes a long breath then expels it slowly and opens his eyes again the look in them tells me this man does not easily grant trust you give me your word not to reveal this to the fbi if its not relevant to the case christ you want me to pinkyswear im not telling them anything they dont need to know to help my sister i dont even like them but theyre the only hope those women and their families have smith sighs and looks over at the old slave quarters that form one wall of his garden a faint scent of lemon drifts into my nostrils its simple he says roger wants me to kill him a rush of heat passes over my face what his disease is steadily worsening its in his lungs now and his other vital organs the end will be unpleasant he wants my help when the time comes i feel like slinking away in shame suddenly everything is clear wheatons reticence most of all if the artists wish to have frank smith help end his life became known to the nopd that might stop smith from risking his freedom to comply no matter where his sympathies lie you get it now asks smith part of it but why the arguments you refused to help him thats right i thought roger might be motivated by clinical depression i thought he had a lot of great paintings left in him i still think so smith gives me a weary look as though concealing the truth is no longer worth the effort but hes wearing me down honestly hes shown me his medical records not to mention his body and im starting to understand how grave his situation is assisted suicide will get you ten years in this state so its not a decision i can make lightly i understand smith looks skeptical do you an awful flash of memory lights my mind i once saw an afghan guerrilla ask his brother to kill him to keep him from being captured hed been wounded during a raid on a russian outpost it was total confusion people running around in the dark russian soldiers screaming afghans howling curses and this poor halfstarved guy shot in the hip he couldnt walk and they couldnt carry him through the mountains he begged his brother to end it for him but the brother couldnt do it the others huddled beside the trail and talked the russians were getting closer finally a cousin went back and cut the guys throat while the others prayed i heard the cousin sobbing as we climbed back into the mountains what an encouraging story im sorry im just i know its a hard thing how did he want you to help him did he have a method in mind how could it help you to know that i dont know im curious i guess insulin insulin its a peaceful way to go he says hes researched it sleep coma then death the problem is that sometimes you dont die you just get brain damage thats why he needed your help yes he wanted me to find some drug that would stop his heart after the coma this was after i told him i wasnt putting a plastic bag over his head and watching him turn blue jesus okay ill tell the fbi theyre barking up the wrong tree thank you smith forces a smile would you like something to drink now coffee a bloody mary i could use a drink but i should go i stand and gather up the transmitter microphone and sticky tape look the jefferson parish sheriff leaked to the media that we have suspects he didnt name names but you might want to get ready for that get a hotel room or something smith shakes his head in exasperation ill do that right after i call my lawyer and tell him to get ready to sue the shit out of the government he stands takes my arm then leads me back through the house as we pass the dining room i glance in at his nude portrait of oscar wilde i really like that picture thanks smith reaches for the doorknob but i stop him by pulling my arm against my side frank tell me one thing the brush hairs led the fbi to four suspects you roger thalia and gaines thalias out if you had to pin it on wheaton or gaines who would you pick are you kidding was leon under surveillance when thalia was taken yes hmm well roger too of course yes a last desperate thought pops into my head has wheaton ever told you he was abused as a child smith sighs angrily i have a good reason for asking i promise he never told me anything like that and if your next question is did i suffer anything like that my answer is fuck you all right he yanks open the door and stands clear of it come again soon now i walk out into the pale sunlight and damp yellow leaves of esplanade and the door closes behind me its been a long time since i felt this low probing private lives has never been my thing all photojournalism is essentially exploitative but in photography the act of invasion is mitigated by the wonderful speed of light which lets you intrude from a distance no messy questions or awkward silences just click click click i turn toward the mississippi river and start to walk knowing that the fbi sedan bearing baxter lenz and john will come alongside at any moment theyll be pissed that i pulled the wire which is fine im pissed that ive played the role of pawn in their deadend investigation id probably feel different if this mornings interviews had produced a lead but they didnt the quiet hum of a motor announces my escorts the sedan pulls up to the curb on my left and when i dont stop keeps pace as i walk baxter rolls down the passenger window and i see special agent wendy travis driving the car her presence tells me john is tied up for the day that im to be left under her watchful eyes yet again why did you kill the wire asks baxter you know why i reply looking straight ahead what did he tell you he convinced me that wheatons visits there have nothing to do with the case baxter glances into the backseat where lenz sits beside john then he looks back at me do you think youre the best judge of that as good as any of you he turns to the backseat again and im certain hes telling john to use his influence to get me to talk baxter may not like me being involved with his old profiler but he doesnt mind exploiting the connection i hope john knows better than to try the car stops the back door opens and john gets out he walks to me his eyes filled with concern what do you want to do he asks softly whatever you say ill make it happen i want to walk you want company no you feel that wheaton and smith are both innocent dont you yes okay im going to go back to the office and study the aerial photos of the courtyards call if you want to talk wendy has a cell phone im going to have company after all john squeezes my forearm then motions to wendy who gets out wearing her usual liz claiborne skirt and jacket combo the jacket there to hide her pistol i resist the urge to say something smart shes only doing her job as best she can she falls into step a couple of yards behind me and the sedan pulls forward and then passes us as it recedes i see john looking back at me over the rear seat his eyes unreadable as i walk along the oakshaded sidewalk of esplanade agent wendy trailing a few yards behind my mind swirls with images i have no desire to ponder and my stomach rolls with the lowlevel nausea ive felt since dr lenz badgered roger wheaton into telling us his disease rendered him impotent years ago frank smiths revelation of wheatons plea for euthanasia only made it worse the impact of my shoes against the sidewalk offers a metronomic distraction from those thoughts so i focus my mind on that from esplanade i turn onto royal street which farther on becomes the center of the antique trade in the quarter but here on the downriver end its a peaceful lane of homes and shuttered warehouses i spent a good deal of time walking this grid of streets when i moved here at seventeen getting to know a world at once seamier and more exotic than the provincial one i left in north mississippi two decades later the sights smells and sounds are the same ornate wroughtiron balconies laden with ferns and flags climb the faces of pastel buildings not so bright as those in the caribbean but festive in their stately way the aromas of baking bread and simmering gumbo drift from the direction of st philip street and shouted cries of the urban new orleans patois collide with rapid precise french spoken by tourists standing on the corner of ursulines just three blocks to my left beyond decatur street and the levee rolls the mississippi river where great ships bob higher than the roofs of the buildings i feel myself drawn toward it but since the water is blocked by the wharf at the end of ursulines i stay on royal walking at a natives clip my inner ear confirms what i have long known that i am below sea level walking in a world that exists only provisionally that a hurricane making landfall here would spill the lake and the river into the quarter like a great bowl and cover everything from the lucky dog men to the tourist traps of bourbon street leaving only cathedral spires andy jackson on his horse and screeching gulls circling the electrical towers at st philip i break left making for the river wendys flats go staccato as she moves to keep pace with me the sound of a slide guitar jangles from the doorway of the babylon club and with every step the quarter grows more commercial there are restaurants and pubs now lawyers offices small hotels yet still the odd doorway leads down a tunnel that opens onto a secluded courtyard beckoning with the promise of midnight trysts and masked soirees i shudder in sudden awareness that the sleeping women may have been painted in one of these courtyards how strange to know that last night while the people down here drank and laughed and loved and slept government planes crisscrossed the sky above shooting thermal images of the buildings searching for a garden private enough in which to paint a dead woman without interruption joan of arc awaits me at the place de france a little concrete island in the traffic she sits high on a golden horse holding a golden flag against the gray clouds an imperfect monument to a woman who overstepped what those in power saw as her place an honest monument would show her burning at the stake wendy moves alongside me here for suddenly we are awash in a sea of humanity surging waves of tourists and cars and french market merchants hawking vegetables coffee and strange souvenirs i can smell the river now a muddy fetid scent on the cool air slipping between two fat creamcolored columns i trot up some flagstone steps and then im looking over a narrow parking lot at the levee and the booms of a freighter whose redpainted waterline floats at the level of my eyes where are we going asks wendy the river theres a walkway on the levee across the streetcar tracks i know the moonwalk she stays at my shoulder as i march to the little streetcar stop at dumaine then cross over the tracks and climb to the brick walkway atop the levee the river is wide here and the water high for this time of year a graybrown flood separating new orleans from algiers pushboats and tugs churn across the water at surprising speed gulls dipping and diving around them we walk toward jackson square and in the distance i see the hotels and department stores of canal place the old trade mart building the aquarium of the americas and the twin bridges arching across to the west bank were not alone on the walkway there are tourists with cameras joggers wearing headphones buskers with open guitar cases full of change and restless bums trying to catch the eyes of passersby searching for likely marks as we approach and pass each i feel wendy tense beside me then slowly relax below us on the right lie the streetcar tracks and the parking lot that runs the length of the quarter to our left the levee slopes twentyfive feet toward the water an earthen wall lined with riprap the heavy gray rocks the corps of engineers uses for erosion control driftwood clogs the riprap at waters edge and every forty yards or so stands a fisherman with a cane pole or rod hoping for a catfish or a gar wendy do you remember the big scandal about fbi lab people giving false evidence testimony dummying up results to give prosecutors what they needed yes she says in an inquisitive tone wasnt it proved that a lot of the bureaus hightech forensic tests werent half as accurate as claimed in some cases but louis freeh made it a priority to correct all that youre thinking about the sable brush hairs im wondering if the four people weve been badgering are tied to this case in any way at all the lab wasnt aiming for some known result in this case jordan they just came up with a rare type and lot of brush hair and one of the few places that lot went was new orleans her answer is solid and that reassures me a little i can hear myself breathing harder from exertion but wendy speaks as though were sitting across from each other at lunch ive never worked a murder case she says but i have total faith in john and mr baxter i nod but my faith is far from complete down at waters edge a huge bearded man in an overcoat looks up the rocky slope as we walk past hes far enough away that wendy doesnt tense but i sense that she could have her gun out in a second or less what was thalia laveau like she asks really nice she had a tough childhood her father and cousin sexually abused her yuck mmhmm she was gay she still is i hope god yes wendys face colors i didnt mean that to sound like it did its okay as we walk on she seems to withdraw into her own thoughts then out of the blue she says i dont want to offend you or anything but i heard during the interview with laveau you told her you got raped once is that true i feel a flash of temper knowing the story is probably making the rounds of the field office but its hard to be angry at wendy whose curiosity seems part of an eternal quest for selfimprovement its true i really admire you for speaking up like that knowing those guys could hear you on the wire it was a long time ago does it feel like a long time ago no she nods thats what i figured have you ever had trouble like that not that bad a baseball player got really pushy with me in college once in the backseat of his car i waited until he exposed himself and then i made him regret it good for you yeah but something like this where they snatch you off the street someone whos all prepared with a rape kit we dont know the victims are being raped i remind her well right except for the woman taken from dorignacs a wave of heat comes into my cheeks i shouldnt assume anything about the others from that wendy goes on we dont know for sure the unsub took her her words stop me dead on the walkway the woman taken from dorignacs grocery was raped wendy looks confused well they found semen inside her she could have just had sex of course but i think the opinion of the pathologist was that she was raped as i stand speechless in the wind a drop of rain touches my face i had thought the police took dna samples from the suspects to compare to skin found under the dorignacs womans fingernails but they had more than that and kept it from me turning left i see a gray line of raindrops advancing across the river with the wind dimpling the waves like soldiers marching over from the algiers shore i just put my foot in my mouth didnt i says wendy they didnt tell you they didnt tell me i guess they didnt want you to suffer any more than you had to with your sister and all my rising anger is dwarfed by hurt at johns betrayal how could he hold this back from me but then come images of jane suffering terror and rape god im in trouble wendy says but instead of asking me to keep quiet she says they should have told you i turn and continue along the levee despite the rain which is light and will probably pass quickly if my memories of new orleans are accurate you know its raining says wendy yes the tourists and joggers are moving a little faster but the fishermen stand their ground knowing the odds favor a quick blowover a clattering racket behind us startles wendy but its only the streetcar in a few seconds it trundles past us and stops opposite jackson square to our right is the burntorange roof of the cafe du monde and the smell of coffee and frying beignets wafts over the levee making my mouth water and my stomach ache pavlovs dog i say quietly can we talk about something personal for a second wendy asks in a hesitant voice i thought we were this is different i know whats coming sure i tell her dreading the questions to follow i think john has a thing for you he does i reply and you have a thing for him yes as a tall man in a sock cap approaches she tenses and waits for him to pass after he does she looks back over her shoulder until hes well away well i know you know i like him john knows too i think i mean hed have to be blind i guess when i feel something for somebody im not very subtle about it nobody is when they really feel something i guess im just not what hes looking for she says her voice remarkably free of selfpity i mean i know he likes me and everything but you know what i mean i know what you mean its never easy she shrugs the weird thing is im not jealous of you if it was another woman from the office i probably would be she kicks a small rock lying on the bricks who am i kidding i know i would be id be comparing myself to her and asking why i fell short but youre different ahead on our right theres a guitarist playing blues on a bench a woman stands behind him holding an umbrella over his head to protect the instrument from the rain a knot of people listens with appreciation probably not as different as you think i tell her im just a woman no you are so many women i know professional women theyre struggling for respect all the time theyre so conscious of how theyre being treated constantly looking for respect that theyre only using seventy percent of their brains for their job sometimes i feel like that but you just go about your business like you never even think about it you just expect respect and you get it im older than you are got a lot more miles on me thats it she says not the age but the miles the fact that youve been all over the world covered wars and stuff seen combat ive never seen john or the sac act the way they act around you with another woman i mean not even with female asacs youll get there its not any great watershed moment though one day you just realize youre part of the game instead of a spectator youre on the inside and theres no getting back out again even if you want to ill be glad when that day comes dont be in too much of a hurry i think about robin ahrens sometimes she was the first female fbi agent to be killed in the line of duty it happened in eightyfive they were trying to arrest an armored car thief and things got confused she was shot by a male agent who mistook her for a bad guy youre curious about what action is like arent you i guess so i mean being on the swat team and all you wonder about the real thing robins story is a textbook lesson combat is total confusion from the first shot combat vets all say the same thing remember your training and dont try to be a hero thats pretty much the bible right there i just want to do my job wendy says not mess up some stupid way and get someone hurt or killed you wont your love life is more complicated than your job ever will be she laughs ruefully youre probably right about that well anyway i know why john is attracted to you and its okay you guys dont have to hide from me or anything i wonder if i could ever summon the selfless goodness that seems to flow from this girl probably not i touch her forearm thanks wendy and i havent slept with him yet if youre wondering i wasnt asking that she says quickly then she bites her lip though maybe i was wondering a little we both laugh and suddenly the day does not seem quite so gray or the rain so cold i wave to the guitarist as we pass him and then were at the artillery park and jackson square just across decatur wait the tourist carriages their horses standing wearily in the rain with a lucky dog man lifting wieners from his steaming cart nearby on st ann the card tables of tarot readers line the cement and sidewalk artists advertise their services with portraits of barbra the duke the beatles and jerry garcia the rains not stopping wendy says maybe we should call for a car in a minute i look to our left where wide wooden steps march right down into the swollen river lets go down to the old jax brewery get some coffee wendy nods but i can see it goes against her instincts i pick up the pace fighting my anger at john for holding back on me the rain has thinned out the walkway traffic but two men are approaching a young one with greasy jeans and an unkempt beard and a few yards behind him a man wearing khakis and a teal ralph lauren buttondown wendy tenses watching the bearded man then glances over her shoulder as he passes while she watches him the man in the polo shirt brings up his right arm and polished nickel gleams in the rain i shout a warning to wendy and before the sound fades shes in front of me her hand flying under her jacket to the pistol holstered there a gunshot explodes over the levee and something hot and wet stings my face wendy seems to stutter in place then falls backward onto the bricks with a flat thump like a sack of sand my white blouse is spattered with a fine red mist wendys blood screams erupt from the parking lot and i sense more than see people diving to the ground the man in the polo charges me his gun pointed at my chest and grabs my arm with his free hand move your ass he shouts dragging me toward streetcar tracks move my eyes are locked on wendy who lies on her back eyes open and fixed on the sky a large bubble of blood on her lips as i stare my captor pulls up his gun and shoots her again this time in the side she doesnt make a sound i try to yank my arm free but he swings the gun in a quick savage arc against my forehead and the world blanks out for a moment move or ill kill you right here a jumble of thoughts his tremendous strength his lack of hesitation in shooting wendy as john predicted the realization that this is no random attack that he shot wendy to get to me that he wants me alive that this is him the kidnapper the unsub the motherfucker who took my sister theres no hunting him anymore hes hunting me and he has me as he drags me toward the streetcar tracks i notice one man in the parking lot whos not lying prone on the gravel both his arms are leveled in our direction and im starting to duck when i recognize john kaiser jordan he cries drop as i start to fall my captor jerks me in front of him like a shield john moves left angling for a shot but im in his way the man holding me throws up his free arm and fires three times quickly in johns direction john spins trying to avoid the shots but his spin continues to the ground and he does not get up dead cop says the voice in my ear the barrel of his pistol touches my temple move he wants me in the parking lot i cant let him get me into a car my mind flashes onto the gun john gave me but its lying useless in its holster in my rented mustang parked at the fbi office the only weapon i have is the knowledge that the man holding me doesnt want to kill me here he has a much more exotic fate in mind i fire my elbow into his rib cage earning a crack and a howl of agony his arm goes limp for an instant and in that instant i wrench myself loose and run back toward wendy an image of her gun in my head but as i near her i realize shes lying on top of the stillholstered weapon if i stop to turn her over hell catch me theres no cover here but the river so i lunge left toward the wooden steps that lead down to the water as i reach the top step a shot rings out behind me dont make me kill you im silhouetted on the edge of the steps like a duck in an arcade and i cant possibly reach the water in one leap im going to have to wait for a better chance as i turn back he marches up with the gun his dark eyes blazing he looks a little older than i am with a shock of saltandpepper hair and a deeply lined face ive never seen his face but i recognize the dark light in his eyes from places i prefer not to remember were going to my car he says if you fight ill shoot you in the spine youll go limp as a rag doll and ill have to carry you but youll still be nice and warm between the legs and youll still make a pretty picture for the man the icy conviction in his voice paralyzes me wiping out every emotion but terror seizing my arm he pulls me back across the walkway his eyes full of purpose thirty yards away john lies on his stomach struggling in vain to reach his knees when we pass him my attacker will fire a bullet into him just as he did with wendy my limbs are heavy with the inevitability of nightmares jooordan the scream stops me cold and in some sliver of a second i know it came from wendy traviss throat twisting my neck i see her lying on her stomach propped on her elbows her pistol clenched in both hands her eyes shining brightly through the blood and rain an arm whips around me to aim at her but i bat it aside and throw myself as far away as i can orange flame bursts from the barrel of wendys gun an explosive grunt sounds beside me my attacker staggers then pulls his gun back up wendys gun spits again he bellows in rage and pain then charges her with blind fury wendy fires again but misses and he starts shooting round after round he misses four times but then wendys head snaps back and im screaming in denial knowing in my bones that shes gone he turns back to me but hes wounded and cant move well blood has matted the teal polo to his chest and shoulder from twenty yards away he raises his gun and points it at me my eyes are full of tears and i can see that hes abandoned his plan he means to kill me now the gun wavers steadies then flies skyward as thunder booms behind me and ricochets back from the far shore i whirl to find john kneeling at the edge of the levee hiscaliber automatic leveled with absolute stillness hit the bricks he yells i dive onto the walkway and john empties his clip blast after blast roaring across the river the echoes of his first shots smashing into the reports of the later ones when i look up my attacker is gone as the last shot fades i crawl across the bricks to wendy hoping its not too late the hair at the back of her head is a mass of blood and brain matter and my heart knots against the truth the first thing i learned in a military field hospital is that visible brain matter means the casualty wont make it get down john shouts find cover i kiss wendys hair then get slowly to my feet and walk to the crest of the wooden steps and look down the man in the polo is doubled over near the bottom step gasping for breath and trying to hang on to a wooden chain post as i watch my heart empty of pity his hand slips off the post and he tumbles headfirst into the river after a moment he bobs to the surface floating in place his mouth opening and closing like that of a landed fish then he slowly turns away as the current takes hold of him i feel no urge to save him but as the current pulls him along the bank i realize that if the river takes him we may never know who he was never find thalia or jane or any of the others or even learn what happened to them hopping over the chain i try to keep pace with him by running along the treacherous riprap navigating the gray rocks without breaking an ankle is difficult and the high water carries him rapidly along not only downriver but into the main channel hes twenty feet from the bank and slipping farther away help he shouts panic filling his dull eyes i cant breathe his lungs are probably filling with blood he could drown internally before the river gets him i cant go in after him he could drown me even without meaning to please he shouts i cant stay up go to hell i yell though i need to save him hes twentyfive feet into the channel now turning in slow circles in the wake of a distant tug spinning away from me he shouts something i cant hear then as his face comes around again he repeats it your sisters alive a bolus of adrenaline flushes through my veins and i have to fight every muscle to keep from leaping in after him thats just what he wants of course he has to be lying where is she i cry save me he yells again i can save her please tell me first his head slips under the water then bobs up again i struggle down to the rivers edge where a big piece of driftwood lies wedged in the rock its a long branch worn smooth by the water on its journey south jordan shouts a voice from miles away its john back at the steps bring him in with the branch i pull at the limb with all my strength but i cant free it from the rocks every second he slips farther downstream my sisters fate going with him i cant save the bastard without jumping in myself and that would be insanity good swimmers drown in the mississippi even without someone trying to kill them suddenly without conscious thought my hand flies to the zipper of my fanny pack and my hand jerks out the canon pointandshoot i used at the gallery fire in new york i point the lens at the drowning man and shoot one exposure then scrabble along the riprap leaping from rock to rock with no regard for my bones trying to get close enough for a clear shot but the channel has him now hes thirtyfive feet out and spinning away as his face comes around again i shoot three quick shots then sprint along the tops of the rocks hoping for another turn when hes forty feet out i get off two more then his head slips below the surface and does not return panting with exhaustion i turn away from the water and climb carefully to the top of the levee john is sitting on top of the steps fifty yards away a cell phone in his hand the sound of approaching sirens rolls over me from the direction of the quarter as i trot down to where john sits he puts down the phone and tightens his belt which he has tied around his thigh youre hit in the leg i ask clearly in great pain he nods then points down the steps go down there and see if you can find his gun he might have dropped it fingerprints i study every inch of weathered wood as i work my way down the steps but theres no gun there is blood and a lot of it look on the rocks just under the water calls john they dont call the mississippi the big muddy for nothing you cant see through it dropping to my knees i feel my way along the first submerged step but a soft splinter is my only reward the second is coated with funk moving sideways i feel among the submerged rocks and again find nothing but as my hand comes out of the water i freeze lying between two rocks in a rainbowed pool of oily water is a cellular telephone retrieving it from the water i see blood on it what have you got john shouts holding the phone by its antenna i climb back up the steps son of a bitch john groans its still on i tell him looking at the waterfilled lcd screen careful he takes the phone by its antenna and holds it before his eyes shit it just shorted out while i was looking at it you can still get prints though right maybe but what we really need is the memory chip this phones getting on a plane to washington dont mention it to any beat cops wait for homicide he points down the levee toward the french market where two whitehelmeted mounted policemen are spurring their horses across the streetcar tracks i sit beside john and in the first seconds of stillness i start to shake i wring my hands trying to make them stop wendys dead i say softly he nods she threw herself in front of me i saw her she did her job she was a good kid she wasnt a kid she was a hero and she worshiped the ground you walked on i know goddamn it she deserves a medal for her family goes without saying so what the hell were you doing here john shakes his head but doesnt look at me i didnt feel good about you walking around the quarter i knew youd gotten upset at frank smiths and ive always felt you were in more danger than anyone realized i also knew you didnt have your gun i squeeze his hand im glad youre paranoid what did the guy say to you down there he said jane was alive john looks at me his eyes hard did you believe him i dont know what i do know is he wasnt roger wheaton or leon gaines or frank smith i know he said something else john what if he had to shoot me in the spine it would still be nice and warm between my legs and id still make a pretty picture for the man johns face pales he said that for the man for the man jesus the clatter of hooves on brick is closer john takes his wallet out of his pants and opens it to show his fbi credentials you lied to me john what the dorignacs victim was raped and you knew it they found semen in her he says nothing at first then the post was inconclusive as to rape you must have asked the husband when he last had sex with her he sighs with resignation okay it was probably rape i didnt want that weighing on you especially before the interviews i didnt want you suffering needlessly and nobody wanted you so mad at the suspects that you couldnt be professional i understand all that okay but dont ever hold anything back again he nods okay nothing john i got it the horses are upon us two cops one black one white stare down with drawn guns get your hands up both of you john holds up his credentials so that the cops can see them special agent john kaiser fbi this crime scene is to be secured for the joint task force ive been shot and i cant walk so you men get to it the wake of wendys death is a blur to me now as i ride the elevator up to the fourth floor of the fbi fortress on lake pontchartrain while john spent ninety minutes in the accident room at charity hospital downtown i sat in a waiting room with enough armed special agents to make me feel like the first lady daniel baxter and sac bowles rushed out from the field office but only to make their presence felt with john and the doctors they sped off to manage the hunt for the unsubs body and a hundred other details leaving me with images of wendy fighting and dying to save me her lifeblood spattered over my chest and the unsubs voice hot in my ear if i shoot you in the spine itll still be nice and warm between your legs i was lucky that one of my new protectors was a female agent she brought me a new blouse from her car and bagged the bloodstained one i wore in case it was needed as evidence but removing the blouse did nothing to erase my waking nightmare john came through surgery fine but his doctor didnt want to release him for twentyfour hours john thanked the man picked up the cane a physical therapist had deposited in his room and limped out of the hospital assuming i was his spouse or at least a significant other the surgeon gave me dire warnings about caring for the wounded leg i promised to do all i could then followed john out to a waiting fbi car where to sir asked the young field agent driving the car he and john were technically of equal rank but in times of crisis a natural hierarchy asserts itself the field office john replied move it baxter lenz and sac bowles are waiting for us in bowless office theyve spent their last hours in the emergency operations center but bowless office has a leather chair with an ottoman on which john can prop his swollen leg how is it john baxter asks as i help him sit down stiff but fine baxter nods in the way ive seen officers do when a needed noncom lies about a wound nobodys going to tell john kaiser to take a medical leave how are you doing jordan holding it together i know that wasnt easy seeing what happened to wendy i start to stay silent but i feel i should say something you should know this she did everything right the first guy coming toward us looked much more suspicious and he diverted her when the welldressed guy brought up his gun she threw herself in front of me and was pulling out her gun as she jumped nobody could have done better nobody baxters jaw muscles clench as pain and pride fight for dominance in his eyes this is the first case where ive lost an agent to a serial offender he says softly now weve lost two it doesnt need saying but im going to anyway we will not rest until every son of a bitch involved is rotting in maximumsecurity lockdown or dead amen says sac bowles ive got a hundred agents downstairs ready to work twentyfours a day wendy had a lot of friends we still dont have his body john asks baxter no the coast guard and contract divers are searching but the mississippi is unforgiving workers go off barges all the time without being found we have to accept the possibility that we may never find his body what about the cell phone john asks no prints no fingerprints on a cell phone how is that possible it was wiped clean he was carrying it wiped this unsub was taking extreme precautions he must have figured that if he dropped the phone during the abduction prints would quickly lead to an id thats the good news i think if we find the body well get a name in no time what about the memory chips inside it the engineering research facility at quantico just got the phone they say if the short didnt fry the chips we could get lucky we should get a report anytime baxter taps his fingertips together like a benched athlete waiting to get back into the game what about my pictures i ask thats the one bright spot they were blurry but usable the university of arizona produced a decent enhancement of the best one and its been running on the local tv stations for two hours three calls so far but they didnt pan out the timespicayune will run the photo in the morning well john halfgroans we got what we wanted we rattled the hell out of somebody we just got a delayed reaction and it was a lot tougher than we expected yep baxter agrees what about the unsubs gun baxter shakes his head the rivers high now and the current fast also the mississippi has a sandy bottom in some places and the water flows through it to some depth heavy objects sink into it in a matter of seconds were making extraordinary efforts but again no great hopes we have to find that body then we can start checking for connections to wheaton gaines or smith where were the three musketeers while this went down john asks all present and accounted for wheaton was painting at the art center had been since you talked to him this morning after jordan left smiths house he lunched at bayona shopped at the hurwitzmintz furniture store then went back home hes presently in the company of a handsome young gentleman weve yet to identify and gaines gaines and his girlfriend woke up at ten am started drinking then arguing they stopped long enough to have sex then passed out theyve been sleeping ever since any of them make suspicious calls john asks in a frustrated voice contacts nothing screw this mutters bowles i say we have nopd pull in all three and sweat them till somebody cracks im worried they may do just that says baxter at this point we have no more leverage to make them talk than we did yesterday we have to id the unsub and find a connection to one of the three the isu chief expels air from his cheeks and looks from john to lenz i want to hear thoughts anything gut feelings twitches psychic waves whatever youve got nows the time what are we dealing with here neither john nor lenz seems inclined to speak first so baxter points to lenz arthur go out on a limb silent until now the psychiatrist leans forward on the sofa i see a paradox one of the unsubs remarks to jordan could indicate that the previous victims have been raped by the unsub then passed on to the artist to be painted yet our art experts say the sleeping women werent painted by wheaton smith or gaines if you look at what the unsub said it doesnt exclude the possibility that he himself was the painter i feel compelled to jump in i dont think a man capable of painting the sleeping women would refer to them as pretty pictures and when he told me youll still make a pretty picture for the man he could have been talking about a buyer rather than the painter marcel de becque says john the guy is deep into this thing im not sure how maybe three or four guys share a similar paraphilia i dont know baxters impatience crackles off him like static electricity i cant believe this is all we have what about jordans splitpersonality idea john asks we didnt get anything out of wheaton or smith on childhood abuse but that concept has stuck with me is it possible that an artist with a split personality could paint in two completely different styles undetectably i mean how different can the personalities be lenz steeples his fingers and leans back they can be so different as to have different physical manifestations there are cases of mpd on record where one personality required heart medication to survive and another did not one may require corrective lenses and the others not or need different prescriptions and there are many lesser manifestations come on says bowles documented fact lenzs voice has taken on a patronizing tone so two completely different painters occupying the same body its technically possible but given the scale of this case the number of victims the extraordinary lengths to which the dominant personality would have to go to conceal his acts from the others wait says john not all the personalities know what the others are doing correct generally one is dominant and knows everything while the others remain partially in the dark jesus says baxter its a fascinating premise says lenz but it verges on pure fantasy the image laypeople have of socalled split personality comes from the strange case of dr jekyll and mr hyde that construct appeals to our sense of evil masked behind a benign public face but clinically thats not the way mpd manifests itself you dont get a benign public person with a diabolical intelligence concealed behind it you get pathetic fragments of personality most of them manifesting as damaged children arrested in development at the age sexual abuse was visited upon them the dominant personality is the one best able to adapt and cope under extreme stress thats all john is nodding a lot of the serial offenders weve caught or interviewed have endured sexual abuse as children but how many had multiplepersonality disorder asks lenz none lenz smiles like a chess master who has led an opponent into a trap before we seriously consider this theory we should fire our art experts and bring in a new group lets do that john snaps were not getting anywhere with the ones weve got goddamn it everyone in this mess knows more than hes saying the suspects de becque even us wingate knew a lot too i tell them i could feel it baxter looks hard at me have you changed your mind about telling us frank smiths explanation for his visits with wheaton or for their arguments an image of smith confiding wheatons desire for assisted suicide flashes through my mind no youve just got to trust me on that does the reason reflect on their psychology asks lenz that could be just as important theres nothing unique about it its something normal people would argue about the phone on bowless desk rings the sac answers then holds out the phone to baxter erf at quantico the isu chief gets up and takes the phone his jaw braced for bad news as he listens his face gives away nothing got it he says i understand what asks john as he hangs up baxter lays his hands flat on bowless desk it was a stolen cell phone reprogrammed no way to trace the unsub from that but erf salvaged the chips they got the speeddial numbers programmed into the phone one belonged to marcel de becque as john pumps his fist in a victory sign a memory of the old french expatriate standing before his great window comes into my mind his cultured voice telling me about my father and the glory days in vietnam baxter presses a button on the phone eoc this is baxter tell me where marcel de becque is right now we sit in silence as baxter waits then his face goes ashen when call the faa and the foreign legats then call me back he hangs up and rubs his hand hard across his chin six hours ago de becques jet left grand cayman the pilot filed a flight plan for rio de janeiro but he never arrived de becque could be anywhere goddamn it says john before anyone else can comment bowless phone rings again baxter activates the speakerphone baxter here weve got chief farrell on the phone for you im ready daniel says a rich africanamerican voice afternoon henry whats up we just got a call about the photo running on tv a widow lady out in kenner says she rents a room to the guy shes dead sure says he goes by the name of johnson and hes hardly ever in town says hes a salesman the address is twotwentyone wisteria drive thats the south side of i right by the airport jefferson parish even baxters poker face betrays excitement as he scrawls on a file folder has the sheriff sent anyone out there yet he doesnt know about it yet i thought id call you boys first baxter looks heavenward with grateful eyes weve got the forensic unit ready to roll well take care of the interdepartmental relations good luck daniel the ladys name is pitre we owe you henry ill get plenty of chances to collect good luck baxter hangs up and looks at sac bowles five years ago would we have got that call not a chance in hell farrells tough hes fired or jailed hundreds of cops in the past five years baxter punches a number into the speakerphone forensics says a female voice twotwentyone wisteria drive kenner take the whole unit sirens everything no but step on it well meet you there were gone mrs pitre lives in a warren of streets just north of the runways of new orleans moisant international airport as baxter lenz john and i roll past cookiecutter houses an inbound jet floats down like a massive bird and passes over our crown victoria with a groundshaking roar lovely neighborhood remarks baxter whos driving you could shoot somebody in the head while one of those planes flew over and nobody would hear it something to think about says lenz whos up front beside him baxter looks over the seat at me sorry jordan dont apologize for the truth john slides his hand across the backseat and covers mine there it is says lenz pointing twotwentyone its a typical suburban tract house when we pull into the driveway i see the roof of a twostory garage behind it the clapboard garage looks like it was added as an afterthought and not by a master carpenter the walls are out of plumb and the roof overhung with branches from an elm that should have been cut before construction as baxter kills the engine a woman with a cigarette in her mouth walks out of the carport door waving a set of keys in her hand though in her late fifties shes wearing a pink spandex tube top and blue shorts that reveal legs shot with varicose veins john reaches for the door handle here we go take your cane advises baxter therell be stairs screw the cane john replies confirming my theory that male vanity is every bit as powerful as the female variety you got here quick ill say that mrs pitre says in a smokeparched voice pitched like a mans ive been worried hed come back before you got here she sticks out her right hand carol pitre widowed four years since my husband got killed offshore special agent john kaiser he shakes her hand mr johnson wont be coming back maam how do you know he gone on another business trip no she cocks her head at john whats he done anyhow why you looking for him the police said he was a federal fugitive but that doesnt tell me anything thats all we can say at this point maam mrs pitre bites her lip and takes johns measure again she decides not to push it what happened to your leg there skiing accident waterskiing the forensic units suburban pulls into the driveway with a roar and a squeal of brakes whos that asks mrs pitre craning her neck they part of your bunch theyre evidence technicians mrs pitre like the oj trial thats right i hope theyre a damn sight better than the ones in los angeles they are mrs pitre we i guess you want to go up now as the doors of the suburban slam a second one pulls in behind it the vehicles arent marked with fbi decals but if you look closely at the grilles you can see blue lights and a siren mrs pitre did mr johnson show you any identification when he moved in hell yes i asked for it didnt i since ray got killed in the mud tank i cant be too careful worlds full of crazy people black or white dont matter these days john seems nonplussed by mrs pitres hyperactive style what did he show you voter registration card for one thing a louisiana card nope new york city he had a new york driving license too he showed you that how else would i know he had it of course did it have his picture on it what good is it without one he wasnt a badlookin man either a little hard in the face but you live long enough life makes you hard isnt that right we would like to go up now mrs pitre is it just one room over the garage two rooms and a bathroom ray built it for joey after we give him that set of drums couldnt stand having him in the house with that racket i dont know if he was any good but he could wake the dead with them i see do you mind if we go up alone we like to see things completely undisturbed mrs pitre isnt overjoyed by this but after a moment she hands over the keys i want a receipt for anything you take youll get that john turns to me and pulls me aside im going up with daniel and lenz for a quick look id like to take you up but it wouldnt fly with the forensic unit im okay go on john confers with the head of the forensic unit who hands him a sheaf of plastic evidence bags then he lenz and baxter climb the stairs inside the garage mrs pitre sidles my way as i watch figuring a woman might give her more information so i flee to the fbi sedan and lock myself in the front seat the roar of an outbound jet rattles the car and my bones and i wonder why mrs pitre isnt as crazy as a road lizard rather than slightly addled as i settle in for a wait john limps down the bottom four steps is it your leg i call getting out and hurrying toward him no theres an evidence bag in his hand he waves to the chief of the forensic unit and a platoon of technicians hurry toward the garage with their cases and bags what is it what did you find the unsub knew we were coming the place was wiped clean like the cell phone all we found was a stash of junk food poptarts potato chips hostess twinkies and beef jerky he must have worn gloves when he bought them but waiting for us on the kitchen counter was a perfect row of photographs a strange chill runs along my shoulders the victims yes how many eleven not the woman from dorignacs grocery and not thalia so he didnt take the dorignacs victim i realize john is still holding the evidence bag whats in that i ask my chest tightening john sighs and touches my arm janes photo if youre up to it id like you to see if you can tell me where it was taken lets see it he hesitates then opens the ziploc and slides out the photo its a blackandwhite print shot with a telephoto lens the depth of field is so poor that i cant distinguish the background but jane is clear wearing a sleeveless sweater and jeans shes looking toward the camera but not into it she looks more intense than usual her eyes narrowed in the way people tell me mine do when im concentrating as i study the image searching for some telling detail anything that might yield a clue to her fate my heart clenches like a fist and my skin goes cold are you okay he asks taking hold of my shoulders i shouldnt have showed that to you when he touches me i realize hes shaking his wounded leg is barely supporting his weight look at her arms john what about them no scars what a wave of vertigo throws me into a spin though i know im standing still jane was attacked by a dog when she was little dog the photo begins to quiver in my hand as realizations clamor for attention ive seen this photograph before but the copy in my hand isnt a true photo print its an inkjet facsimile printed on photo paper fighting tears i press the picture to my chest and close my eyes careful john warns there might be fingerprints look dr lenz says over johns shoulder theres something written on the back john leans forward and studies the back of the print its an address twentyfiveninety st charles thats jane lacours address says lenz theres a phone number too sevenfiveeight onenineninetytwo i ask no john says softly its a new york number we need to trace this right away he reaches for the picture but i push his hand away turn over the photo and read the number i know this number i whisper whose is it john asks just a second i try to think back through a haze of scotch and xanax oh my god its wingates gallery christopher wingate i dialed this number from the plane back from hong kong jesus john says under his breath thats everybody tied in the same knot wingate the unsub and de becque theyre all tied together now wingates number on a victims photo muses lenz that could mean wingate selected jane lacour how could he asks john he hasnt been in new orleans for years he didnt choose jane i whisper he chose me the causeway across lake pontchartrain is the longest bridge in the world built solely over water the twentythree miles of humming concrete and traffic push me inward like a mantra toward the dark vortex of my fear and guilt somewhere on the other side of this shallow lake amid the exploding construction caused by white flight from new orleans stands the house of john kaiser the man himself sits beside me in the passenger seat of my rented mustang the seat fully reclined so that he can stretch out his wounded leg thirty seconds after he read christopher wingates number off the back of my photograph johns leg gave way and he collapsed in mrs pitres driveway baxter ordered him back to the hospital but john argued that he was only tired that he should have used the walking cane and that he had to return to the field office to work the new connections between the unsub wingate and marcel de becque baxter gave him two choices go back to the hospital or go home and rest for the night john chose the latter but as we picked up my mustang from the field office he called upstairs and had an agent bring down a thick folder filled with the latest argusgenerated enhancements of the abstract sleeping women hes like i used to be when i got my teeth into a war story unstoppable the picture he pulled from the ziploc bag floats in my mind like a grayscale emblem of guilt ive placed the photo now it ran in several major newspapers two years ago when i won the north american press association award wingate must have accessed some database that contained that picture printed it on photoquality paper and sent it to the unsub in new orleans do you want to talk about it john reaches out and touches my knee i dont know i know what youre thinking jordan a little survivor guilt is normal but this is crazy youre forcing everything to fit a predetermined result and the result youre reaching for is that jane died because of you i dont know why you want to feel that guilt but thats not what happened i squeeze the wheel trying to control my temper i dont want that guilt im glad because that would be really fucked up i grip the wheel still harder to bleed off my exasperation but it does no good will you call and see if theyve compared the handwriting if its not wingates ill admit im being paranoid but if it is well know wingate mailed or gave the unsub my picture john takes out his cell phone calls the field office and asks for the forensic unit jenny john kaiser have you guys heard from new york on that handwriting yet what did they say i see one hundred percent sure right thanks he presses end then lets his head fall forward and sighs what is it the phone number on your photo was in wingates handwriting my stomach goes hollow and i slam the wheel with my open hand there it is somebody outside new orleans chose me as victim number five and it got jane killed he bites his lower lip and shakes his head if i had to pick someone id pick marcel de becque what if he ordered me john the way youd commission any painting hes known who i am for years he tells wingate he wants me in the next painting but since im traveling all the time wingate finds an easy way to supply what de becque wants he takes jane instead theres one big hole in that theory that de becque didnt have janes painting thats easy wingate sold it out from under him thats the source of their bad blood i was talking about coincidence every other victim lives in new orleans but for some unknown reason de becque chooses you a world traveler based in san francisco as victim number five to fill de becques order wingate decides to use your twin sister as a substitute and that substitute just happens to live in the same city as all the other victims thats a statistical impossibility a low pounding has started at the base of my skull i reach down to the floor and unzip my fanny pack looking for my pill bottle whats that john asks as i bring it up xanax tranquilizers its no big deal xanax is a chemical cousin of valium i know that look i need to calm down he looks out his window at the lake but i know hes not going to let it drop do you take them regularly i pop off the lid shake two pills into my hand and swallow them dry this has been a bad day okay i watched wendy die i watched you get shot a guy tried to kidnap me and i just found out im responsible for my sisters death you can put me in rehab tomorrow he looks back at me his hazel eyes filled with concern you do what you have to do to get through this im just worried about you and me weve got another fifteen minutes in the car youre not going to fall asleep at the wheel are you i laugh dont worry about that two of these would put you out but theyll barely dent me he studies me for a long moment then faces the causeway again sooner or later were going to break through the wall jordan were going to find those women all of them sooner or later it had better be sooner later is like the horizon it recedes as you approach john lives in a suburban ranch house on a street with twenty others exactly like it homogenous americana enforced by neighborhood covenant the lawns are welltended the houses freshly painted the vehicles in the driveways clean and new i park in the driveway then help him out of the passenger side with only me present he uses the cane its slow going but he grits his teeth and keeps walking under the carport he punches a security code into a wall box and opens the back door which leads into a laundry room then a spotless white kitchen you obviously never cook i remark i cook sometimes you have a maid then a woman comes in once a week but im basically a neat guy ive never met a neat guy id want to spend the night with he laughs then winces the truth is ive been sleeping on a cot at the office since baxter called about your discovery in hong kong ah beyond the kitchen counter is a dining area with a glass table and a large arch leads on to a decently furnished den everything appears to be in its appointed place with only a couple of magazines on a coffee table suggesting the presence of an occupant the house feels like its been cleaned up for sale or is even a demo unit used to sell young marrieds on the neighborhood wheres all your junk i ask feeling a warm wave of xanax wash against my headache my junk you know books videotapes old mail the things you buy on impulse at walmart he shrugs then looks oddly wistful no wife no kids no junk that rule doesnt apply to other bachelors ive known he starts to reply but winces again instead your leg its stiffening up fast let me just get on the couch there i can go through the argus photos there i think youd better rest before you start on those he limps to the sofa with his weight on the cane but instead of helping him sit i take his hand and pull him past the sofa toward the hall i dont want to sleep he complains pulling back against my hand were not going to sleep oh his resistance stops and i lead him toward a halfopen door at the end of the hall where a cherry footboard shows through like the rest of the house the bedroom is clean the bed is neatly made with johns casual dress habits i thought this inner sanctum might be the secret wreck of the house maybe thats just projection he starts to sit on the bed but i stop him and pull back the covers first once he gets horizontal the painkillers will kick in and it will be a while before he feels like getting up again i need to sit down he says in a tight voice with me holding his upper arms he eases back and sits on the edge of the bed then lies back on the pillow with a groan bad not good im okay though lets see if i can make it better i slip off my shoes then climb onto the bed and carefully sit astride him does that hurt no liar leaning forward i brush his lips with mine and pull back waiting for him to respond his hands slide up my hips to my waist then he kisses me back gently yet insistently enough to remind me of the passion i felt in the shower last night a warm wave of desire rolls through me which combined with the xanax suppresses the shadowy images bubbling up from my subconscious i want to forget i whisper just for an hour he nods and pulls my lips to his kissing me deeply as his arms slip around my back after a bit he nibbles my neck then my ear and the warmth escalates into something urgent enough to make me squirm in discomfort thats the way i am i go a day or a week or a month without being aware of my body and then suddenly its there making me uncomfortably aware of its needs but my need runs much deeper than flesh for the past year ive lived with a growing emptiness that has threatened to swallow me whole you have something i whisper in the dresser i slide off him and move to the dresser top drawer when i get back to the bed i stand looking down at him he watches me with wide eyes waiting to see what ill do the base of my skull is still throbbing but not so badly now id give a lot to have my shoulders rubbed but hes in no shape to do that for me given what his doctor told us hes not in shape to do anything i have in mind but i suspect he feels differently you okay he asks i smile at him and begin unbuttoning my blouse the bra i put on this morning is sealed in an evidence bag in the belly of a plane on its way to washington and the agent who lent me a change of clothes didnt have an extra bra in her trunk when the blouse slips off my shoulders johns breath goes shallow i slide off my jeans and panties then climb back to the spot i was in before as he looks up at me i see the pulse beating at the base of his throat i touch his lips with my finger five minutes ago i felt as low as i ever have i thought we were going to come in here and have violent sex that would exorcize our demons just long enough to let us sleep but thats not what this is he nods i know you make me happy john im glad you make me happy too god were a bad movie he laughs the real thing always sounds like a bad movie he reaches up and touches my cheek i know youre torn to pieces inside especially after seeing that picture i dont shh this is how it is life happens in the middle of death i feel lucky to have found you and this is where we happen to be you could have died today so could i and wed never have known what this was like youre right come on we deserve it he reaches up and rubs my abdomen and the warmth of his hand makes me shiver he nods down toward his leg im not exactly in top form youre still talking pretty well and one critical part is still in working order he shakes his head and laughs youre not shy are you im forty john im not a girl scout anymore and you still owe me from the hotel i wondered why you hadnt taken off my clothes i smile down at him first things first how do we do this ill make it easy for you leaning forward i take hold of the headboard and slide up his chest then rise onto my knees without hesitation he lays his hands on my hips and pulls me to him kissing lightly a thrill of heat races over my skin and i settle against him is this okay he asks dont talk just keep doing that he does and after less than a minute i know this is not going to take long i learned long ago that the trick is not to concentrate on reaching a peak but to be with someone with whom you feel totally at ease then you can close your eyes and let go of the world and youll be carried to the peak without ever taking a step ive felt at ease with john from the first and now is no different he knows where i want to go and how to take me there and im content to let him i dig my fingers into his hair and pull him into me and he groans with pleasure with a sudden tingle a film of sweat covers my skin from my scalp to my toes the tension builds steadily within me and my thighs go taut and quiver with strain as i hold myself still against his insistent kisses his hands slide up my ribs and cover my breasts and i feel him urging me toward completion one flick no different from the last the next a trigger that catapults me into another dimension where every nerve ending sings with heat and every muscle trembles without command for an instant all goes white then the whiteness bends into waves that dissipate into soft color and the physical fallout of shivering and panting that let him know he has done well he lifts his head and lightly kisses my belly and i slide down his chest and hug him tightly mmm i think i could actually sleep now hmm the sound of consternation i reach back and tickle his stomach then slide my hand farther down feels like somebody needs some special attention before anyone goes to sleep he tries to look nonchalant but hes not fooling anybody i reach back and undo his belt and trousers then try to fit the condom on him with one hand this is like you learning to unhook a bra when you were a teenager right he laughs youre doing pretty well there everything okay he pulls my face down and kisses me again gently despite his need i playfully bite his bottom lip waiting to see how desperate he is but he just keeps kissing me before long i realize what he already seems to know i want him inside me as badly as he wants to be there you win i tell him sliding backward are you okay he asks i will be in a minute go slow im counting his eyes twinkle not easy to be still now he lays his hands on my thighs and slowly presses up into me taking my breath away then he begins to move sliding me forward and back with maddening regularity the mere presence of him there is enough to scramble my thoughts its been almost a year since i made love with a man and i feel as though im recovering from a sort of physical amnesia to be so full and still need to be filled to feel utterly vulnerable and yet primally complete all of it comes back in the grip of his strong hands and the slow ebb and flow of him in my softest place i can tell hes happy but i also sense that hes holding back that at the core he sees me as fragile im not a china vase john i know that youre thinking about what i told thalia he slows his movement then stops you cant pretend thats not part of you that youre completely over it im not over it but i am above it is it you that has a problem with it absolutely not im just worried about you i want to take care of you then do that i start to move against him but he still looks uncertain theres only one way to get past this awkwardness and thats to rip him out of his preconceptions its a risk but one i feel i have to take did lenz tell you about my affair with my teacher i ask watching his eyes as i move no but i saw something in his notes lenz showed you his notes they were on the table in the conference room he looks troubled now i took a quick look only natural right im an investigator nosy by nature what did you think about what you read i dont judge anybody as long as they dont hurt someone else good because i was really in love with him im sorry about what happened i arch my back and john closes his eyes and groans deep in his throat you know one thing i really liked in that relationship what when i went to school after being with him the night before or that morning nobody knew but i knew i could still feel him i felt marked you know i belonged to him that doesnt sound like you wanting to belong to somebody anybody shows how much you know im as independent as they come right i settle my weight and begin moving in slow circles but you know what what he asks hoarsely after weve been together long enough for the cdc or whoever to clear us you know what i want what i want you to fill me up i want you to mark your territory every day so i can always feel you jesus jordan tightening my muscles i plant my palms on his chest and push he moans with ineffable pleasure and his eyes go wide searching mine trying to discover all that i am in a span of seconds foolish man my neuroses alone would take years to plumb he bites his lip against the pain of his leg and grasps my wrists in his hands now you see me i whisper and i see you i know what you want how you want it im all grown up john you can do what you want anything at last he snaps out of himself out of the man who sees me as someone to be protected and into the one who wants me beyond restraint his hands fly to my hips pulling me down as he flails into me not caring anymore about my feelings or his leg nothing but getting as deep into me as physical limits will allow making me his alone the bed which only squeaked before hammers the wall the lamp on the end table crashes to the floor none of it matters i grip the headboard with all my strength and hold him against the mattress until he screams and goes into spasms youd think would kill a man but which in fact bring him gasping and sweating back to life when he collapses onto the pillow i fall beside him jesus he says breathlessly i know youre amazing hardly how do you feel the same way you feel about me you think all the boys get this treatment i didnt know well now you do he smiles with contentment i love you jordan take it easy youre in shock i think youre right i havent been i mean i havent felt like that since when he blinks and looks at the ceiling i was going to say vietnam the mild euphoria i felt before slips away you slept with vietnamese women over there everybody did they were beautiful some different from other women how do you mean in bed yes but not just that i dont know like de becque said like that li that woman we met on cayman did they make you fall in love with them hes looking in my direction but his mind is focused thousands of miles away i saw it happen a lot people over here think its because vietnamese women were more submissive than american women but thats not it they just im not talking about the city girls now the bar girls but regular vietnamese women they had a naturalness about them they were very demure yet open about certain things its seductive without trying to be i knew a guy who deserted to be with one and i just made you feel like they made you feel not the same only the intensity he touches my cheek youre thinking about your father arent you yes that he may have left you on purpose i nod unable to voice my fear im not like your father jordan i know youre like the men he took pictures of what do you mean johns ceiling has a water stain the house isnt perfect after all they were more real than he was he seemed to make them real to bring them into existence with his camera and in a way he did the way i do we make certain things real to the rest of the world but the rest of the world doesnt really matter my fathers photos didnt make soldiers eternal the way someone wrote they did what those soldiers did made them eternal and whatever they did i think is still happening somewhere all of it all things all the time i probably sound nuts thats what comes from living on the west coast right you dont sound nuts the things i saw and did in vietnam have never stopped for me you know why i dont have posttraumatic stress disorder because theres nothing post about it its just something i live with sometimes nearer sometimes farther away tell me something john the truth do you think my father is involved in this thing no his eyes are steady and guileless but you did before i wondered thats all i still dont know whats happening but if your fathers involved the only way i can see it is if hes in with de becque somehow but you dont think so no what do you base that on my gut i lay my hand on his flat stomach you dont have much of one im glad you can still laugh its the same old choice laugh or cry i rub my hand slowly over his abdomen why dont you sleep for a while he shakes his head i cant not with thalia still out there i can never sleep when things are breaking you want me to make coffee or something coffee would be good what about food you have anything in the fridge can you cook i laugh mostly foreign dishes designed for campfires but i dont think theres a mississippi girl on the planet who cant do the basics there are some chicken breasts in the freezer rice in the cabinets onions probably jambalaya then i kiss him on the chin and climb out of the bed would you mind bringing those argus photos in here i think they can wait but ill bring them i retrieve the thick manila envelope from the coffee table and toss it onto the bed how many of those have you looked at already i dont know until they adjusted the sensitivity of the program i was looking at twenty different versions of the same face before it became recognizable as another one pace yourself jambalaya and biscuits coming up i walk back to the kitchen and orient myself but ive gotten no further than running water over the chicken breasts when johns voice echoes up the hallway something in the sound makes me freeze with my hand on the sink tap i run for the bedroom in my mind seeing him turning blue from a blood clot broken free by our strenuous lovemaking i know this woman he says shaking a piece of paper at me as i come through the door from where i ask taking the picture from him its a facial shot of a young blond woman maybe eighteen shes like a template of an adult her face has yet to develop the definition of personality is she one of the missing persons youve been studying no i saw her years ago in quantico you mean you knew her personally he shakes his head impatiently no every year we have city and state cops coming through quantico our national academy program most of them have a case thats dogged them for years one they couldnt solve or get out of their minds sometimes its a single murder usually its two or three they think might be connected a police detective showed me this woman at quantico a new orleans detective thats the thing i think he was from new york this is a really old case my head is buzzing with a strange excitement how old ten years remember at the camellia grill when i told you i was working on something i said if it panned out id tell you well maybe it has how do you mean what are you talking about the youngest of our four suspects is frank smith whos thirtyfive serial offenders dont just wake up one day and start killing people in middle age baxters unit was checking all four suspects past residences for similar unsolved crimes vermont where wheatons from terrebonne parish where laveau grew up those were easy that left new york for smith and gaines not to mention the possible accomplice in fact all four suspects have ties to new york but when youre talking about missing persons which is what this case is because of the lack of corpses youre talking about thousands of victims in new york even if you only go back a few years the vicap computer is supposed to make those kinds of connections but police compliance isnt always great and its worse the farther back you go but i thought what if there were unsolved homicides in new york that had only one or two similarities to this case like women taken from grocery stores jogging paths et cetera snatched off the street without a trace no witnesses nothing a professional feel to them yet no obvious similarities between the victims did you check it out i called some new york cops i knew from the academy program and asked them to poke around their old files it was asking a lot but i had to do it did you talk to the cop who showed you this woman no that guys retired now and nobodys gotten back to me yet but this woman you still remember her i told you before ive got a knack for faces this girl was pretty and young and she stuck in my mind that detectives too she was his informant now that i think about it will you bring me the cordless phone i get him the phone and he rings the field office asking for baxter its john he says i think we caught a break a big one we need new york to liaise with nypd in a big hurry i sit on the edge of the bed and look at the argusgenerated portrait again its a strangely nonhuman image yet lifelike enough to pull a tenyearold memory from johns brain i say a silent thankyou to the photographer who confided the existence of argus to me jordan says john hanging up the phone do you know what this means it means my sister wasnt victim number five whoever is behind this started taking women more than a decade ago in new york he squeezes my arm were close now really close im lying in johns tub soaking in hot water up to my neck a pleasure i managed by jamming plastic wrap into the slits in the side of the circular metal thing that operates the drain the glass bricks above me have slowly turned from black to blue with the coming dawn and while i dont feel rested i do feel less frazzled than i did yesterday last night passed in a flurry of confusion elation mingled with depression like sugar highs punctuated by exhaustion prompted by johns recognition of the argus photo daniel baxter rousted the midnight homicide shifts at the nypd using argusenhanced photos of the abstract sleeping women paintings new york detectives managed to identify six of the eight unidentified victims in the nokids case once the women were identified the story came together by itself between and a serial kidnapmurderer was operating in new york city area without anyone connecting more than three of his crimes his victims were prostitutes and hitchhikers neither category high on the nypds list of priorities the significance of this discovery was simple and devastating the painter of the sleeping women had not begun his work two years ago in new orleans but more than twenty years ago in new york the ramifications were more complex first our youngest suspect frank smith had been only fifteen years old at the time this alone did not exonerate him but it shifted the focus of the investigation away from him second not one sleeping woman had been sold at the time of the new york murders third why would a serial killer murder eight women and then suddenly stop in johns experience only prison or death stopped serial murderers from pursuing their work but most puzzling was why having stopped the murderer would resume his work fifteen years later had he been locked up for a decade and a half only to emerge as hungry for victims as before john drank nonstop cups of coffee to fight the sedative effects of his painkillers and sat on the sofa working out theory after theory in an attempt to fit the new parameters of the case too exhausted to be any use to him i went into the bathroom took three xanax and got into bed sleep came quickly but that was no blessing with sleep came dreams all the fantastic input of the past seven days had been brewing in my subconscious and it finally burst free with a vengeance most of the images i cant remember but one remains clear im standing at the center of roger wheatons roomsized masterpiece a circular canvas thats no canvas at all but a universe of forest and earth and stream and sky peering out at me from the twisted tree roots are shadowy grinning faces leon gaines his eyes blazing with lust the murderous unsub on the levee and capering through the trees like a beautiful demon frank smith naked chasing thalia laveau who struggles to keep a white robe from falling as she runs the scene whirls around me like a hieronymous bosch nightmare while i stand transfixed the floor under my feet flowing like a stream and reflected in the stream the face of my father that dream soon flowed into another but i cant remember it sometime during the night john began kissing me only half asleep i started awake but when i recognized his face my heartbeat slowed and my fear abated i made sure he was wearing something then pulled him over and let him move slowly inside me until he shuddered and collapsed i was asleep before he rolled off me caught again in a spiraling descent into flashing darkness the phone rang ceaselessly for most of the night and even in my sedated state i stirred at every ring fearing dreadful news it finally stopped around four and john fell into a deep sleep now with the coming of dawn it begins again id like to let john rest but im not getting out of this delicious water to talk to some homicide cop from queens after three rings the bedsprings groan and a hoarse voice says kaiser after a few moments he says when where right im on my way after ten seconds of thrashing in the bedcovers and grunting in pain john limps into the bathroom his hair a mess but his eyes alert a pushboat crew just fished the unsubs body out of the river five miles downstream from where he went in adrenaline flushes through me in a dizzying rush i get to my feet and snatch a towel from the rack baxter choppered a forensic team down to the site to fingerprint the corpse theyll be back at the office before we can get across the causeway hows your leg its still there get dressed were about to meet the man who tried to kidnap you baxter and lenz are standing in the main computer room with coffee cups in their hands when we arrive at the field office three technicians wearing headsets sit before a bank of computer terminals with continuously changing data while above them large crts show live tv of every possible approach to the field office you broke some speeding laws getting here baxter says to me but he winks at john chopper got the prints here five minutes ago theyre already in iafis iafis as john explained on the way over is the integrated automated fingerprint system a database of over two hundred million fingerprints our priority bumped everything in the queue says baxter if theres a match well have it any second dr lenz says when i started consulting they did this job with note cards wheres the body asks john going to the orleans parish morgue looked like four bullet wounds sir says a female technician looking up at baxter we have a match one hundred percent the technician flicks her trackball and clicks a button on her crt one large fingerprint superimposes upon another with nearperfect accuracy whose finger is that asks baxter as we crowd around the screen the tech clicks again and a criminal record pops onto the screen in the top righthand corner is a photograph the face in it a younger version of the man who shot wendy on the levee yesterday conrad frederick hoffman reads the tech convicted felon born newark new jersey the three men tense around me what was the crime asks lenz murder where did he serve his time asks john sing sing says the tech new york state a more pregnant silence ive never heard as if speaking with one voice the three men say leon gaines what years was hoffman in sing sing asks baxter quick while the tech searches her screen john taps the shoulder of the male tech next to her and says call up leon isaac gaines on ncic i need the exact years he was in sing sing hoffman served fourteen years for murder says the woman to leon isaac gaines says the male tech two terms in sing sing the first to the second to son of a bitch john breathes thats a fiveyearintersect they had to know each other and both were free at the time of the new york murders sometimes the cards fall right says baxter lets get back to the eoc we need the warden of sing sing says john and every convict we can get hold of who served during those years not just gainess known associates and everybody who was involved in the art program in the prison john picks up a nearby phone emergency operations center please surveillance unit he nods at lenz who can apparently read his mind john kaiser here wheres leon gaines right now whats he doing there you have him covered how many cars and men get a chopper in the air i want zero chance of losing him when he comes out right wheres his girlfriend okay wheres gaines asks baxter as he hangs up he just pulled into the kenner walmart isnt it a little early for shopping baxter shrugs hes a drunk and an addict and he just woke up after sleeping twelve hours the isu chief steps up behind the two techs and squeezes their shoulders thanks a lot people this was big the gesture seems a little overdone but both techs sit taller as we leave the room such is the gift of leadership fortyfive minutes later were grouped in sac bowless office and the mood is grim an hour of phone calls to sing sing has not yielded the hopedfor results no one has been able to establish a personal relationship between conrad hoffman and leon gaines even though the two spent five years in the same prison at the same time we have three options says baxter one arrest gaines now and interrogate him two question him but dont arrest him three wait until we have more information you cant wait i cry in disbelief youve already wasted too much time thalia laveau could be dying somewhere right now i think laveau is dead already says lenz not even looking at me even if shes not gaines may not know where she is if hes merely the painter in the conspiracy i mean you think shes dead i ask coming half out of my chair who gives a goddamn what you think how many times have you been right in the past week once the four men gape at me in amazement but i cant hold in my anger any longer right now thalia is wherever all the sleeping women were painted in a killing house like you talked about in the beginning the house where the courtyard is the house you cant find and if that painter is leon gaines thalia is waiting for an artist who wont ever show up because he knows were watching him she could be dying while gaines strolls around walmart dreaming about painting her and laughing at us thats true john says quietly but gaines cant help us with thalia without admitting complicity in serial murder and without knowing more we cant offer him immunity the victims families would crucify us the grim reality is that right now we have no way to make gaines talk no legal way anyhow a strange hush follows this statement and baxter hurries to break it six hours he says for six hours we work every possible lead every snitch at sing sing go back over every fact of gainess past to see if we missed something we rip his life apart if we find something we can use against him hallelujah if not we fall on him like a brick shithouse and try to scare him into talking bluff a streetwise excon mutters lenz weve got no other option baxter shouts in a rare breach of professionalism in the stunned silence that follows i ask what about the girlfriend linda knapp what about her asks baxter if you could talk to her away from him she might recant her support for his alibis she did it once and then she went right back to him says john knowing hed beat the crap out of her shes alone in the house right now lenz says thoughtfully his eyes on me gaines is at walmart damn it says baxter only now realizing what the psychiatrist already has jordan you almost got killed yesterday you havent had enough hoffmans dead gaines isnt home wire me up and send me in there with the girl if gaines starts home knock on the door and ill get the hell out of there baxter is not convinced but sac bowles looks like he has no objection and john knows better than to get involved at this point you know a woman has a better chance with her than any of you i insist we have plenty of female agents says baxter not one who knows this case like i do not one with something personal at stake knapp will feel that from me shes right says john we cant turn gainess woman against him with some bullshit comeon and knapp knows her already his eyes lock onto baxters with dark intensity its all weve got daniel goddamn it mutters baxter throwing up his hands in surrender lets get over there before gaines fills up his shopping cart baxter and dr lenz are hunched in the surveillance van one block from gainess shotgun house on freret street im parked behind the van in my mustang johns featherweight strapped to my right ankle beneath my jeans john leans into my window and points toward my foot everything secure he asks knowing baxter and lenz can hear me over the wire good to go seeing worry in his face i slip my hand into my blouse and flatten the pad of my thumb over the microphone clipped there im not going to need it thats just when you do need it he whispers like the camera in your fanny pack he lays his hand on my upper arm ive never seen a female serial killer of the classic type but we do get women who help men carry out vicious murders serials even and linda knapp fits the profile of that type of woman poor selfimage dominated by an abusive male im just going to talk to her john if she comes at me i promise ill shoot her now let me get going before gaines gets back he squeezes my arm then backs away from the car i wave and pull into the street gainess neighborhood is a sad sight in the early morning i have a feeling that even the old people dont start stirring until well after daylight wheeling over to the broken curb in front of gainess shotgun i kill the motor and sit for a moment i dont want to appear too eager or rushed like an actress preparing for a scene i let the worries of the present bleed away and allow the emotions i keep buried in my heart to rise to the surface my fears for jane my longing for my father the humiliation of my rape things i loathe but which can be my allies now gainess stairs creak as i climb to the porch the surveillance team says their thermal imaging camera shows knapp still in the bed i considered calling her first but everyone agreed that would give her an easy chance to refuse to see me before doubt can assail me i knock on the door three times hard theres no answer so i knock again hard enough to bruise my knuckles come on i say softly she doesnt come to the door maybe she overdosed in there i say to the mike clipped to my bra getting on tiptoe i peer through the window set high in the door inside is the same dark and depressing cavern i wanted out of so badly the other day dirty clothes and pizza boxes litter the floor the easel stands to my left bare as a skeleton now to my right is a blank wall that farther down becomes the wall of the hallway without warning apprehension raises the hairs on my neck and arms something is out of place what am i seeing wrong question i murmur as apprehension escalates into anxiety its what im not seeing the small abstract by roger wheaton the one that hung on the wall to my right its no longer there why would gaines take it down in answer frank smiths voice plays eerily in my head pond scum roger gave him a matched pair of abstracts as a gift small but very fine leon sold one of them two weeks later for heroin im sure gaines took the painting with him because hes going to sell it for what drugs or money to run i grasp the handle and try the door its locked but the old wood panel rattles loosely in its frame an eightyearold could kick it open of course if i do daniel baxter will jerk me out of the house so fast i wont even reach the bedroom gripping the handle firmly with both hands i set my shoulder against the door and lean forward wood and metal creak even under the marginal stress of my pounds keeping my leg against the door i lean back then lunge forward with the pad of my shoulder the door gives way with a soft crunch hello linda i say for the benefit of the boys back in the van i wanted to talk to you if i could the smell of feces hits me in a wave i recoil sensing death but my brain reassures me that for thermal imaging cameras to see linda knapp on the bed she has to be alive or very recently alive says a small voice i could have the guys in the van busting in here with one word but if i do ill lose any chance to question linda knapp alone she may just be sleeping the stink could be coming from an unflushed commode bending over i pull johns featherweight from the ankle holster and move quickly through the front room holding the gun in both hands i keep my eyes forward not focusing on specific objects but staying alert to any movement the way a british soldier once taught me the hall closes around me with a claustrophobic closeness theres an open door ahead on my right crouching low i ease my head past the frame theres no bed just a mattress lying on the floor piled with blankets and surrounded by dirty clothes the room looks empty though a closet door stands partly open in the corner it looks empty but the thermal camera says its not as i stand erect the blankets piled on the bed suddenly coalesce into a recognizable shape a human shape with my eyes on the closet door i dart to the mattress and jerk the blankets off the bed the stench nearly makes me vomit but the sight is worse lying on the bed is a woman gagged with duct tape and wrapped in a blanket the side of her head matted with blood one eye open and staring sightless at the ceiling john i whisper but nothing audible comes out john i need help help the woman on the bed is linda knapp the hard line of her jaw and the lank blond hair confirm it in my mind crouching over her i put two fingertips beneath her jawbone and feel for a carotid pulse theres a weak throb against my hand as carefully as i can i pull the duct tape away from her mouth to free her airway then the little house begins shaking under the pounding of male feet and a voice roars federal agents throw down your weapons john and baxter crash into the room with guns drawn but theres no one for them to shoot shes alive i cry she needs an ambulance hurry while baxter issues orders over a radio and john checks the closet dr lenz rushes to the bed bends over and examines the beaten woman severe head trauma he says he hit her with something heavy john points at a shadeless metal lamp lying on the floor with a shattered bulb its base is square and heavy and stained dark arrest gaines right now baxter orders over the radio presume him armed and extremely dangerous but try not to shoot him confirm as soon as its done he wrapped her in an electric blanket says lenz right around body temperature even if she died wed have been slow to notice anything he pulls up knapps closed eyelid then lets it close well be lucky if she can ever tell us anything this is all wrong says john you dont beat your girlfriend and leave her for dead then go shopping at walmart the paintings gone i say dully what painting asks lenz the one wheaton gave him he must have taken it to sell hes pulling a rabbit says john baxters radio crackles sir this is agent liebe my agents inside lost visual with the suspect a couple of minutes ago were in the store in force now but its full of people i think maybe shut it down baxter orders nobody goes in or out the kenner walmart is a riot waiting to happen as we drove up sirens blaring i saw the parking lot halffilled with cars but empty of people and though we entered the store through its rear loading dock the low roar of an angry crowd rumbled through the service doors in the twelve minutes it took us to get here two agents sifting through the trapped customers and four searching the aisles and dressing rooms have turned up no sign of leon gaines though his car still sits in the parking lot in the security room at the back of the store a bank of video monitors displays feeds from three dozen video cameras mounted at various locations in the ceiling of the store baxter shows the head of security his fbi credentials then asks the technician operating the vtrs to fastforward from a point three minutes before agent liebe reported losing contact with gaines to the point that he sealed the building whats this guy done asks the security chief hes a federal fugitive says john thats all we can say i dont think we can legally detain customers inside the store the company could be liable baxter turns away from the screens your store was sealed by the federal government youve got no worries theres gaines says john looking over the techs shoulder on the screen leon gaines pushes a grocery cart along the hardware aisle hes wearing a dirty white tshirt black jeans and has three days growth of beard on his face his curly black hair is a tangled mess and he moves with a jerky sort of energy like a man looking for a fix his cart holds a gallon of milk a pack of precut hamburger patties some toiletries and a copy of hot rod magazine after ten seconds he moves out of the frame baxters radio crackles agent liebe sir we just had to arrest an elderly gentleman at the main exit dr lenz chuckles softly baxter holds the radio to his mouth keep the lid on give us the cameras covering the exits says john you dont want to try to follow him on other views asks the tech just the exits two sets of automated glass doors appear on the screens plus the large service exit at the rear run it normal speed we watch people stroll in and out of the store male and female young and old black and white some customers stop beside the greeter and have a sticker affixed to a product theyve come to return stop the tape says john what is it asks the tech stopping the tape john touches his fingertip to the figure of a brunette woman exiting through the automatic doors look how tall she is compared to this other woman his finger slides onto a blonde frozen in the entrance door she looks almost a foot shorter than the brunette then his finger slides back i think this is gaines baxter crouches before the screen and squints damn it youre right he shaved put on a wig and coat picked up a handbag and walked right past our people probably brought a batterypowered shaver with him says lenz baxter straightens up and turns to the security chief let everybody go the man nods and hurries away to quell the incipient rebellion hes been gone fifteen minutes minimum says john he could be anywhere were less than a mile from the international airport baxter thinks aloud he lifts the radio to his mouth liebe your whole detail is going to the airport come back here first yes sir baxter touches gainess image on the screen and looks at the tech can you give me a print of this woman no problem print twenty and twenty of him the way he looked in the hardware aisle an agent liebe will be back here to get them baxter looks at john back to the office john walks over to the gray wall then back as though pacing will give him some insight into the situation we should leave somebody in the parking lot in about a minute a customer is going to start yelling that his car was stolen while he was trapped in here once we know the make we can put everything we have in the air a muted ring sounds in the room john pulls his cell phone from his jacket kaiser here just now put him through he looks at baxter roger wheaton just called the office and asked them to page me he said it was an emergency wheaton says lenz hello john covers his open ear and turns away from us to concentrate yes sir john kaiser can you get out of the building i understand can you get them outlisten to me mr wheaton if you cant get them out get yourself out theyre not your responsibility were on the way get to safety and wait for us to arrive john whirls to face us gaines just sandbagged roger wheaton in his office at the woldenberg art center gaines claimed hes being framed by the fbi and that he needs money to get out of the country is he armed asks baxter john nods wheaton told gaines he would drive him to the bank and get him money but that his wallet and keys were down in the gallery where he was painting gaines told wheaton if he wasnt back in two minutes hed take students hostage and start killing them there are fifty to seventy students spread through the building and they have no idea whats happening wheaton ran down to another office and called us why not the police asks lenz and why ask for you he said he didnt want gaines shot out of hand hes actually worried about that son of a bitch i dont want him shot either i say sharply he may be the only person in the world who knows where the women are baxter takes out his cell phone and hits a speeddial button this is baxter give me sac bowles right now he looks at john we need a chopper out here patrick leon gaines is at the art center at tulane and he probably has hostages we need swat out there asap how many choppers do you have in the air send them both to the kenner walmart parking lot and youd better alert the task force be sure they know whos running the scene at tulane ill keep you posted baxter waves away a sheaf of photo prints the tech holds up to him and looks at john well have two choppers outside in three minutes lets move hurtling over new orleans at a hundred knots you can see why people call it the crescent city the older sections sit in a great bend in the mississippi river the main streets either fanning into the bend or running with it today the river flows the color of slate thanks to a gray overcast but a broad shaft of sunlight to the south shows a patch of familiar reddish brown john and baxter ride the lead chopper dr lenz and i the one behind below us audubon park stretches north from the river to st charles avenue north of st charles begins the rectangular garden that is tulane university as the lead chopper swings over a golf course and drops toward tulane an overwhelming sense of deja vu brings sweat to my face and hands ive descended into many cities this way clinging to a spar with my cameras around my neck sarajevo maputo karachi baghdad san salvador managua panama city the list is endless but the city below me now is the one in which i began my career and it strikes me that the symmetry of my ending it here might be quite a temptation for the fates if so i accept the risk the placid green island below harbors a desperate situation but in the resolution of it lies the answer to the mystery that has haunted me for more than a year the cockpit radio spits and crackles as a deskbound fbi agent with a university map guides the pilots toward their lz the helicopter drops fast enough to make my stomach roll and i wonder if john and baxter are flashing back to vietnam as we auger in parked at the center of one grassy quadrangle are two police cars with their lights flashing while beside them an olivedrab huey helicopter sits like a harbinger of battle its main rotor slowly turning i saw several hueys on the national guard base contiguous to the fbi field office lot the fbi swat team has probably deployed from that chopper as i search the quad for armed men we dip forward and bore in at the last second flaring and coming to rest thirty yards from the lead chopper john jumps out of his cockpit and runs toward us while baxter moves toward the waiting nopd cops its not good john yells as i get out and run in a crouch beneath our rotor gaines has a male hostage in a thirdfloor office hes come to the window to show he has a gun to the guys head swat has set up a command post under the trees in front of the building baxter runs over from the squad car lets get over there john whos the negotiator dr lenz asks appearing suddenly ed davis john replies hes good this isnt a normal situation lenz says directing his words to baxter this isnt a distraught husband or a suicidal cop this is a probable serial murderer you know i know what you want arthur baxter says brusquely well discuss it with the swat commander talk to bowles says lenz its his call baxter starts running toward a large building on the north edge of the quad that i now recognize as the woldenberg art center john and i follow with lenz puffing after us i should have recognized the building from the air with its three massive skylights over the gallery where roger wheatons roomsized painting awaits its first public showing from this angle the building appears as two threestory brick boxes separated by a onestory section fronted with arches if i remember correctly the classical boxes house classrooms studios and offices while the long section houses the art gallery gaines must be inside one of the two end sections the closer we get to the building the harder it is to see massive spreading oaks line the road in front of it obscuring most of the windows beneath one of the oaks a knot of men in black body armor with fbi stenciled in yellow crouch around what looks like a map john reaches them first and immediately begins talking to one of the men on the ground baxter takes out his cell phone and dials a number and dr lenz hovers beside him i edge in to listen to the swat leader briefing john hes a tall man in his thirties with a black mustache and a patch on his flak vest reads burnette gaines is still on the third floor says burnette hes keeping his gun to the hostages head when we can see him but most of the time our view is obscured by venetian blinds theres no high ground for snipers so were going to put a man up in the huey and have the pilot hold a hover thats not a good solution but until we get some scaffolding out here its the only way to get a bead on that office we also have two men on the roof with rappelling gear they can drop and crash the window but thats not my call weve rescued about forty students and faculty so far but there may be twenty or so still on the floor with gaines some in small private studios hes barricaded the main access door those kids could be completely ignorant of the danger or completely under gainess control have you established contact with gaines john asks a secretary just gave ed the number of the office hes talking now as burnette points across the lane a man dressed in civilian clothes pockets a cell phone and runs toward us he wants one of our helicopters to take him to the airport says the negotiator he wants a plane waiting there to take him to mexico i tried opening a dialogue but he hung up the guy sounds like a hard case streetwise prisontempered this could take a while baxter steps up to burnette and says sac bowles just designated doctor lenz the hostage negotiator for this event he also put me in tactical command on the ground ive got no problem if you want to verify that the swat leader shakes his head its fine with me youre from quantico right thats right ed the negotiator looks like he wants to argue but suddenly someone yells there he is three floors above us wedged in front of some venetian blinds stands roger wheaton his long face is pressed flat against the windowpane and theres a large pistol pressed against his ear goddamn it john mutters i told him to get out hes trying to be a hero says lenz just like he did in vietnam dial that office and give me your phone lenz tells the negotiator then he looks at burnette tell your snipers to stand down do it says baxter as the former negotiator makes his call swat leader burnette says mr baxter my sniper can shoot that pistol out of gainess hand he can do it from here ive seen him do it twice under pressure baxter shakes his head thats not an option yet we dont know how many weapons gaines has up there yes hello says lenz leon this is dr arthur lenz i was at your house the other day yes im here because i know you need to talk to someone whos not bound by the normal rules thats right some cases fall outside the lines and this is one of them when i look back up at the window wheaton is gone lenz lowers his voice a helicopter isnt out of the question leon but everything has a price you know that thats the way the world works you may seem to hold all the cards but youre assuming you know what our priorities are there are twelve families who care a lot more about you getting a lethal injection than they do about a dying artist whose life you might shorten by a few months ed the negotiator looks like he wants to snatch his phone from lenzs grasp but baxter holds up a restraining hand leon lenz says irritably listen to me you a dull pop slowly registers in my brain gunshot yells a swat agent burnettes radio crackles rooftop we heard a gunshot please advise over do nothing says baxter hold position says burnette but stay ready put a sniper up in the huey orders baxter get a thermal imaging scope up there with him we need to see through those blinds as burnette runs to the next oak tree a woman screams from the direction of the art center then the front door of the studio wing crashes open and a dozen students pour through it like people running from a fire behind them running with an awkward lope is a tall man wearing white gloves its wheaton i yell starting toward him as swat agents race forward to help the students john hobbles past me and takes wheaton by the arm the artists mouth and nose are covered with blood are you all right john asks were you hit no wheaton coughs we struggled and leon hit me with the gun he could have shot me but he didnt i didnt think he would thats why i tried it we heard a gunshot john says in a taut voice was anyone hit his gun went off during our struggle but he didnt shoot anybody is he alone up there now wheaton shakes his head he had two female students barricaded in an adjacent office theres a sofa against the door i knew i couldnt save them but i thought i might be able to clear some of the grad students studios on my way out wheaton suddenly recognizes me oh hello im glad youre all right i tell him well get you an ambulance says john leading the artist back toward the command post but we need to know everything you can tell us thats sarah oh my god the sound of screaming college girls is more piercing than a siren looking up at the window i see a petite brunette pressed to the pane the gun barrel huge beside her head get those students out of here baxter yells to the swat agents john sits wheaton down beneath an oak tree and an agent wearing rubber gloves begins wiping blood from the artists face baxter the swat leader and i cluster around them did you see any other weapons besides the pistol john asks wheaton takes the gauze pad from the agent and wipes the blood from his own lips no but he has a bag with him a bag john looks back at me i didnt see a bag in his cart at the walmart under the magazine maybe a heavy beating sound ricochets off the face of the art center the huey on the quad is climbing into a hover fifty yards from the window behind which gaines holds his hostage instant execution will soon be an option john raises his voice above the rotor noise has gaines said anything to you to indicate hes guilty of the abductions no wheatons long gray hair flies as he shakes his head has he mentioned thalia laveau he claims he knows nothing about her he says youre framing him he said those assholes need a patsy and im it he wanted cash he has a painting i gave him as a gift but he wants to get the most he can for that did he know you called the fbi probably wheatons gloved hands are shaking but i sense that hes more frustrated than afraid but i had to go back up there if i tried to get everyone out hed have heard me and he might have panicked and done something crazy leon acts like hes in control but deep down hes very unstable the safest thing was to offer myself as a hostage that took guts john says but the artist just shakes his head leon doesnt want to shoot anybody agent kaiser hes scared to death if you give him a way out of this hell take it john looks skeptical mr wheaton sometime last night or this morning leon beat his girlfriend into a coma then he gagged her and left her for dead a look of sadness comes over the artists face good god i met that girl the sadness is quickly replaced by a look of concern thats still no reason to shoot him hes backed into a corner offer him a way out then arrest him later i dont know about that i say but gaines may be the only person in the world who knows where thalia laveau is or my sister and the rest of them john looks over his shoulder at lenz who is angrily punching numbers into the commandeered cell phone any luck hes not answering a look of puzzlement crosses johns face then he pulls his cell phone from his jacket he must have felt rather than heard it ringing hello he yells cupping his free hand around the earpiece thanks ill call you when we know more he puts the phone back in his pocket and turns to baxter linda knapp regained consciousness at the hospital she said she threatened to tell the truth about gainess alibis and he went crazy she has no idea where he went on any of the snatch nights could someone help me stand up please wheaton asks i may have to be sick baxter pulls the artist to his feet true to his word wheaton doubles over and vomits on the grass im sorry he apologizes wiping his mouth on his sleeve theres an ambulance on the way says baxter im fine says wheaton really but i dont think i want to see whats going to happen next john grimaces and pulls out his cell phone again what is it what put out a citywide apb hell statewide and keep me posted what is it asks baxter surveillance just lost frank smith what he went into the antiques show down at the convention center and disappeared shit whats going on john i dont know but we better get on top of it fast he looks at wheaton well have someone drive you home im just going to walk a bit clear my head dr lenz appears and taps baxters arm gaines told me that if we dont land one of our helicopters on the roof of the art center in five minutes hell kill that girl and drop her out the window he says hes got another one up there john looks at wheaton you said there were two girls didnt you wheaton nods then wobbles on his feet ive got him i tell john please just remember that gaines may be the only one who knows what we need to know john squeezes my arm then leans down to me and says stay in plain sight as i lead wheaton away john addresses a group of blackclad men who remember their swat teammate wendy travis much too fondly to be objective in this situation we may be looking at explosive entry he says i want every one of you to i turn and catch up to wheaton who is walking aimlessly along the grass parallel to the lane that runs in front of the woldenberg center leon really left that girl for dead he asks i thought she was dead till i felt her pulse he stops and looks back toward the art studio wing theyre not going to listen to us theyre going to kill him theyre not as gung ho as you think maybe not kaiser thats why i called him but the rest i saw it in vietnam you put enough guns and soldiers into a situation like this somebodys going to fire i hope not but we said our piece lets find somewhere for you to sit down the sound of a bullhorn reverberates across the quad and dr lenz begins addressing gaines through the window glass i guess he quit answering the phone i murmur i dont want to see this wheaton says im going to go home youre in no shape to drive ill get a cop to drive you im really fine but my keys are in the gallery with my bag and i dont think that cop is going to let me get them he points to the low section of the building where an fbi agent stands beneath the entrance arch wheatons keys are far from leon gaines this is the backwater of the hostage scene ill talk to him you stay here thank you theyre on the floor in the center of the room right by my bag i trot across the grass and wave to the agent as i come under the arch i need to get some keys for one of the hostages theyre just inside the gallery nobody goes in he says youve got a radio call john kaiser the agent lifts his walkietalkie and makes the call wheres wheaton jordan asks john from his position forty yards away with exaggerated movements i point out into the quad where wheaton has sat down on the grass go in with her john tells the agent but dont let wheaton go home yet bring him back to the command post im sending an agent with him we dont know where frank smith is and i dont want anyone else kidnapped no more surprises copy says the agent his face softens as he opens the door and holds it for me im agent aldridge by the way i walk into the gallery my eyes drawn to the tiffany stainedglass windows i saw the first time we were here through here i tell aldridge leading him through the makeshift plywood door that seals the gallery against nosy visitors the access panel in the canvas circle is still open i start to go through but aldridge pushes ahead of me wow he says softly the electric lights are off in the gallery but a flood of illumination pours through the skylights bathing wheatons masterpiece in a bluish glow as in my dream of last night the forest clearing seems alive its branches and roots seeming to grow as i watch them this thing is massive aldridge marvels theres the bag i tell him pointing to a leather tote lying in the middle of a huge drop cloth oh shit says the agent looking at his shoes look at this the drop cloth around his shoes is stained with wet paint is that oil paint he asks i think it is shit itll take a shattering gunshot echoes through the building the echo fading over a span of seconds before it dies aldridge is moving toward me with his gun drawn that was outside i tell him a rifle give me your radio he passes me his walkietalkie with his free hand this is jordan glass calling john kaiser john its jordan theres a crackle of static then johns voice jitters from the radio as though hes talking while running up stairs they had to shoot him jordan we dont know if hes dead were going up now he cant get to where you are stay put for five minutes then have the agent escort you to the cp okay be careful john doesnt speak again if jimmy reese took the shot says aldridge the tangos dead the fbi man lifts one shoe and studies the bright blue paint on its sole i wonder what happened the guy probably panicked and got wild with his gun i cannot reply the knowledge that died with gaines took part of me with it everything i hoped to learn has vanished with the impact of a snipers bullet my legs feel shaky as though they might buckle i fall to my knees and breathe as deeply as i can are you okay just give me a minute sure hey aldridge shouts pointing his pistol at the opening in the painting roger wheaton stands just inside the canvas circle his face a mask of anguish they killed him he says i heard leon yell through the window and i walked to where i could see a sniper shot him in the head take it easy i tell aldridge its his keys we came to get the fbi agent lowers his gun john said gaines might still be alive i say without much conviction wheaton shakes his head reaches out with his bloodstained white glove and touches the trunk of a tree on the canvas hey calls agent aldridge the guy who painted this might not like you touching it its still wet wheaton smiles sadly i dont think he minds hes the guy who painted it i tell aldridge oh hey i like it thank you but whats with the gloves they protect my hands i thought the painting was done i tell wheaton putting my palms flat on the floor to push myself to my feet there are always lastminute additions its finished now my palms are wet turning them over i see red and yellow paint on my skin bright primary shades like the blue on aldridges feet this much paint couldnt be the result of spills wheaton must have been painting on the floor thats why the drop cloth is here he wasnt satisfied with enveloping the viewer in a great wooded circle he had to paint the forest floor too have i ruined anything i ask holding up my palms so he can see them are you going to do the ceiling too wheatons face darkens as he realizes ive smeared the paint stand up and tiptoe to the edge he says i got some on my shoes says aldridge you shouldnt have sent us after the keys with it wet stay where you are says wheaton both of you the artist tiptoes across the drop cloth in a complicated path like a military engineer walking through a minefield he just laid as he passes aldridge wheaton takes the agents hand and leads him toward me when he reaches me he escorts us both to the edge of the floor then smiles at me youve discovered my surprise i thought it would be dry by now may i look i suppose so aldridges walkietalkie crackles loudly and then johns voice sounds in the room daniel it was a ck the hostage is unhurt and on her way down copy that baxter replies whats a ck i ask clean kill says aldridge i told you it was a head shot says wheaton lifting the edge of the drop cloth jordan would you go down there and lift the other side well walk it across if you still want to see it in a haze of incipient depression i walk down the edge of the cloth and lift the coarse material in my hands now walk says wheaton slowly and carefully as i walk forward the cloth comes away from the floor like saran wrap stuck to a birthday cake oh man thats ruined say aldridge you put that cloth down too early thank you for stating the obvious says wheaton halfway across the room i stop my eyes transfixed by the images on the floor they look nothing like the painting on the canvas circle that surrounds us theyre bright childlike human figures painted directly onto the hardwood wide curves of red yellow and blue with mixed tones where the primary lines cross that looks like finger painting i say softly it is think of what the critics will say wheaton exults i cant wait to see their faces but im not thinking of the critics im thinking that beside every figure is a large x that all the figures have long hair and that their mouths are open in huge wailing os i open my mouth to speak but nothing comes out thats freaky says aldridge youre the guy who painted this he points at a beautiful tree beside his shoulder then back at the floor and you painted that wheaton touches aldridge on the arm and something crackles and flashes blue the fbi agent falls to the floor jerking like a man having an epileptic fit then wheaton turns to me and the avuncular face is gone a new intelligence stares out through his eyes vulpine knowing cold fearless im not the man who painted that he says pointing at the clearing the man who did is almost dead with the slowness of nightmares i scrabble at the right cuff of my jeans reaching for the pistol john gave me but wheaton jerks his end of the drop cloth and my right foot flies out from under me spilling me onto the floor as my hand closes on the butt of the a vicious wasp stings my neck and my arms begin jerking spastically the room blurs fades then returns i feel myself rising toward the skylight and i wonder if im dying until i begin moving laterally and realize wheaton is carrying me he walks to the border of the canvas circle away from the open panel and i wonder if he thinks he can simply step into his own painting but inches from the meticulously painted forest he bends and sets me on the floor then takes a knife from his pocket with one great slash he lays open the canvas from top to bottom then lifts me again and carries me through the crack like a ghost walking through a wall consciousness returns before vision i know im alive because im cold dreadfully cold and wet shivering i try to touch my face but my arms wont move properly my legs either with great effort i shift my hips and pain shoots up my legs the agony of circulation returning i focus all my energy on opening my eyes but they dont open my sense of smell is working though urine pungent and ammoniac floats all around me terror squirms in my chest like a rat trying to fight its way out of a bag stop says a voice in my mind and i cling desperately to its echo my fathers voice dont panic he says but im so afraid youre alive where theres life theres hope stay with me daddy think of happy things he says the light will come soon my mind is a fog of confusion but through the mist i see patches of light i see a little girl sitting at a desk in a room filled with desks beside her sits another girl identical to her to the last detail one of the little girls is me i feel more like a boy than a girl my favorite book is the mysterious island i order my books from a flimsy catalog the teacher hands out to every student in the class emil and the detectives white fang like that money is tight for us but when it comes to books my mother is a spendthrift i can order as many as i like i sit here day after day waiting for my books to arrive my books it takes a month or more but when they finally do when the teacher opens the big box and passes out the orders to the kids checking the books against a form taken from her desk i glow with happiness ive never had the newest dress or the prettiest but i always have the tallest stack of books little paperbacks that smell of wet ink i lay my cheek against their cool covers anticipating the stories inside knowing all the other girls wonder what i could possibly want with those books thats how i discovered the mysterious island its about four men who try to escape from a civil war prison camp in a hotair balloon a storm blows them out to sea and they crash near an uninhabited island their task is survival and they succeed mightily one prisoner finds a kernel of corn in his pocket and from this comes their first crop a former engineer brings irrigation to their fields the story is a fable of selfreliance which makes it perfect for me i have my mother and my twin sister but my father is gone not dead but away shooting pictures for the magazines there is a map in the mysterious island a handdrawn topographic sort of thing showing the island as it would appear from the air the beach the cove the volcano with its hidden caves a forest of palms streams running through it i could almost see the men down there doing their best to get by using their common sense their natural gifts i began to draw maps of my own in the margins of my textbooks on the backs of the mimeographed drawings they handed out at thanksgiving the pilgrim or the indian which we colored with crayons only after hungrily sniffing the solvent on the purple mimeograph paper still wet from the machine when we finished coloring the teacher would collect the pictures and tape them above the chalkboard in a long line mine never got the star for being the best there was always someone who stayed completely within the lines or had some fancy shading or outlined their picture in heavy black crayon that they scraped flat with their fingernail but i knew even if the teacher didnt notice that on the back of my pilgrim was a whole world an island drawn with the finest detail a big red eagle pencil could produce a world id spent the last thirty minutes living in before hastily coloring in the lonelylooking puritan with my crayolas without warning my eyelids begin fluttering and my hands clench into fists somethings happening to my muscles a voice tells me to keep my eyes closed until i know more about my situation but the hunger for light is too strong vision returns as swirling clouds wisps of white on gray slowly the clouds part to reveal the face of thalia laveau the beautiful sabine artist is sitting across from me immersed to her breasts in a pool of yellowish water her head lolls against a rim of white enamel her eyes are closed her skin pale to the point of blueness and she is naked i am naked too between us just an oldfashioned faucet were in a bathtub i try to turn my head but my neck muscles refuse to obey my brain i must be content with what i can see from this position the wall opposite me is made of glass the roof above is also glass long shining triangles of it fanning out from a brace bolted to a redbrick wall above and to my left through the glass i see the sky fading down to dusk to my left above the narrow ends of the fanning panes the sky is blue to my right violet i am facing north moving only my eyes i follow the glass down to within four feet of the ground where it meets a brick wall im in a conservatory of some type a conservatory with a bathtub in it beyond the glass wall stand trees and tropical plants beyond these a high brick wall im almost convinced im dreaming when i hear the pad of feet welcome back says a male voice add some hot water if youre cold the voice sounds familiar but i cant quite place it it has the refinement of frank smiths voice but its pitched lower with superhuman effort i turn my head to the left and find a scene so bizarre i am rendered speechless roger wheaton stands partly behind an artists easel a paintbrush in his whitegloved hand working feverishly on a large canvas that i cannot see he is naked but for a white cloth tied around his waist and between his legs like those that renaissance artists used to cover the genitals of jesus in crucifixion paintings wheatons body is surprisingly well muscled but his torso is lined with bruises and hemorrhages the kind i saw in africa on pneumonia patients coughing themselves to death my first attempt to speak is only a rasp but then saliva comes and i get the words out where am i in one sense this is a rhetorical question im in the place eleven other women occupied before me twelve including thalia im in the killing house i am one of the sleeping women you cant move can you when i dont answer wheaton walks over and turns the tap marked h at first i shiver more but then blessed heat begins to roll against my hip and stomach he walks back to the painting leaving me to push myself away from the steaming rush of water where am i i repeat where do you think you are wheatons gaze moves from the canvas to me then back again the killing house i reply using john kaisers term he seems not to hear is thalia dead not clinically i fight to keep my fear in check what does that mean is she sedated permanently what look at her the surreal sense of horror that suffused me when i saw wheaton is ratcheting down to pure animal fear but i force myself to look at thalia the bathwater comes halfway up her breasts which because they float seem more alive than their owner i see no obvious wounds on her body one arm hangs limp in the water the hand wrinkled like the skin of a prune her other arm hangs outside the tub peering over the rim i discover that my fear has barely begun to ascend the scale of terror a white venous catheter enters her arm at the wrist held in place by medical tape from the catheter a clear iv tube runs in a serpentine loop around the base of an aluminum stand and up to a bag hanging from an iv tree the bag is empty drained flat what was in the bag i ask trying to control my voice wheaton holds the brush poised motionless in the air then strikes the canvas quickly and repeatedly insulin i shut my eyes recalling frank smiths description of wheatons suicide plan insulin is painless but sometimes it doesnt bring death just brain damage and coma shes in no pain he says as though this mitigates the situation i try in vain to lift my right hand to turn off the faucet whats wrong with my arms wheaton ignores me flicking the brush over the canvas with remarkable speed a belated impulse makes me turn over my own hand the left one it seems to take an eternity but finally on the outside of my wrist i see a plastic tube running into one of my own veins i try to yank it out but havent enough muscular control wheaton admonishes me with an upraised finger your bag is valium and a muscle relaxant but that can easily change so please dont bother the equipment valium my secondfavorite drug i expected you to be unconscious for at least another hour wheaton suddenly straightens then turns as though looking at himself in a mirror which is exactly what he is doing to my right propped between the bathtub and the wall is a huge mirror like the ones used in ballet studios wheaton is not only painting thalia and me hes painting himself what are you painting my masterpiece i call it apotheosis i thought the circular painting back at the newcomb gallery was your masterpiece he laughs softly as though at a private joke that was his masterpiece my mind flashes back to the primitive childlike images fingerpainted on the floor beneath the drop cloth at the gallery then wheaton carrying me stepping over the stunned fbi mans body im not the man who painted that this is my last he says last what he gives me a sly look i could not have imagined on the roger wheaton i met a few days ago you know he says in a singsong voice thelast sleeping woman yes but this ones different because youre in it among other reasons youre not wearing your bifocals i think aloud those werent mine whose were they he gives me a look i translate as duh then he says they belonged to roger the weakling the fag my stomach turns a slow somersault jesus christ two fbi profilers and a psychiatrist sit brainstorming around a table and the photographer turns out to be right mpd dr lenz called it multiplepersonality disorder fragments of the psychiatrists patronizing lecture come back to me thats not how mpd works thats dr jekyll and mr hyde welcome to my nightmare dr lenz what else did lenz say always caused by extreme sexual or physical abuse if youre not roger wheaton i say carefully who are you i have no name you must go by something an odd smile when i was a boy i read leagues under the sea i loved captain nemo nemo means no one did you know that yes sailing beneath the oceans of the world trying to cure man of his selfdestructive obsessions ive wandered some of those same oceans but i learned the truth much earlier than nemo did man cant be cured he doesnt want to be cured only a child can express the purity in human nature and already the world is bearing down on him with all its weight its corruption and filth its violence wheaton bites his lip the gesture strangely childlike im not sure i understand dont you remember when you were a little girl remember when you believed in fairy tales and the shock you felt as each one crumbled in the face of reality no cinderella no santa claus your father wasnt perfect he wasnt even good he wanted things for himself alone he wanted your mother behind a locked door he wanted other things and it hurt you always caused by severe childhood sexual abuse always there was no perfect prince waiting to carry you off to his castle was there wheatons smoldering eyes never leave the canvas now all the little pretenders wanted the same thing didnt they they didnt care about you not the soft little you that lived in your secret heart they wanted to spend themselves inside you anything for that to use you and then ignore you throw you away like trash wheatons getting wound up and i dont want him any more unstable than he already is time to change the subject im really hot now he frowns in exasperation but after a moment he walks over and turns off the faucet how did i get here i ask as he walks back to the canvas in the deep valley between his back muscles the bones of his spine show through his skin like a ladder you dont remember he asks lifting his brush again you were conscious think back while i finish your eye and try not to move i do remember some things flashes of light waves of vertigo a gray sky bubbles of glass a bridge of white tubes and a long fall the roof you took me out on the roof wheaton chuckles but there were fbi agents up there not after leon was shot they all wanted to see the trophy theres a catwalk of pipes running from the art center to the physical plant it only runs over a narrow alley but crawling over it with a woman on your back sure gets the heart pumping but how did you manage that youre ill wheatons lips curl in disdain that diagnosis is currently under review roger was weak i am strong what is he telling me hes not sick anymore what did lenz say about mpd theres a documented case of one personality needing heart medication to survive and the other not why am i not like thalia wheaton keeps painting because i want to ask you something what youre a twin an identical twin yes i painted your sister oh god i saw that painting i say aloud ive done some reading on twins its an interest of mine and i find a consistent theme in their stories of childhood many twins share a closeness that borders on telepathy they tell remarkable tales precognitions of disaster intimations of death silent conversations when in the same room did you and your sister experience any of that as children yes i reply since the answer he wants is so clear some you want to know if your sister is alive or dead dont you i close my eyes against tears but they come anyway dont you already know through the tears i see wheatons eyes locked upon mine this is a test he wants to know if i know janes fate hes testing my assertion of paranormal ability which is it he asks alive or dead trying to read him im suddenly thrown back to the street in sarajevo to the instant the world blacked out and i felt a part of me die despite all my subsequent hopes despite the phone call from thailand i knew then that jane was dead dead i whisper wheaton purses his lips and goes back to his painting am i right he cocks his head as if to say maybe yes maybe no why are you so interested in twins isnt it obvious two personalities from the same genetic code twins are exactly like me in that way i dont know how to respond he has clearly traveled far down this road and i can only look for clues to what he needs to hear when you first came into the gallery he says with kaiser i knew it was a sign sent by whom i have no idea but a sign nevertheless a sign of what that one half can survive without the other his words hit me like a stake through the heart even though i knew it to be true this confirmation dissolves some essential fraction of my spirit shes dead i whisper yes wheaton says but you shouldnt be upset shes far better off the way she is now what youve seen my paintings the sleeping women surely you understand understand what the point the purpose of the paintings but i dont i never have wheaton lowers his brush and stares at me with incredulity the release ive been painting the release the release i echo from what from the plight his face is like that of a monk trying to explain the holy trinity to a savage the plight femininity the plight of being a woman a moment ago i felt only grief now something harder quickens my blood a desire to know to understand i dont understand what youre telling me yes you do youve tried so hard to live as a man you work relentlessly obsessively you havent married youve borne no children but thats no escape not in the end and youre learning that arent you every month the little seed inside you cries out to be fertilized louder all the time your womb aches to be filled youve let kaiser use your body havent you i saw it the morning you came back with him to the house on audubon place so im not at audubon place of course im not if i were i would have heard the st charles streetcar bell by now do you mean that killing women somehow releases them from pain of course the life of woman is the life of a slave lennon said it woman is the nigger of the world from childhood to the grave shes used and used again until shes but an exhausted shell broken by childbirth and marriage and housekeeping and wheaton shakes his head as if too angry to further explain the obvious then dips his brush in paint and goes back to the canvas different voices are speaking in my head marcel de becque telling me that westerners fight against death while the people of the east accept it this posture of acceptance is portrayed in the sleeping women johns voice all serial murder is sexual murder thats axiomatic dr lenz saying wheatons mother left home when he was thirteen or fourteen details unclear lenz badgering wheaton about it at the second interview wheaton evading the question thats what all this is about the paintings the murders everything wheatons mother but im not going to question him about her until im fairly sure i can survive the asking i do understand that i tell him my eyes settling on thalias inert body thats why ive lived the life i have how can this man possibly see the ruin thalia is now as a release but the painting youre doing now must have a different theme he nods flicking his hand right then left his eye leading the strokes with lightning precision its my emergence he says my freedom from the prison of duality from roger you mean yes again the strange smile rogers dead now rogers dead how did he die i shed him like a snake sheds its skin it took a surprising amount of effort but it had to be done he was trying to kill me now frank smith speaks from my memory confiding that roger wheaton wanted his help with suicide roger went to frank smith for help didnt he wheatons eyes are on me now trying to gauge the depth of my knowledge thats right why go to him why not to conrad hoffman your helper hoffman set this place up for you didnt he wheaton looks at me like im three years old roger didnt know conrad except from that first show which he quickly forgot dont you see i cant digest the information fast enough does didroger i mean did he know about you of course not but how do you hide from him how have you done all this work without him knowing its not difficult conrad and i set up this special place and this is where i do my work is that what you did in new york too wheaton cuts his eyes at me a wolfish look in them you know about new york yes how a computer program enhanced the faces in your earlier paintings and an fbi man recognized one of the victims kaiser ill bet yes hes a sly one isnt he i hope so as wheaton paints on i ponder the chances of the fbi finding me here they know what happened by now of course john and baxter lenz the nopd they know gaines was not the killer theyve seen wheatons finger painting found agent aldridge but what could possibly lead john to this place the infrared photos fbi planes shot total coverage of the french quarter and the garden district they have a definite number of houses with courtyards by now dozens of agents are probably at the new orleans courthouse right now wading through the deeds to those places searching for any connection to roger wheaton or conrad frederick hoffman will they include houses with conservatories yes john will be thorough we talked about houses with skylights anything that lets in lots of light will be on the list how long have they been looking for me is this the evening of the day gaines was shot or the next day or the next i suddenly realize that im terribly hungry thirsty too im starving do you have any food wheaton sighs and looks up at the glass roof checking the diminishing light then he sets down his brush and walks to my left out of my field of vision straining to turn my neck i see him reach down into a brown grocery bag and bring out a flat narrow package about eight inches long beef jerky suddenly im standing in mrs pitres driveway outside the garage apartment conrad hoffman rented where john found hoffmans stash of junk food beef jerky was part of it beside the grocery bag stands something else that must have been hoffmans an igloo ice chest the standard threefootwide plastic model big enough for two cases of beer or iv bags filled with saline and narcotics it depends on the customer i suppose wheatons gloved hands give him difficulty tearing open the yellow plastic wrapper of the jerky but he knows i cant manage it in my present state at last he pulls it apart and walks over to the tub with tremendous effort i raise my hand and take the brown strip from him very good he says ugh i think as i slide the tacky stuff into my mouth but when i grind the flat strip between my back teeth my tongue savors the grease expressed from the meat like creme brulee if only i had some water to go with it i could cup some bathwater and drink but i dont fancy a mouthful of urine if i regain my muscular control ill drink from the tap how do you know roger is dead i ask if i have a potential ally in this room his name is roger wheaton the artist laughs softly you remember the finger painting on the floor at the gallery yes that was his last gasp his death throes an infantile attempt at some sort of confession pathetic and now you dont need your his eyeglasses anymore you see me painting without them dont you yes but youre still wearing your gloves what about your other symptoms wheaton glances at me and his eyes flicker with confidence youre very close to it now you see rogers efforts to kill me arent anything new hes been trying to kill me for a long time now more than two years only i didnt know it how wheaton pauses with his brush then adds a few judicious strokes autoimmune diseases are poorly understood multiple sclerosis scleroderma lupus oh doctors understand the mechanics of how they kill you well enough but the etiology the cause you might as well consult a witch doctor do you know what an autoimmune disease is a phenomenon in which the bodys immune system which evolved to protect the body from outside invaders actually malfunctions and attacks the body itself wheaton gives me a triumphant look isnt that food for thought how did the weakling come upon it perhaps his guilt and selfdisgust were so consuming his desire to kill me so powerful that they manifested themselves physically my disease waxes and wanes in severity as it progresses and i noticed that the waxing phases occurred when roger had control then he began actively trying to murder me with frank smiths help with insulin you know what that told me there were chinks in the wall that separated us he was beginning to see into my mind thats when you walked into my life a mirror of a woman id already painted a woman who was dead yet here was her double her other half perfectly healthy i knew then a new vision had come to me and this painting was part of it i had to save myself i stare speechless from the steaming tub the complexity of his delusion is staggering born in the mind of an abused child it blossomed and flowered in the crucible of a dying artists fear of extinction are you i mean has it worked are you cured its happening i can feel it im breathing more easily my joints are less stiff but youre still wearing your gloves a tight smile my hands are too delicate to take chances and theres systemic damage that will take time to heal he glances up at the darkening sky i want you to be quiet now my lights almost gone i will but theres one thing i dont understand he frowns but i push on you say you killed the women you painted to release them from their plight to spare them a life of pain and exploitation is that right yes yet each sleeping woman was raped before she died how can you stand there and tell me youre sparing them pain when youre putting them through the worst thing a woman can experience short of death wheaton has stopped painting his eyes glower with anger and confusion what are you talking about conrad hoffman before he died he had a gun to my head he told me he was going to rape me he said that even if he had to shoot me in the spine it would still be nice and warm between my legs wheatons eyes narrow to slits youre lying no then he was trying to intimidate you to get you into the car i shake my head i saw his eyes felt the way he touched me ive been raped before i know how rapists eyes look a strange cast of compassion comes over the long face you were raped yes but thats not the point the last woman taken before thalia the one taken from dorignacs and dumped in the drainage canal the pathologist found semen inside her his head jerks as if avoiding a blow was it yours i ask softly wheaton throws down his brush and takes two steps toward me youre lying the prudent thing would be to stop but my salvation may lie in the root of this paradox the fbi is sure you killed the dorignacs woman they worked out the timing of wingates death and they know when hoffman flew back from new york hoffman couldnt have taken her wheaton is wheezing now like a child with asthma i took her but he stands with his mouth open unable to continue he really does believe that by killing those women he was sparing them but i cant spare him somewhere buried behind those deranged eyes is the gentle mind of the artist i met earlier in the week help me understand i plead a man who saves a twelveyearold girl from being raped in vietnam turns around and helps some pervert rape the women he claims hes saving wheatons chin is quivering i guess it was roger who saved that girl in vietnam no a single explosive syllable i did that i say nothing the fault line running through wheatons mind is torturing him more painfully than i possibly could his face twitches and his hands shiver at his sides with a jerk of his head he looks up at the nearly dark sky then he walks to a table behind his easel lifts a hypodermic syringe from it and walks back toward me his face devoid of emotion my newfound confidence vaporizes leaving pure terror in its wake if wheaton wants to stick me with that needle theres nothing i can do about it that reality sends me hurtling back to honduras to the night my innocence died forever when i learned the most terrible of lifes lessons you can shriek and fight and beg for someone to stop hurting you but it wont make them stop you can plead to god and your mother and father and they will not hear you your cries will not move to pity those who rend you when wheaton steps behind my head the skin of my neck crawls awaiting the prick of the needle summoning all my strength i twist my neck to look up and back he is standing by my iv tree injecting the contents of his syringe into my iv bag i scream now with all my power but he tosses the empty syringe on the floor and walks back to his easel my left arm begins to burn at the wrist and tears of anger and helplessness flow from my eyes sucking in great gulps of air i try to fight the unknown poison but in a matter of seconds my eyelids fall as surely as shutters being pulled down by a man with a hook this time the world returns as stars in a black sky a universe of stars slightly blurred by glass and the sound of a man sobbing the anguished sobs seem to echo all the way from a distant planet the planet of childhood i suspect im shivering again which is not such a bad thing its when you stop shivering that youre in trouble i can barely see thalia across from me in the tub so dark is the night but im thankful for the darkness ive been many places where my only light at night was the stars and i know this if i can see polaris and the horizon i can estimate my latitude not with enough accuracy to navigate a ship by not without a sextant but enough to guess my location in general terms its one of the practical tricks my father taught me a good thing for a world traveler to know he said especially if youre ever hijacked on a boat or a plane which he once was i dont know which star is polaris yet because i cant see either the big or little dipper which are the quickest guides polaris may not even lie within my field of vision but i am facing north and surrounded on three sides and overhead by glass my view only partly obscured by tree branches if i can watch long enough stay conscious long enough all the stars will move around the sky but one polaris which rotates in a twodegree circle above the north pole the pole star the north star that constant light has guided many a desperate traveler and i am certainly that now my problem is the horizon i cant see it because of the high brick wall outside not to worry says my father you can use an artificial horizon the best is a bowl of mercury on the ground mercury reflects stars remarkably well you simply measure the angle between polaris and its reflection then divide by two thats if you have a sextant which i dont in the absence of a mercury bowl the surface of a pool of water can be substituted and that i do have but the conservatory glass distorts the starlight enough so that combined with the movement of the bathwater caused by breathing and blood circulation no clear reflection exists not the end of the world my father assures me you can guess where the horizon is the anguished sobbing has stopped i sense that wheaton is lying on the floor somewhere but i cant see him as i try to make out objects in the room an amazing new reality comes to me my muscles are under my control leaning back i look up at the silver line of my iv stand the hanging bag is flat whatever was keeping my muscles in limbo has stopped flowing into me but my mind is not yet clear it seems unnaturally focused on the idea of the stars and where i am but this information is important new orleans lies roughly on the thirtieth parallel if i can verify that im on the thirtieth parallel i can reasonably assume that im still in new orleans that wheaton has not flown me to some distant killing house where the other victims await me like the living sculpture thalia has become of course polaris will not tell me my longitude so the thirtieth parallel could put me in bermuda the canary islands or even tibet but these are outside possibilities for me thirty degrees latitude will mean a real chance of rescue by the fbi control of my muscles brings to mind another possibility that of saving myself after flexing most of my cramped limbs i decide i can probably get out of the tub the problem is wheaton hes close by even if i cant see him is he close enough to stop me from breaking out of this glass room surely hes thought of that but do i really need to break out to save myself i was wearing a pistol on my ankle when he overpowered me at the gallery it must be here somewhere but before i look for it or do anything that entails risk i must know how close he is and what he will do when he hears noise reaching out with my right hand i turn the hotwater tap and wait for twenty or thirty seconds the new water is cold then it begins to warm and blissful heat flows under and around me bringing blood to my bluish skin the bathwater cant be that cold i tell myself no colder than the temperature of the air which wheaton must keep at close to seventy degrees because of his hands it doesnt have to be that cold my father reminds me you lose heat to water thirty times faster than you do to air sustained immersion can kill you without regular infusions of hot water thalia might already have died of hypothermia the faucet continues to run but wheaton doesnt come to investigate when the level approaches the rim of the tub i shut it off i want to get up but a soft wave of whatever has kept my mind hazy resists my intention and i lie back against the enamel sleep wants to enevelop me but i force my eyes open and watch the slowly changing sky the bathwater cools then becomes cold as i lie shivering in the dark every star above me wheels slowly across the sky except one bright and stationary it hovers just above the treetops polaris its a matter of seconds to estimate where the horizon is guess the angle between that imaginary line and polaris and subtract that number from ninety degrees the answer sets my heart racing thirty degrees im almost certainly still in new orleans if john kaiser looks hard enough for me he will find me this possibility warms me more deeply than hot water could and yet i cant rely on rescue from outside reaching up with a shaking hand i turn the hotwater tap again but this time i dont sit and wait to be warmed this time i stand on shaky legs and climb out of the tub my muscles still arent quite my own but they do function the iv tube in my hand presents a problem but the iv stand has wheels and the floor appears to be painted concrete with careful steps i drag the stand over to the glass wall of the conservatory what i find is discouraging the first four feet of glass above the brick wall supporting the conservatory is encased in a diamondshaped metal mesh smashing the glass with something heavy will get me nowhere theres a glass door leading outside but it too has mesh between its metal struts and a heavy padlock ensures that the door remains closed the space my body displaced in the tub is filling quickly what options do i have creep into the house proper and try to slip past wheaton surely he expects this and the sobs i heard before came from close by not far away he may be lying on a sofa in the next room my pistol in his hand or the gun may be nowhere in the house he probably still has the taser he used on me at the gallery he may have a dog is it worth the risk of looking when i think of his eyes as he screamed denial of the rapes that option strikes me as rather like sneaking into a dragons lair do dragons really sleep if they do i fear its only lightly think says my father what do you know that he doesnt whats near to hand that can help you what do i know that im more than half addicted to xanax which is a cousin of valium its probably a crosstolerance between those drugs thats made it possible for me to wake and tiptoe around while wheaton believes me to be asleep what is near to hand that can help me i dont see any weapons not even paintbrushes the table from which wheaton took the hypodermic is bare the room is as sterile and empty as a prison cell which it is not quite empty i realize on the floor behind my end of the tub sits the igloo ice chest and the grocery bag conrad hoffmans things i drag the iv stand toward them the bag is half filled with the same junk food john found at hoffmans apartment poptarts potato chips hostess twinkies beef jerky i stare at the boxes and bags sensing important activity deep in my brain but not quite understanding it slowly the logic makes itself known to me these arent weapons they are defenses reaching into the bag i quietly open the boxes and remove three shining foil packs of poptarts and a handful of cellophanewrapped twinkies these i stash between the clawfoot tub and the mirror wheaton uses to help paint himself into his picture as i climb back into the tub i realize i forgot to look at wheatons paintinginprogress understanding that image might help me but not as much as that ice chest i think how long has it been sitting there how long since i saw hoffman swirling away in the mississippi moving to the igloo i say a silent prayer then pop open the white fastener and lift the lid its dark inside so i blindly push my hands toward the bottom they plunge into a rattling arctic ocean of ice and water with floating islands that feel like beer bottles in seconds pain radiates up my arms god bless you you sick bastard i say silently my heart pounds with new hope but i cant linger here warm water is lapping at my feet the bathtub is overflowing and not quietly but this too is good the spillover will wipe out the wet traces of my journey around the room and perhaps convince wheaton that im still in poor control of my faculties shutting the igloo i shove it a foot closer to the tub then climb back into the nearscalding water im reaching for the tap when i hear a noise in the dark i lay my head back and close my eyes the water runs on what are you doing bellows a groggy voice i reach out and take hold of thalias hand beneath the water footsteps approach the tub stop wheaton must be looking down at me beautiful he says sending a chill to my core despite the burning water the tap squeaks and the faucet stops running then something dips into the steaming water and warm waves lap against my breasts wheatons hand covers my left breast gently as though hes reliving some distant memory i force myself to breathe with a regular rhythm the hand slides over my heart feeling the blood beating there then slips beneath the water it covers my navel kneading the little pad of fat there then slides down between my legs a sensation of falling nearly makes me scream but numbness saves me it spreads outward from my brain and heart a numbness of selfpreservation born in the jungle of honduras neurochemical armor to help me endure anything in the cause of survival wheatons fingers tremble as they explore but i do not i lie still and breathe in and out in and out his hand is not the paw of a brute but the inquisitive hand of a boy the fingers entwine in my pubic hair and cling with childlike tenacity in the silence of the dripping faucet a long keening moan of grief cuts me to the quick like the cry of an orphaned animal beside its mother it reverberates through the glass room terminating in a sob then the fingers uncurl and the hand vanishes footsteps move away and i hear a clatter in the other room then the footsteps return this time behind my head my iv bag rattles in the stand hes changing it soon he hisses tomorrow as he walks away my wrist begins to burn valium i tell myself even as my eyes try to close not insulin insulin doesnt burn but just in case i reach between the tub and the mirror strip the wrapper from a twinkie and gobble it in two bites dumping protective sugar into my blood as fast as possible then i eat another my dry throat makes it hard to swallow but after a look at thalia i force down a third should i pull the iv catheter out of my vein if i do ill bleed into the tub maybe for some time and tomorrow wheaton will see what i did i could always say it was an accident beneath the water i squeeze thalias hand wishing with all my heart that she could squeeze back were going to make it girl i whisper you wait and see pull out the tube says my father lift your hand out of the water the vein will clot in the air i cant feel my hand i tell him i im reaching for the iv catheter when my eyes go black i awaken in full daylight but i dont open my eyes wheaton will expect me to be unconscious longer for an hour i lie with my eyes closed reconstructing my environment from sound alone just as yesterday wheaton stands behind his easel painting with sure rapid strokes now and then the easel creaks and the soft sibilants of his breathing alter with his stance theres a new urgency to his movements how long will it take him to finish this painting how long before he turns me into another thalia i have to slow him down the longer i lie here alive the more time john will have to find me but i must also prepare for the possibility that he may not find me that wheaton will finish his work first things first says my father get him talking when the sun shines noticeably brighter through my eyelids i make a show of coming awake how does it look i ask as it should wheaton answers in a clipped voice he clearly doesnt recall last nights conversation with fondness rather than push him i lie quietly and try not to look at thalia who seems several shades paler than she did yesterday at length wheaton says i saw a report on television this morning if the local anchors arent lying for the fbi you told me the truth last night about the rapes i say nothing a quick glance at me as he paints conrad was raping my subjects yes id do anything to change that but i cant i should have known i suppose conrad always had poor impulse control thats why he went to prison but rape is just a symptom of what i told you about yesterday the plight if conrad hadnt done it someone else would have in a different way perhaps the husbands way but still theyre all much better off now your sister included wheaton steps away from the canvas and studies himself in the mirror its worse for you that shes dead of course but for her theres no more pain no more helpless wishing no more subservience if i think about jane now i wont be able to keep it together i understand about the plight i understand the sleeping women but i dont think youre telling me everything his eyes flick to me then back to the canvas as he resumes painting what do you mean your feelings about women didnt just come to you out of the blue they must have been shaped by women you knew i have to be careful here maybe the woman you knew best of all wheatons brush pauses in midair then returns to the canvas i know your mother disappeared when you were thirteen or fourteen he stops painting altogether i know what thats like my father disappeared when i was twelve in cambodia everyone said he was dead but i never believed it hes watching me now he knows im telling the truth and he cant fight the compulsion to know more what did you think had happened he asks at first i created all sorts of scenarios hed been wounded and had amnesia he was crippled and couldnt get back to me he was held prisoner by asian warlords but as i got older i realized that probably none of that was true you accepted that he was dead no i came to believe something even more terrible that he hadnt come back because he didnt want to come back hed abandoned us maybe to be with another woman another family another little girl that he loved more than me wheaton is nodding it almost killed me thinking that i racked my brain trying to figure out what id done to make him angry enough to stop loving me it wasnt your fault he was a man i know but last night i was thinking dreaming really about you and i saw a woman i thought she must be your mother she was holding a boy and trying to explain why she had to go i tried to ask her why she would leave you red blotches have appeared on wheatons face and neck the way they used to on my sisters face he jabs his paintbrush at me like a knife she never left me i was the only thing that kept her alive what do you mean his face goes through tortured contractions as though hes reliving some horrible moment then he dips his brush in the paint and goes back to his canvas almost as if no conversation ever took place and then he begins talking i was born during the war wheaton says painting with absolute assurance nineteen fortythree my father was in the marine corps he came home on leave after basic training and thats when he fathered me thats what he thought anyway he was a hard man merciless and cold mother couldnt explain to me why she married him she only said things look different when youre young my mother said the same thing more than once i tell him when my father was drafted she was left alone for the first time since shed been married she had two sons but they were only four and five it was a liberation she was free of the cutting voice the brutal hand the ruthless insistence of the nights when she protested in vain to the ceiling and the walls begging god for some reprieve god had finally answered her prayers he had sent her the war wheaton smiles with irony a month after my father shipped out for the pacific a stranger came to the door asking for water he had a limp some injury or disease had crippled him and the army wouldnt take him he worked for the government one of the wpa artists projects he was a painter mother fell in love with him the first day she worshiped art her prize possession was a book a dead aunt had given her a big colorplate thing called masterpieces of western art anyway the painter camped nearby for two weeks and when he left mother was pregnant she never knew where he went but he said was from new orleans he told her that much my god i say silently i was born two weeks premature wheaton twirls the tip of his brush on his palette that made the timing almost work out it meant mother could lie about my paternity and get away with it at least for a while when my father came back from the war he was different hed been captured by the japanese and they had done something to him he rarely talked he became a sort of religious fanatic but he was just as brutal with her and with us he saw immediately that mother treated me differently from my brothers she told him it was because i was premature that i was fragile he tried to force me to be like the others but she resisted him after a time they came to an arrangement she bought me a sheltered childhood with subservience anything he wanted he got his word was law in daily life in his bed only where i was concerned did her word count my brothers worked the farm and helped him trap when they werent in school my life was different mother taught me things read to me pinched pennies to buy me paint and canvas she encouraged me to imitate the paintings in her book my brothers made fun of me but secretly they were jealous they beat me when they could get away with it but that was a small thing in the summers mother and i spent our days in an old barn in the woods we escaped a look of transcendence comes over wheatons face it stood in a small clearing surrounded by ancient trees with a stream flowing beside part of the roof had fallen in but we didnt mind the sun fell through the hole in great yellow shafts the way it does in gothic cathedrals what did you paint there i ask even as the answer comes to me did you paint your mother who else could i paint after i outgrew copying from the book she would bring different clothes from the house or things shed bought on a rare trip into town things she never showed my father gauzy gowns robes like those the women wore in the classical paintings hour after hour i would paint and we would talk and laugh until the shafts of light began to fade and we began to whisper putting off until the last second our walk back to the dark little house of rage what happened what ended all that wheatons body freezes like a tape being stopped his jaw moves but no sound emerges then slowly his right hand extends the paintbrush to the canvas when i was thirteen i became curious about certain things many of the pictures in mothers book were nudes and i wanted to paint like that she understood the necessity but we had to be careful sometimes my father took work at the mill in the town my brothers would do his trapping then thats when she posed nude for me though the bathwater is cold my face feels hot i sense that were heading into the unmapped territory of incest did you become intimate intimate his voice is an echo from a cave we were like the same person i meant you meant sex he lifts his brush his face showing disgust it wasnt like that i touched her sometimes of course to pose her and she told me things about the way love was supposed to be how somewhere in the world she hoped it really was but mostly we made plans she said i had a gift that would make me famous one day i swore a thousand times that if i ever got away i would succeed and come back for her a frightening vision comes to me did someone catch you with her like that wheaton closes his eyes one spring afternoon instead of trapping my brothers spied on us they watched until mother disrobed then they ran all the way to town and got my father when he burst into the barn and saw her naked he went crazy screaming gibberish about harlots and godknowswhatelse from the bible my mother shrieked at him to get out but he had murder in his eyes he told my brothers to hold me down and he he started to beat her but instead of taking it as she usually did she fought back she clawed his face drew blood when he saw that he picked up an old scythe handle wheaton squints as though staring at a distant object i can still hear the whistle it made and the impact like the sound of an eggshell the way she fell she was dead before she hit the floor his voice sounds the way mine does when i speak of my fathers death higher in pitch tremulous why isnt there any record of this there was no one around for miles she had no family left did your father bury her no no what happened wheaton looks at the floor and his voice drops to a barely audible whisper he came over to where my brothers were holding me down and leaned over my face he told me to bury her and go home his breath stank he said if i told anyone what had happened he and my brothers would swear theyd caught me raping her in the barn after she was dead id never even heard of such a thing it paralyzed me with fear no one would believe me he said id be sent to a reform school in the city where boys would beat me every day and sodomize me in the night then they left me with her im so sorry i murmur but wheaton doesnt hear me i couldnt bury her his voice is almost a whine i couldnt even look at her the side of her head was broken her skin was like blue marble i cried until my eyes were like sandpaper then i dragged her down to the stream i fetched her gown and washed her from head to toe cleaning away the blood and straightening her hair as best i could the way i knew shed want it i knew they might come back at any moment but i didnt care id realized something her agony was finally over all her life was pain and now it had ended she was better off dead wheaton lays down his brush and drives his fingers through his tangled hair i wasnt better off i couldnt even imagine life without her but she was you see i do i see how a shattered child made the mental journey to a state that allows him to kill women and believe he is doing a good thing i went back to the barn and painted over what id been doing then in the dying light of the clearing i painted mother in her peace it was the first time id seen her face completely relaxed it was an epiphany for me my birth as an artist when i was finished i took a shovel from the barn and buried her beside the stream i didnt mark the spot i didnt want them to know where she was only i knew what happened when you went home my question seems to suck the humanity out of wheatons face for four years i lived like an animal my father told the few people who asked that my mother had run away to new york then he began poking into her past he became convinced that i was illegitimate he talked to her doctor studied the records at the courthouse he was right but he couldnt prove it he just knew there was nothing in me of him nothing and i thank god for it but after that they did things to roger that you simply cant imagine they starved him beat him worked him like a slave the father gave the older brothers permission to do as they liked with him they burned him cut him shoved things inside him the father used him sexually to punish him wheaton shakes his head dismissively if it werent for me hed never have survived severe sexual or physical abuse during childhood dr lenz told us the kind of radical psychological break im talking about how did you protect roger i listened i watched my hearing grew frighteningly acute i could hear them breathing in their sleep if their breathing changed i knew it if they got out of bed i knew roger was in danger i told him when to hide when to run when to hoard food when to give in and when to resist after a while it got where i could hear them thinking i saw the morbid desire in their minds pictures forming into intent intent traveling from their brains down their sluggish nerves moving their heavy limbs to action thats how roger survived did you tell him to run away to new york wheaton resumes painting the brush moving quickly again yes but the city wasnt how i thought it would be roger tried to paint but he couldnt make a go of it people offered help but they didnt want to help him they were helping themselves they gave him food a place to sleep space to paint but in exchange they wanted their pound of flesh they wanted him and he gave himself to them what did it matter they were so much gentler than his father and brothers for four years he moved among them soft greedy gray old men painting derivative work doing anything they asked of him things had to change an almost cruel smile touches wheatons lips one day walking down the street i saw my opening i darted into a recruiting office and joined the marine corps one quick irrevocable act there was nothing he could do the war in vietnam was heating up and almost before roger knew what had happened he was on his way there pride flashes like diamonds in the artists eyes thats where i came into my own vietnam he couldnt make it without me during the days he would poke along joking and cursing and slapping backs trying to fit in but at night he made room for me on patrol on point i could smell things he couldnt even see i could hear bare feet bending grass at fifty meters i kept him alive the others too they gave me medals for it what about after i ask a fraction of my mind still wondering how far john and baxter and lenz have come down the investigative trail to this house i went back to new york didnt i i was a different man i took my gi bill money went to nyu and painted for four years when i got out i did portraits to keep myself in groceries i was searching for my destiny and it found me my surviving brother died in the merchant marine and the farm went up for sale i decided to buy it i thought of burning the place down but i didnt every day was a sweet revenge those rooms had witnessed all mothers pain and roger filled them with color and light it was then that he began to paint the clearing when did you start painting the sleeping women wheaton purses his lips like a man trying to recall the year he got married or joined the service seventyeight i think i was driving out of new york and i saw a girl beside a bridge hitchhiking north she was young and pretty and looked like a student a waif you know a leftover hippie i asked where she was going and she said anyplace warm man wheaton smiles at the memory i knew exactly how she felt id been there too i drove her back to the farm on the way she got high she had pills with her and they made her talkative her story was like others id heard from women a father like mine a mother who couldnt protect her men who used her at the farm i fed her she got sleepy i asked if i could paint her and she said yes when i asked if i could paint her nude she hesitated but only a moment you wouldnt do anything freaky she said youre too nice and then she took off her clothes i posed her in the tub lulled into a trance by his story i feel a sudden nausea as his last words sink in i painted as roger never had i was in control you see i had the brush it worked under my will but something happened i say hesitantly wheaton puts down his brush and vigorously massages his left hand yes before i finished the painting she woke up i was naked im not sure how i got that way and what does it matter i only know i was naked and painting and i was aroused the girl panicked what did you do i panicked too she knew where she was if she told people the way things had happened it could cause trouble for roger i tried to calm her down but she took it wrong she fought she gave me no choice i pushed her under the water and held her there until she stopped fighting jesus what did you do then i finished the painting wheaton picks up his brush dips it and goes back to his work she looked so peaceful much happier than she had when i picked her up she was the first sleeping woman nineteen seventyeight the year i left high school roger wheaton drowned a waif junkie in new england and started down a road that led ultimately to my sister what did you do with her body i buried her in the clearing of course he did i waited a year before i picked up another one she was a runaway she made it so easy and i knew what i wanted by then what about conrad hoffman that was roger had a oneman show in new york and conrad showed up for that he saw something in the clearing paintings that no one else did he saw me the germ of me he was charismatic young dangerous he hung around after the show and we went for coffee he didnt fawn over roger as some did he sensed the power hidden in the paintings the darkness and i did something i never thought i would do you showed him your sleeping women wheaton nods cagily there were only two then you should have seen his face when he saw them he knew immediately that the women were dead he knew because hed seen women that way and when he looked back at me from the paintings i let him see my true face i dropped the mask as you did with me after tasing the fbi agent in the gallery what did hoffman do he reveled in it when i saw that he understood i felt some irresistible power well up within me and i ravished him what i wasnt like roger facedown and taking it in pain i was the one in control conrad saw my genius and he wanted to experience its totality he was a vessel for my power seeing shock in my face wheaton says conrad was bisexual hed told me in the car he picked it up in jail and after that he started helping you wheaton is painting with almost mechanical speed now conrad procured my subjects mixed the drug cocktails worked out what was best to keep them sedated while i worked the insulin he carried many burdens for me and he raped the women as a reward wheatons brush hardly stutters i suppose he did i doubt they were conscious while it happened i pray they werent what made you stop in new york i mean conrad killed someone in an argument he was sentenced to fifteen years he told me not to take any more but i i couldnt stop i tried to pick up a girl in new york she sensed something wrong and she fought screamed i barely escaped the police thats what made me stop conrad had told me about prison i couldnt go there it would have been like being back in my fathers house so you channeled your desires into the clearing paintings didnt you thats why they became more abstract yes and the more i put into them the more famous roger got i wanted the world to see my work purely not through the distorted mirror of rogers abstracts is that why you started killing again fifteen years later no he gives me a simple clear gaze i was dying i had to do what good i could while i could hoffman was out of prison by then he helped you six months after my diagnosis he was released to make room for new inmates id already moved to new orleans i had a juvenile fantasy of finding my biological father or his grave something tangible but i never did but yes conrad helped me begin my work again why did you sell the paintings why take the risk you already had money fame respect roger had those things wheatons brush pecks the palette then flies to the canvas in his bourgeois way but when collectors saw my sleeping women they recognized an entirely different level of truth like marcel de becque he was one do you know him well i know he buys my work nothing more strangely i believe him so what explains the connections between de becque wingate and hoffman were they all exploiting this tortured artist and his twisted vision what do you intend to do now im going away to live as myself openly moneys not a problem and conrad established new identities for us long ago just in case will you paint if i feel the need after this one i dont suspect i will what do you plan to do with me im going to give you what you most want im going to reunite you with your sister my eyes close where is my sister very close driving distance walking distance wheaton sniffs closer than that johns voice sounds in my head an echo of the first day i met him lakeshore drive the water table has fallen considerably in recent years he could be burying them under a house and they would stay buried and dry toss in a little lime every now and then they wouldnt even stink is she buried here under this house theres not even a hitch in wheatons brush stroke as he nods its almost more than i can bear the other women too yes your sister was a bit different from the rest she tried to escape im not sure how she managed it but she made it out to the garden conrad caught her but she fought and he had to end it there he buried her immediately i finished painting her using only a photograph for the first time in many hours anger boils to the surface reaching out to the tap i turn it as i have twice before only this time i open the cold valve wheaton doesnt seem to notice as i fight the tortured images called into being by his words he puts down his brush massages his hands again then lifts a watch from the table behind him and looks at it with a soft grunt he turns and walks into the main house theres a soft clatter followed by the low murmur of a voice hes making a phone call i roll over get to my knees lean out and drag the igloo cooler up to the tub praying the running water will cover the noise i take several panting breaths then lift the cooler to the edge of the tub and dump the contents inside the icy shock sucks the breath right out of my lungs even my thoughts seem to stutter so cold is the water but i havent time to waste three bottles of michelob have fallen into the tub i put them back into the empty cooler then slide it back to its place a droning voice floats through the doorway to my left i hear the word ticket several times possibly the word departure god its cold i wont be able to stand much of this my sluggish brain has already forgotten something critical my insulin defense reaching down between the tub and mirror i bring up a pack of poptarts and tear open the foil with stiff fingers i break the hard pastries into pieces shove them into my mouth and chew them just enough to get them down my throat wheaton is still talking i rip open another foil pack and gobble two more poptarts footsteps come to me i say softly trying to keep my teeth from chattering said the spider to the fly when wheaton reappears i suddenly realize how strange he looks in his white linen cloth after two days of painting ive gotten used to it but after hearing him talk on the phone like a normal person its a shock he looks like a man who believes hes jesus a sixtyyearold jesus he stands before the easel examining the canvas with a critical eye the ice water feels like its draining the life out of me and the pain is greater than i anticipated the line between ice and fire quickly vanishes is the painting done i ask what wheaton says in a distant voice oh almost i the ringing telephone cuts him off he looks confused it rings again faint but insistent with a quick glance at me he goes back into the house i have an almost irresistible compulsion to leap out of the tub turn on the hot water says a voice in my head a little wont hurt this time the footsteps return at a run wheaton rushes into the room his face blotched red again only this time theres a gun in his hand a smith amp wesson featherweight the gun john gave me whats the matter what happened they hung up his voice is a ragged whisper that happens all the time not here and it wasnt dead when i got there they listened for a few seconds before they hung up i try to keep my eyes flat as hope blossoms in my chest it was probably a kid or some pervert wheaton shakes his head the animal awareness shining in his eyes is a fearsome thing to see survival instinct honed to a gleaming edge why are you making explanations he asks why do you care i dont i just shut up he turns and looks at his unfinished painting then back at me i have to go go where why sometimes i know things and i never secondguess that feeling this place isnt safe anymore i feel a sudden urge to leap out of the freezing tub but before i can act wheaton says i know you can move my heart stutters dont pretend you cant i ran out of muscle relaxant i have to get ready to leave im going to walk over there and put some more valium into your iv enough to knock you out for a while but not enough to kill you his face looks sincere but i know who im talking to youre lying you already said youre going to kill me jordan i could shoot you right now if i wanted to kill you maybe were too close to other houses or maybe you cant stand to kill that way using insulin gives you the illusion of euthanasia a strange smile touches his lips and eyes i shot a lot of people in vietnam thats not a problem he crouches four feet from the tub and looks me in the eye why doesnt valium work on you jordan do you have a little habit is that it maybe a little one he laughs appreciatively youre a sly one arent you a survivor like me so far he stands and goes into the other room then returns with a syringe stay right where you are if you try anything ill have no choice but to shoot you same thing if you pull out the iv wheaton walks out of my field of vision and though i cant see him i know what hes doing leaning in from as far away as possible and injecting the contents of the syringe into my iv bag could he be telling the truth about the valium would he really let me live he hasnt let anyone else theyre all buried somewhere under this house my wrist should start burning but it doesnt wheaton reappears on my left side and crouches again three feet away he doesnt say anything he just watches youre shivering he says at length how do you feel scared theres nothing to fear dont fight it fight what the valium its not valium a wave of nausea rolls through me is it why do you say that because my wrist isnt burning he sighs then smiles with something like compassion youre right trust a junkie to know her drugs its insulin soon you wont have a care in the world no pain at all four feet opposite me thalia laveau looks like exactly what she is a living corpse i cannot end my life like that i only pray that conrad hoffman didnt rape her before she went into a coma sleepy yet asks wheaton cradling the gun in his left hand the sugar that the poptarts flushed into my blood will give only limited immunity to the insulin depending on the dose he gave me if he comes no closer than he is now ill pass out before i can do anything to save myself unless i pull out the iv and then hell shoot me i i am i say in a slurred voice am sleepy thats right he halfwhispers glancing past me through the glass wall of the conservatory he looks as if he expects to see armed men crossing his garden at any moment the bathwater doesnt feel as cold as it did before and for a second im thankful then i understand the insulin is affecting my perception near panic i shake myself then kick my legs up out of the tub which sends me sliding down into the water my behind skids between thalias thighs and my head slips beneath the surface it takes a supreme act of will to hold my head under the water but this is the only path to survival i make a show of fighting to get my head above the water a shadow appears above the tub then coalesces into a definable shape a head shoulders wheaton is looking down into the tub what does he see a replay of the first woman he ever killed the waif with a macabre sense of dislocation i watch my last moments on earth through his eyes he wants to pull my head clear of the water i can feel it to give me a more humane death starved for oxygen and stunned by the cold my lungs burn to reach the surface i cant wait for wheaton to reach in with a scream of desperation i explode out of the water hands extended like claws his eyes bulge in terror and he tries to wheel backward but i have him by the wrists he roars and tries to fight but his feet havent enough purchase on the wet floor to allow him to use his weight against me with all my weight i jerk both his hands down into the icy tub his eyes go wide with the incomprehension of a child being tortured for reasons it cannot guess and his feet go out from under him still i hold on new faces come alive in his eyes the abused boy who could read his fathers lustful thoughts the soldier who heard the enemys bare feet from fifty meters as i struggle to keep his hands pinned one of his wrists jerks in my hand and a muted explosion hammers my ears blood swirls through the bathtub his wrist jerks again and my ears ring like cymbals hes firing the gun under the water i dont feel hurt but sometimes you dont know amplified by the tub the blast alone stuns me but i dont let go bright red blood sprays through the icewater as though from a hose thalia a hole in her thigh is spurting blood with every beat of her heart shes still alive enough to die badly screaming in rage i cling to wheatons wrists as the gun kicks my freezing hand across the bottom of the tub when silence returns it shocks us both wheatons face is bone white and his arms have stopped struggling the icy water has done its work before i know what im doing ive let go of his wrists and scrambled out of the tub the iv stand crashes to the floor beside me and the catheter pops out of my wrist sending a warm rush of blood down my hand wheaton straightens slowly and for a moment i think hes been shot but hes not holding himself anywhere hes struggling to remove the soaked gloves from his shaking hands he looks like a burn victim trying to remove melted clothing one glove drops to the wet floor then the other and then hes holding his hands up before him fingers splayed and quivering the fingers are blue not a pleasant blue but the morbid blueblack that signals tissue death as i stare wheatons mouth forms an o and he roars in agony the scream snaps my trance backpedaling away from the tub i turn toward the door of the main house it seems a short distance away but when i try to run my legs go watery i have to stop bend and grip my knees to stay on my feet panic balloons in my chest cutting off my air is that the insulin too i need sugar rather than try to reach my stash by the mirror i fall backward onto my rump and throw my hand toward the grocery bag wheaton plods toward me his eyes blazing but he doesnt look like much of a threat its like being attacked by a man without hands scrabbling in the grocery bag i rip open a twinkie and stuff it into my mouth swallowing the spongy cake almost without chewing wheaton suddenly veers away back toward the tub hes looking down into it like a monk ordered to retrieve some relic from a kettle of fire the gun hes trying to summon the courage to plunge his dying hands back into the ice i rake my fingernails down my left forearm drawing blood the pain momentarily sharpens my senses and in that window of clarity i force myself to my feet wheaton bends over the tub and plunges one arm in up to the elbow then he pops erect like a jackinthebox his gun arm trembling and whirls to face me the pistol is rising when i charge him arms outstretched the gun bellows as my hands strike center mass driving him backward over the tub and into the mirror propped against the wall the mirror snaps five feet from the floor and the top half crashes over us bursting into lethal shards as big as china plates wheaton falls across the tub stunned but still conscious straining to hold himself above the icy water as i struggle to get off him his eyes flash with life and he jams the gun barrel into my throat dont i plead hating myself for begging please he smiles with odd regret then pulls the trigger theres a hollow click wildeyed he jerks back the gun to bludgeon me but his flexing shoulder slips off the rim of the tub and sends him down into the water he doesnt even scream he sucks in a massive gulp of air and one dark hand flies to his chest as though to massage his heart before pity can gain a foothold in mine i put both hands on his head and shove it beneath the icy surface he struggles but his strength has left him i want to hold him down if only to end his torture but i cant afford to the sugar in my blood could be metabolized by insulin before i get ten paces from the tub if it is ill leave this place feet first with a tag around my toe i raise myself from the tub and stagger to the door behind the easel the door leads to an oblong room containing a television a sofa and a telephone table stumbling through it i find myself in a wide hall that runs forty feet to a great wooden door much like the one in janes house on st charles avenue i start toward the door focusing on my balance but twothirds of the way there my legs give way and i fall headlong into a white baseboard theres a strange fog loose in my head i want to lie on the soft wood and let it enfold me but from the midst of the fog rises an image so indelible that my heart begins pounding under the force of it shallow graves eleven in a line low mounds of dirt moldering in the dark beneath a house this house beneath my feet wait the remains of eleven women whose husbands and parents and children pray each night to know their fates my sister waits with them and there is no question whom shes waiting for my duty is not yet done struggling to my knees i crawl the last few yards to the door then reach up with my right hand and turn the knob it doesnt move a few stillactive brain cells paint the image of a window behind my closed eyes but ive no hope of reaching one i can go no farther please i hear myself sob and again the indignity of begging embarrasses me open the door remains closed a pathetic end for a decently lived life naked alone lost in a white fog that blows with insidious silence deadening the sound of my sobs then the rasp of my breathing soon all will be whiteness as my ears chase the last hissing echo of my respiration an inhuman screech splits my fading consciousness like an ax theres a pounding of drums then a shattering cacophony like the mirror breaking in the conservatory black insectile figures swarm over me their metallic voices ringing against my eardrums one is trying to ask me something his goggle eyes wide and earnest but i cant understand him a scream of utter desolation cleaves the air stretching toward infinity it punches through my heart like a bullet of pure misery fusing with the grief that has festered there so long my hands fly up to cover my ears but the scream smashes into a black wall leaving only a ringing vibration in the air the goggle eyes above me go wide then vanish and a human face appears in their place john kaisers face he thinks im dead i see it in his eyes the fog has almost swallowed me i have to tell him im alive if i dont he might bury me deep in my mind a spark winks to life a lone pinpoint of white in a black sky and from that star comes a voice not my fathers voice a womans voice my sisters voice speak jordan say something damn you two syllables fall from my lips with eerie clarity and they trigger a burst of frantic activity the word i say is sugar then i slap my wrist sugar i say again slapping the bloody iv hole like a monkey on amphetamines sugar sugar sugar a whiteclad angel bends over me i think she wants us to check her glucose level then the star winks out and johns face vanishes jordan jordan white light spears my retinas but i endure the pain i dont want the dark anything but that jordan wake up a shadow floats over my eyes shielding them a hand after a moment the hand pulls back and a face leans in johns face its creased with worry and his eyes are red with fatigue do you know me he asks agent kaiser right the worry doesnt leave his face i told you john im not a china vase thank god wheaton john shakes his head he ran screaming into the hall when you were down he had a gun it was turned around in his hand like a club i shouted for swat not to fire but by then someone had he was killed instantly ck i whisper what clean kill oh turning my head i see that im lying on a table in what looks like an er treatment room theres an iv running into my arm i have to fight the urge to rip it out where are we charity hospital your blood sugars back to normal the doctors say youre dehydrated but theyre fixing that now their main worry was your brain thats always been my worry too jordan i feel like i have a bad hangover thats all really physically but what about inside inside i pick at the bandage over the wrist where wheatons iv was a couple of times this past week i got my hopes up for jane but deep down i knew she was gone but thalia after hoffman died in the river i thought we might find her alive and all right waiting for the ax you know johns eyes are steady but somber she was probably in that coma within an hour or two after being taken once she evaded surveillance and hoffman got her there was nothing we could have done i nod where was i four blocks from wheatons house on audubon place five blocks from st charles avenue one block from tulane jesus they had some nerve whats happening there now he gives me a hard look are you sure you want to know yes theyve taken two corpses from shallow graves under a crawl space janes no ids yet were in the process of gathering all the victims families at a hotel were going to proceed very slowly on the exhumations we dont want any mistakes i understand wheaton told me the new york victims are buried in a clearing on the family farm in vermont john nods as though not surprised were already working on paperwork up there that farm is mostly a commercial district now big deal to start poking random holes in search of bodies i dont want to stay here tonight the doctors want to keep you i dont care youre the fbi do something about it he takes a deep breath then lays his hand on my arm listen theres something youre going to want to know what i ask my throat tight with fear we just got a message from marcel de becque what an invitation really what do you mean he wants to talk to you in person de becques here in the us no he wants to see you at his house in the caymans he says hell send his jet if you need it do i need it no there are still serious questions in this case and only de becque can answer them now baxter says we can take the bureau jet when when youre strong enough for a twohour flight tell them to get the plane ready and go handle the doctors i dont want to deal with that john looks at me like a parent who knows his child will not take no for an answer then he squeezes my shoulder bends and kisses me on the forehead i guess were taking a trip grand cayman lies like an emerald on the caribbean smooth and flat after the mountains of cuba our pilot lands the lear at the airport near georgetown but this time theres no pair of escorts waiting with a range rover at the fbi directors request the governor of the islands has provided state transportation a black limousine flying the caymanian flag from its fenders our native driver speaks with a crisp british accent and he loses no time shepherding us to de becques colonial estate on north bay the door is answered by li who stands with the same selfpossession i noticed the first time we were here mademoiselle she says with a slight inclination of her head monsieur this way please this time there will be no body search john is carrying two service pistols and the governor knows it de becque knows it too and hes made no objection li leads us to the great hall at the back of the mansion where the massive window looks out onto the harbor just as before the tanned silverhaired french expatriate stands framed in the lower corner of his window staring out to sea like a man with an unquenchable yearning mademoiselle glass li announces and then she backs soundlessly down the hall de becque turns and nods with courtly grace im glad you came cherie im sorry to bring you so far but alas my legal situation does not allow me to travel to you he takes a step toward us then hesitates i have things to tell you that you must know for my sake and for yours he motions us deeper into the room sil vous plait come in please john and i walk over to the sofa we sat on less than a week ago and sit side by side de becque remains standing he seems ill at ease and he paces as he speaks first the matter of the sleeping women i want to assure you that i never knew the identity of the painter or of his associate i did know christopher wingate the art dealer and its him that what i have to say concerns as you know i bought the first five sleeping women he offered for sale the sixth painting was also promised to me and i paid a deposit on it then wingate stiffed me as they say he sold the painting to hodai takagi a japanese collector though he knew i would match any price takagi paid why would he do that i ask to open new markets john replies right quite so says de becque its a business after all but this painting had been promised to me and i was angry im not a man to brood over an injustice im not what the psychiatrists call passive im sorry what is the term passive aggressive i suggest oui i happened to know that wingate was heavily invested in a development project in the virgin islands i made a few phone calls and very shortly monsieur wingate discovered he had made a very bad investment his principal was wiped out am i boring you agent kaiser im riveted actually the frenchman nods his seablue eyes flickering wingate was infuriated by what i had done and he sought revenge now you should be aware that wingate had visited my estate here on three previous occasions id entertained him over a period of days he learned a bit about my life he sat in this room he saw many of my things among them certain photographs de becque waves his hand toward the wall where his collection of vietnam photos hangs you have seen these photos some anyway he walks over to the wall and takes down two blackandwhite photos then comes back to us studying the pictures all the way these were not hanging here during your last visit perhaps youd like to see them with a strange sense of foreboding i take the frames from his hand the first picture is of me my standard publicity head shot the second is of jane her graduation photo from ole miss my heart begins to pound what are you doing with these at last de becque sits on the sofa opposite us listen to me jordan again the soft j because of the circumstances when we last met there were certain things i could not tell you now things have changed you should know that i knew your father much better than i led you to believe i think perhaps you suspected this yes he was a good friend to me and i to him i did what i could for his career and for his life what did he do for you he enriched my days thats a great gift but what you really want to know is this did your father die on the cambodian border today i tell you he did not oh god he was shot there by the khmer rouge yes but he was found alive later by others there are many angles in an asian war business always business even with the communists until they win jonathan glass was my friend and when i heard what had happened to him i exerted considerable effort to learn his fate over a period of months i managed to negotiate an exchange for him for certain considerations that need not be mentioned here how badly was he hurt very seriously he had a head wound there had been infection john takes my hand and squeezes tightly he was not the same man he had been before the wound says de becque did he know who he was he knew his name he remembered certain things other things no his vision was impaired as well photography as a career was over for him though i dont think he much cared at that point his frame of reference had been reduced to fundamental things food shelter wine love i cut in is that where this is going did he have someone here someone like li de becque raises his eyebrows in a way that says we are all adults here no there was a woman she was with him before he was shot oui i take a deep breath then plunge on to the almost unspeakable question did he have children by her de becques eyes tell me he understands my pain non no children relief washes through my soul but new fear follows did he remember us at all my mother my sister the frenchman holds up his flattened hand and tilts it from side to side sometimes yes sometimes no but let me speak plainly if your anxiety is that jon simply decided to abandon you to not go back to america this should not be a concern he was in no condition to do such a thing i had a plantation in thailand and he lived out his days there in a simple way he did simple work he knew simple joys john squeezes my hand again and im grateful for his presence the emotions pouring through me now are too intense to bear alone amazement that my secret hope turned out to be true sadness that my father was not himself afterward that perhaps he did not remember me in any meaningful sense but deeper than any of these wells a relief that even tears cannot express my father did not abandon his family he did not choose others over us he did not voluntarily stop loving us though i do not voice it a childs simple cry of joy bursts from my heart my daddy didnt leave me there is no sight quite like gentlemen in the presence of a lady reduced to tears john blushes and reaches for a kleenex he doesnt have while de becque the old world man pulls a silk handkerchief from his trouser pocket take a moment ma cherie he says in a soothing voice family matters always difficult thank you i wipe my eyes and blow my nose and neither man seems to mind much tell me the rest please i anticipate your next question your father lived until seven years past the wound that probably should have killed him he was lucky to have those years seven years my father died during janes sophomore year at ole miss the year i became a photographer at the timespicayune before i can think of what to ask next john speaks monsieur your story began with the daughters not the father with the photographs and a point about christopher wingate de becque looks at me if you are now composed yes please go on you understand the situation wingate had offended me cheated me i then taught him a lesson about the consequences of breaking promises we understand wingate was not content to learn this lesson perhaps he could not afford the loss he sustained in the caribbean in any case he wished to revenge himself upon me and he wished certain people to know he had taken that revenge to this end he set about trying to hurt me as deeply as possible this is not so easy as it might sound i have no family in the ordinary sense no hostages to fortune im a businessman a citizen of the world not a vulnerable man so wingate had to look hard for a weakness i think i know where this is going john says you wish me to continue please i tell him giving john a look that tells him not to interrupt again wingate knew about more than painting he knew photography when he was here he naturally noticed my vietnam photos he encouraged me to tell stories i confess i am fond of doing so especially after a few bottles of wine i know when to keep my mouth shut but some stories seem harmless enough he sighs with regret i always kept pictures of you and your sister for jonathans sake i showed them to him sometimes i had a newer picture of you because you are famous anyway wingate knew your story he knew who your father was and that i cared about you cared about us on one of your fathers better days he asked me to look after you this was near the end of his life you were almost grown then and i didnt know you were in financial difficulty had i known well what are words worth now after jonathans death i learned that you were doing all right but that jane needed money for university i made sure she got it i shake my head in wonder i never knew how she stopped depending on me i thought she had scholarships or something pell grants she did im sure de becque smiles but she also had help from uncle marcel youre telling us wingate chose jane lacour as a victim to hurt you john says unable to contain himself right i believe it happened this way wingate never knew roger wheatons identity but i think he knew where the victims were coming from i believe he had close ties with an associate of wheatons conrad hoffman says john perhaps says the frenchman in any case by this time i too had surmised that the girls in the paintings were being taken in new orleans you told us you had no idea no proof says de becque merely the conjecture of an old man but i was interested enough to watch the new orleans newspapers and keep an ear to the ground through contacts i have there i suspected that if another victim were kidnapped there a new sleeping woman might soon come on the market jane was victim number five john says in a cold voice you suspected all the way back then de becque suddenly looks very serious do you wish to waste time with another useless philosophical debate i assure you a frenchman likes nothing better no i cut in just tell us what you know all right i think it happened this way wingate was casting about for a way to revenge himself upon me one day as he searched his memory he remembered the story id told him of the famous jonathan glass and of the lovely twin girls i watched from a distance the world traveler and the southern belle of st charles avenue my mouth falls open a simple matter of mental association in any case once he hit upon it the mechanics were simple he sent a photograph and an address to wheatons associate made a request possibly promised a bounty and the thing was done john and i sit in stunned silence so says de becque jane lacour nee glass became the only sleeping woman chosen by someone other than wheaton or his associate at least that is my guess its a good guess john says jane lacour died because she knew you how did that make you feel no big deal i suppose de becques lips flatten to a thin line you are near to offending me young man i do not advise it a tight smile now because i was watching new orleans for other disappearances i learned very quickly of janes disappearance i owed my dead friend i could not let this thing pass without taking steps what did you do i ask i sent an emissary to discuss the matter with wingate who did you send asks john a retired military man a friend from my indochina days perhaps youve met the sort of man i mean a persuasive man de becque gives a single firm nod just so he made clear to wingate that the death of jane lacour would mean not only the death of christopher wingate but the death of his line his women children parents stop i plead i dont think i want to know this de becque makes a gesture of apology i merely wished you to be aware that i spared no effort but you didnt do much good did you says john de becque sighs some things once set in motion are difficult to stop wingate understood the stakes and he used all his influence to get wheatons associate to release jane the associate agreed to try he may have tried i tell them recalling what wheaton told me of janes death wheaton said jane tried to escape and almost succeeded hoffman only caught her in the yard and he he ended it there wheaton finished painting jane from a photograph i know that upset you very much john is staring at de becque with open hostility but de becque ignores him the frenchman reaches out and takes my hand prepare yourself cherie i have news for you what your sister lives my hand jerks out of his as though of its own accord what jane glass is alive what the hell is this asks john youre saying hoffman didnt kill her oui considering what jordan just told me i would guess this hoffman released jane then lied to wheaton to protect himself if jane lacour is alive says john where has she been for the past eighteen months thailand de becque shrugs i still have a plantation there youre lying even you wouldnt save your indignation scoffs de becque i found myself in a very difficult position a woman had been kidnapped several women to be exact i knew more than i should about those events in a legal sense normally i would not have interfered but this woman was special i had no choice if this is true you could have solved the case you could have saved i dont care i shout i dont care what he did all i want to know is if hes telling the truth de becque nods i am the phone call i say softly the phone call from thailand that was your sister she was drinking at the time a bit confused she had recently learned the truth about your father and it upset her i want to go to thailand i tell him right now the frenchman stands and claps his hands twice li appears in the far doorway like a brownskinned princess conjured from thin air de becque nods once and she vanishes will you take me i ask i wont believe shes alive until i see her there are other things you must know first oh god i whisper an image of thalia laveau in my mind dont tell me shes brain damaged or no no but she endured a traumatic experience at the hands of this hoffman he was a man of peculiar tastes now i understand my precognition of janes death in sarajevo perhaps she did not physically die perhaps what i felt was the death of innocence that is every rape the murder of part of the spirit she has largely recovered now says de becque but she is fragile in some ways at first she required much care later quite naturally she desired to return home i was unable to allow that for legal reasons as i mentioned but also because i did not wish to stop the painter of the sleeping women i make no apologies to anyone but you but to you i apologize please take me to her you are on your way ma cherie jordan john says in a low voice dont let this guy get your hopes up hes a john comes out of his chair and stands with his mouth open as if struck dumb in the doorway at the far end of the great room stands a mirror image of the woman he claims he loves jane is wearing a white robe like lis and the frenchvietnamese woman stands behind her like an attendant my hands begin to shake my palms go clammy and my bladder feels weak never in my life have i felt such emotions and how could i i have never witnessed a resurrection you son of a bitch john says softly to de becque how long would you have kept her jane is walking toward me her cheeks red her eyes glittering with tears li follows one step behind as though ready to catch her if she falls jane looks more beautiful than she ever did thinner perhaps but with a selfawareness in her face and bearing that wasnt there before de becques voice rises in argument with john but i dont hear their words only blood pounding in my ears when jane is halfway across the room i find the strength to take a step and then to run as i fly to her a fleeting image passes through my mind a tall man with a camera walks down a mississippi road a little girl on either side of him one clings tightly to his hand the other skips ahead her eyes on the horizon that man is gone now but not the little girls it is dusk and the house on st charles avenue looks just as it did the day jane walked out of it in her jogging suit eighteen months ago but the people inside are different the lights glow warm and yellow through the windows hinting to passersby of an idyllic life beyond the wroughtiron rail and polished door but this is a false impression a woman once told me that good homes have hearts this house had a heart once now it has a great emptiness jane and i mount the steps together hand in hand after much discussion we agreed it would be better this way not to call first not to try to explain why put marc or the children through an hour or even a minute of confusion and why let marc see her first when it is undoubtedly the children who miss her most terribly behind us at the curb john waits in the car not my rented mustang but an fbi sedan that let us all be comfortable i look back at him then raise my hand to knock on the door but jane stops me with a touch on my shoulder what is it i ask are you all right shes crying i never thought i would stand here again i cant believe my babies are inside they are i know this because an fbi agent posted on the street outside notified us when marc got home marc is here and the children and annabelle the maid too i take janes hand dont think too much enjoy every second of it youre blessed beyond belief i start to say more but i dont to remind her that eleven other women wont be going back to their homes would only trigger the survivors guilt that i know so well instead i hug her to my side and hold her there here we go i knock loudly on the door and wait after a moment footsteps pad up the cavernous hallway and stop before the door then the knob turns and the great door opens revealing annabelle in her blackandwhite uniform the old black woman starts to greet me then freezes her mouth open her hand flies halfway to her mouth then stops and begins to shake is it its me annabelle jane says in a quavering voice lord jesus come here missy she pulls jane into her arms and squeezes tight mr lacour dont know anything no i thought it would be better if they saw jordan and me together then they would know they could believe it annabelle nods with exaggerated amazement i wouldnt believe it myself if i wasnt seeing it right now jane slowly disengages herself where are the children annabelle in the kitchen waiting for me to fix supper how are they doing the old woman starts to reply but instead shuts her eyes against tears not good but everything gonna be all right now yes lord what you want me to do wheres marc hes in his study lets go in the kitchen annabelle takes jane by the hand and leads her down the hall the long wide corridor throws me back to wheatons killing house just blocks away and i quicken my steps to stay up with them jane looks back and hurries me along with her hand knowing the children need to see us both to understand at the kitchen door we pause and jane whispers something to annabelle the maid nods and goes in ahead of us henrys highpitched voice asks her who was at the door and annabelle answers in a voice laced with excitement you chilren close you eyes now why they ask in unison your aunt jordan brought you a special present aunt jordans here asks lyn the hope in her voice breaking my heart you shut your eyes says annabelle you never gonna get a present like this again in your whole life neither one of you theyre shut cry the little voices aunt jordan as jane takes my hand i feel hers quivering i look into her eyes she nods and we step through the door henry and lyn are standing side by side facing the doorway their hands pressed hard over their eyes aunt jordan asks lyn parting her fingers in an attempt to see you can look now i tell them when the hands slip down the childrens mouths drop and their eyes flick back and forth between jane and me then their eyes flash with a light i havent seen in twenty years of traveling the world the light of those who witness a resurrection mama lyn asks in a hollow voice her eyes on jane jane falls to her knees and holds out her arms and henry and lyn rush to her breast she enfolds them in a shuddering embrace and in seconds her eyes are pouring tears when the children find their voices they begin jabbering questions but jane can only cradle their faces in her hands and shake her head whats going on comes a deep voice from the hall annabelle whats all the racket marc lacour wearing a pretentious seersucker suit looks from me to the back of the woman holding his children his face clouded with confusion he cant see janes face but something about her shape and manner has told him much already she embraces the
