pale demon the ninth book in the rachel morgan series a novel by kim harrison to the guy who knows how i take my tea one brown or green for the drapes rache jenkss voice slid into my dozing state and i opened an eyelid a crack to find him hovering inches from my nose the sun was hot and i didnt want to move even if his wings provided a cold draft too close i cant see i said as i shifted in the webbed lounge chair and he drifted back his dragonflylike wings humming fast enough to spill a redtinted pixy dust over my bare middle june sunbathing and cincinnati normally didnt go together but today was my last day to get a tan before i headed west for my brothers wedding two bundles of fabric were draped over jenkss arms spider silk most likely dyed and woven by one of his daughters his shoulderlength curly blond hairuncut since his wifes deathwas tied back with a bit of twine to show his angular pinched features i thought it odd that a pixy able to fend off an entire team of assassins was worried about the color of his drapes well i hedged not more confident in this than he was the green goes with the floor but id go with the taupe you need some visual warmth down there brown he said looking at it doubtfully i thought you liked the green tile i do i explained thinking that breaking up a pop bottle for floor tile was ingenious but if you make everything the same color youll wind up back in the seventies jenkss wings dropped in pitch and his shoulders slumped im not good at this he whispered becoming melancholy as he remembered matalina tell me which one i cringed inside i wanted to give him a hug but he was only four inches tall small yes but the pixy had saved my life more times than i had spell pots in my kitchen sometimes though i felt as if we were worlds apart taupe i said thanks trailing dull gold dust jenks flew in a downward arc to the kneehigh wall that separated my backyard from the graveyard the highwalled graveyard was mine too or jenkss actually seeing that he owned the deed but i was the one who mowed the lawn heartache took me and the sun seemed a little cooler as i watched jenkss dust trail vanish under the sprouting bluebells and moss and into his new bachelorsize home the last few months had been hard on him as he learned to live without matalina my being able to become small enough to help him through that first difficult day had gone a long way in convincing me that demon magic wasnt bad unless you used it for a dark purpose the breeze cooled the corner of my eye and i smiled even as i dabbed the almost tear away i could smell the newly cut grass and the noise of a nearby mower rose high over the distant hum of cincinnati across the river there was a stack of decorating magazines beside my suntan oil and a glass of melted iced teathe lull before the storm tomorrow would be the beginning of my personal hell and it was going to last the entire week through the annual witches conference what happened after that was anyones guess nervous i shifted the straps of my bikini so there wouldnt be any tan lines showing in my bridesmaids dress already packed and hanging in a garment bag in my closet the witches annual meeting had started yesterday on the other side of the continent i was the last on the docketlike saving the biggest circus act for the end the coven of moral and ethical standards had already shunned me tried to incarcerate me without a trial in alcatraz sent assassins when id escaped and finally accepted a stalemate only when i threatened to go public with the fact that witches had their beginnings in demons and i was the proof the rescindment would become permanent after they replaced the missing member of the council and pardoned me for using black magic at least that was the theory as much as i needed to do this i was soooo not looking forward to it i mean id been accused of being a black witchof doing black magic and consorting with demons both of which i did do whatever that wasnt going to change but if i couldnt pull this off id be hiding out in the everafter for the rest of my life not only did i not particularly like demons but id miss my brothers wedding and hed never let me live it down i looked up squinting into the oak tree as the familiar almost ultrasonic whistle of a pixy cut through the drone of a mower it was no surprise when jenks darted out from behind the kneehigh wall going to meet jumoke one of his kids coming in from sentry duty at the front of the church whats up jenks i called out as i grabbed my sunglasses and the pixies angled toward me still talking black car at the curb jenks said his hand on the hilt of his garden sword its trent my adrenaline pulsed and i almost jabbed the earpiece of my sunglasses into my eye as i put them on hes early i exclaimed sitting up trent and i had an appointment for me to annul his familiar mark but that wasnt until five the curse wasnt ready yet and the kitchen was a mess maybe he wanted to see the prep afraid of what might be in it jumokes wings hit a higher pitch when the front bell rang and we all turned to the back of the church as if we could see through it to where trent was standing on the front porch the bell was one of those big farm bells with a pull and the entire sleepy neighborhood could hear it maybe hell go away if we dont answer i said and jenks rosesixty feet in a mere second in another second he dropped back down hes coming around back he said his gold dust looking black through my sunglasses damn it back to the turn pix the sucker i said then waved my hand in negation when jumoke clearly thought i was serious the small pixy looked about six and he took everything literally jenks flew backward as i twisted yanking on the back of the chair until it slid forward and i could sit more upright maybe this was a lastditch effort to get me to sign that lameass paper of his guaranteeing my safety from the coven but making me trents virtual slave in the process tomorrow id be on the west coast clearing my name and sliding completely out of his clutches either that or he was avoiding ivya distinct possibility he knew shed be here tonight and his spies had probably told him she was out now jenkss wings clattered and i flicked my gaze to his what do you want me to do rache he asked hes almost at the gate my kids are mobbing him my jaw clenched and i forced it to relax i had a nice silk blouse picked out to wear tonight something professional and classy and here i was in a bikini and with a dirty kitchen let him come back i finally said if this is about that paper of his he can suck my toes and die with a nod and a wing chirp for jumoke to accompany him jenks and his son darted to the side of the church and the slate path there i settled back tilting my head so i could see the gate without looking obvious about it trents voicehis beautiful resonant soothing political voiceslipped over me even before he got to the gate and i touched the braid that jenkss kids had put my curly red flyaway hair in this morning i hated that i liked his voice but it was a familiar hatred one that had lost its fire long ago the wooden latch to the tall gate lifted and my heart thumped as i took my sunglasses off eyes half closed i pretended to be sleeping wreathed in pixy kids trent came into my garden his motions both slow and irate clearly he was not liking the noisy winged escort keeping my expression bland i took in his slim form in the months since id last seen him trent had deepened his tan and his babyfine almost translucent hair caught the dappled sun instead of his usual thousanddollar suit he had on a lightweight gray shortsleeved shirt dress slacks and shiny dress shoes it made him look harmless but trent was anything but and what was he doing here alone quen never let him out by himself trent made his way down the fernlaced slate path with the pixies chatting at him his innocent businessman facade hiding his true demeanor as the head of an illegal biodrugs and brimstone distribution why am i helping him again i am helping myself i thought suddenly feeling almost naked if i didnt annul the familiar bond between us before i left for the witches meeting trent would start trying to kill me again and as much as i detested the man i liked him rather more when he wasnt trying to put me in the ground feeling like a big fat hypocrite i closed my eyes entirely listening to trent murmur something to one of jenkss kids as his steps scraped on the broken patio tile my heart beat faster if it had been anyone other than trent someone might think i liked the man in reality i was trying hard not to look like the crazy witch living in a church with a gargoyle in the belfry pixies in the garden and a cat on the fenceeven if i was no way was he getting into my kitchen not with candles all over the place and halfcrushed herbs and magnetic chalk everywhere youll never guess who i found digging through our trash rache jenks said snidely and i stretched shivering as a cold shadow slipped over me i thought we got rid of those raccoons i said opening my eyes to find trent looming over me nothing more than a black silhouette with the sun behind him the scent of cinnamon and wine hit me and i squinted up trent was on edge curious if trent was uncomfortable then maybe i could keep the upper hand even if i was only half dressed that would be a nice switch he was good at putting me on the defensive oh hi trent i said when the man said nothing the half shadows of pixy wings making dappled patterns over both of us their noise almost as loud as their chiming voices what the turn are you doing here already avoiding ivy are we he backed up and the sun blinded mejust as he had planned good afternoon rachel trent said dryly youre looking well thanks i reached for my sunglasses and put them on as he moved to stand next to the chair with my robe draped over it effectively stalling me from taking it its amazing what two months of not being on anyones hit list will do for a person i hesitated realizing his hair was in a more trendy style than usual youre not looking bad yourself for a murdering drug lord at that trents smile became real i think he enjoyed our verbal bantereveryone else was too awed by his bank account to stand up to him i apologize for surprising you like this but i have something i want to discuss with you he glanced up at jenks alone if possible he was avoiding ivy then i mused thinking it was funny jenks snorted his hands going to his hips his fingers just brushed the hilt of his garden sword giving him a mischievous dangerous look like puck with an attitude and penchant for killing amused i beamed at trent pulling up a knee so i didnt feel so exposed actually i am kind of busy right now i drawled as i settled back into the chair and closed my eyes you have to make melanin while the sun shines i opened my eyes smiling at him with bland insincerity but a small ache of warning furrowed my brow hes here alone a soft giggle in the trees drew trents attention up and he made a quick step to the right getting out of the way of one of last years acorns it pinged on the broken slate of the patio bouncing and rolling under my lawn chair as a chorus of disappointment grew excuse me jenks said sourly darting up into the tree there was a noisy complaint quickly hushed and the pixies started to drop down one by one to leave an acorn a stick and even a marble on the table beside my glass of iced tea before they apologized and flew mournfully into the graveyard all under jenkss watchful eye i have four hours to try to get this pasty skin a shade away from deathpallor white for my brothers wedding i said uneasy and trying to ignore the little drama and im not spending it in my kitchen twisting your spell come back at five or you can sit and wait until the sun goes down i dont care is quen in the car hes welcome to come back ive got more iced tea in the fridge or a beer you guys drink beer dont you i dont have a babysitter today trent said as if it was a victory and i cleared my throat i knew how he felt my babysitter was either a fourinch man or an annoying exghost depending on how much trouble i was currently in and which reality i was occupying jenkss youngest daughter jrixibell dipped forward and back twisting the hem of her brown silk dress apparently it had been her acorn under jenkss stern gaze the sweetlooking little girl mumbled a shamefaced sorry and flew to where three of her sisters waited and together they darted into a nearby bush to plot further mischief trent smiled halfturned and shocked the peas out of me when he brushed the nearby chair free of imaginary dust and sat down moving gingerly as if hed never had to trust plastic webbing before staring at him i took off my glasses hes staying sure id offered but i hadnt expected him to take me up on it suddenly i felt twice as exposed and i could do nothing as trent crossed his legs and leaned forward taking the top magazine off the stack doing some redecorating he asked idly uh jenks is i said heart thumping crap on toast i couldnt just lie here and pretend he wasnt there id thought hed get huffy spout some nonsense about his time being more important than mine and leave youre ah going to wait dont you have something else more important to do yes i do actually he said as he turned a page his green eyes darting over the images of tiles and artwork but i want to talk to you alone his eyes lifted from the magazine fixing on jenks now just a fairyfarting minute jenks rose up on a column of indignant silver my brow furrowed trent had come early stinking of cinnamon and wine to talk to me alone soooo not good its okay jenks i said softly but he didnt hear me the day i leave you alone with rachel is the day i wear a dress and dance the polka jenks was saying and i sat up putting my feet to either side of the lounge chair jenks ive got this we are a team jenks shouted his hand on the hilt of his sheathed garden sword you talk to all of us or none of us there were about a dozen pairs of eyes watching from the edges of the garden and graveyard and i heard a rustle of leaves overhead i glanced at trent his lips pressed together for an instant and then his expression eased hiding his irritation jenks i said softly its okay ill tell you what he says trents eyes squinted and i lifted my chin promise immediately jenks calmed down his wings clattering as he landed next to my iced tea in a huff trent got that little worry wrinkle but it was true id tell jenks just about anything and trent needed to know that why dont you get your kids and check out the blackberries at the far end of the graveyard i said and there was another rustle in the tree overhead all of them yeah okay jenks said sullenly he rose up pointing two fingers at himself then at trentthe unmistakable gesture of im watching youbefore he flew off yelling at his kids to clear out and give us some space trent watched them leave from their hidden nooks and hideyholes his tension becoming more obvious as he laced and unlaced his fingers a wind blew across the graveyard smelling of cut grass and warm stone and i shivered well what is it i said leaning back in my chair with my eyes closed pretending indifference you going to tell me what you cant say in front of my partners and your office help or are you just going to sit there ogling my bikini that didnt get the expected chuckle i heard him take a breath and let it out the soft sliding sound of the magazine being replaced made me shiver again your upcoming meeting with the coven he said softly i dont think you realize whats going to happen my eyes opened and i turned to him hed leaned forward to put his elbows on his knees hands laced between them bowed over a worried slant to his brow he looked up as he felt my gaze on him he was worried about the coven the witches annual meeting i said not a problem i can handle it the webbing was cutting into me and i shifted uncomfortably youre begging forgiveness for using black magic he said and my gut tightened at the reminder its a little more than dodging drunk witches at the beach i shifted the strap of my top to hide my unease trent looked scrumptious sitting on that cheap chair even if he was worried tell me something i dont know i grumbled rachel nervousness twisted in me and i grimaced the coven called off their assassins i said but i couldnt look at him sure theyd quit trying to kill me but they could start up again in a demon minute let me live in my dream world a day longer okay trent youre leaving tomorrow for the coast he asked and i rubbed a hand under my nose nodding he knew that id told him last week what about jenks and ivy my gaze slid to jenks standing on the kneehigh wall between the garden and the graveyard true to his word he was keeping his kids corralled he was pissed though his feet spread wide and his hands on his hips his wings were going full tilt into invisibility but his feet stayed nailed to the sunwarmed stone i lifted a shoulder then let it fall trying to look nonchalant ivys staying to watch the firm jenks is coming with me if hes humansize hell be able to handle the pressure shifts i hope suddenly suspicious i turned to trent why he sighed youll never make it even with jenks my heart gave a thump and i forced myself not to move the slight breeze became chilly and goose bumps ran down my arms oh really really he said and i flushed as i saw him notice my gooseflesh which do you think more likely that the coven is going to let you come before them with that story of how they shunned you as part of an elaborate plan to test my security systems or that they will simply make everything go away by killing you en route it was hard to keep my head in the sand when he kept yanking my tail feathers like that im not stupid i said as i grabbed the suntan oil you dont think ive thought about that wheres my choice here they said theyd pardon me if i kept my mouth shut they never said whether or not the pardon would come while you were alive true thats so unfair peeved i flipped the bottle top open and squirted some oil onto my palm you cant afford to be stupid anymore trent said and i frowned smacking the bottle on the table the same qualities that make you an attractive employeeloyalty honesty passion diligencetrustwill get you killed until you realize how few people play by your rules that last one trust had been hard for him to say and i frowned rubbing out the goose bumps under the guise of putting on suntan oil im not naive i grumbled as i found the red marks from the webbing yes i worked with demons studied with them and was one of only two witches capable of invoking their magic but id been good id never hurt anyone who hadnt hurt me first and id always shown more restraint than those whod tried to kill me even the fairies the coven will never let you on a commercial plane and the only way youre going to make it to the coast is if we go together trent said quickly the coven wont dare attempt anything if im with you together i blinked then stared at him this was why hed come in my garden stinking of cinnamon and wine he wanted to go out to the coast together and was afraid id say no are you offering me a ride on your private jet i said incredulous i was almost free of him and the coven both almost my own person again if i got on his plane it could land anywhere you have to trust me he said as if reading my mind but his body language said i shouldnt i settled back uncomfortable and feeling cold yeah like i believe youd help me out of the goodness of your little elf heart dont think so would you believe im trying sugar instead of vinegar he sounded amused and i squinted at him yeah i blurted out id believe that but im not getting on your jet you are a drugrunning taxevading irritatingmurdering man and there hasnt been a month in the last two years that ive not worried about your trying to off me irritating trent leaned back against my robe seeming to like being irritating his fingers laced and his ankle on one knee the position would have made me look unsure but on him it was confident the scent of coconut oil mixed with cinnamon and he dropped his eyes silent i waited the truth of the matter is id rather have you alive and free of the coven than dead trent said softly glancing up as a torn leaf drifted down if you leave for the coast without me you wont make it i still harbor the hope that youll someday work with me ms morgan we were back on familiar ground work with me was better than work for me but how many times did i have to say no noyoure lying i said waving my glasses at him when he began to protest green eyes looking innocently at me from under his wispy blond hair you walked in here all strung out about asking me to go with you to the coast not the other way around you want my trust try buying it with the truth until then weve got nothing to talk about byebye trent see you at five dont let the graveyard door hit you on the way out i jammed the glasses back on my face and reclined in a huff ignoring him as he shuffled his feet for a moment i thought he was going to stick to his lame claim of citypower benevolence but then he whispered i need to get to the west coast i have to have an escort and quen wont leave ceri shes three weeks from her due date ceri my jaw clenched my eyes opening as i looked into the ambertinted world i sat up eying trent to see if he was lying there was a hint of compassion there but most of his expression was peeved probably because ceri liked his security officer instead of him quen wont allow me to leave cincinnati unless you come with me trent said clearly bothered he says youre raw but enthusiastic i laughed i couldnt help it okay i said swinging my legs to the broken patio again i think ive got it now you say you want to join forces to help mepoor little mebut its only because quen wont let you go by yourself how come you planning on speaking out against me if i dont sign your lameass paper i knew there was a reason i liked quen will you forget about that contract he said starting to look cross it was a mistake to try to bully you and im sorry my need to get to the coast is a private matter youre simply a means to get me there an escort he was sorry i thought shocked by the admission from the wall jenks flew up in a burst of orange clearly hed heard it too please trent said scooting to the edge of his chair rachel i need your help from the gate came the faint familiar sound of a metallic click and a puff of air behind trent a little blue ball at chest height flew right where he would have been had he not leaned forward it hit the tree exploding in a familiar splat of sound as a piercing whistle echoed through the garden trent stared at me then the wet mark his eyes wide shit we are under attack two trent rose to his feet stupidly staring at the tree and the foaming yellow mass of magic get down i shouted as i yanked him off balance he started to fall and still sitting i pulled him toward me bracing myself and levering his weight over me and to the patio on my far side he hit the hard pavers with a gasp eyes wide and hair askew i was already reaching a quick thought out to the ley line in the backyard power flowed in familiar but painful in my rush and before trent had tossed the hair from his eyes the word rhombus whispered through my mind in an instant i relived the fiveminute process to make a protection circle the semiinvisible barrier sprang up around us me at its center as in all undrawn circles trent sat up his head even with my shoulder stay down i hissed and we both jerked as two more splats hit my circle their magic making little dimples of color on my blackandgold aura beyond it the pixies were moving in the graveyard and i cursed my stupidity id told jenks to keep his kids centralized effectively shutting down our first line of defense jenks i shouted as i stood my circle inches from the top of my head and reached for my robe jamming my arms into the sleeves jenks was gone but his golddust trail still glittered showing that he had flown straight up getting the sitch a shrill pixy chirp drew my attention to the front gate my eyes met the wouldbe assassins and the attacker ducked there i shouted and more pixies arrowed toward the attacker frowning i fumed as i tied my robe get in the church i all but growled at trent put yourself in a circle rachel i turned angry as i took in his tightly pressed lips and angry green eyes as he managed to be ticked that id pulled him to safety even as the attacker fled they were aiming at you not me i said get in the church not waiting to see if he did as id told him i ran for the gate gasping as i broke my circle and took the energy into myself my bare feet were almost silent on the slate path and my jaw clenched my splat gun would have been handy right about now but al had melted it two months ago and no one would sell me a replacement heart pounding i shoved on the worn rough wood of the gate adrenaline sending it crashing into the bushes ms morgan look out shrilled a pixy and i jerked back at the puff of air crap i exclaimed as i fell against the fence and the gate smacked back into the door frame looking the way id come i saw there was a new splat on the ground between me and the empty lounge chair miracle of miraclestrent had actually listened to me and gone inside the slightly itchy feeling in the back of my mind might have been him setting a circle or it might have been the assassin setting up a trap a darkhaired pixy landed on the fence his hands in fists as they rested on his hips hes running now ms morgan jumoke said and i gave him a quick grateful smile i smacked the gate open again and ran through it jumoke flying just over my head a passel of pixies trailed behind shouting encouragement the man whod shot at me was indeed running and a wicked grin spread across my face he was fast i was faster and i raced after his slim dark form as he headed for the street my fingertips grazed the mans shirt as we reached the sidewalk and heart pounding i fell on him he had time for one yelp of surprise and i clenched my eyes against the coming cement we hit with a jar that knocked my breath away and i scrambled for a new grip sunglasses falling off you tap a lineand you wontwake upuntil next week i panted when i caught my breath oh god my elbow was vibrating all the way up to my skull but hed taken most of the impact scrambling i put my knee in the small of his back and twisted his arm around his own neck ready to snap his wrist if he moved the pixies were everywhere talking so fast i couldnt understand them but i caught the words intruder and papa just where was jenks anyway the man wasnt moving and after some vigorous encouragement he let go of his splat gun and the pixies worked as a team to drag it out of his reach it looked like mine right down to the cherry red color and the blue splat balls they were almost my trademark you trying to frame me for assaulting trent i exclaimed and he only grunted what you got in your splat balls jack maybe we should find out together real personal like breathing hard the man tried to look at me the anger obvious in his green eyes green eyes blond hair lanky build tan was he an elf an elven assassin not a very good one though and where the hell was jenks the sound of running feet pulled my head up there was a second man and i could do nothing damn it he was getting away are you after trent or me i shouted at the guy under me and furious i thunked his forehead into the cement the mans eyes showed his pain why do you even care huh there was a squeal of ultrasonic sound and jenkss kids dropped back to make room for their dad two of them jenks exclaimed dropping silver sparkles and a zip strip from my charm cupboard to hit the mans back trents in the kitchen you want me to get her her i slipped the zip strip around the mans wrist and ratcheted it tight immediately feeling better jack didnt move as his maybecontact with a ley line was severed telling me he hadnt been prepared to use one to begin with but better safe than sorry i was spared the decision of what to do by the sound of ivys cycle at the far end of the street jenks darted away with a second zip strip leaving his kids to sweetly tell me what i ought to do to the man under me he moved when the subject of wasps entered the conversation and i yanked on his arm ivys bike slowed as jenkss dust glittered over her then she gunned it roaring past me and aiming for the woman fleeing over the lawns ivy was a tad more protective of me than jenks and with a silent fury she ran the woman down using her foot like a jousting pole wincing i watched the woman take a mouthful of grass as she slid to a frontface halt jenkss children left me and the woman slowly sat up her hands in fists over her head as they surrounded her bright sparkling spots of potential death in the sunshine kids jenkss voice was shrill weve talked about this lunkers are a nokill species how come you never listen to me like you listened to your mom it looked like it might be over get up i said breathing hard as i eased up on my grip the man spun under me foot and fist lashing out jerking up and away i stood grabbing for his foot it smacked into me with a bonejarring thump but i caught it determined green eyes met mine and when i went to snap his ankle he sideswiped me with the other foot i gasped and went with it trying to keep my presence of mind as i fell on the concrete walk trying to turn it into something graceful there was a sickening crunch under me my glasses damn it id let go though and when i again found my feet he had stood and was coming at me with a knife rachel quit playing with him ivy said loudly her cycle idling back to us the zipstripped woman meekly walking before her with an escort of exuberant pixies holding swords hes got a knife i exclaimed teeth clenched as i did an x block then dove under his arm to make him twist his own knife into his side and there i stopped breathing hard as i pressed the blade still in his grip into him but not yet breaking the skin he didnt move knowing it was right over his kidney jeez louise the curtains of the house across the street were moving we had to take this inside before someone called inderland security the last thing i needed was the is out here youve lost jack i shouted as i pinched his wrist until he let go of the knife then wrenched his arm up and pressed him into the nearby light pole we got jill i said as he grunted and no way are you getting that bucket of water in my garden if you dont relax im going to bust your crown we clear the guy nodded but i didnt ease up spitting my hair out of my mouth i realized that ivy had parked her cycle and was coming up the walk with the woman the female assassins hands were in fists high over her head jenkss kids were working together to shift the knife to the sidelines slowly i started to smile wed gotten them hot damn hi ivy i said as she scuffed her booted feet to a halt get the errands done the slightly asianlooking woman quirked her lips at my robe smiling as she held up her pharmacy bag the unmistakable shadow of a second splat gun and several knives showed through the thin plastic her lips were closed to hide her small sharp canines but her mood was good you want to take this inside or bag them up and leave them here for bigtrash pickup she asked her black eyes going to the deceptively empty street her pupils were fully dilated despite the bright sun evidence that she was working to maintain control of her instincts being in the sun would help so would the wind now carrying away the scent of sweat and fear inside i panted i was out of breath but ivy wasnt she was six feet of lean athletic living vampire dressed in blue jeans boots and a tight black tshirt it would take more than running down a fleeing assassin on her bike to make her break into a sweat you going to be good jack i asked the man pressed against the light pole and when he nodded i let up he grimaced as ivy patted him down adding another knife and more blue splat pellets in a clear crushproof plastic vial to her bag i held my hand out for the splat balls and i refilled his hopper fast enough to make jacks eyes widen in appreciation clicking the magazine away i hefted the splat gun thinking it felt good in my hand this is my house i said as i indicated the church if you do something i dont like youre going to get whatevers in the hopper and the law will be on my side clear they didnt nod but they didnt spout threats either move i said and with an obedience that told me the potions were nasty the two of them started up the cement stairs and toward the double wooden doors slowly i began to relax ivy looked at the gun her brow furrowed it looks like yours she said you noticed that too eying the attackers i pulled one side of the door open jenkss kids entered the church firstthree of them carrying my broken sunglassesthen the bad guys then us are you okay i asked ivy she smiled to show her fangs small until she died and became a true undead and i stifled a shiver ivy was great at maintaining a grip on her instincts but fight flight or food brought out the worst in her and this was all three not a problem she said as the dark foyer took us one of these days we were going to invest in a new light fixture but the sanctuary beyond it was a bright wash of light the sun coming in the tall stainedglass windows to make colored patterns on the new set of living room furniture my unused desk ivys exercise mats and kistens burned pool table i still hadnt had it refelted my bare feet squeaked over the old oak and i shoved jack toward the small hallway at the back of the sanctuary trent is here already ivy asked clearly having smelled him hes still alive right i nodded wiping the grit from the sidewalk off my feet good lord i had tagged an assassin in my bare feet and a bikini if this showed up on the internet i was going to be peeved last i knew he was i told him to go into the kitchen and wait assassins usually traveled in threes but these were elven i didnt know their traditions hes in there jenks said derisively as he dropped down to us i dont think theyre real assassins they didnt know any leyline magic you dont need magic to be deadly jenks you of all people should know that jenks snorted i dont think they know any they stink like elves but theyve got so much human in them they might not have any magic i shrugged guessing as much by the almost indifference jenkss kids had shown the two attackers the man in front of us glanced back as we entered the dark hallway and i smiled mockingly all the way to the end i directed as we passed the his and her bathrooms and twin bedrooms and headed to the huge industrialsize kitchen i cleared my throat in warning as jack and jill whispered between themselves and they shut up the pixies were singing about blood and daisies as we entered the sunlit kitchen to find trent safe within a circle of his own making between the cluttered center counter and the sink full of dirty spell pots the bright cheerful gold of his circle was free of any demon smut making me uncomfortable hed just been under my aura and had seen the mess id made of it demon smut ugly black permanentmostly the kitchen was hands down my favorite room in the entire church with its expansive stainlesssteel countertops fluorescent lighting and center island counter with my spelling equipment hanging above it and in the open cabinets below it there were two stoves so i didnt have to stir spells and cook on the same surface my moms new fridge took up a wall bis perched atop it was asleep next to the skullshaped cookie jar the little gargoyle had probably been trying to stay awake after sunup and misjudged hed be down until sunset no matter how noisy we were and it was getting noisy pixies were flitting in and out through the one small window over the sink ivys computer was set up on the big farmkitchen table against the inside wall but the space felt like mine that trent had been in here alone sort of bothered me jenkss kids were flitting everywhere too excited to perch in one place and they were starting to give me a headache trent too looked like he was hurting look ivy elf under glass jenks said and i sighed even as a small twinge on my awareness went through me and trent dropped his circle like one entity jenkss kids swarmed trent he stiffened but did little other than grimace when jrixibell asked if she could make a dandelion necklace for him yeah jack and jill might be elves but they werent fullblooded like trent the pixies were almost ignoring them jenks i prompted my own head splitting from their noise as i glanced at bis how the catsize grayskinned kid could sleep through this was a wonder but he was his leathery wings lying close to his back his blackfringed ears drooping and his lionlike tail wrapped around his clawed feet in slumber jenks clattered his wings for their attention okay you lot he shouted jumoke jack jixy jhan can stay if youre quiet the rest of you hit the garden evens take cleanup odds on perimeter not a butterfly crosses the lines without someone knowing and watch the splatball marks stay back until we have a chance to get out there with salt water and no dropping moths into the puddles to see what the charms do clear in a chorus of affirmation and disappointment they dispersed the eldest children jenks had asked to remain retreating to the overhead rack i exhaled in relief and realizing that i was standing like jenks with my bare feet spaced wide and my hands on my hips i dropped my arms sit i said to the wouldbe assassins pointing at the floor beside the fridge and they gingerly lowered themselves with a languorous stretch ivy shoved the magazines off her chair with a booted foot they hit the floor with a thump and slid into a long pile against the wall deceptively calm and relaxed she drifted back to the doorway standing to look aggressive as she took her hair out of its ponytail and let the strands fall where they might unless the assassins went through the window they were stuck a breath of selfpreservation made me toss a roll of paper towels to the woman not only was her chin bleeding but the mans forehead was scraped where id thunked him into the sidewalk ivy would appreciate it if nothing else the harsh ripping of the paper sounded loud and folding up a sheet jill dabbed at her jaw and passed the roll to jack move and ill be on you like a demon ivy said do please jack and jill looked at each other together they shook their heads i kept one eye on them as i unloaded ivys bag next to my broken sunglasses setting the two splat guns and five knives on the counter looking right at home among my magnetic chalk and scrying mirror the knives had an elaborate intricately raised design on the handles to help with the grip i didnt like that one of the guns looked like mine i wondered what was in them that first shot had been aimed at trent making me wonder about his story of quen not letting him leave cincinnati without me he couldve gotten himself on someones hit list but these guys werent good enough to be taken seriously and why would elves want me dead no i was betting they were here for trent did they tell you who sent them trent prompted and i tightened my robe again not yet turning to them i smiled who wants to go first no one said anything big surprise i flicked a glance at trent it was a nowin situation if i was tough hed think i was a thug if i was too nice id be a pushover why i even cared what he thought was beyond me jenks dropped down to the man who sent you he barked sword angled at the mans eye jack remained silent and jenkss wings began slipping an eerie black dust in a whisper of sound jenks darted close and then away the intruding elf yelped his hand smacking his head where jenks had been i frowned when i saw the wad of hair in jenkss grip i didnt like this jenks was usually easygoing more inclined to plant seeds in the ground than people but his land had been violated and that brought out the worst in him ease up jenks ivy said as she came forward to touch jills face you need more finesse with the big ones she made a little trill of sound as the woman drew back in fear and i sighed as ivy started to vamp out think rachel i mused silently dont just react think guys i said conscious of trent watching we need to find out whats going on without leaving any traces i wont leave a mark ivy whispered and jill paled not where you can find one they might be a test from the coven i said and ivys finger tracing the womans jawline curled under and she straightened in disappointment we cant simply let them go ivy said even if it wasnt much of an attack i winced maybe we should call the is jenks snorted and from the overhead rack came a peal of highpitched laughter yeah bad idea mind if i hurry this along i have an idea it had been trent and as one we all turned to look at him you have an idea jenks said sarcastically hovering before him in his best peter pan pose his hands on his hips and his red bandanna tucked into his waistband the day you have a good idea will be the day i eat fairy toe jam he said it was an idea he never said it was a good one i scoffed but my lips parted at the sudden prickling of magic like a blanket rubbing the wrong way wild elven magic scraped across my aura both an irritant and an enticement pulling at my pores as if trying to draw my soul from my body hey i shouted knowing it was trent elves were the only species that dared to use wild magic even demons shunned the art it had a horrible unpredictability along with the horrible power it couldnt be the two elves on the floor they had zip strips on trent no i did not have a clue as to what he was doing and with a satisfied glint in his eyes he clapped his hands volo te hoc facere he exclaimed the sound pinging through me making me both cower and jump as the force i felt him drawing from the line abruptly fell to nothing i will you to do this i thought clutching my robe around me an enthrallment spell but i think it was and i stood at the table and stared at trent aghast the rims of his ears were red and his jaw was clenched in determination that was a black spell i whispered stepping forward and out of ivys reach that was a black spell i yelled and he retreated to the table his eyes falling from jack and jill they were motionless almost slackjawed eyes unfocused and hands limp unable to do anything apart from the most basic things to survive unless told you enthralled them didnt you i exclaimed and he bowed his head when it came back up his eyes met mine with a fervent gleam unrepentant what did he do to them ivy said sidling up next to me jenks wasnt happy either buzzing over them as they blinked vacantly he enthralled them i said sure of it when trents lips pursed and its black damn it i hadnt known he could do something that sophisticated it changed everything black jenks yelped darting up in a wash of yellow dust go ahead ask them who sent them trent said standing stiffly as he gestured to them i know who did but you wouldnt believe me if i told you not in time anyway go on it doesnt last long well that was one bit of good news and then what i said harshly do you know how illegal those are this is my kitchen and im the one whos going to be blamed for this or is that your idea i said with a sneer and ivy caught my arm thinking i was going to cross the room and smack him you need to hurry up he said tossing his hair back in a rare show of nervousness i have this under control ill hit them with another charm so they dont remember i shoved ivys hand from me shaking as i stood there is that your plan make them forget god trent this is like six times illegal trent tugged his sleeves down as if unbothered but his eyes were squinting true but no one gets hurt this way and id think youd be the last person worrying about whats legal youve got thirty seconds tick tock rachel as i stood there fuming jack started to blink ivy took my arm again this time in encouragement but i couldnt do it it was wrong oh for tinks little red shoes jenks said suddenly and he darted down to hover before the man who paid you to attack rachel he barked his hand on his sword hilt no one jack said and i turned to trent my brow furrowed jenkss dust turned green you mean you dont know or you werent paid for it trent shifted his weight to his other foot they werent attacking rachel they were attacking me try again giving me an apologetic shrug ivy slipped past me and crouched before jill lifting her chin to force her to look at her who told you to attack trent she asked calmly and i crossed my arms over my chest i wanted to know but id rather scare it out of them than use black magic walter withon they said together and a knot tightened in my gut this was a warning trent said with a sigh his shoulder easing to make him look somewhat embarrassed no guarded ellasbeths dad i dropped back a step my anger fizzling crap on toast ellasbeth was the woman trent had been going to marryuntil id arrested trent at his own wedding it was something trent thanked me for later in a weird bit of honesty when we thought we were both going to die yeah the withons had the means for a hit and they might be a little mad but enough to take potshots at him now will you help me trent said and i took a breath snapping myself out of my funk seeing my eyes on his trent smiled wickedly hands moving in a leyline charm trent wait i said but it was too late and i could do nothing when i felt the line he was connected to give a lurch and he whispered memoria cadere again i jerked back setting up a protection circle around myself since i didnt know what the man was capable of anymore seeing its creation ivy flung herself almost under the table and jenks darted to the ceiling i stood tall heart pounding as a wash of my goldtinted aura lapped over the circle with all the subtleties of a shadowy pearlescence bis on the fridge stirred his bright red eye cracking open to find me before it slid shut again with a little sigh damn it trent i exclaimed furious as the assassins sat wideeyed and stared at me bewildered but clearly no longer enthralled what in hell are you doing youre kidding he said in disbelief you werent going to ask them anything worried it might be illeeeegal he drawled it mocking me and i squinted at him fear of the withons mixing with the worry of what the assassins could have told us before but now couldnt you did that on purpose i shouted his head bowed slightly and his lips quirked as he eyed me looking both mischievous and polished i told you i was going to anger grew in me but i stayed where i was beside the table sullen it couldnt be undone not easily anyway dr anders teach you that i muttered memory charms werent black they were simply illegal as all hell it didnt make me feel any better though on the floor the woman felt her chin shocked when her fingertips came back wet with blood um whoa she said looking tense but harmless i guess that explains why i have no idea who you people are or how i got here her companion nudged her to be quiet clearly not remembering anything either but knowing enough to keep his mouth shut bad this was so bad two illegal charms and if trent got to the west coast hed probably try to pin them on me if i didnt become his indentured servant damn it back to the turn i wasnt going to play this game jenks dropped from where hed been checking on his kids his hand was on the butt of his sword and he looked ready to give trent a lobotomy i had more to ask them even if she didnt you wanted to know who sent them now you do it was wearing off trent insisted but i could see a hint of unease in him our only other option was to kill them our i barked sarcastically there is no our this is your doing not mine i spun as jill started to get up her alarm obvious park it jill i said but it wasnt until ivy cleared her throat that both of them checked their upward motion and slid back down my name isnt jill the woman started it is today so sit down and shut up until i tell you that you can leave got it shit the man said sourly as he thumped his head back against the fridge and eyed me in mistrust i dont know who was supposed to pay us do you jill shook her head she looked too confused for it to be an act awww man the guy added i dont even know where i left my stuff this sucks see trent said confidently but that worry wrinkle above his eyes was still there it worked now we can let them go and be on our way with their employers still thinking we are here he smiled and i hated him they wont be expected to check in for twentyfour hours we could be long gone by sunset jenkss wings hummed and ivys face lost its expression sunset she said and i grimaced she wasnt going to like this but it didnt matter i wasnt helping trent not after this he had stood in my kitchen and performed two illegal charms one of them black ceri was rubbing off on him and not in a good way im not going anywhere with you you little shoemaker i said trying to figure out what to do with these two especially after that little stunt not in a plane not in a car not on a trainyouve gone too far i blinked what the hell ah rachel ivy touched me and i jumped whats this about trent needing your help help for what jenks hummed his wings for her attention smirking at trent as he said trent wants rachels help quen wont do it trent says its because quen wont leave ceri but i think the little cookie maker plans to speak out against rachel at the uh big meeting to get her under his thumb again and quen refuses to be a part of it trent wont have anything on her after she nullifies his familiar mark so he has to move fast jenks smiled at trent and trent sighed its not like that at all he said but his confidence was wearing thin ivy glanced quickly at me before turning back to jenks not going to happen shrugging jenks landed on the center counter where he could watch everyone or trents telling the truth and hes afraid of the weenie assassins here jack scowled and jill made a little huff of sound but i was glad jenks hadnt dropped any names theyd forgotten who had sent them and didnt need any reminders trent frowned one hand behind his back as he turned to me shoulders stiff he asked will you do it i could not believe this and i pointed at the two assassins sitting in front of my fridge no i said firmly im not helping you especially now trent shifted his confident poise lost when his hand slipped from behind his back they tried to kill me he said his brow furrowed as he glared at them you saw them yeah i spouted off they werent very good at it jenks was laughing but i was mad and ready to throw trent out throw them all out standing by the table i dropped my forehead into my hands and rubbed at my temples from the floor jack sighed my old lady is going to be pissed her i remember i pulled my head up get out i said bluntly get up and get out both of you for a moment jack and jill stared at me but when jenks clattered his wings threateningly they slowly got to their feet okay i knew whod sent them and it only solidified in my mind that i wasnt leaving cincinnati on trents private jet he was still lying to me son of a bastard i dont feel so good the woman said as she held her stomach and limped forward jenks laughed bitterly thats because we beat you up you cried like a baby the two people shuffled toward the door feeling body parts as they began to complain jill looked at the weapons on the counter but when i shook my head they filed out under a pixy escort ivy seemed surprised that i was simply letting them go but i had to be on a plane tomorrow at eight i didnt have time for an extended smackdown jenks youd better tell your kids to leave them alone unless they come back i murmured and he flew up on a column of silver dust yeahhhhh he drawled his focus vacant as he imagined it ill be right back he was gone in an instant and from the front of the church i could hear him shrill something and then the door opening and closing i turned to look at my kitchen defiled by elven black magic it wouldnt leave a visible mark but it left me uneasy just the same al might be able to smell it you too trent i said listlessly picking up the roll of paper towels and trying to wipe the pixy footprints off the stainless steel trents curse lay assembled on the counter but he could just suck my toes and die for all i cared im not leaving until you untwist the curse he said stiffly its all there do it now i hesitated in my motions to clean the counter ivy cleared her throat and i felt more than saw her take up a stance still not looking up i continued to clean the counter picking up the scrying mirror and setting it down then the magnetic chalk the five candles the stick of redwood he could go to hell goodbye trent i muttered my head starting to hurt excuse me his voice was harsh and i balled up the paper towel standing with my fists on the counter so i wouldnt jump over it and strangle him i dont trust you i said softly my knuckles going white from the pressure if i take that curse off now you wont want me for anything and will speak out against me at the covens meeting youre going to have to wait ill do it after not a moment sooner from the street came a faint is that our car trent grimaced when his car alarm began beeping and he looked ready to murder someone as he fished a key fob out of his pocket and pointed it at the street the alarm cut off and he turned back to me that wasnt the deal he said take the mark off now neither was your coming over here trailing assassins i said letting go of the balledup paper towel behind him ivy went to her stash of chocolate on the counter opening a box and leaning against the counter she was behind trent between him and the door and he shifted to keep us both in his sight rachel he warned looking pissed ill do it i said flippantly but youre going to wait until im safe you dont like it i said voice rising then kill me right now go on i shouted do it here i am i flung my arms wide to make a bigger target but if you do youll never get the mark off you you slimy little thug jenks buzzed in with worried wing chatter seeing me screaming at trent and trent looking like hed swallowed a bug the pixy exchanged a look with ivy who was now leaning idly against the counter completely unworried as she ate a chocolatecovered orange slice her apparent indifference seemed to make trent only more pissed trent took a breath and held it saying nothing he turned to the door his stance stiff jenks snickered and the man spun back around even with ivy there his face was white with anger and his eyes almost seemed to glow you are the mostunprofessional irritating frustrating person i have ever had to deal with he said and i shrugged i dont need your help ill get to california without you like i care i said and he turned on his heel and strode from the kitchen good riddance i said then in a wash of selfpreservation i followed him to the hallway leaning out into it as i shouted after him go on leave ill get that mark of yours taken care of but not until i get my freedom you sonofabitch elf he never slowed his dark silhouette flashing into a blinding whiteness when he found the sanctuary more light poured in when he opened the churchs door it boomed shut behind him and i pulled myself back into the kitchen ivy was still slumped at the counter her eyes were hooded and she lookedrather sexy from the anger trent and i had been giving off grimacing i stalked across the kitchen to the window shoving it high to let in the breeze birdsong drifted in and my hair tickled my neck from the fridge bis sighed his wings shifting as he settled back to sleep i hadnt realized id woken him up peeved i stared out at the bright afternoon seeing the dark spot of the spell on a tree id have to take care of that before the pixies got into it even with jenkss admonishment beside me ivy casually took another piece of chocolate succinctly biting through it with a snap of chocolate and sugar crystals jenks hummed closer landing next to the brandy snifter on the windowsill it was turned upside down to keep his cat rex from eating the chrysalis al had given me last new years eve jenkss wings were unmoving and his expression worried as he looked at me not the garden what i said as i edged toward ivy leaning close to take a chocolate and then retreating i looked down seeing the dirt and grass clippings on my feet my robe had come undone and i tightened it back up so much for getting a tan ivy licked her lips and stood upright do you think calling his bluff was the smartest thing to do i exhaled shaking as i leaned against the center counter no i admitted sourly no it wasnt but im not going to give him what he wants until i know hes not going to give me to the coven i bit into the chocolate feeling the sudden give and the crunch of crystallized orange on my tongue from the front of the church trents car engine was racing harshly its the first smart thing shes done jenks said making the short flight to the chocolate and using his sword to cut off a slice the size of his hand maybe but something isnt right ivy said clearly not convinced and i followed her gaze as she took in the assembled ingredients for trents curse next to the assassins splat guns and knives and my broken sunglasses an unsettled feeling tightened around my chest and i fidgeted i was glad id said what i had and i wasnt going to escort trent to the west coast but if truth be told i agreed with ivy something wasnt right and i didnt think it was over yet three hollows international wasnt a huge airport but it was busy with earlymorning flights even at the ungodly hour of seven in the morning it was way too early for me to be up and i felt numb the lukewarm cup of blah coffee almost slipping from my grip our flight was boarding in half an hour we had lots of time the air smelled like floor polish and plastic and i sat in the fake leather chairs across from the checkin counter and peoplewatched as ivy bought a ticket and checked our luggage after the incident with trent she had gotten leave from her master vampire to come with jenks and me trents prediction that i wouldnt be allowed on the plane had convinced me that the less i interacted with the gods and goddesses of air travel in their polyester blazers and winged lapel pins the better so i sat waiting our carryons strewn around me nervous i pushed myself to the back of the chair and slouched jenks though wasnt fooled by my show of nonchalance trents an ass but hes right were not getting through security he predicted making his wings hum for some extra heat it was chilly this morning and all the warmth was escaping through the big plateglass windows and the endless opening of the doors i didnt look at him watching ivys slowly moving line trents just trying to scare me i said but when i realized i was spinning my wooden pinkie ring around and around on my finger i stopped i didnt need it to hide my freckles anymore but if i didnt wear it my brother robbie would ask where my freckles had gone what if we couldnt get on the plane i had to be there in three days or my shunning would become permanent is it working jenks landed on my knee where he could lecture me better he was wearing his garden best convinced that he wasnt even going to have to use the potion in my bag to go big to handle the airpressure shifts he hadnt even arranged for anyone to watch his kids thinking wed be back in an hour his confidence in me was breathtaking i cocked my eyebrows and he put his hands on his hips finally starting to dust a little as he warmed up rache even if trent is telling the truth and the withons are gunning for him that doesnt change that you being dead would make the covens life a lot easier you are not getting through security he said glancing nervously at a little girl in pink who had noticed him we should be thinking about how were going to get you two thousand miles in three days not chilling at the airport i already have my ticket i said sourly noticing that ivy had reached the front of the line how are they going to stop me rache he coaxed and i shifted my shoulders acknowledging that he had a point look i said slouching even lower if they dont let me on the plane well take the train be there in no time his sigh was tiny but i heard it despite the loudspeaker paging someone silence grew between us and i took in his pulledback hair and his sharp blackandgreen outfit with bluebells on the hem it was the last outfit that matalina had made for him and i knew he wore it to feel close to her it had been a very hard two months even if he now knew for sure that his biological clock had been reset and he had another twenty years ahead of him i too had my first twentysix years back and i figured this was why demons lived so long by next spring jenks would be the worlds oldest pixy i didnt care that it had taken a curse to do itas long as he was happy he was happy wasnt he worry filled me as i watched him watch everyone else his attention mainly on the cameras in the corners how you doing jenks i asked the tone of my voice telling him i wasnt asking about the temperature he turned his sharply angular face showing a neutral nothing until i added dont lie to me jenks looked away as the sun started to stain the sky fine he said flatly fine i knew what fine was i had been fine for the better part of a year after kisten died since then id dated marshal had gotten shunned and had sex with a nineteenthcentury ghost named gordian pierce whod been bricked into the ground alive in by the same group currently trying to give me a lobotomy and steal my ovaries much as i hated to admit it pierce was everything i liked wrapped up in a package that might be able to stay alive through the crap my life dished out he was als familiar and i saw him every week when doing my stint as a demon student in the everafter wed not had a moment alone together since hed helped me get a temporary reprieve on my shunning and it was aggravating even if i didnt quite know what to think of pierce anymore hed seen me through one of the most terrifying moments of my life and we had opened up to each other in ways that left me wondering why i was still hesitant he was a good man but the same things that had once attracted mepower tragic history and a sexy bodynow left me with a mild sense of unease ivy would say i was getting smarter but i just feltempty twisting i felt my back pocket for my phone wondering what time it was seven thirtytwo jenks said knowing me better than i did myself thanks sighing i tucked the phone away jenks didnt like pierce agreeing with al that the charismatic witch would be the death of me but pierce wouldnt hurt me he loved me the hard part was i thought i might love him too someday i just didnt know and al wasnt letting me figure it out it worried me that pierce was a little too free with the black magic even if it had been to help me i was trying to prove that black magic didnt make you badbut still i hesitated whereas a year ago id have been head over heels and damn al back to the turn for getting in the way here she comes jenks said in warning and i looked up sure enough ivy was making her way toward us our two bags left behind on the conveyor belt and a blueandgold envelope in her hand she was wearing an unfamiliar black business suit to make her look both sexy and capable a mix of brains and body able to get anything done in the boardroom id never be able to carry off that look but for ivy it was easy see i said as i sat up she got her ticket okay jenks whistled softly as she maneuvered gracefully through the throng ignoring the stares behind her the woman needs her own theme music he said dryly i stood and he took to the air cake short skirt long jacket thatd do it he said as ivy picked up her briefcase with her laptop in it so far so good she said glancing at the nearby security line jenks wasnt impressed yeah they just confiscated your luggage rache good job jenks i complained then turned to ivy what gate all my ticket has is the flight number doesnt matter jenks said bluntly were not getting through security a ivy said not looking at her ticket ignoring jenks humming a dirge i grabbed my garment bag with my bridesmaids dress in it it had been easier than i had thought possible to coordinate cindys bridal shop with the one id worked with in downtown cincinnati making sure my hem length would match everyone elses and for once i liked this dress steel bluegray with no lace id give robbies fiancée one thingshe had great taste next stop portland i said as i threw away my coffee and fell into step beside ivy boots clunking we crossed the white tile jenks was an irritating hum at my ear woohoo i havent seen anyone strip searched all week we got closer to the short line where the spell and metal detectors were and ivy began dropping back what i said irate and she shrugged you first exasperated i got in line behind an old couple crabbing about the wait why are you making so much out of this i asked if they were going to do something they would have done it by now they probably dont even know im here robbie bought the tickets not me but a sick feeling was slipping between my thought and reason as i noticed the two security cops eying me from the other side of the gate ahead of me the old couple tottered through both the metal and the charm detection the charm detection glowed a bright red but the security people waved them on in the distance a plane roared into the air i started to sweat jenkss wings hummed and i muttered this wont be a big deal lets just get through this as fast as possible okay his doubtful expression saying it all jenks darted through the detector and swung back around to land on it waiting with a feeling of foreboding i dropped the garment bag on the belt and smiled at the severely emotionally deficient woman across from me she was about twenty pounds too heavy for her uniform and didnt look happy any produce or high magic to proclaim she asked dully my heart started to pound cool it rachel i thought knowing they had charms to detect stress no fruit but for the pixy there i quipped pointing at jenks only to have him flip me off but i do have a lethalmagic detection earthmagic amulet and a highmagic detection leyline charm on my bag here if i didnt claim it id get nailed for sure they werent illegal just unusual the curse in my bag to make jenks big wouldnt even register it being demon magic and all the woman looked up pixy jenks clattered his wings for her attention hey hi he said trying to look innocent im not flying like this i mean im going on the plane ive got a ticket the woman looked away well have to check your bag by hand was all she said and i gave ivy a sarcastic smile see no problem i guessed as much i said cheerfully handing it over i couldnt move through the detector until she gave me the okay but ivys briefcase slid past me and the guard asked her to step through behind her a young couple with a kid in a stroller were grumbling about the holdup i was busy making bunnyeared kisskisses at the baby when the attendant cleared her throat not sounding nice at all can i see your ticket maam i looked up my expression going blank crap she called me maam um its in my handbag i said seeing it in front of her im going out for my brothers wedding she reached for my bag as she leaned to look at the screen nice dress bridesmaid i nodded trying to stay calm her attitude had shifted from boredom to a sharp interest on the other side of security ivy waited with her hip cocked can i reach into your bag for your ticket the woman asked and i nodded again hope sinking theres a problem here she said not even looking at the paper from behind me the couple with the kid began complaining more loudly a businessman and what looked like an entire high school cheerleading team behind them joining in my brother gave it to me i said leaning closer only to have her point at the floor and a yellow line id never even noticed before i checked it online i babbled as i backed up its still good look my seat is verified and everything yes maam she said my bag with all my identification in it in her grip oh god what if they slipped brimstone in there or something could you step over there please she asked tightly just through here she flipped the conveyor belt up and pointed to a laminated table and three chairs set to the side two guys and a woman in blue were waiting for me hands placed behind their backs so their guns and wands showed it was the wands i was worried about sure i said slumping and jenks darted to join ivy taking a deep breath i crossed the yellow line into enemy territory the carpet changing from dirty and threadbare to only dirty rachel ivy called out with jenks on her shoulder what do you want me to do i hesitated wait for me on the other side she smiled without mirth i was planning on doing that anyway i knew she was saying more than her words were and i dropped my eyes twenty minutes i had only twenty minutes to get to my gate damn it i should have known better i wasnt going to make it i could either spend my time arguing with these guys or grab a shuttle back to the car screwing up my resolve i eyed my shoulder bag on the table and my garment bag on the counter behind them look i said as i stopped before the table i dont want to waste your time if theres not a fairys fart in a windstorm of a chance im going to make my flight or any flight for that matter will you just let me know now so we can all get on with our lives one of the men inclined his head and gave me a cigarettestained smile not a chance okay i nodded trying to stay calm looking across the conveyors and archways i found ivy and jenks and made a kill gesture well duh i heard ivy say faintly and i turned back to the security people can i have my bags back i asked apart from my car keys the curse to make jenks big and my scrying mirror i had all the materials to make trents curse in my shoulder bag the head security guy hesitated and i stifled a surge of anger what did al do to scare the crap out of me oh yes get cold and pleasant dont mess with me johnny boy scout pleasant was too much to ask for but i could manage cold im being really nice right now just give me my purse and my dress and ill be on my way and out of your hair that is the first bridesmaids dress ive ever liked and im not leaving it here i put my hands on the table aware of but ignoring the fact that the two subordinates had dropped back and were touching their wands do we understand each other i said softly or do i need to stamp it on your foreheads with my foot i smiled that would be the pleasant part i felt more than saw ivys sleek form slip back through the security exit jenks was a sparkle of dust on her shoulder told you so she shouted not slowing as she headed for the doors yeah you did i exclaimed not taking my eyes off the head guy as expected my being left to my own devices made the security people more nervous not less i wasnt being abandoned i was capable of handling this on my own well i said again finding my pleasant inner demon you going to give me my dress and my car keys or am i going to show you why i was shunned my smile grew even brighter even as my mood became more pissed give it to her the man said his words clipped and precise but they said to detain her the woman said sounding disappointed taking his eyes from mine the head security man met his subordinates eyes give the woman her dress he said pushing my bag back to me across the table shes not the one they want but give the woman her godblessed dress he shouted and everyone looked at us the noise of a plane taking off sounding all the louder in the sudden silence his ears reddening he hunched like a bear i have had an incidentfree workplace for three years and im not going to let you ruin that because you want a little gold star annie the woman huffed but the man beside her had handed me my things sliding the straps of my bag over my shoulder i accepted the unwieldy garment bag thanks i said surprised that calm and pleasant had gotten me further than hotheaded threats maybe there was something to a demons methods my bags had never been out of my sight but i hesitated finding and holding the mans attention are they bugged no he said his eyes flicking from me to the distant doors behind me and back again but your checked luggage probably is good luck ms morgan you helped my grandfather once about three years ago on a bus i think youre getting a bum rap i hesitated then smiled as i searched my memory for a familiar face and found a close match he was being harassed by were pups winter wasnt it i asked getting a flustered nod in return it was my pleasure you take care of yourself okay and thanks he smiled totally ignoring the woman behind him having a hissy and with my pride intact i spun on a heel and strode for the big plateglass doors the second i emerged from the lowceilinged hallway jenks dropped down to me i told you so he sang out wings spilling a yellow dust over me like a sunbeam somehow though i didnt have it in me to be mad it wasnt often that i ran into anyone who knew me and even less frequent that they thanked me yes you did i said disappointed six hours on a plane and id have been there now i had three days to get to the west coast stiff i pushed the automatic door aside when it didnt slide quickly enough the fresh air hit me and i hesitated fumbling in my bag for a moment until i remembered that id sat on my sunglasses yesterday what about your luggage jenks asked and i shook my head squinting in the bright morning light and brisk wind looking for ivy forget it its bugged i said id have to dip everything in salt water my new jeans the silk sweater i was going to impress robbie with the swimsuit that took me three weekends to findgone at least i still have my dress i thought hiking it farther up on my shoulder wheres ivy jenkss wings hit a higher pitch and when he started swearing in onesyllable words i followed his line of sight down to the end of the curb sighing i pushed myself into motion and made my way past the chatting skycaps to the low black car ivy was there with her briefcase at her feet the flat of her arms on the open front window as she talked to the driver her butt was giving the porters something to stare at and not all the oglers were men it had to be trent whoopie friggin surprise from somewhere above me jenks shrilled listen to me listen this time witch this is trents doing he wants to get you alone and brainwash you with a charm hit you with an enthrallment spell what about yesterday huh you saw what he did how stupid can you get pretty stupid i said feeling my heels clunking all the way up my spine as i dodged oversize luggage and yet another cheerleading team trent isnt going to charm me i said not so sure anymore he had tried once before the spell fizzling only because id been drenched in salt water at the time i wanted to trust him but couldnt bring myself to do it even if hed shown me a part of himself that would be dangerous in the right hands and what was with the elven magic that stuff could kill you if you didnt do it right jenks dropped down to my shoulder reminding me of a shoulder angel hes going to convince you to get in that car he said and then youre going to believe everything he says i tried look at jenks but failed he was too close probably i want to talk to quen wings going full tilt jenks drifted backward off my shoulder sputtering ivy noticed my approach and pulled herself out of the window a hint of relief in her dark eyes they were dilated despite the early sun but not bad worry not fear squinting from the morning light i looked inside to find quen behind the wheel a real smile came over me and i crouched to avoid looking bad next to ivys perfection despite or maybe because of having fought trents security officer in the past i liked quen and by the honest smile on the older mans pebbly textured face i knew he liked me too hi quen i said cheerfully hows ceri from the backseat trent cleared his throat but i was mad at him and ignored him round irritable and as happy as if the world were hers quen said the darkcomplexioned man reaching across the seat to shake my hand it felt small in mine but powerful and it reminded me of pierces his voice was as gravelly as his skin both remnants of the turn it hit some species harder than most but witches vampires pure elves and weres not at all quen had some human in him not that i thought any the less of him for it it is i said as i took my hand back there was something wrong with me i could free thousandyearold slaves outwit militant weres survive exploding boats and a vampire roommate once fixated on my blood and body both but i couldnt find my own happiness yet seeing ceri smile as she held her baby that would be a good second place quen was an honorable man if trent was up to something he didnt approve of hed tell me wouldnt he unsure i angled my head to quen if you were me what would you do id get in the car his eyes were focused out the front window his jaw tight he was trents security officer and abided by his wishes but hed also helped raise trent and was probably the only one besides ceri who could say no to him with impunity and he wanted me to get in the car a shiver ran through me something bad was coming i could feel it good enough i said hearing trents exasperated sigh from the back my hand went to the handle but ivys was already there i am not sitting in the back with trent she said eyes narrowing in warning behind her jenks pantomimed being hanged oh for tinks diaphragm the pixy said what is wrong with you women the trunk popped open with a slow whine and i went around back to stow the garment bag nice and flat quen met me back there and i handed it to him thanks i said softly as ivy and jenks got in the front seat arguing the door slammed and quen gently put my dress into the trunk already holding a bland but expensivelooking piece of luggage we had only a moment time for only one question licking my lips i blurted out did trent send those elves yesterday to persuade me to help him quen met my eyes a lifetime of nobility in them no he said simply id feel better if he had though my shoulders slumped and i didnt move as he eased the trunk closed and the power lock whined as it shut squinting i looked up at a plane taking off roaring overhead to who knew where portland maybe my gaze dropped to the bustle of people life was going on and no one but a handful of people cared if i lived or died yeah me too i said with a sigh feeling trapped i went to the door that quen opened for me and slid into the leatherscented darkness four if looks could kill my face would show the imprint of jenkss thoughts the irate pixy was sitting on the rearview mirror of trents big black car heels thumping the glass and scowling at me as a green dust sifted from him sparkling in the sun before it hit the dash to make an evil puddle then spilling to the floor ivy was in the front passenger seat talking softly to quen about the success hed had with trents highly experimental treatment to make vampire neurotoxins dormant i could tell it bothered trent that they were discussing the illegal highrisk procedure and the only reason it didnt bother me was because it wouldnt help ivy in her quest to be free of her vampirism she was a vampire and making the neurotoxins dormant in her wouldnt save her soul when she died no she expected me to do that crossing my knees i looked out the tinted window we were passing through a weird mix of airport and industry on our way to longterm parking and i felt cut off the light making it through the tint was ugly and it made me uneasy no one was looking at us we were just another black car that made me uncomfortable too from the far side of the backseat trent said quen could we have the roof open their conversation never hesitated as quen touched a button and the small square of roof slid back to let the wind and sun roll in i couldnt stop my sigh of relief and i settled back into the comfortable leather i hadnt meant to telegraph my unease but i thought it telling that trent was trying to make me more comfortable taking a deep breath i tucked a stray curl behind my ear and looked at him id called his bluff and was still alive it must irritate him to no end he met my eyes and simpered destroying any illusion i might have had about him being miffed with me damn it he had warned me that i wouldnt be able to fly and it rankled that id have to admit he was right that jet of his was looking easy easy like a demon curse and those always came back to smack you i smiled back thinking of that curse i owed him he wouldnt kill me for delaying it but i was pushing him and he would push back eventually that he wasnt dressed for revenge having gone extremely casual today made me feel better and whereas quen was in his usual black outfit that looked somewhat like a uniform crossed with a martial artists robe trent was wearing jeans and a lightweight shortsleeved shirt instead of his thousanddollar boardroom shoes he had on brown boots scuffed from the stables and comfortable i was sure his appearance had been painstakingly contrived to remind me of the evening we had ridden over his fields his number one man jonathan had died under a pack of dogs that night for having attempted to kill me without trents permission killing an enemys enemy was probably elven tradition for cementing a new relationship but that trent had run his own man down like some perverted version of the hunt left me cold trent had insisted that it hadnt been jonathan out there and stayed with me while the horns blew and the dogs bayed but i hadnt seen jonathan since green was truly trents color and i wondered if the buttons of his shirt were real silver the wind shifted the collar to show a wisp of hair and i looked away my pulse quickening the moon had been new that night and it had been wonderful riding as trent tried to show me what it was like to rule creation with dogs singing for the blood of the one who had hurt me it had left me feeling curiouslylofty and then he goes and does black magic in my kitchen my attention flicked back to trent his expression open and wondering clearly curious as to where my thoughts had gone looking toward the front through the quietly moving car i sighed and said loudly okay i cant fly you told me so im still not getting on your jet and im still not going to remove your familiar mark until im free of the coven jenks made a rude sound and a burst of dust came from his wings trent shifted in his seat inadvertently giving away his mood i never offered the use of my jet there you are jumping to conclusions again ms morgan my runner instincts kicked in a soothing adrenaline starting to flow trent was trying to look relaxed when he was almost sweating jumping to conclusions is my only option when every third word out of your mouth is a halftruth i shot back the withons trying to kill you for standing up their daughter is a good story except i know she walked out on you not the other way around youre still lying to me no quens eyes flicked to mine by way of the rearview mirror his conversation with ivy had cut off and the tension in the car spiked you dont need to know why i need to get to the coast trent said softly and quens grip tightened on the steering wheel crap on toast whatever it was it was bad all you need to do is get me there trent finished jenkss wings were humming a warning and even ivy looked worried as she turned in the front seat so she could see me her window made a soft sound as she cracked it youre the only one quentrusts trent added his gaze on his fingers in the shaft of early sun gray through the tinted windows there was that word again and i grimaced as i looked to quen and he inclined his head at me in unspoken encouragement damn it i didnt want to be responsible for trent i didnt even like trent just get your little elf butt on your private jet and go i muttered jealous that his money made everything easy for him i cant trent explained patiently i cant take the train either tradition says i have to go by land and i need to be there by sunday night two days i yelped by car are you nuts what do you need to do on the west coast in two days that you cant do by phone jenkss wings hummed as if he was going to join us in the back but a look from ivy stopped him the car turned a corner and the sun shifted coming in to touch my knee without warmth trent leaned back into the shadows reluctant to answer whats on the west coast i asked again trent if you want my help treat me like a professional i need to know especially if lameass assassins are going to be dogging us quen sighed heavily and at the sound trent seemed to get mad its my personal business trent said glancing at the back of quens head no one will be hurt by it and it doesnt touch on your upcoming trial its not a trial its a pardon i said quickly but we all knew he was right trent looked at me across the seat his green eyes almost black in the shadows if you can get me there by sunday i should have time to speak for you at the meeting as well he said earning a bark of laughter from jenks that is if my familiar curse is gone by then carrots sweeter than vinegar but still unpalatable i thought remembering the druglaced carrots id eaten once while a mink trapped in his office son of a bitch what was i doing get me there after sunday and ill miss my window of opportunity trent added three days and there is no reason for me to go at all if we leave immediately we can make both of our deadlines my trial was sunday night and i met jenkss and ivys eyes this had all the earmarks of the tip of an iceberg trent was in trouble with the biggest elf family on the west coast and though he hadnt blamed me i might have had some part in it guilt licked at my soul i had a really bad feeling about this will you do it trent asked he sounded angry but not at me and i could hear a whisper of past arguments with quen in his tone though trent was the boss quen ran trents life had since trents father died it had to rankle when the only way quen would let him go would be with me no i said sitting up straighter the last time i worked for you willingly the boat blew up that water was cold atta girl rache jenks exclaimed and ivy leaned over to whisper a question to quen trents expression was empty i kept you alive didnt i only so you could pound my head into a tombstone i was upset he said avoiding my glare as he gazed at the parking lot wed turned into the sun shifted to him making his embarrassment easy to read i had just saved your life i said and you try to kill me for something i hadnt done and wouldnt do no i dont think so youre spouting pretty words like trust but you dont give it im not going to help you get to the west coast so you can run your personal errand especially if you are playing around with black magic trents eyes fixed on mine his anger easy to read as he put one ankle on his knee looking both cold and professional ceri does black magic you like her i squinted at him ceri has morals i said and quen winced i might not understand them half the time but shes got them you i almost poked trent in the chest turning the motion into a quick point i dont trust you you need me trent said playing it like it was his last card desperate despite his attempts to hide his stress if im with you the coven will be less inclined to take potshots at you ill admit that my dealings with you to date have been less than aboveboard his jaw clenched im trying to change that if not for me you wouldnt even have this chance to clear your name i swear rachel that my business on the west coast has nothing to do with you my foot braced against the carpet as the car gently halted i looked up seeing the back of my moms car finally thanks i have it from here ivy said with her usual calm control opening her door she slipped out jenks followed her shrilling something about his kids quen too got out and the trunk whined as it opened ivy had a set of keys to my moms buick and she opened the trunk taking my garment bag as quen handed it to her reaching for the door i picked up my shoulder bag you i said to trent gripping my bag tightly are anything but aboveboard with me you ask me to trust you but even now youre not telling me everything you must think i filled a prescription for stupid pills if you think im going to get you out to the west coast in two days for personal business god trent you told the coven i was a demon i could bear to say it now that ivy jenks and quen werent in the car but my face still burned i pulled on the handle but nothing happened damn it the thing had child locks i need your help trent said as i leaned over the front seat and unlocked the doors from the passenger panel i flopped back in the seat and reached for my handle shocked when trent touched my arm i need your help he said again letting go please oh crap hed said please gut clenching i covered my arm where hed touched me his eyes were pinched and i wondered if i was really seeing that whisper of desperate need in the back of his eyes or if this was all a trick to get me to do what he wanted why i asked letting go of my arm it felt like he was touching me still at the question the tight press of his lips eased outside the car quen jenks and ivy were talking in a small huddle but the drama was inside the car trent wasnt faking he needed meand he wouldnt tell me why exhaling i closed my eyes in a long blink crap i was a sucker for helpless males especially when they looked as good as trent a quiver rose through me and i felt my resolve start to fall apart he was powerful he was suave and he needed my help hed asked for it damn it damn it damn it i suddenly realized that no matter how much i complained and argued i was going to do exactly what trent wanted again and it irritated me that he was right if the coven was going to take a shot at me en route they would think twice if trent was with me i didnt trust trent but i trusted the coven even less i desperately need to get to the west coast before sunday night he said and my eyes opened its a private matter this is the most important thing in my life please help me the faint scent from his boots of stables was winding its way into me now that the car wasnt moving and the air was still his clothes the sun in his hair everything combined to remind me of a summer afternoon when i was twelve and he had found me crying in the stables at summer camp thinking id alienated my best friend the thrill id felt the power hed given me when we took a fence together on his horse twined through me then a mere two months ago when we had pounded over his fields under the moonlight believing the lie that the scream we had heard was a fox and not the man who had tried to kill me remembering it all i quivered feeling myself pulled to him shit maybe i was a demon i spoke to my knees if i get you to the west coast by sunday you have to promise to help me at the coven meeting i need them to reinstate my citizenship that you pushed them into revoking and guarantee that everyone stops gunning for me heart pounding i looked up if i cant beat this im permanently in the everafter i was going to regret this i knew it i didnt know that he said looking like he was realigning his thinking he went to say something more but jenks had dropped down through the open roof to hover between us you ready to go rache he asked looking far too bright and eager yes i said tired as i gathered my bag to myself again we need to talk im going to get trent to the coast im going to need your help and dont try to stop me the pixy put his hands on his hips and grinned at me i know my lips parted and i stared at him i know hed said i know who are you and how did you kill my partner i said and jenks spilled a silver dust cookie farts is right he said neither of you will make it out there without the other and me to help a huge sigh came from trent instead of the expected bad temper at the slur his eyes were closed and when they opened there was hopeit made him look more powerful yet we can leave within the hour he said opening the door they wont be expecting that i wondered if he meant they as in the withons or they as in the coven trent was gone his door thumping shut jenks shot out of the roof scrambling i worked the door and got out blinking as i emerged in the sun they wont be expecting it because its a stupid idea i said seeing trent beside ivy and quen i need to go home and pack again i said striding to the trunk of my moms car jenks needs to find a babysitter ivy shifted my garment bag to show two suitcases my old blue one and the other id seen in the trunk of trents car it had to be trents what was my old suitcase doing here and trents that was trents wasnt it youve got your dress ivy said as i stared and everything you packed for the airplane is in your blue bag whawhat was in my checked luggage i stammered ivy gave me one of her few full smiles magazines she said matteroffactly they werent going to let you get on that plane she said coaxingly when my brow furrowed so sue me for thinking ahead i just moved everything you packed to a different bag i thought wed hit the train station next but this is better not believing this was happening i looked at everyone in turn feeling like id been manipulated what about jenks and his kids i asked i called jih jenks said as he landed on the raised trunk his wings going red in the reflected heat bis is going to watch them at night and jih is going to watch them during the day her husband wasnt going for it until i agreed that jih could bring home whatever she wanted from the graveyard his wings hummed and he took flight warm again ivys going to bring me my good sword and some toothbrushes youre coming i asked ivy not seeing her suitcase in the trunk she shrugged im going to close up the church and fly out to join you you can get to st louis by nightfall i already have my ticket oh god the one shed bought today feeling used i dropped back eying them in disbelief this morning was all for show i said bitterly from beside me trent shifted his feet is this why you suggested i dress casually he asked quen you knew i wasnt coming back jenks hummed close darting off when i waved him away before he could land on my shoulder we had to be sure ivy could fly the pixy said now we know she can were taking your moms car the pixy looked too satisfied to live but i wasnt happy no were taking mine trent said suddenly and i realized he hadnt known about this either it made me feel a little better especially when quen cleared his throat and fell into a modified parade rest no sahan youre taking ms morgans car i turned to ivy and jenks both of them smiling in the sun as if it was all just a joke me and trent in a car to st louis the tabloids would love it you had this all worked out huh not all of it until just now ivy said but both quen and i like to be prepared from my other side trent muttered can i talk to you quen privately yeah yeah jenks said brightly when quen inclined his head to excuse himself go complain it isnt going to change anything gravel crunched under trents boots as the two elves went to have an argument that i was sure trent was going to lose uneasy i squinted in the sun as i faced ivy you agree with this ivy nodded and jenks darted away to eavesdrop on trent and quen i think this is the safest way to get you there ivy said and my focus sharpened on her the coven wont take a shot at you with trent in the car and the withons assassins arent that much of a threat its the best of a bad situation and if he is lying and he doublecrosses you ill kill him for you from anyone else it would have been an idle threat and i smiled feeling loved take this for me ivy said handing me her laptop in the briefcase if for some reason i cant get on the plane ill bike out and join you with luck ill see you in a few hours i took the briefcase as the heavy door of my moms car slammed nervous i gave her a hug jenks flew up dusting us as he got included in there somewhere be nice ivy whispered as she let go and i shivered at the feeling of her words on my neck flustered i backed up holding the briefcase before me like a fig leaf quen was coming toward us and i shifted to make room for him trent was in the front seat passenger side huh he was in for a surprise if he thought he was going to ride the entire way worry made the creases in the older mans face deeper gripping my hand quens expression smoothed out somewhat thank you rachel he said as he let go dont let him do anything too stupid if he does jenks said loudly well just leave him at a restaurant or something i didnt bother to hide my smile but i shook my head to reassure trents security officer i had more class than that i think quen hesitated as ivy made motions to get back into trents car then he said quickly thank you from me ceri and me both my smile grew wider and for the first time i started to feel good about this youre welcome i said knowing quen couldnt leave ceri it was his child she was having not trents the woman could take on demons and win but to have quen beside her as she brought their child into the world would mean more to her than anything else bring him home safely so i dont have to mess you up quen added as he turned away and my worry flowed back i was responsible for trent i was responsible for keeping him alive on this magic carpet ride remind me again of why i said yes but quen had gotten into the sleek black car with ivy and i did nothing as it looped forward and around and left the sound of the popping of gravel under tires gave way to crickets a hot summer breeze rose making my hair tickle my neck my gaze went to the pale blue sky then shifted to the cameras on the light poles i took a slow breath and it was as if i could see the entire world spreading out unseen before me making me small as i realized how far we had to go how many miles is it i whispered to jenks and the sound of his wings melted into the morning sounding right one at a time rache nodding i dropped my eyes and scuffed my boots to the passenger side of the car yanking the door open i met trents startled gaze he was wearing a pair of classy greentinted sunglasses and it made him look all the better youre driving i said flatly trent stared i beg your pardon i dont have a license i said waiting for him to get out the is took it when i got summoned out on i and plowed my car into a bridge railing youre driving bucko at least until we get out of the city and no one will recognize me he blinked then muttered for gods sake as he undid his seat belt and slid over jenks darted into the car as i got in taking his usual seat on the rearview mirror youre not going to swear all the bloody tinkblasted way there are you he asked feeling weird i settled myself my bag going on the backseat ive got one more condition or this stops right here i said and trent sighed his hands on the wheel staring at the dusty trunk of the car in front of us overhead a plane roared what he said flatly more of a demand than a question my thoughts went back to the enthrallment curse and him wiping the memories of jack and jill and i laboriously rolled my window down my mom didnt trust electronics and they were the old crank style you do nothing but drive i said got it no wiping memories no enthrallment and no fighting if theres trouble nothing you sit in a bubble and play tiddledywinks jenks made a scoffing sound youre not good at this greenie weenie and youre going to slow us down if you try you dont like my magic he said a thread of pride in him no i shot back stifling a shiver at the memory of his wild elven magic i dont calling on the divine for strength is risky and you never know what youre going to get keep it to yourself or im going to zipstrip you his eyebrows rose mockingly not a good feeling is it knowing someone has the ability to do bad things and you just have to trust they wont i only do black magic as a last resort i said through clenched teeth it was all i could do not to smack the smug satisfied look off his face keys trent said mockingly and jenks hummed his wings in anticipation twisting i reached over the seat for my bag flushing when i got myself back where i belonged sheesh my butt had been inches from trent and jenks was laughing as i refastened my seat belt trent was still utterly emotionless and i smacked the keys into his hand with enough force to bring his eyes to mine shes all yours jeeves i said closing my eyes as i tried to gather my strength this was going to be a long ride they stayed shut for all of three seconds flashing open when trent revved the engine hard jamming it into reverse and making me reach for the dash take it easy i shouted staring at trent his eyes on the rearview mirror watch where youre driving that piece of bluehaired crap someone yelled and i turned to the businessman behind us clearly hot and bad tempered as he looked for his car i went to shout something appropriately rude but trent had already yanked the wheel around and was accelerating leaving him in a cloud of gravel dust when we get to st louis were renting a real car trent muttered there is nothing wrong with my moms car i snapped trent was silent staring straight ahead but i was fuming there was nothing wrong with my moms car nothing at all five a narrow slice of earlyafternoon sun made it into the front seat to warm my arm resting on the open window i was drivingbig surpriseand the wind had my hair in a tangle that would take half a bottle of cream rinse to fix wed stopped three hours out in the bottom part of indiana for jenks to find something to eat and somewhere to pee and after that he told me he was going to nap elves had a similar sleep schedule and though he hadnt said anything it was obvious that trent was getting sleepy too so id offered to drive actually i mused as i glanced at a somnolent trent the last four hours had been nice trents face was pleasant when he wasnt scowling his jeans and shirt made him look dramatically differentmore attractive than his usual suit somehow accessible maybe the wind shifted his babyfine hair as he slumped against the door as far from me as he could get i could reach right out and smack him if i wanted i hadnt liked his quiet disdain of my moms car so it didnt have a sixspeaker system or power doors or windows it wasnt shiny and the blue color didnt do anything for me either but i could do ten miles an hour more in my oldlady car than in my shiny red car and never get noticed it had lots of cup holders too tucking a wayward curl behind an ear i eyed his sunglasses in envy just sitting on the dash while he slept i bet theyd look better on me than on him the sun was giving me a headache and i almost reached for themuntil i noticed that trents hands were clenched even in sleep okay maybe he wasnt as comfortable with this as he wanted me to believe still it said something that hed even fallen asleep looking back to the flat landscape wed been in for the last hour or so i wondered if id be able to fall asleep with trent driving this was weird and not just because a witch an elf and a pixy were on the great american road trip i still owed trent that freed familiar curse and guilt was tugging at me bothered i glanced at my shoulder bag where his curse was then back to the road a quick look at the rearview mirror assured me that jenks was still sleeping soaking in the sun like a tiny winged cat in the back window sighing i returned my attention to the landscape id never driven like this and the open spaces were getting to me the road had been built preturn and it was creepy driving past town after town that had been abandoned during the plague the turn had been born of the trees growing through the roofs of abandoned buildings and the tall yellow ms and old gas station signs high above new forests made me positively uncomfortable the mix of vegetation covering the old destruction was reminiscent of the everafter and curious i brought up my second sight my scalp tingled the sensation shifting over my skull to make me shiver as the redtinted everafter swam up coating everything in a sheen of red the sun seemed to cast two shadows but apart from the road which now looked broken and covered with weeds everything looked pretty much the same a sunbaked field of nothing but grass stretched from horizon to horizon demons congregated where the ley lines were living under them in the ground where nothing changed much according to al the everafter was a broken reality unable to stand on its own and was being dragged along behind ours connected to and kept alive by the ley lines energy flowed like tides between them preventing the everafter from vanishing and giving the alternate reality a broken visage it was a reflection of reality but shattered so if cincinnati put up a new building a new one would show up in the everafter but would begin to fall apart even before it was completed thats why demons lived underground we didnt construct much below a certain level so nothing changed there but what the demons fashioned for themselves they used gargoyles like familiars pulling leyline energy deep into the earth to where they could use it but here out in the spaces between big conglomerations of ley lines where the cities were there was a whole lot of redsheened nothing trees grass bushes youd think that being an earth witch id like nature but i didnt not like this anyway it felt broken it didnt help that the everafter looked almost normal out here except for the black parts squinting i tried to figure out what they were id never seen them in cincinnatis version of the everafter and they glinted silver under the redtinted sun like a heat mirage or something reflectingnothing still using my second sight i looked over the trees to st louis feeling better with the tall buildings even if they looked broken with the overlay of my second sight we were close and i dropped my second sight and twisted in my seat to pull my phone out of my back pocket id gotten a text from ivy earlier when shed boarded her plane then again when shed landed we were going to meet at the arch i should give her a call what were you just doing trent said suddenly and i jerked dropping my phone jeez trent i yelped how long have you been watching me i flushed glancing in the back to see jenkss wings shift and spill a silver dust as he slept on im calling ivy trent sat up rubbing his right bicep where his familiar mark was before he bent almost double to get my phone from under my feet you forgot i was here he said as he handed it to me smiling as if it pleased him what were you doing before i mean you were looking at something and it wasnt the view your aura had a shadow on it ive never seen that great hed been watching me grimacing i focused on the road the traffic was starting to thicken as we approached the city really i said shortly jenks had said the same thing to me once when i was doing some high magic i didnt like that my aura shadow showed up when i was using my second sight smiling as if nothing was wrong i tossed my phone to him and he deftly caught it will you call ivy for me tell her where we are he tossed it back and it thumped onto my lap im not your secretary dude that was just rude i thought intentionally swerving from the right lane to the left as i flipped the phone open trent clutched the door and the dash and from the backseat jenks shrilled hey rache what the disney blasted hell are you doing i was smiling my prettiest as trent growled give me the phone thank you i all but sang dropping it into his hand and rolling up the window so he could hear better he seemed harmless in his jeans and shirt and i wondered how much of his charisma came from his wardrobe jenks apparently appreciated the drop in wind and he flew back to the front looking rumpled and sleepy as he yawned and sat on the rearview mirror where are we he asked rubbing a hand over his wings to check for tears still on i i said as trent scrolled through my call list eyebrows going high when he found the mayors number yeah we had talked got that little misunderstanding about her son a few years ago taken care of well be crossing the mississippi in a minute i added rubbing his arm again trent hit a button and put the phone to his ear i wondered if he knew he was doing it rubbing his familiar mark one of these days your smartass attitude is going to get you killed he said softly not today i said then watched jenks peer behind us huh the pixy said not sounding at all worried theyre still there nodding i flicked my gaze to the mirror seeing a gold cadillac a way back yup phone to his ear trent turned to look were being followed relax cookie maker jenks said as he continued to work over his wings theyve been there since terre haute a knot of worry started to tighten was it me they were following or trent there was a faint hail on the tiny speaker and trent continued to watch the car behind us through the side mirror ms tamwood he said and i marveled at his voice rachel would like to talk to you he added as i held out my hand hey hi i said as i wrangled the phone to my ear were almost across the mississippi how was your flight lousy ivy sounded tired but shed been up longer than i had im at the arch she continued stay on i then take the south memorial drive exit just after the bridge thanks i already looked at the map i said mildly peeved the woman had not only laminated the map but shed used a marker to star where we could stop for jenks follow memorial drive all the way down to washington she continued as if id said nothing therere signs everywhere to the parking structure okay thanks i said exasperated but jenks was laughing as he landed on my shoulder rache those guys are getting closer he said pitching his voice so ivy could hear him what guys ivy asked her concern clear through the tiny speaker i fluffed my hair to make jenks take off thanks a hell of a lot jenks someones tailing us i said casually for how long she said loud enough for trent to hear long enough i said they arent that close quarter mile two hundred feet ivy jenks said loudly back on the rearview mirror and knowing her superior vamp hearing would pick it up three guys unless someones taking a nap the good news being that if they were that close the car probably wasnt bugged maybe we should drive straight through wheres the map jenks said taking off in a burst of sparkles and vanishing in the backseat trent stiffened his gaze sharp on mine we need to stop i dont need a map jenks i said paying more attention to the road wed picked up a dump truck somewhere and the road was getting crowded with semis and suvs if youre being followed just keep going ivy said ive got a rental car and ill catch up okay ram them or something we are going to stop trent said again looking militantly adamant maybe he needed to use the little boys room after his nappies from the backseat jenks chimed i found it trent be a pal and open it for me huh i jiggled the phone to my other ear and the car swerved ram them was she serious rachel came ivys voice and i put my attention back on the road youre not going to ram them i said and trent rubbed his forehead as if in pain and we arent going to drive through we are coming in id rather meet up now than later even if they are watching they probably already know youre waiting for us jenks darted up from the backseat his hands on his hips trent i could use some help here you just going to sit there like a pile of fairy crap the entire way we dont need the map i said starting to get mad and we are not driving through we are stopping for ivy from my phone ivy was protesting theres a bunch of kids here you really want to risk a fight with the coven the coven wouldnt dare i said as i started to wonder not with innocents around we can have an ice cream or something make bunnyeared kisses at them from across the park i suppose she agreed sounding doubtful call me when you park okay making a murmur of agreement i closed the phone and dropped it onto my lap good plan trent said breathily and a single warning flag went up as smooth and sure as ice is cold i dont know why because he was agreeing with me but his attitudethe overwhelming relief he was trying to hidewas at complete odds with what he should be feeling with someone tailing us frowning i thought back to whose idea it was to stop in st louis in the first place ivys i think shed bought a flight going there the tires hummed as we found the bridge and the world seemed to shift as we headed right for the city the arch was huge word was that it pinned down one of the citys ley lines which i thought suspect why would anyone do anything so stupid you need the memorial drive exit trent said intently it goes right past the park thanks trent i said my eyes narrowed suspiciously youre in the wrong lane he added and clenching my teeth i wondered what hed do if i just drove past the exit watching his body language i shifted even farther to the left to get around a black car sure enough he tensed interesting i mused and then checking the rearview to see that the gold car had done the same i slid back to the righthand lane making the motion far too fast jenks yelped taking to the air as the steering wheel spun trent clutched the dash glaring at me as we rocked to a halt but saying little else as his sunglasses slid off the dash and to my feet another warning flag went up that should have gotten me more than a dirty look youre going to have to do a lot more than that to lose them jenks said misreading my motion and i eyed the semi that roared up behind me aggressively making his brakes flatulate in an effort to get me to move faster faster that might be a good idea seeing as that gold cadillac was a car length away three guys all blonds elves not the coven then my phone hummed and i ignored it trent jerked his eyes showing a new alarm as he turned to me we need to get off this road now like how i snarled our exit isnt for another two miles well do something trent exclaimed someone is prepping a spell my eyes flicked behind us seeing the three heads clustered together the shoulder was on one side and that truck on the other as he tried to pass me a little vw bug was ahead of me full of people are you nuts no one would make a hit on the expressway too many people could get hurt and besides i dont feel look out jenks shrilled and i gasped jerking the wheel as a reddishgold ball of something blossomed from the car behind us our tires hit the shoulder gravel kicking up underneath as i struggled to maintain control at a suddenly toofast sixtyfive miles per hour the spell hit the vw bug ahead of us and i watched in horror as it turned sideways and spun right into the path of the truck barreling down on it sparks flew inside the small car and the truck hit its brakes the tires hopping on the pavement as three lanes of traffic became five everyone trying to get out of the way the little car spun into a roll a protection bubble snapping into place and i stiffened my arms looking for an out the truck was going to jackknife and the rear of it was two feet away coming closer almost shoving us behind us were the ugly sounds of screeching tires and plastic crunching i didnt dare look as we sped ahead the truck now taking up three lanes as it slowly began to topple over the little vw had hit the wall and i swerved into the path of the truck to avoid it there was a huge crash and the sound of scraping metal i looked back to see the truck on its side cars piling up behind it three cars had made it through us a station wagon with a whitefaced woman driving it and that gold cadillac my god what had they done go go go jenks shrilled plastered to the back window they got through go i floored it weaving through the cars ahead of us most of them just now noticing the truck sliding to a stop and taking up the entire road brake lights were going on and my grip on the wheel became sweaty how had they gotten through i wondered seeing that they had lost a fender but were still moving the vw had become small in the rearview mirror and feeling sick i pulled my attention back to the road ahead of us no one does a hit on a busy road no one who the hell did these people think they were or perhaps my question should be who the hell did these people think we were that they would do such a thing we need to get off this road trent exclaimed as i sped past a slowmoving jag gee you think i said seeing the cadillac clip another car as it tried to catch up wheres the map trent muttered leaning over the backseat to find it jenks looked scared having moved to the front where he could stand on the rearview mirror and hold on to the stem for dear life go right he shouted and i jerked the wheel looking back to see yet another ball of whoknewwhat headed for us trent yelped as the car swerved his butt smacking into me and a raised foot hitting the wheel trent i shouted shoving him off sit down will you im trying not to get pasted here and your ass in my face isnt helping the orange blob hit the pavement behind us the jag id just gone around running right into it the car flipped and i started to get really scared what the hell were they using to throw their magic a grenade launcher we were going over ninety oblivious to it trent slid back into his seat with a huff the map in his hand jenks you got any ideas i asked as trent buckled himself back in and jenkss wings stilled even as a green dust began spilling from him maybe trent should have married the bitch he warbled and i shifted into the farleft lane to get around a bus sure enough they stuck with me and my heart pounded i couldnt do magic and drive at the same time where the hell was pierce when i needed him noooo the one time i have nonunion assassins behind us i have a businessman riding shotgun trying to find answers in a friggin map thats our exit trent said trying to look cool but his grip on the map was too tight were sitting ducks on the expressway oh thank you very much for that observation kalamack i said sarcastically you think we should get off the road and then what just take south memorial he said his eyes on the map as he swayed to my swerving through traffic earning beeps and flashing lights we can lose them on the surface roads more easily than on the expressway do what i say and well be fine but he was sweating i couldnt make a bubblewed drive right through it jenks darted down to land on the map in trents hand as we flashed past the sign thats the one you want rachel right lane right lane there was a big truck ahead of me in the farright lane if i slowed down to take the exit the cadillac would hit us my fingers clenched and relaxed behind us a new glow was starting in the car i had to time this perfectly do what i say and well be fine i muttered through clenched teeth surface streets mean we put the entire city in danger were going to lose them right now rachel trent said his voice tinged with anger and fear what are you doing getting onto memorial i said licking my lips the engine roared as i pressed the accelerator and my moms car leapt ahead my heart pounded and i darted around a white car on the right then a blue on the right crap this was going to be close there was a weird prickling through me but i darent look at trent it was wild magic but i didnt think it was from him it was like the tracers that the earth sends up to the cloud before the lightning follows it down the next hit wouldnt miss hold on i shouted eyes wide rachel trent shouted the chicken strap in his hand this is going to be close i yelled and i jammed on the accelerator the car bounced as we raced forward and i yanked the wheel to the right at the last moment skidding across all three lanes and onto the exit ramp the semi blew its horn but we were through and bouncing over the rough pavement narrowly missing the cement wall yeeeeehaaaaa jenks shrilled and i hit the brakes hard so i wouldnt ram the car ahead of me my heart was thudding and we fishtailed scared i looked to find jenks in the back face plastered to the window as he watched the traffic behind us the awful prickling had stopped thank you god they missed the exit he yelled they missed it you lost them rache i looked across the seat to trent white faced from behind us came a crunch of metal and someones horn got stuck my phone started to hum ivy where was my phone we lost them i breathed then became worried we had lost them but what about everyone else god i hoped those people were okay i was sure id seen a protection bubble on the bug but at those speeds it might not make a difference ahead of us cars were slowing for the traffic light its red rachel jenks said and i slammed on the brakes adrenaline making the motion too fast jenks yelped and trent reached for the dash glaring at me i couldnt believe theyd tried to take us out on the interstate id been under death threats before but there were niceties to be observed union rules this wasnt them silent trent folded up the map tucking it away with precise motions he looked calm but i was starting to shake nicely done he said and i almost lost it my hands clenching the wheel until my knuckles were white nicely done there were people hurt back there and i felt a sudden surge of panic as three ambulances went by headed for the interstate everyone in that vw bug was probably dead and the truck driver and the four cars behind him the guy in the jag was probably okay probably my foot started to jiggle and when the light turned green i crept up on the car ahead of us pushing it into moving i wanted out of the car like now jenks flew to the rearview mirror when trent rolled his window all the way down to get rid of the scent of cinnamon and wine and something in me eased as i turned right onto memorial he was shaken and trying not to show it more sirens wailed and jenks landed on the steering wheel giving me a worried look as a fire truck went by headed for the onramp people were hurt because of me trent did it matter were going to stop right trent asked his eyes on riverside park as we passed it why think youll get a better view of the accidents from up on top of the arch i asked sarcastically this was way more than id expected when i agreed to escort him to the coast and i was long past wishing id told him to shove his little problem and taken my chances by myself my foot was shaking as i stopped at another light the church was right next to us and in a splitsecond decision i turned the blinker on okay i said as i glanced behind us at the flashing lights on the interstate were ditching the car get your stuff together ditching the car trent stared at me like id said we were going to walk to the moon right now i said as the light changed and i turned into the quiet parking lot ignoring the do not park sign you hear those sirens we left the scene of an accident one we helped make theres no way we can go back there which makes this a marked car and not just by your friends from seattle soon as we find ivy shell carry your bag mr kalamack think you can handle it that long first smart thing youve done all day trent muttered his fingers tapping jenks exhaled loudly his wings an excited red as i put the car in park and turned the engine off i was moving almost before the car stopped gathering my stuff and jamming everything but the bag of trash into my bag trents sunglasses included trent was already out of the car and i popped the trunk my fingers trembled as i worked the door handle finally getting the stupid thing open cool air slipped in and the sound of kids damn that had been close what the devil were they putting in their coffee in seattle wheres my phone i said hearing it start to hum jenks have you seen my phone jenks darted to the floorboards its under the seat he said then added its ivy i stretched reaching for it exhaling loudly as my fingers found the smooth plastic i wished my fingers would stop shaking jenks zipped out from under the seat and flipping my phone open i muttered i think we lost them were abandoning the car where are you from the sounds of the sirens id say a couple of blocks away she said whats going on i wish i knew getting out i looped my bag over my shoulder and grabbed my coat and ivys laptop jenks was a sparkle of dust as he searched the car giving me a thumbsup before he joined trent trent already had our luggage out from the back and he slammed the trunk shut hard his hands going to his hips as he squinted at the busy road the wind from the nearby mississippi river shifting his shirt to show the familiar mark on his shoulder were at the church i told ivy i got your laptop and were going to walk in soon as we find you well head to your car worry pinched my brow ivy they tried to kill us on the interstate a semi tipped over and i think they killed a carload of people someone will remember my moms car youre at the church she asked not caring you cant park there im not parking im abandoning i said frustrated as i looked at the big handpainted sign my mom would not be happy shed been royally pissed off when id left her car at a pulloff by the ohio river last year at least this time the car was in my name and she wouldnt be getting the impound notice ivy i gotta go i said not able to handle everything i had and my suitcase too im on my way she said and i could hear the hoot of a steamship through the connection before it cut off i closed my phone and tucked it away worry settling in deep as i looked from trent standing behind the car with our stuff to the road wed find ivy and then wed be out of here can anything else go wrong today i whispered thinking i could have been sitting on a dock somewhere drinking coffee by now if the coven had let me fly uh you gotta stop saying stuff like that jenks said darting up in a wash of dust alarmed i followed his gaze across the busy street crap on toast i said the dappled sun going cold on me as i saw three blond men in slacks and polo shirts they must have left their car on the interstate and walked it wasnt that far and a feeling of ice seemed to slip through me as i took them in one had really long hair the other was short but perfectly proportioned and the third in the middle reminded me of quen even though he looked nothing like him it was his pace both predatory and graceful the other two carried themselves with a belligerent swagger shoulders back arms swinging and hands well away from their sides the withons had gotten serious all three were watching us as they waited for four lanes of traffic to clear but upon seeing me notice them the one with the long hair simply stepped out into the street his hand raised horns blew and cars screeched to a halt the drivers yelling out their windows ignored trent turned to the noise his lips parting as he took a deep resolute breath funny id have thought hed look scared not determined and i stifled a surge of what might be a feeling of kinship well he asked me looking surprisingly calm find ivy i said digging through my shoulder bag for a stick of magnetic chalk and reaching out for the citys ley lines i sucked my breath in as i found the one the arch was pinning down holy cow it was big and way stronger than the one under cincys university it felt slippery being next to so much water and had a metallic flavor like fish i looked up with the chalk in my hands surprised to find trent still standing there with his suitcase jenks hovering between us go i shouted pushing the chalk into trents hand and giving him a shove find ivy ill take care of this and catch you up oh god i could do this right where was my blackarts bodyguard when i needed him rache jenks whined but trent looked at the chalk in his hand and nodded saying nothing more he turned and walked quickly away with his suitcase headed for the arch stay with him will you i asked jenks my attention on the three guys they had gotten to the median and hadnt slowed down maybe get him to run a little i added trying to be funny as i glanced at the worried pixy ill be right behind you piece of cake i dont like this my eyes flicked back to him seeing his worry in the slant of his brow me neither but who do you think needs you more right now ill catch you up go its just three guys once you get trent to ivy you can come back and play he made a face and with a harsh clatter he bobbed up and down in agreement then zipped after trent telling him to hurry up that they had things to do today other than play tourist i felt better with jenks watching trent but nervousness prickled through me as i turned back to the three blonds now at the curb the one with the long hair peeled off and started for trent hey legolas i shouted my boots grinding the gravel as i shifted you want him you go through me ignoring me he continued on that was just insulting and gathering up a wad of fishtasting everafter i threw it at him the guy with the long hair raised his hand a protection bubble flashing into existence to deflect the everafter standard move i hadnt really expected my first shot to land and i started backing up more my feet finding grass as i moved under the huge trees but the men stopped and that was all i wanted for the moment side by side the three men looked at me traffic passing behind them in an uncaring blur the guy with the long hair seemed to be the leader and he frowned at trent disappearing through the bushes before turning back to me whatever hes paying you the withons will double it if you turn your back for ten minutes he said loudly and my face burned why was i not surprised elves were elves hes not paying me anything i said just now realizing it i was either really smart or really stupid the short guy on the end snorted his disbelief youre kidding embarrassed i backed up until the roots of a thick tree stopped me and even if he was i dont work like that i said obviously you do pathetic i should have known you were amateurs when you tried to take us out on the expressway you keep that up and the union is going to come down hard on you there are traditions for this kind of thing procedures or havent you been playing the game long enough to know i was stalling and the guy with the long hair knew it taking a moment to tie his hair back and frown at the arch behind me i glanced back a knot of worry easing when i realized trent was gone who wants the pleasure he asked and the one in the middle the one who reminded me of quen smiled ill do it he said and i tensed shocked when a heavy lassitude filled me my legs buckled and that fast i was on my knees the tingle of wild magic coursing through me robbing me of strength there was music in my head like green growing things and my hands hit the ground bits of twigs biting into my palms making them tingle i gasped my lungs reluctant to expand i fought it finding strength from the ley line i pulled it into me feeling it burn teeth clenched i looked up through the strands of my hair the man in the middle widened his eyes as if in surprise and then he started to sing my breath escaped me in a rush as his words washed over me and my head bowed my elbows trembled and everything i had won back left me stop i whispered i couldnt think the thick muzzy blanket swallowing me up as he sang the lazy words unclear as they became my entire world my pulse shifted becoming slower meeting his song beat for beat it was too slow and i fought for control failing i felt myself start to fall and a warm arm caught me gently cradling me i could smell cinnamon and wine bitter and spoiled i couldnt fight the music beating its way into my existence making me live to a rhythm too slow and my eyes shut as someone propped me up against the tree i was losing my hold on the ley line and in terror i reached for it trying to make a protection bubble in my mind to wall the music off but it was already in my head and i couldnt separate it from me it was too beautiful i couldnt help but listen that was easy i heard the longhaired elf say derisively but i couldnt move couldnt fight the lassitude that had become my world hated and familiar from my childhood you have her then the voice asked and finally the singing stopped the fatigue lingered as the song echoed in my brain circling over and over going more slowly each time it was killing me go a breathy voice said and my head landed on a shoulder ill be done by the time you finish kalamack oh god trent but the spark quickly died my breathing had slowed to a shallow hint i was faltering i recognized it id lived this before when i was younger the grass sighed as two of them left and it was only me and the elf singing me to death so beautiful i couldnt let it go couldnt forget it mesmerized the air grew cold on my face and i realized i was crying i didnt want to die like this damn elf magic wild magic divine slipperyalive uncontrollable uncontrollable i thought fastening on that idea malleable i couldnt control wild magic couldnt fight it but maybe i couldchange it my heart gave a thump and refused to beat again as the mans voice faltered leaving a single note in my mind to spiral down to a long soft hum om perhaps the sound of peace the sound of death not yet i thought and then i added to it giving my mind an ugly note to follow the one of pure beauty and my heart gave a beat at the harshness of it discordant and wrong the arms holding me jumped in surprise jarring me and i added a new note to follow my first i could hear him singing again the words unclear and so exquisite it broke my heart my jaw clenched and i drowned the purity of his song with my own ugly music harsh and savagesurvival it was never beautiful except for its pure honesty again my heart beat and i took a sip of air breaking away from the elven spell tingling with wild magic as control came flooding back his hold on me broken my eyes flashed open i was sitting on the ground my back to a tree his arm around me like a lover sleeping in the sun as he sang to me son of a bitch i sat up out of his reach turning to see the shock in his green eyes as his voice faltered there was a hint of resemblance to trent in them and i felt a moment of doubt could he do this too that was a mistake i rasped and then i plowed my fist right into his gut the man grunted bending over and bringing his knees to his chest i swung my legs around to kneel reaching for his hair it was soft like silk and i clenched my fingers in it anger giving me strength i slammed the back of his head against the tree and as he groaned i staggered to my feet giving him a mean kick in the ribs hard enough to at least crack one or two if not break them i was pissed you son of a bitch i yelled seeing the mothers nearby gathering their kids and moving them away try to kill me with your magic have a taste of mine i shouted shredding the last of the music in my mind trying to get rid of it completely he looked up at me the pain from his ribs making him squint i put my hand on his face and flooded him with everafter burning the last of the wild magic from me with my own he screamed and tried to pull away but i followed him down having to kneel when he fell over you are slime you hear me i shouted wiping my eyes as i pulled away my hand throbbing and me not caring slime and you know what the withons are slime too and trents going to make it to the west coast if it kills me and it wont heart pounding i gave him another kick thinking i should do a lot more all those people dead on the expressway glancing at the empty park i went and picked up my bag searching until i found my lipstick throwing the cap away i scrawled i killed them on his forehead panting i lurched to my feet and dropped the ruined lipstick on his chest he whimpered his synapses singed he wouldnt be doing magic any time soon turning to the park i pushed myself into a staggering ugly run i did not like st louis six rache jenks shrilled scaring the crap out of me as he darted down from the tall trees god jenks i yelped heart racing as i paused a hand on the tree beside me you scared me wheres trent dripping red dust he hovered before me taking in my haggard appearance and accepting it knowing better than to ask what had happened i was here the assassin wasnt it was enough for jenks and right now it was enough for me in a hole in the ground he said and tension hit me some kind of gardeners bunker it was his idea i told him to find ivy but he wouldnt listen theyre going to find him rache its not my fault he wouldnt listen i panted turning to look back the way id come show me i said and he darted away dusting heavily so i could follow at my own limping pace if that man gets himself killed im going to pound him i muttered starting up the gentle incline the back of my mind registered how cool and restful it was here the grass thick and well maintained the trees were huge rising high overhead like a distant ceiling seagulls called swarming a crying kid with a box of animal crackers breathless i caught sight of two men vanishing behind a row of tall shrubs damn it i dont want to do this again my shoulder bag held tight to me i ran after them seeing jenkss faint trail leading down a damp sidewalk ahead of me the two men stood at a bunkerlike door built right into a wall of earth in the distance one of the archs huge legs rose up oblivious to me the men slipped insideand the door swung shut i slid to a panting halt before the brownpainted steel door listening as i struggled to catch my breath and tried the handle lockedand not with a spell which i could break but probably with a mundane dead bolt from the inside at least jenks was in there damn it i hissed dropping back and digging my phone out of my pocket answer me ivy i said as i hit the button and wrenched on the door at the same time right behind you came her voice and i spun where i started then shoved the thought out of my head the door i babbled dropping the phone into my bag two of them in there with trent ivy motioned for me to back up and she gave the knob a side kick yelling for strength i heard metal snap and i wasnt surprised when the knob came away in her grip as she gave it a tug and the door opened god i had good friends shoulder to shoulder we looked down a long dimly lit room that narrowed into a black hallway the electric lights were pale and the sun streamed in for only a few feet it was silent and a cool breath of underground air blowing out from the depths moved my hair which way ivy said and i crept inside feeling the chill take me the faint glow of pixy dust showed when she pulled the door shut and i pointed there it smelled like oil and dampof sweaty men old machinery and dusty paperwork that hadnt seen the light of the sun for twenty years this was not on the regular tour and i wondered where we were as we followed the corridor down and around shunning doors and open archways when jenkss dust pointed elsewhere wheres the third one she whispered back at the car out cold dont let them start to sing okay i said breathlessly and she nodded taking that at face value we have to be almost under one of the feet i thought wondering how quen kept trent safe every day i suppose watching trent in an office was easier than trying to shake three guys in a cadillac but i was going to get the man a leash if we found him alive a soft crack of metal shocked through me and then jenkss yelp shit ivy swore darting past me and running down a corridor gasping i bolted after her trent was shoutingit sounded like latinand my boots skidding on the oilslicked cement i grabbed a rusty ceiling support and swung myself around a dusty machine and into a puddle of dirty light squinting i watched jenks bust another bulb to make it darker yet two shadows were scurrying into the dark ivys sleek form chasing them the ceiling was low and the space was crowded with abandoned machines trent had his back to me as he knelt next to his suitcase under a light a protection bubble around him relief hit me and i paused torn between seeing if he was okay and following ivy busy thunking people into walls by the sound of it the circle was larger than i thought trent could make almost one of my size and i was glad id given him the magnetic chalk he had a ribbon draped over his shoulder and a cloth hat on his head that i didnt recognize i sniffed wondering if that was an extinguished candle i smelled or just sulfur he was kneeling and looked haggard as our eyes met seeming almost scholarly with that hat and ribbon but he seemed okay rachel some help here ivy yelled and i gave him a look telling him to stay put and ran the glow of jenkss dust lit a dark corner and i winced at a loud clang crap if that had been ivys head i barreled into another puddle of light scrambling to catch the arm of the man she had flung it was the short guy and using his own momentum i threw him into a rusty ceiling support he hit with a thud grasping weakly at it as he slid to the dirtcaked floor with a dull crack the beam hed hit broke from the ceiling falling right on him a splattering of ceiling dust slipped over him patterning him with rust i wedged a toe under him and flipped him over to see his pained expression surprise i said and his eyes widened duck jenks yelled and i dropped feeling the rush of metal over my head son of a bastard i whispered as i rolled away finding my feet when i hit a piece of machinery the size of my car i scrambled up the lethalmagic detection charm on the strap of my bag clinking the guy with the long hair was in front of me with a metal rod the size of a baseball bat damn it is ivy down i couldnt see her and i backed up as he came forward swinging his pole in some lameass elf move as if it were a sword my hands were empty i had jacks splat gun in my shoulder bag but there were no charms in the hopper licking my lips i tapped the ley line that st louis was built on if he started singing i was going to fry him black charm or not energy tasting of dead fish and electric lights slammed into me and my eyes widened it was as if it hit every square inch of my skin all at once and i sucked in my breath exhilarated crap i think were right under the ley line the guy id slammed into the pole was moving and his buddy took a moment to help him up ivy i called out worried and she coughed from the darkness shes okay jenks said darting in circles around my head the two men stood a ribbon of blood seeping from a scalp wound the short one had grinning ponytail guy pointed at me then ivy and i cringed when someone pulled hard on the ley line humming somewhere above us their heads shot up as if surprised and i dove for the shadows grab some air jenks i shouted my heavymagic detection amulet flashing red as i found ivy upright but holding her head i never got a circle up as the tingle of wild magic hit me too late i thought doubled over in pain as a surge of energy swamped me it was as if they had found a way to dump the entire line through me forcing me to hold it i screamed trying to channel the entire ley line or spindle itanything to get atop the massive force burning me gasping i managed to ride the wave of cresting energy and with a triumphant cry i shoved the spindled energy back out of me and into them breaking my connection with the ley line entirely before they fried my synapses it wasnt wild magic and this i could handle son of a bitchwhat demon had taught them that and how much had it cost i looked up from my half kneel not remembering having fallen ivy was standing beside me and i peered through my watering eyes to see the two elves picking themselves up off the floor i would have felt pretty good if my mind wasnt aching from the pain you okay ivy said her grip on my arm hurting as she pulled me up my skin felt as if someone had forced sand through my pores she let go when i winced but she didnt look much better than i felt her cheek swelling and dirt caked on her entire right side great how about you i snatched my bag up from the grimy floor and faced the two assassins ill live she said darkly which is more than i can say for them yeah i felt the same way and i stifled a groan as i stepped forward with ivy ready to take them on if they wouldnt just go away somehow looking at them i didnt think they would i took a breath to let them have it hesitating when the faint sound of rumbling echoed up through our feet a soft pattering of dust sifted down and the two elves looked up the one whod hit the support looked terrified pointing up he turned and ran the way wed come in hey come back here i shouted as the other one bolted after him jenks darted up his face scared out he shrilled the sound of rumbling growing louder run what was all i had time for and then the earth moved my balance left me and i reached out for something anything to keep from falling chunks of concrete dropped where the elves had been ivy danced somehow staying on her feet as i clung to another rusty ceiling pole its falling jenks screamed the only thing not moving in the suddenly choking air wobbling ivy grabbed my arm and we staggered to the door the ground quit moving and we broke into a run earthquake i guessed as we found trent dazed and numb in the middle of his fallen circle that hat of his slipping off and my chalk loose in his grip were on a thousandyearold swamp ivy said no fault lines here run jenks shouted its not over yet i grabbed trents suitcase and we all ran for the brownpainted door getting three steps before a wave of dusty dirt rolled over us clogging our lungs and making our eyes tear the lights went out and the earth shook again choking i felt my way forward squinting past trent and following ivy as she threw stuff out of our way there she shouted and the dim light of the sun spilled in the ground gave a hiccup and noise crashed down making me cower hand on trents arm i yanked him forward as he hunched over and coughed we spilled out of the earth in a cloud of dust running several feet before stopping to turn and stare at the opening damn maybe i shouldnt have swung that guy into the support pole theyre getting away i said hands on my knees as i pointed to the dusty elves a short distance up the walk seeing us they turned and ran chicken let them go ivy said and i turned to her trying to ignore trent throwing up in the nearby bushes i owe them some hurt i said tugging my shoulder bag back up where it belonged damn it trent i shouted pulling him up from where he was wiping his mouth with the red ribbon hed pulled from his shoulders i told you to find ivy not go hide in a hole in the ground i cant keep you alive if you dont listen to me leave him alone ivy said tugging my arm off trent her eyes on the sky and her lips parted i was bleeding and i looked at my hand in horror flexing my fingers until i realized that it wasnt my blood staining my fingers but trents his right bicep was soaked where i had been yanking him forward his ears too had blood leaking from them and his hand was red when he wiped his mouth it only made me angrier damn it he was hurt you are my responsibility i shouted ticked if you ever do something like that again ill kill you myself do you hear me trent glared at me as he wiped his mouth with that ribbon then let it fall youre not my keeper he said his green eyes vivid reminding me of the elf who had almost killed me lulled me to my death right now i am i shouted getting in his face deal with it rachel will you shut up jenks exclaimed we have a bigger problem i suddenly realized trent had gone white faced and like both jenks and ivy was now staring at the river turning i felt my mouth drop open oh i said the sound of the approaching sirens taking on new meaning i didnt think i needed to worry about having left the scene of an accident the cops both the is and the fib had something bigger to worry about the arch was not there anymore sort of the legs were mostly there but the rest of it was in housesize chunks between the shattered posts my stomach clenched and i looked at the bunker realizing what had happened this wasnt my fault i said softly but my voice was quavering as if i didnt believe it maybe we should get out of here jenks suggested good idea ivy said forget the rental they have tracking charms built into the framework and no one is going to be looking for you now nodding i grabbed trents sleeve and tugged him into motion theyve probably got a tracking charm on my moms by now too i can find any bug jenks said then flew up when trent shuffled to his wheeled suitcase and limped silently beside me we came out from the sunken sidewalk together and joined the walking wounded heading against the wash of help flowing into the park from the surrounding city for once our dusty and bloody appearance was unremarked upon we were walking and there were lots of people who werent no way did a single support beam falling cause this it had been the two elves and that magic that id pushed back into them this was not my fault and as i remembered the children playing on the grass i vowed that the withons were going to pay with interest seven the faint smell of cinnamon blood and wine drifted forward from the backseat despite the fact that all the windows were down my elbow was propped up on the sill and my hair was a tangled mess jenks was on the rearview mirror his wings flat against his back to keep them from being torn to tatters ivy was driving we were an hour out of st louis and no one was happy i would have asked ivy if shed mind if i rolled mine up but her grip on the wheel was tight and her eyes were halfway to black slowly edging into hunger my chest hurt and i wrapped my arm around my middle staring out at the wholelotofnothing we were passing through the sun shifted as we took a slow turn from the back where trent sulked a new burst of blood and cinnamon grew as the warmth found him ivy swallowed hard that we hadnt stopped to give him a chance to change his clothes told me she was scared i exchanged a worried look with jenks trent had tried to clean up but there was only so much that bottled water and fastfood napkins could do dried blood cracked and flaked from the absorbent black cloth hed tied around his bicep it looked like a shoepolishing rag and i was sure hed gotten it from his suitcase thrown into the backseat before we tore out of st louis at least his face was clean even his ears where the blood had dripped down he had been bleeding from his ears what had they tried to do to him i shifted my foot scraping against the fastfood bag half full of candy wrappers coffee cups and water bottles the scent of fries mixed with that of dried blood somehow reminding me of my prom id be hungry except my stomach was knotting over the news coming out of st louis experts claim that an adhesive that dissolves in salt water is to blame the woman on the radio said her voice a mix of urgent drama and calm journalism this saltwaterdissolving adhesive is routinely used in major road construction in nofrost zones outside the coastlines and its thought that the salt used to deice the nearby sidewalks soaked into the soil eating away at the foundation over the years until todays disastrous toll saltdissolving adhesive i thought darkly that was inderland speak for a magic misfire no need to scare the humans despite all the integration wed achieved the equality that we managed there were still secrets still hidden ugliness jenkss wings hummed from the rearview mirror anyone mind if i change the station he asked theyre just repeating themselves now his tone was heavy and i looked at ivy she was the one whod turned it on from the back trent sighed finishing off a bottle of flavored water enhanced with b vitamins and complex amino acids or something capping it and tossing it to the front for me to jam in with the rest of the trash ivy clicked off the radio her motions just shy of vampiric speed i squinted out the window in the new silence as i shoved the bottle in the trash not really seeing the gently rolling grasslands they looked hot under the lengthening afternoon sun and i wished i had my sunglasses to cut the glare id put on trents but hed probably want them back and i didnt know what to think of him anymore the third assassin hadnt been at the car when wed stumbled back to it neither trent ivy or jenks had asked what happened and i wasnt about to admit especially to trent that id almost died i hadnt known elven magic could be so insidiously deadly and a new wariness or respect maybe had me quietly thinking depressed i hoisted my shoulder bag with its earlywarning amulet higher onto my lap the leyline amulet glowing briefly when it fell into my auras influence thanks to them jenks had looked for and found the explosive charm stuck to the car before it blew and then the bug theyd put on it in case we found the bomb ivy had been ticked trent impressed it was the bug that had prompted ivy to take southwest instead of jumping on ticking off trent whose ultimate destination was seattle i wasnt going to seattle i was going to san francisco the deal was the west coast in two days not seattle i turned to look at the man wondering if he could sing hows your shoulder i asked hed missed a smear of blood just under his hairline and i forced my attention from it i could see it in peekaboo snatches when the wind hit him just right trents sour expression shifted to one of irritation better he said the word clipped i dont think im bleeding through my pores anymore from the corner of my eye i saw ivy tighten her grip on the wheel her frenchmanicured nails catching the light jenks hummed his wings in worry and i took an uneasy breath sorry i said shortly wondering if i should ask ivy to stop you care trent muttered no i said resettling myself to look out the front but i told quen id keep you alive even when you do stupid stuff like hide in a hole instead of finding ivy like i told you to i wasnt aware that keeping your word was important to you he mocked my eyes narrowed jenks shook his head warning me not to rise to the bait but i couldnt help it it is i said eying my nails there was blood under my cuticles trents and thats why you refuse to take my familiar mark off trent asked ivy exhaled loudly and i looked sideways at him i dont trust you i said duh seeing my irritation trent put his leg across his knee and lounged in the backseat like it was a limo the sun in his hair and eyes as he looked out at the hot flat view how could someone with a bloody rag around their arm look that confident because he could sing someone to death thats patently obvious he said softly almost like a rebuke but you did agree i huffed and turned back around like you hold to all your agreements i do he said quickly agreementsand threats jenkss expression had gone dark ivy too was clenching her jaw the scent of cinnamon and wine grew stronger trent might look calm but he was losing it on the inside i might not have noticed it last year but after spending almost a day with him i could now then why havent you killed me huh i said turning and holding myself back from the seat so i could look at him square on go for it you little spot of sunshine i just beat off three assassins one by myself im stronger than you and you know it i smiled insincerely it bothers you doesnt it you rely on quen far too much his eyes flicked to mine then away thats not it at all he said mildly the wind playing in his hair showing that smear of blood again is so i said and jenks cleared his throat youre lucky i pushed that magic back into those idiots and got them to back off there was enough there to kill both of us irritation crossed his face so quick i wasnt sure it even existed thats not what i meant he said dabbing a bloody cloth against an ear obviously youre more capable than i in magic its why i wanted to hire you in the first place he said making it sound like an insult the deal was that i give you until the witches conference to resolve this issue i made a well face at him and he snarkily added we arent there yet youve got a day or two before i start trying to kill you again my mouth dropped open from behind me jenks coughed covering up a laugh i just saved your life i said loudly anger spilling into my voice again will you two stop bickering ivy suddenly said and i flicked a look at her seeing her about ready to lose it the blood the anger it was adding up trent had pissed me off and i was filling the car with it i wasnt done but for ivy id shut my mouth screw you trent i said as i flopped back into my seat in hindsight it might not have been the best thing to do since ivy took a deep breath and shuddered im just saying trent started his voice cutting off as ivy put on the blinker we hadnt seen a car in miles but she flicked it on and took the exit ramp right before the interstate rose to go over a grasscovered road running north and south uh ivy i asked trent too had put both feet on the floor and sat up straight id almost say he was worried im good ivy jenks chimed in the guy had a bladder the size of a pinhead im not ivy looked at trent through the rearview mirror you stink i looked over the seat wincing at the sight of his bloodsoaked shirtsleeve and the wad of red tissue he had pressed against his ear again sorry he said sourly didnt mean to offend youre not offensive she said shortly youre turning me on get out clean up i turned back around mouth shut tires popping on pebbles ivy pulled onto a seldomused road bracketed by two deserted gas stations and a derelict fastfood joint slowing she made a beeline across the grassy pavement to the station with the least weeds she brought the car to a halt sideways to the faded parking lines and put it in park sighing she turned the engine off silence and crickets took over it was four according to my cell phone but it felt like five somewhere wed crossed a time line where are we jenks looked up through the strip of bluetinted glass at a faded sign saint clair the sound of trents door opening was loud and above us a car drove by on the interstate good he said as he got out with a wince to peer at it thats going under the expressway if we take that we can hit i in an hour and cut twenty hours out of the drive ivy leaned back and closed her eyes im not driving on a twolane road not out here in the abandoned stretches and not after dark youre afraid trent mocked jenks rose up and down in nervousness but ivy just settled deeper into the sun absolutely she said softly and i bobbed my head totally agreeing with her i didnt want to get off the interstate either there were bad things in the empty stretches especially out west where thered been less of a population to begin with release the trunk will you trent said clearly not going to push the issue while trent shuffled to the back of the car i began gathering the trash i dont remember anyone buying milk duds be quick about it ivy said loudly as she reached for a lever and popped the trunk and dont go in the building for water ive got wet wipes in the outside pocket of my bag i know better than to knock on doors trent said feeling his jaw as he pulled his suitcase out and moved to the back of the car i watched him in the sideview mirror until the lid of the trunk lifted blocking my view fidgeting i finished shoving trash into one bag i didnt believe his crack about trying to kill me but i was going to have to make good on our deal at some point here in the middle of nowhere might be better than in the middle of san francisco with witches breathing down my neck i didnt trust him but now was better than later it might get him to shut up too ivy i said as i grabbed my shoulder bag do we have twenty minutes you gotta pee too jenks guessed darting outside the window to warm himself in the sun tinks panties i dont know why it takes you women so long he said from outside maybe because we dont have to do it every twenty minutes i suggested hey he said indignantly but ivy had opened her eyes waiting for an explanation i want to take care of his familiar mark i said almost angry feeling guilty she said eyes closing no i said quickly and im not afraid of him killing me but it will give him one less thing to bitch about ivys lips quirked and the sun hit her fully if it will shut him up take an hour all i need is twenty minutes sublimely aware of trent rustling in the back i got out with my bag in one hand the trash in the other using my foot to shut the door jenks lifted high to do a perimeter and looking at the abandoned gas station i sighed yellowed weeds grew in the cracks but there was a nice bit of concrete under the gas station overhang that was likely the best spot to make a circle and i did want this done in a circle rachel ivy called and i turned to see her leaning across the front seat to my window find out why the withons are trying to kill him will you she whispered her brown eyes going darker were going to hit desert soon thats a lot of space for bad things to happen in squinting from the sun i followed her gaze to the lifted trunk lid and settled my bag on my shoulder the memory of the attack outside st louis sifted through me and then my nearly succumbing to wild magic and then the arch falling on us it was a far cry from the assassins in my kitchen and i wanted to know myself it was times like this when i missed pierce hed probably threaten trent with a curse and be done with it which wasnt much better than trent but i did appreciate his results i had to be more circumspect for my answers nodding i started for the back of the car jenks was sitting on the rim of the upraised trunk talking to trent and upon seeing the man i stopped blinking in appreciation trent had his shirt off wadded up and in a pile at his feet his suitcase was open but he quickly shut it when my shadow touched him a wad of wet towelettes was in his hand and his skin was glistening in the sun where hed wiped himself down damn he looked good lots of definition and not a single tan line not to mention the sixpack abs disappearing into a pair of faded jeans murdering drug lord biodrug dealer pretty like a toxin his expression cross trent dropped the used wipes on his bloodstained shirt and snatched up the one draped over my garment bag what he said shortly and i flushed sitting on the highest part of the hood his feet dangling down jenks sighed i need something from my bag i said as i dropped the trash into the nearby fiftyfivegallon drum and edged closer shoving trent down with my mere presence i pulled my scrying mirror from the side pocket of my carryon the rest of the cursefive candles magnetic chalk finger stick transfer media and stick of redwoodwas in my bag it was a simple curse really im tired of you bitching at me i said jamming my carryon bag back where it had been im going to take care of your familiar mark right now here trent said the sun making his surprise easy to see thats generally what right now means yes unless you want to do it in a car going ninety miles an hour down the interstate his motion to wrangle a black tshirt on across his shoulders was fast now is fine he said as it settled over him not too tight not too loose oh my god he looked good unaware that i was watching his hair was mussed where hed tried to slick it back after wiping off the blood and it was all i could do not to reach out and smooth it my hand gripped the scrying mirror tighter as he tucked the black cotton shirt behind his waistband in a move that was both casual and intimate upon noticing my eyes on him he stopped a mistrustful wariness coming over him motions sharp he zipped his suitcase closed and slammed the trunk shut what can i do to help he asked you help jenks said flying since trent had shut the trunk out from under him youre the reason were in this trouble the day we need your help relax jenks i interrupted sure trent had sicced the coven on me but he wasnt the one getting filmed being dragged down the street by a demon jenks made a hum of discontent and i gripped my scrying mirror tighter it feeling slippery in the sun thereve got to be pixies here i said leaning to look at the gas station overhang can you talk to them find out where the local big bad uglies are so i dont do my magic on their doorstep face screwing up jenks shifted his wings in sullen affirmation his hand rose to slap his bicep to make sure he had on his red bandanna then dropped to rest on the butt of his sword again on his hip thanks to ivy sure he said buzzing off with a noisy wing clatter tinks a disney whore rache why dont you start thinking with something other than your hormones hey i shouted after him stiffening when he was suddenly surrounded by pixies in brown shirts and pants they had spears pointed at him but they soon dropped them and he went with them willingly slowly i exhaled trent scuffed his boots and i looked over the abandoned gas station a car went by looking a thousand miles away on the overpass hiking my shoulder bag up i headed for the manmade shade of the overhang trent moved to stay with me dropping his bloody shirt and wet wipes into the trash can along the way ah i should apologize for not doing this sooner i said feeling a pang of guilt you were scared trent said his lofty attitude making my eyes narrow im not talking about yesterday i said tartly guilt vanishing i mean the last two months al wouldnt tell me the curse and it took me a while to find it trent glanced at me his pace going stiff its a new curse he stated flatly i thought you would simply untwist the one you put on me i didnt curse you i said sharply i took ownership of the one minias claimed you with but dont worry this one wont hurt ill take the smut crap im taking his smut ah he started and i scuffed to a halt my toes edging shadow as i squinted at him in the sun damn he looked good in that tshirt and looked even better out of it stop it rachel im not going to ask you to pay for it i said tired im so covered with smut that this little bit wont show on you though i slipped under the gas stations overhang appreciating the cooler temp we dont want to jeopardize your bid for mayor do we okay that might have been catty but everything about this bothered me pulling my magnetic chalk out i dropped my shoulder bag hows that going anyway i asked as i set my scrying mirror beside it the weres have had the mayoral seat for over fifteen years trent edged under the overhang his eyes on the holes in the roof not as well as id like he said a practiced polish coming across with his words as if he had been saying it a lot lately im writing off the were demographic theres been a marked increase in registered were voters in the last two months which will make things difficult if i knew it was an intentional block by you id be irritated he went silent spinning to keep me in his sight as i walked around him bent almost double to trace a circle on the dirty concrete straightening i kicked out an old pop can and sank to the ground his eyebrows rose and i shrugged have a seat i said indicating a spot about four feet in front of me still silent he bent his knees and found his way to the ground in a graceful move that was as far away from the boardroom as his present clothes were he had an almost animallike grace now that he wasnt in a suit and something twisted in me stop it rachel jenks was right i thought way too much with my hormones but seeing trent sitting crosslegged in jeans that thin black tshirt and bloodsplattered boots i was struck by how quickly the businessman was slipping away it kind of worried meeven as i liked it trents gaze dropped from the broken roof to me and i warily shuffled my things around trying to figure out what was going through his mind hed known ceri for almost a year now and her oldschool blackmagicusing elf mentality had been rubbing off on him shed believed demon magic was a tool a dangerous tool but a tool trent had been taught to fear it much like the coven had but clearly that was changing i didnt know what he could do anymore and it moved him from a familiar threat to something i had to be wary of looking across the twolane road i whistled for jenks getting a burst of green dust signifying that we were good on the horizon the waxing moon rose in the bright light of afternoon at the car ivy was busy cleaning the backseat with her special orange wipes nervous i wiped my palms on my thighs the wind moved my hair and i tucked the strands still caked with the dust of the arch behind an ear ivy wanted to drive all night but i wanted to rent a room to shower if nothing else i felt icky i meant it when i said i didnt mean to drag this out to the last few days i said as i pawed through my bag al wouldnt tell me how to do the curse just gave me a book demon texts dont have indexes so i had to look page by page it wasnt in there but it does have a page or two with info like substitutions sun and moon tables conversions i found the index card with the latin trent was going to have to say and i handed it to him he automatically took it his expression one of surprise the curse to free a familiar was at the back with the metric to english conversions yes i said sourly i guess they dont do this often i set five candles on the cement they were from my last birthday cake how sad was that the finger stick and shaft of redwood were next i had a moment of panic until i found the vial of transfer media i could buy it sure but not anywhere near here i twisted where i sat to reach my scrying mirror setting it between us as the platform on which to do the curse trent looked at the dark winecolored hues that it reflected the world in his boots shifted he was nervous he should be you need the mirror for this he asked though it was obvious yes i said thinking the platesize piece of etched glass was beautiful for all its dark purpose etched with a stick of yew the pentagram and associated glyphs were how i accessed the demon database in the everafter it also let me chat with my demon teacher algaliarept i guess you could say it was an interdimensional cell phone that ran on black magic and since this curse needed to be registered id have to use it suddenly suspicious i asked why trents eyes fixed on mine too innocent i was remembering having used it to talk to minias it wasnt hard i flicked the top off the finger stick with my thumb and jabbed myself the brief pain was familiar and i massaged three drops of blood into the transfer media demon magic never is i said softly as they went plinking in and the expected redwood scent was quickly overshadowed by a whiff of burnt amber i glanced at trent hoping he hadnt noticed thats why you pay for it the hard way hes dead by the way minias newt killed him suddenly tired i slumped i cant get the familiar bond annulled i admitted knowing he wasnt going to be happy the best i can do is file an emancipation curse thats why i need the mirror sure enough trent clenched his jaw id still be counted a slave deal with it i exclaimed angrily eyes flicking up when i heard a pixy whisper from the roof and realized we were being watched you were caught trent you were on a demons auction block you had a little red bow around your neck and you were a commodity im sorry but you were scowling trent looked past me to the yellow grass if it helps i said softly the only reason i was able to get the familiar bond between al and me annulled was because it couldnt be enforced and before you ask if you want to go that route id have to complete the familiar bond use it and youd have to successfully beat me down after that little stunt at the arch i think we can agree that that is not going to happen i added not sure if i had the right to be so confident anymore looking as if he were swallowing slugs trent gazed past me i will be a freed slave i winced in sympathy as i rubbed at one of the candles to get the dried frosting off the upside is that no demon can ever claim you even al at least as long as im alive i added watching him as he took it in and his frown eased into a thoughtful expression it was a serendipitous bit of cya but it was true and it felt good knowing that he wouldnt be trying to kill me again ever nana nana naaaa na his response was a quiet mmmm and i wondered if he thought i was making it up leaning forward i wiped the glass clean and pressed the candle at the tip of the pentagram to trents right wiggling it a bit to get the wax to melt a little and stick soooo i drawled not looking up you want to tell me why the withons want you dead so badly that theyd drop the st louis arch on us i said and his knees shifted id sooner tell you what i wanted to be when i grew up trent said sarcastically then frowned when our eyes met it could have been the coven my hair was getting in my way and i pushed the nasty curls behind my ear to make them less obvious come on trent i said we all know the withons were after you they said as much after you left trent looked at the holes in the ceiling silent i pressed the second candle into the mirror on the point counterclockwise from the first surreptitiously eying him from under my tangled hair as i took in his tells he was nervous thats all i could determine im doing demon magic at an abandoned gas station within sight of i god no wonder they shunned me i moved to the third candle rolling it between my fingers before i wiggled it into place quen was so scared that he picked me up from the airport ready to send us out right from there in the hope of shaking the withons assassins i said and trent cleared his throat they attacked us on the interstate risking dozens of lives and then again under the arch and you knew they would i said suddenly realizing it or you wouldnt have gone to that bunker looking for that ley line when i told you to find ivy his head came up and he glared at me still refusing to say anything thats why you were so adamant that we stop there wasnt it i said leaning forward and why you went to ground you knew they were after you and you didnt trust ivy and me to hold them off you had your magic all prepped with your little hat and ribbon i accused and he held his gaze angry and after you did your magic the arch fell down it fell on us and children and dogs playing in the park trents eye twitched i didnt make it collapse he said his beautiful voice strained feeling used i set the fourth candle my hair falling onto the mirror to meet its reflection i never said you did i said but they want you dead and they want you dead now what are you trying to do that the withons will sacrifice a park full of people to prevent i looked at him thinking he appeared sharp and cold in the shadow with me people got hurt because of us killed kids trent if i hadnt gone to st louis the arch would still be standing and those kidsthose kids would still be okay i deserve to know why i said not wanting to get back in the car without an answer trent his expression a blank nothing looked into the field where the pixies were showing off for jenks its something between ellasbeth and myself he finally said reluctantly the fourth candle fell over when i let go of it and it rolled almost off the mirror before i caught it you going to kill her i asked outright my heart pounding no i felt better at the horror in his voice and he said it again as if i might not believe him no never the wind shifted his hair and i couldnt help but think he looked better now than in a thousanddollar suit silent i waited finally he grimaced and looked at his feet ellasbeth has something that belongs to me he said im going to get it she wants to keep it is all we caused a pileup on the interstate and hurt a bunch of kids over a family heirloom ring i guessed disgusted a stupid hunk of rock its not a hunk of rock trents green eyes lowered as he looked at his hands in his lap fixing on me fervently when he looked up its the direction the next generation of elves is going to take what happens in the following days will shape the next two hundred years oh really thinking that over i tried to get the candle to stick holding my breath as i let it go watching it carefully i didnt know why i was helping him i really didnt you dont believe me trent said his anger showing at last you asked why they want me dead i told you the truth and you havent said anything my gaze coming up from the mirror i looked at him from under my straggly hair i was so friggin tired it hurt the withons are trying to stop you from getting this thing so they can shape the next two hundred years of elfdom not you eh thats it trents shoulders eased at my sarcasm our marriage was supposed to be a way to avoid this if i can claim it by sunrise monday then its mine forever if not then i lose everything his expression was empty of emotion everything rachel i stifled a shiver trying to disguise it by wiggling the last candle into place so this is kind of like an ancient elven spirit quest rite of passage and closed election all in one trents lips parted uh yeyes he stammered looking embarrassed actually thats not a bad comparison its also why quen couldnt help and why air travel was out im allowed a horse and the car is the modern equivalent i nodded jumping when the fifth candle fell over and me what am i youre my mirror my sword and my shield trent said dryly i looked askance at him to see if he was serious mirror times change eh i said not sure what to think the candle wasnt sticking and i was getting frustrated i have to be in seattle by sunday or it means nothing rachel this is the most important thing in my life the candle went rolling and trent jerked his hand out catching it i froze in my reach eyes narrowing as trent breathed on the end and quickly stuck it to the mirror my gaze went to the moon pale in the sunlight maybe that was his deadline elves loved marking things by the moon i dont have to help you steal it do i i asked and he shook his head unable to hide his relief that i believed him and i did believe him if i cant claim it on my own then i dont deserve it back to the comingofage elfquest thing i want a say i said and trent blinked excuse me i lifted a shoulder and let it fall carefully spilling a bit of primed transfer media onto the mirror if im your mirror sword and shield then i want a say as to how its used ive seen you work and i dont like your way of getting things done maybe ellasbeths family would be better at directing the elven race than you trents eyes were wide you dont believe that i dont know what i believe but i want a say especially if it bothers you so much mouth moving trent finally managed you have no idea what youre asking i know i said flippantly but here we are yes or no trent looked like he was going to say no but then his posture slipped and he smiled i agree he said lightly extending his hand over the scrying mirror you have a say his eyes were glinting like als but my hand went out and we shook over the prepared curse his fingers were warm in mine pleasant and i pulled away fast why do i feel like ive made a mistake i muttered and trents smile widened worrying me more rachel ive been trying to get you involved for two years if this is how im going to get my foot in the door then so be it his eyes went down to the curse is it ready crap had i just gone into a partnership with him feeling ill i nodded taking up the stick of redwood and dipping it in the primed transfer media i made a quick counterclockwise movement before touching the tip of it to the back of trents hand then mine making a symbolic connection between us trent frowned at the damp spot on his hand as if wanting to wipe it off and i set the stick down beside my bag with a snap dont wipe that off i said sharply still uneasy because of his last comment and put your hand on the mirror pleasewithout touching any of the glyphs or knocking over the candles he hesitated and i set my hand down first making sure my thumb and pinky were on the center glyphs for connection the cool stillness of the glass seemed to seep up into meuntil trents fingers touched the etched mirror jerking i met his startled gaze sure hed felt the zing of energy leaving him youre connected to a ley line i asked not needing to see his nod um let go of it i said and the faint seepage of power ceased thank you satisfied everything was set i reached behind me with my free hand to touch the ring of chalk rhombus i said wincing as my awareness found the nearest ley line it was all the way back in st louis thin and weak from the distance but it would be enough warmth textured with silver poured into me and trent sucked in his breath in surprise connected to the line by way of the mirror a moleculethin sheet of everafter rose up arching both overhead and underneath within the earth forming a sphere of protection nothing stronger than air could pass through except energy itself the sheet was colored with the gold of my original aura but the demon smut id accumulated over the last couple of years crawled over it like arcs of unbalanced power looking for a way in at night it wasnt so noticeable but out here in the sun it was ugly looking up trent grimaced nothing youve not seen before mr clean looking up at a car on the interstate i took a deep breath there was no better time to do this but i wasnt comfortable trent too looked uneasily at the forces balancing between us and i dampened the flow until his shoulders relaxed my thoughts went to the energy id shoved into the assassins under the arch there was no way all of that had come from trent but i didnt think it had come from the assassins either what had he been doing with that little cap and ribbon okay i said starting to fidget whats going to happen is that im going to light four of the candles then you say your words ill register the curse and were done trents gaze flicked from the index card to me thats it i nodded and his attention went to the candles there are five candles do i light that one no it will light on its own if we do it right the wind brought the sound of pixy laughter to me recognizable but faster and higher than jenkss kids and i inhaled slowly a quiver went through me id never shown anyone outside my friends that i could do demon magic but trent was looking at his card squinting as if he didnt care what does it say he finally asked a flush warmed me um bella usually means beautiful doesnt it trent scrunched his face up clearly not knowing either but i bet hed find out thirty seconds after he got to his phone you want to wait until i find out i asked already knowing the answer and sure enough he shook his head it doesnt matter i want the mark off now yeah me too jittery i looked at the candles hoping theyd stayed put the curse didnt physically change anything or break the laws of physics so the smut would be minimal nature didnt care about the laws of demons or men only her own break them and you pay ex cathedra i said carefully scraping a bit of wax off the first candle at trents right and holding it under my nail i didnt need a focusing object most days but i wanted no mistakes in front of trent thinking consimilis calefacio to light the candle i pinched the wick and slowly opened my fingers to leave a new flame ex cathedra from the office of authority i hoped my pronunciation was right it wouldnt mess up the curse if i was off but this curse would be registered in the demon database and word would get around lighting the candle had taken an almost minuscule drop of leyline force and i met trents startled gaze ceri knows how to light candles like that too he said shes the one who taught me i admitted and trents frown deepened guess she hadnt taught him rogo i said lighting the second candle on my left i am asking i thought watching until i was sure the flame wasnt going to go out trent cleared his throat at the rising power and the hair on my arms pricked mutatis mutandis i said lighting the candle to my right continuing my counterclockwise motion counterclockwise this was really wrong but it was for a good reason things to be changed libertus i said as i lit the candle to trents left almost completing the circle just one right in front of him to go and if it didnt light on its own then i was in trouble read your card i said as i stared at the unlit candle and for gods little green apples dont blow anything out in the process much to his credit trent didnt lick his lips or give any indication that he was nervous and with a smooth enviable accent said si qua bella inciderint vobis ausilum feram i felt a sinking of self and my hand pressed firmly into the glass it was as if the world had dropped out from under me and i was suddenly not just under an abandoned buildings overhang in the middle of nowhere but also in the theoretical black database in the everafter i could hear whispers of demons talking through their own scrying mirrors sense the bright flash of a curse being registered the double sensations were confusing and my eyes had closed but they opened when trent roughly said nothing happened dizzy i tried to focus on him and the fear behind his anger clearly he wasnt feeling the same thing i was its not done yet i have to register it heart pounding i closed my eyes praying this wasnt going to swing around to bite me on the ass evulgo i stiffened as a flare of everafter shot through me and my eyes opened at trents hiss keep your hand on the glass i warned him the four candles went out the thin trails of smoke and the scent of sulfur rising like curls of thought to heaven my gaze went to the asyetunlit candle please please please relief pulled the corners of my mouth up as the last candle burst into flame covering the scent of honest sulfur with the acidic biting scent of burnt amber i pay the cost i whispered as i glanced at trent even before the smut could rise trent grunted his free hand clutching his shoulder where the familiar mark was a wave of unseen force pulsed out from me breaking my circle as it passed through pressing the pixies into the air and heading out in an everwidening circle from inside the abandoned building something crashed to the floor still holding his arm trent looked to the gaping windows i let go of the ley line and took my hand from the scrying mirror it was done for better or worse and i lifted my head and took a deep breath i didnt know what trent would do and it was scary from the car ivy called out you good trents face was empty of emotion as he turned where he sat and pulled his sleeve up twisting to see on his arm where the mark washad beeni hoped good i called out to ivy my voice cracking im good i said louder and she slumped back into the seat shed felt it that was curious trent made a small noise his expression ugly what is that he exclaimed his face becoming red as he twisted to show me his arm and my lips parted the demon mark was gone but in its place was a dark discoloration of skin that looked like a birthmark a birthmark in the shape of a smiley face all it needed was the phrase have a nice day tattooed under it a mild panic hit me this was so not fair i had done the charmcursewhateverright and i still ended up looking like a fool what is that he demanded the flush rising to his ears from the open field the pixies rose high then back down uh it looks like a birthmark i said really its not that bad is this your idea of a joke he exclaimed i didnt know it was going to do that i admitted voice rising as i shifted to a kneel my foot hit the mirror and the candles all fell over the one going out in a puff of smoke maybe its so the demons know to keep their mitts off you oh my god it looked like a smiley face he sniffed at it it stinks he said it smells like a dandelion i closed my eyes in a long blink but he was still there when i opened them trent im sorry i apologized hoping he believed me i didnt know maybe you can add a tattoo to it make it something more butch trent wouldnt look at me as he got to his feet his boots scraping on the cement this is clearly the best you can do he said shortly we have to get going youre welcome i said peeved that that was all i was going to get out of him his becoming my familiar had only been to save his little elf ass for my trouble id gotten my head bashed into a tombstone and now that id gone and added more smut to my soul to break said familiar bond incidentally giving more ammunition to the coven of moral and ethical standards to use to prove that i was a black witch all i got was we have to get going have a nice day i called snidely after him as i shoved everything into my shoulder bag standing i started to follow the sun hit me like a heavy wind and i bowed my head wishing i had another pair of sunglasses they might have a pair in the gas station but i wasnt going in to look and i wasnt going to give trent his back either trents pace was stiff as he walked to the car i turned to the nearby field squinting for jenks not a wing caught the light or broke the stillness and a sliver of worry colored my anger do i smell better i heard trent ask ivy sarcastically as he got in the back of the car i liked the way you smelled before trent that was the problem i dumped the candles transfer media and finger stick into the barrel with trents bloody shirt and our trash tapping a line i made the appropriate leyline gesture and with the final words leno cinis i threw a ball of unfocused energy in on top to get the entire thing burning flame whooshed up fueled by my anger as well as the demon curse ivy looked at me through the open window her eyebrows high as i destroyed any evidence of us and the curse without a word she started the car hands on my hips i looked to the field for jenks a sneeze tickled my nose and i let it come hearing it echo against the broken buildings my eyes narrowed and sure enough i sneezed again there was only one reason i sneezed more than twice in a row and i held my breath until the third one ripped through me damn it was al maybe hed felt the familiar emancipation curse being registered ivy we got a minute i asked as i tossed my bag in through the open door then sat down sideways with my feet still on the cracked cement she knew what my sneezing meant too a minute still reclining she honked the horn jenks lets go the tightening in my gut eased as jenks flew up a veritable cloud of pretty dresses and flashing wings left hovering forlornly over the meadow crap on toast the pixy said his long hair loose and looking disheveled as he straightened his clothes i think i almost got married there was a flash of red on his feet and as i placed the scrying mirror on my knees i blinked in surprise where did you get the boots jenks you like them he said as he landed on the glass to show them off me too i told them about you and they gave them to me they think im some kind of wandering storyteller and it was either take these or the nasty honey made from sedge flowers he made a face his angular features twisting up dramatically what does al want i sneezed in the middle of saying three guesses and he took off flying to the back to show his boots to trent im coming i shouted at al as i placed my hand on the center glyph and tapped into the ley line feet in the sun i set my thoughts on algaliarept his ruddy complexion his overdone british accent his cruelty his crushed green velvet coat his cruelty his voice and his cruelty he was nice to me but he really was a depraved sadisticdemon cant you do this while were on the road trent asked from the backseat al i said aloud when i felt the connection form to the demon collective and my thought winged away to be immediately answered a second consciousness expanded mine and i heard jenks clatter his wings you ever see anything freakier than that he said to trent yes about three minutes ago trent answered back what in the arcane are you doing came als unusually angry thought within mine and shoved away the whisper imagery of him either cleaning his spelling kitchen or tearing it apart filing an emancipation curse i said aloud so ivy and jenks could hear half the conversation and before you start what i do with my familiars is my business do you have any idea what youve done al shouted and i winced please tell me you didnt teach him anything al hesitated did you i shook my head even though al couldnt see it i didnt teach trent anything not even respect i said and i felt al sigh in relief itchy witch al thought his dark musings seeming to insert themselves into my head theres a reason we kill familiars when were done with them hes got a new mark doesnt he his familiar mark turned into a smiley face i said feeling myself warm from the backseat jenks exclaimed no way let me see and trents negative growl damn my dame al thought seeming to fall back into ceris comfortable chair by the small hearth in his kitchen if i was interpreting his emotions right you did it correctly nice going rachel hey youre the one who gave me the recipe i shot back thinking the modern phrase sounded funny coming from the oldworldcharm demon i gave that one to you because its bloody impossible and i thought you wouldnt be able to do it he exclaimed loud enough to give me a headache you just made trent able to call any demon without fear of being snatched nice going fingers pressed to the glass to maintain our link i looked back at trent so you can still smack him around cant you i said and the demon chuckled making me shiver technically no but thats a matter of interpretation i pushed my fingers into my forehead tired of it all demons their societys rules were not worth the blood they were written with unless you had the personal power to force everyone to abide by them but the snatching thing that was probably ironclad what did you say jenks asked belligerently hey youre talking and not telling us thats rude rache tell you later i said turning to look at ivy her hands on the wheel as she waited she looked worried hell i knew i was look i wasnt going to use him as a familiar i said to al and now hes going to help get my shunning removed the part about the west coast elves trying to cack him id keep to myself not because it made this look more dangerous but because al wouldnt care hed just as soon see me fail if i lost our bet id be living with him in the everafterhence the reason he wouldnt just pop me over there trenton aloysius kalamack al thought a tweak of magic running through me when he lit a candle why you going to be his little demon in return for his vouching for your sterling character dove absolutely not i said with a huff trents on some elf quest i promised id see him to the west coast is all im his mirror sword and shield all in one it was a deal al just because i can break them with impunity doesnt mean i will youre on an elf quest jenks said loudly and trent sighed you shitting me you make the most interesting mistakes my itchy witch al thought and i didnt care if he could sense me slump in relief if he was back to calling me itchy witch we were okay dont teach him anything he finished nothing not a problem i said and lifted my hand breaking the connection before algaliarept caught my first whisper of unease dont teach him anything al had said like how to free a familiar maybe too late eight the hum of the engine shifted becoming deeper it stirred my unconsciousness waking me more than the bright sun determined to wedge itself under my eyelids beyond the cover of my coat draped over me it was cold so i didnt move somewhere between ohio and texas the cinnamon and wine smell of elf had joined the familiar scent of vampire and witch mixing with the leather of my coat under that was the faint hint of lilac perfume evidence of my mom lingering yet in the cushions of the backseat of her car it was relaxing and i lingered dozing and slumped against the door if i woke up id have to move and i was stiff from riding in the car for the last twentyfour hours a sigh that wasnt mine moved me and i jerked awake crap i wasnt slumped against the door i was leaning against ivy great i thought carefully sitting up and trying not to wake her i wasnt being phobic but i didnt want a misunderstanding her eyes opened as i pulled away and i met her sleepy expression with my own taking my coat and covering her up where my warmth had been against her ivys smile turned sly even as her eyes closed again and i shivered at the slip of teeth the clock on the dash said it was about nine way too early for me to be up jenks must have changed it to central time scooting to my side of the backseat i flicked my attention to jenks sitting on the rearview mirror he had on a new red coat i didnt recognize matching his boots seeing me look at them jenks shrugged and continued his conversation with trent about financial trends and how they parallel the size of successful pixy broods i vaguely remembered hearing them talking in my dreams and i sat there ignored as i tried to figure out what was going on the last thing i remembered was ivy stopping for gas and trent waking up from his midnight nap to take over the driving wed been in oklahoma and it had been dark flat and starless now as i sat slumped in the back and blinked at the bright sun i wondered where we were the terrain had changed again gone was the sedge that had dotted the dry rolling plains and turned everything in the distance into a pale green carpet it was true desert now the vegetation dry and sparse under the glaring sun and cloudless sky the colors were thin and washed out tans whites with a hint of mauve and silver id never seen such a lack of anything before but instead of making me uneasy it was restful my mouth tasted ugly and i checked my phone my brain still fuzzy as it tried to work without caffeine id missed another call from bis and i frowned concerned hed be asleep now but if it was anything important the pixies would call jenks bis was probably just checking on me again still worried about me having pulled on st louiss line so heavily hed called yesterday shortly before sundown throwing me until i realized it was dark where he was but what bothered me now was that hed felt me pull on a line when hed been asleep trents voice was pleasant as he talked to jenks and i tucked my phone away wondering what it might feel like to have that voice directed at me i was not crushing on him but it was hard not to appreciate a man who was rich sexy and powerful trent was all of that and scum too but the respect in his tone as he talked to jenks was surprising respect or perhaps camaraderie but trent and jenks were a lot alike in many ways stuff that went beyond their similar sleep schedules jenks had the same frontierjustice mentality that irritated me when i saw it in trent i knew jenks killed fairies to protect his family and i didnt think any the less of him ivy too had killed people to survive until she had managed to escape piscary i was sure pierce had though he hadnt told me of any except the four hundred innocents in eleison dead because of his previous lack of skill everyone made sacrifices of some kind to save what was important to them maybe trent had a lot more things that were important to him than most people where are we i said softly as i pulled on my boots not liking where my thoughts had taken me i felt fuzzy like id been asleep a long time jenks shifted to face me his wings catching the light and sending snatches of it about the car about an hour outside albuquerque albuquerque as in new mexico youre kidding i said scooting forward to drape my arms over the passenger seat into the front there was a fastfood bag on the floor no it was a takeout bag from a chain of high priced gourmet eateries what time is it i asked looking at the clock on the dash and where did you get the red coat jenks nice isnt it he said rising up to show it off i got it when trent picked up some breakfast around sunup all i had to do was tell a story and the pixy girls gave it to me i dont know what time it is anymore my internal clock is all screwed up trent glanced at me his eyes showing the strain of too much driving we crossed into another time zone the clock is right but i feel like its eleven im tired i did the math and i looked at the speedometer seeing it was a mere sixtyeight miles per hour holy crap i exclaimed then lowered my voice when ivy moved how fast have you been driving jenkss wings hummed as he returned to the rearview mirror ninety mostly silent i turned to trent seeing a smile lifting his lips i have to make up the time somewhere he said you sleep a lot and the roads were empty i tried to stretch by pressing my palms into the roof of the car but that wasnt doing it i dont sleep any more than you do i said as i collapsed back over the seat i just dont have to do it every twelve hours trent raised an eyebrow and i added you want to stop for some breakfast maybe rent a room for a shower or something lunch jenks said brightly we ate at sunup i stifled a smile at jenkss satisfaction from the backseat came ivys low gravelly im hungry and trent smoothly took the next exit the offramp clean of debris indicating that it was well used and likely had civilization at the end of it though the space between the cities was mostly abandoned there were clusters of oddballs for gas and food holding back the emptiness breakfast for the witch and the vamp it is trent said sounding like he was in a good mood relaxed almost i ran my eyes over his clothes seeing that hed changed into a pair of dark slacks at some point not jeans but still casual his boots were gone and softsoled shoes had taken their place id be willing to bet they were still pricey but the shine was gone the businessman was vanishing being replaced bysomething else quen i thought as i slumped back into my seat might not be pleased good jenks said as ivy pulled herself together i gotta pee maybe get me a red hat or something i gotta call my kids too taking up a new profession jenks i asked and he slipped a silver dust i like the color he said flushing and where else am i going to get new clothes my gaze went to the weird landscape as i thought of matalina most pixies died of heartache when their spouses passed but jenks had lived partly due to a demon curse that had accidentally given him a new lease on life and partly due to his desire to see beyond what was real and into what might be he had spent half his life breaking pixy traditions learning about both the grief and the reward that came from taking chances matalina had told him to live and somewhere hed found the courage to do it it was the smaller things like who was going to make his clothes or cut his curly hair that tripped him up the obvious choice would be one of his daughters but the thought had probably never occurred to him i slumped as trent pulled into the single cluster of buildings on the right sporting a tidylooking gas station a small motel and an eatery the southwestern flavor made everything look alien tires popping on gravel trent parked in front of the long low restaurant behind us a green twodoor pinto slowly turned into the lot and parked at the outskirts hey look who caught up jenks said wheezing slightly as he landed on my shoulder alarmed i turned to look closer relaxing when i recognized the woman it was vivian the youngest member of the coven of moral and ethical standards of the five remaining members i liked vivian the best and might even count her as a friend if circumstances were different shed given me a bit of blackmail to use against oliver and had enough guts to think on her own she drove a pinto id put her down as a bmw kind of girl i saw her at the airport too ivy said sleepily im surprised she found us at all hey i got all the bugs off jenks said in a huff dont look at me i eagerly opened my door and the new air coming into the car smelled of dry grass my faint headache seemed to ease vivian was a concern but if shed wanted me dead she would have done something by now the woman was lethal despite her diminutive looks and childlike voice think we should go talk to her i said and trent stared at me like i had lobsters crawling out of my ears you think you can knock her out buy some time to slip away from her trent asked totally misreading my words i snorted and even jenks laughed vivian is not the one trying to kill us i said as i gathered up the trash and the last thing i want to do is lose her they might give the job of tailing us to someone else someone more likely to throw spells and ask questions later no vivian and i understood each other and that was more conducive to a good nights sleep than a cauldron of sleep charms even so i was glad she hadnt been around when id done the demon curse to free trent that would have been hard to explain trent opened his door and the breeze went right through the car you do make the oddest friends rachel you want me to buzz her anyway jenks asked pix her maybe i shoved another empty box of milk duds in the garbage who is eating the milk duds i glanced at trent and ivy and seeing that they were leaving it to me i shook my head good jenks said from my shoulder the elevation is kicking my ass i cant fly worth a tinkers damn i carefully got out catching my hair before it could hit jenks vivian had her head against the steering wheel as if exhausted her straight blond hair falling to hide her face she was alone and therefore likely hopped up on a charm or a spell shed pay for it later bigtime trent will you pop the trunk ivy said standing beside it im going to shower i plucked my chemise away from my skin thinking a shower sounded fantastic breathing deeply i took in the air tasting the differences my body felt like it was almost noon but the sun wasnt that far above the horizon nine oclock and the sun was already warm as it hit my shoulders it felt good to be warm and i squinted at the distant horizon missing my sunglasses the hardpacked earth had a pink tint to it rusty almost it was as if i could sense the salt beneath the earth just under the surface the wind moving my limp curls had the feeling of distance while ivy stretched in what i recognized as her martialarts warmup i reached out a finger of awareness and looked for the nearest ley line my lips curled up in a smile there was so little water in the ground here that it seemed as if i could feel the earth forever the mental landscape of ley lines stretched as far and as clear as the flat horizon there was space here both visually and in the more nebulous regions of the mind lots of space and nothing to stop any of the senses until the very earth curved from you it was odd and i took a moment to just taste it breaking my line of sight ivy grabbed her overnight bag from the trunk ill see if theyll rent us a room for an hour she said flicking her gaze at trent daring him to protest you want to shower rachel absolutely i said after i eat want me to order you something ivy shook her head her gaze on the interstate it was almost empty at this hour no ill get something to go while youre cleaning up moving with an uncharacteristic stiffness trent started for the cloudy pair of restaurant doors jenks took to the air as if unsure of who to follow his new boots and jacket caught the light shining brilliantly trent you going to want a shower ivy called yes he said not turning then im taking a nap jenkss wings clattered in relief well get a table he said quickly then hummed heavily after trent ivys smile was faint but sincere someone found a new friend she said dryly i chuckled thinking trent looked dead tired it was weird seeing him like that so far from the usual polished puttogether face he showed the world can you believe where we are its not fair if i drove ten miles over the limit id get pulled over she made a sound of agreement then glanced at vivian sleeping with her head propped up on the steering wheel you sure you dont want to shower first she asked grabbing my bag from the backseat i flicked my lethalmagic detector nah im hungry ill babysit trent until youre done i dont mind going last save me some water nodding ivy turned on her heel and headed for the faded office sign and the wilted flowers in the huge earthen pots decorated with azteclooking figures that reminded me of leyline glyphs i pulled my suitcase to the front of the trunk to grab a new shirt bra panties and socks my jeans were okay for another day i shoved everything in my shoulder bag and slammed the trunk shut across the parking lot vivian jumped awake waving at her i went in poor girl youd think theyd give her some help in spying on us maybe it was a punishment of some sort the windows fronting the road had been tinted and only the barest glimmer of light and warmth made it inside as soon as the milky glass doors shut behind me i felt cold as if i had stepped into a cave my attention went to the cash register hoping for a stand of sunglasses but there was nothing maybe the next stop the few people were clustered in such a way that it was obvious they didnt know one another a pinball machine flashed silently trying to attract a quarter and the carpet was almost threadbare it smelled like were more than vampire in here but they had an mpl posted on the door so i knew it was a mixedpopulation restaurant not that humans ever drove much through the between places anymore entire human populations had died in small towns during the turn and the fear lingered it was only in the cities that there had been enough of a support structure to keep them alive in any numbers no one looked up as i entered except the waitress and after i pointed at trent she turned away true to his nature trent had taken a table in the center of the place not in the sun but close oddly enough even though he didnt fit in with the rough weres and brooding witches smoking idontwanttoknowwhat he didnt look out of place it might have been jenks on the napkin dispenser we cant take all day with this trent said as i pulled out the seat across from him sitting down with a tired thump we can skip your shower if you want i said arranging my bag so i could see the lethalamulet detector hanging off it green eyes looking black in the dim light he frowned i didnt drive ninety miles an hour all night so you two could waste it under a showerhead i still have the dust from the arch in my hair i said turning my mug over to hopefully get something in it soon i know were in a hurry i want to get there as much as you do trent was silent and jenks looked between us an unhappy expression on his face you look tired i finally said when jenks made a motion for me to say something trents pinched brow eased i am he admitted and jenks perked up me too he offered i dont mind driving for a while i said trying to catch the waitresss eye thatd be nice rache jenks said snidely hands on his hips and slipping a silver dust since youve only driven about two hundred miles so far no trent offered you need to stay hands free in case the coven he hesitated lifting a shoulder and letting it fall in case the withons send someone else he finished yeah okay jenks said but i was surprised hed taken trents side in the first place the waitress finally came forward two pots in her hands she looked about sixty and smelled of both were and witch so i couldnt easily tell what she was she had cowboy boots on and an apron wearing both like they were comfortable slippers morning folks she said her sharpevaluation look clearly trying to peg us as well regular or decaf um regular i said and trent put a hand over his mug decaf he said and the smell of the coffee rolled over the table as she poured first mine then trents jenks flew to my cup and dipped a pixysize portion out the waitress watching the entire time she looked suspicious not charmed and i guessed that she had had dealings with pixies before what can i get you she said as jenks lifted from the rim of my cup and i took a sip oh god this is good i said and the woman beamed her wrinkles folding in on themselves to make her look windbeaten beautiful thank you hon weve got some batter in the back want me to have len make up some pancakes for you i nodded willing to put myself at the womans mercy if she gave me coffee like this ill have the tomato soup trent said as he slid his menu to her and the woman made a small sound jenks too turned to trent ordering tomatoes wasnt unusual especially out in the wild where there werent many humans but for trent it was hed been masquerading as a human his entire life getting out of cincy must be a new experience for him freeing perhaps that is if len makes a good soup he added smiling up at her the best this side of the mississippi she said tucking the menus under her arm you want the spicy or mild mild leaving both carafes she wandered back to the kitchen for a moment silence but for the pinball machine and the comfortable kitchen noises swirled around us as we all lost ourselves in the pleasure of sitting somewhere other than in the car drinking something that wasnt coming out of a can or a bottle the best coffee i ever had in a restaurant was in this little place in downtown cincinnati trent said suddenly looking like a different person as he set his chipped mug down the memory of the smile hed given the woman genuine and sincere wouldnt leave me it had pictures on the walls of babies dressed like flowers i blurted out and jenks let a flash of gold dust slip from him you know it trent asked eyes wide know it shes been banned from it jenks said laughing juniors i said over the rim of my coffee then set the mug down i could smell pancakes and my mouth began to water mikes i said correcting myself he banned me when i got shunned that was the night i tried to arrest the banshee that had been terrorizing the city last new years remember the fires at astons roller rink and fountain square depressed i looked into the depths of my coffee id never gotten any public credit for that one either his name is mike trent asked and my attention came back up at the amazement in his voice and when i nodded trent shook his head you know a lot of people i lifted one shoulder and let it fall so do you this was kind of freaky i was sitting with trent and neither one of us was baiting the other maybe my mom was right whenever robbie and i got on each others nerves she would make us clean the garage or something my mom had had a very clean garage foods here trent said sounding relieved as he pushed back from the table to make room for his bowl one stack of hotcakes the woman said setting a plate of three very brown pancakes before me and a bowl of tomato soup trent was already reaching for the bowl thank you maam he said with such eagerness that she smiled can i get you anything else she asked setting the bill between us facedown jenks clattered his wings for attention but didnt take flight would you mind if i browsed in your flowerpots im just about dead on refined sugar and processed peanut butter the womans brow pinched youre welcome to what you can find but it will be a mite thin theres been some singing in the rills lately weve got a rove clan about somewheres not that they bother us big folk but they might not take kindly to you jenks beamed ill be fine thanks he said taking a slurp of his coffee to make his wings hum faster one more cup of coffee and i could take on an entire fairy clan you just be careful she said as she went back to the kitchen the smell of my pancakes was heavenly and shunning a knife and fork i rolled the top one up in a tube and took a bite trent sighed heavily carefully polishing his soup spoon with a paper napkin before taking a cautious taste his eyes blinked and started to water its hot she gave me the spicy this is good still gasping trent started eating in earnest wiping his eyes and blowing his nose on his napkin i doubted she gave him the hot it was more likely that the mild was hotter than most volcanoes the light shifted as the door opened and i turned to see vivian standing alone and small in the narrowing band of sun arching to nothing giving us a halfhearted wave she shuffled to the bar and ordered something putting her head down on her crossed arms when the waitress yelled back to the cook to make up a milk shake i chewed looking at her slumped petite form at the bar remembering her honesty at loveland castle and then her phone call that had given me leverage with oliver the covens leader when id first met her shed been polished and refined wearing a cashmere coat and having a trendy bag by the end of the week she was begrimed sore and full of the knowledge that everything shed been told had been a lie right now she was somewhere in between wearing jeans and a sweater that looked too hot everything was designer label though and her makeup though thin had been expertly applied you mind if i ask her to join us i asked trent and he looked up green eyes watering for an instant he was silent and then his spoon clattered against the white porcelain why not he said as he stood since youre so sure shes not going to kill you ive not yet made her acquaintance i was going to do it i said but hed already crossed the room why not jenks mocked his wings a bright red from the caffeine get him away from quen and he thinks hes cock of the world you noticed that too i said softly i like his new shoes thief shoes jenks said around a belch i wonder what hes stealing not our problem i hope taking another bite i watched vivian sit up startled when trent came up beside her and then her quick glance at me are you doing okay i asked jenks seeing his flushed face and slowly moving wings ill be fine jenks tugged his new red jacket straight and rinsed his cup out in my glass of water leaving a thin ribbon of coffee trailing down i want to see if she put a bomb under our car you going to be okay alone with them thinking of ivy in the shower i nodded and he rose up to leave a fading glow of yellow sunbeam on the table ill be in back in five be careful i said as he flew off and he gave me a flash of red dust the pixy equivalent of rolling his eyes at the bar vivian was sliding off her stool one hand holding a tall glass of milk shake and a dangling napkin behind her trent followed smiling as if he were crossing a ballroom floor not a barrestaurant surrounded by nothing in the middle of new mexico ah i dont know what to say the small woman said as she approached and i pushed out a chair for her sit i said smiling trent wont bite its ivy you have to worry about and shes in the shower her milk shake hit the table and she sat the heavymagic detection amulet on my bag started to glow but the lethal one remained dark it didnt go unnoticed by vivian and she took a sip of her drink while trent resettled himself i couldnt help but be reminded of the last time id sat with her and had coffee it had been in mikes actually and shed been prepared to shoot me if i hadnt gone with her but that had been before shed watched me stand next to a demon and try to save her mentor brooke ivy said you were at the airport i said taking a sip of coffee and probably getting jenkss glitter on my lips youre not going to kill me are you i asked and trent choked on his tomato soup eying trent she shook her head her eyes red rimmed and tired looking theyre hoping you do something demonic on the way and if so im to report it she said nervous until trent stopped coughing not that everyone isnt pretty much set on how they are going to vote already except for whoever they elect to take brookes spot oh anything you say to me is going to be used against you in the vote vote i thought my gaze going to trent as i realized hed been right they were going to try to put me away despite what oliver had promised this was a done deal i said then lowered my voice oliver said if i dropped my claim that the council is corrupt youd pardon me i almost hissed vivian shrugged as she sucked on her straw and trent wiped his mouth red faced but finally under control ms morgan is somewhat naive when it comes to world powers he said why because i expect them to keep their word i said darkly looking innocent drinking her milk shake vivian sat back her blue eyes downcast the diamonds on her watch glittered and the time was off it would help a lot if you brought back brooke shed vote for you then i couldnt stop my rueful laugh no she wouldnt trent had gone back to his soup watching us both it made me feel like i was on trial not once but twice and were not corrupt vivian said almost as an afterthought why is she saying this crap i thought rolling up a second pancake and taking a bite it was like she was reading a script maybe she was afraid of what trent thought maybe she was bugged and this entire conversation was going to end up in someone elses ears regardless i couldnt let that one go without a rebuttal so taking a huge bite of pancake i mumbled right okay lets just say the coven is lilywhite but brooke was dabbling in demonology swallowing i added she summoned big al all on her own knowing thats who she was going to get not me she didnt pay or threaten anyone into doing it she did it herself i warned her not to i went out of my way to try to stop her burned my synapses and fried my brain trying to jump a line to get to her in time if im to be shunned then she should be too sure enough vivian didnt look appalled or insulted though we were alone we were not unheard can you she looked at trent hesitating no i said knowing where her thoughts were i cant rescue her brooke summoned al he broke her circle because she didnt know what she was doing im sorry i know you think i control him but i dont im just trying to stay alive here vivian bent her head back over her milk shake i had to ask she said her thin fingers looking cold on the glass the table grew quiet i kept shoveling pancake in my mouth not knowing what to say now that i knew we were being eavesdropped upon vivian trent said his attention lifting from my unused syrup as he broke the awkward silence what role do you have in the coven you seem to be involved in everything im the plumber she said with pride its traditional for the junior leyline magic user plumber was a nice way of saying that she plugged information leaks and kept the crap moving and i almost laughed at the junior tag junior or not she could smear my face in the playground dirt with her white magic i fix things vivian added to make sure trent understood make things run smoothly thats why i her words faltered and she looked embarrassed as she took another pull on her straw got this gem of an assignment i said and she nodded sorry about that its what i like she said shrugging usually the last was said rather dryly and i wondered if it was for our listeners benefit just be careful i said not entirely in jest thats what pierce was before they cemented him into the ground trent was still eying my syrup even as he scraped his spoon to get the last dregs of the soup and i pushed the little container to him vivians face showed her disgust pierce had beaten her up last spring and that was not easy for the selfassured woman pierce she said mouthing his name like it tasted bad he was dead you brought him back i could almost hear her think black witch and my jaw clenched why was everyone so fixated on labels across the table trent dunked his clean fork in the syrup pushing the little container back after hed tasted it if he didnt like it then jenks wouldnt either and i left it as i put my napkin over my last pancake i was done i didnt bring pierce back to life i said not seeing what difference it made but wanting to clear it up he was in purgatory and i accidentally woke him while using a white spell to talk to my deceased father for some parental advice did it on a dare i got pierce instead al was the one who made him alive again so he could use him as a familiar dead witches cant tap lines and they make lousy familiars i sipped my coffee trying not to think about it pierce was living out the rest of his life in anothersa dead mansbody it gave me the willies and i only hoped id never find myself facing such a decision it was hard to blame the guy i just wished he had given me a chance to find a better way before hed given himself to al until death do them part but you woke him first vivian said intently her eyes red rimmed from lack of sleep its a white spell i said glancing at trent he had known for a while that i could do this and it doesnt work on the dead only on those in purgatory vivian moved her straw around to remix her milk shake i know its white she said ive tried it you got it to work when you were how old oh that uncomfortable i looked out the window at my moms car i dont remember i lied id been eighteen and stupid but clearly there was someone under the grass vivian wanted to talk to pierce started haunting me last year he was buried in my churchyard i started to warm getting angry it was your precious coven that killed him i know vivian said as eager as if she was talking about someone from a history book not a real person i once had breakfast with hid in a little hole with owed my life to i read up on him after heafter we met she said slowly he was a coven member gone bad they had no choice but to kill him trent was silent drawing back as i pointed a finger at her he wasnt just killed he was buried alive because of eleison vivian said eyes alight as if discussing a longargued point eleison was a mistake i interrupted it wouldnt have happened if he had known even the basic defensive arts for demonology your coven turned on one of their own gave him to an ugly rabble instead of trying to understand what he was warning them about frustrated i leaned forward vivian this lilywhite crap the coven sticks to cant protect you anymore it took five of you to subdue me and i didnt use a black curse a real demon would have you saw how easily al took brooke rachel trent said and i cut him off knowing how to twist curses doesnt mean that youre evil i said hoping i believed it myself using demon magic doesnt necessarily mean youre bad it just means you created a whole lot of imbalance you vivian said hotly are rationalizing white is white black is black trent picked up both bills pulling a wallet from his back pocket and dropping enough cash on the table to cover them both madam coven member disagrees with you he warned me and i frowned my gut tensing look i said aware that i was probably sealing my fate but this might be my only chance to actually say anything in my defense knowing demon magic has saved my life i never use curses that require body parts or ones that kill shit i thought hesitating ive never killed sighing i paused once more ive never used it to kill anyone who wasnt trying to kill me first vivians lips parted and her fingers slipped from the condensationwet glass you admit you killed someone with black magic trents expression was questioning as he sat back down my shoulders slumped and i grimaced the fairies your precious coven sent to kill me i admitted no vivian said shaking her head i mean people fairies are people i said hotly i saved the ones i could but frowning i shut up glad jenks hadnt heard vivian was silent her milk shake gone and her fingers damp as she dried them on a white paper napkin well i have to use the little girls room she said looking uneasy dont leave until i get out okay she said hopefully god she didnt even know why i was insulted no promises trent said as i continued to steam the road calls vivian stood her chair bumping on the floor im going to pay for this little chat when this is over she said as she flicked the amulets around her neck see you at the finish line it was a pleasure meeting you vivian trent said standing as well his hand extended and i huffed when they shook vivian though was charmed beaming at him she turned away and i cleared my throat you going to vote for or against me i asked bluntly and the womans eyes pinched i dont know she said softly thanks for breakfast our pleasure trent said as he sat back down vivian paused looking like she wanted to say more but then turned for the short corridor with restrooms over it she turned a corner and vanished with a squeak of a hinge trent wrapped his hands around his mug and took a sip i dont understand you he said i truly dont you know they were listening right editing it and putting it on the closedcircuit tv at the convention hotel i know i said depressed the sad thing is that shes probably the only coven member who might side with me and i think i just alienated her disgusted i pushed my plate away trying to shove my dark thoughts along with it looking up i caught the waitresss eye and pointed to my coffee cup signaling another one for the road in a togo cup you want another coffee i asked no mind if i shower next he asked and i gestured for him to have at it be my guest i said hoping he left me more than a hand towel trent tapped the table once with his knuckles hesitated then left the weres at the end of the bar watched him as he walked to the door there was a flash of light and a jingle as he opened it and then the restaurant returned to a dim coolness the waitress sashayed to my table a jumbo disposable cup in her hands it was were size and if i drank it all id be stopping to pee more than jenks thanks that will wake me up i said reaching for my bag and wallet as she set the cup down were good she said as she picked up the bills trent had left behind and smiled standing i slung my bag over my shoulder and lifted the huge cup of coffee it took two hands this thing was not going to fit in my moms cup holders and i walked carefully to the door opening it by leaning against it and walking backward the heat and light hit me and i carefully let the door slide off me and close this timezone jumping got to a person two hours in one day was hard squinting i shuffled to the car now parked under the gas station overhang with a hose stuck into it trent wasnt anywhere but ivy was standing halfway across the lot confronting a heavy grungy trucker who looked not scared but concerned her long hair wet from her shower glinted and i paused at the car to set my coffee down and sigh at how much it took to fill the tank ivy had changed her clothes her long legs managing to make the retro bellbottoms look work her white shirt set off her figure nicely and the short sleeves were going to make her day a lot cooler she looked upset and a faint feeling of unease tightened in me ivy i called and she spun the fear on her face striking me cold she was moving fastvampire fastand her eyes were fully dilated in the bright sun hes gone ivy shouted across the lot and the fear dropped and twisted who i said already knowing jenks she said eyes wide coffee forgotten i ran across the lot squinting when the sun hit me gone where the trucker looked forlorn in a bearish sort of way clearly wanting to help us but not understanding why we were upset im sorry maam he said holding his hands like a fig leaf i dont pay much attention to the little winged critters unless they hit my windshield theyre a bitch to get off god help me i thought panicking i dont know if it was pixies or fairies the man said but a whole mess of noise of em just rose up taking a little fella in red with them he didnt look like he was hurt any my heart was thudding and i backed up sharing a terrified look with ivy oh god we were in the desert there was nothing between me and the horizon but wind sand and scrub pixies could fly faster than i could run and in every direction wed never find him nine trent i shouted hammering on the bathroom door it was thin and hollow and i could hear the water running in the shower he had to have heard me but he didnt answer fidgeting i hammered on it again trent we have to go ive been in here two minutes he shouted back my breath came fast and i looked out the open door to the parking lot ivy was still talking to the trucker explaining the difference between pixies and fairies to hopefully narrow down who had taken him wed never find him if fairies had taken him not in time i should have insisted that he use that curse to make him big i thought i should have made him safe get out i shouted my voice muffled by the low ceiling and faded curtains we have to go go go where i had no idea not even in which direction i just got in here trent muttered my eyes narrowed to slits i looked at the door took a deep breath grabbed the chintzy fakebrass handle and twisted it wasnt locked and the door cracked open a moist foggy warmth spilled out over my feet and then my face i peered into the tiny room grimacing it was clean but old an ugly toilet was right before me a simple pedestal sink on two spindly rusted legs was beside that there was a small tidy bathroom kit open on it with clean stuff laid out the tiny window had peeling selfstick privacy film the tubshower combo was to my right with a masculine shadow moving behind the thin curtain trent i said and the shadow jumped with a halfheard oath what are you doing in here my heart pounded they took him i said reaching through the curtain to turn the water off trent protested but he moved to the back of the tub they took him and we have to get moving i said handing in a large towel the curtain shifted open and i jerked my attention up to trents face he was rubbing it dry with the towel dont look down dont look down i thought though i dont know why hed seen me naked in fountain square hair still dripping he draped the towel around his hips and tucked the end in the folds to hold it there looking more appealing than if hed been stark naked took who he said calmly flustered i stared at his face avoiding his damp taut skin sliding easily over his muscles his hair still looked pale plastered to his face the tub gurgled as the last of the water drained away and still i stood there who did they take rachel he asked again and i shook myself jenks my eyes suddenly started to swim and i looked away you have two minutes to get dressed and get in the car or we leave without you they took jenks my throat closed and i choked out the longer im standing here talking to you the farther away theyre getting damn it i was almost crying its a desert out there i shouted pointing he cant fly at this altitude i have to find him trents head dropped okay he said tiredly and i just about lost it its not okay i yelled get moving trent stepped from the shower and i flung myself back jumping when his showerwet hand gripped my arm and propelled me toward the door okay get out so i can get dressed oh heart pounding i blinked okay only now did i look at his feet nice feet trent cleared his throat and i backed out of the bathroom two minutes i affirmed two minutes trent said and the door shut between us i backed up until my calves found the bed not looking i sat on it the air was cool and dry out here and i nervously smoothed the coverlet my fingers catching where the stitching had pulled it smelled and i stood arm around my middle as i looked out the door to ivy and the trucker i could hear trent moving around and i wiped my eye damn it i was crying i had to find jenks he had saved my life so many times i couldnt imagine a day without him rachel are you still in here i spun finding the door cracked a slip of fog drifting out like trents irritation given substance yes hand me my clothes will you or leave one or the other i scanned the room finding a pile of dark clothing on the chair beside the window moving fast i strode to it hardly feeling the softness of the fabric as i tried not to mess up the folds of his shirt and pants here i said awkwardly the door creaked open a little more and the flush of warmth and steam rolled out thank you he said and the door shut leaving the clean scent of his deodorant ill wait outside i said glancing at the door thank you it was short and clipped and even through the door i could hear his irritation sorry i said as i moved away he hadnt been flustered at all by my bursting in on him but then again he didnt have anything to be ashamed of the man was built like one of his horses not an ounce of flab on him what is wrong with me i thought as i snatched my bag up from the bed and went out slamming the door hard enough to shake the windows and let trent know id left jenks had been kidnapped and i was thinking about trent naked in the shower ivy was walking toward me the trucker revving up his diesel engine behind her and she turned and waved when he yanked the horn cord to send an echo of it across the flat desert i had to content myself with trying to guess her news by her posture as she made her slow way to me arms wrapped around her middle and her head down my head started hurting its pixies she said when she got close enough and my breath slid from me in relief are you sure i asked hand on her arm she nodded he said they all had silver wings that made a lot of noise the only noise fairies make is when they clank their swords against each other i looked back at the motel wishing trent would hurry hes probably alive then i said my worry coming right back pixies wouldnt kill an intruder wearing red and jenks had on enough to blind a horse but why kidnap him at all the jingle of the restaurant door caught our attention and we turned to see vivian coming out her head down as she looked at one of her amulets maybe she arranged it ivy said her dark eyes getting darker to slow us down if you dont make it in time your shunning is permanent squinting at the slight but powerful coven member i shook my head not her style vivian looked up blinking as she saw us standing in the parking lot turning she looked to the west then down at her amulet then up again clearly confused steps slowing she halted on the covered wooden walkway that connected the motel to the restaurant my pulse hammered and sweet beautiful adrenaline poured into me shes got a tracking amulet i whispered knowing now how shed been following us through the night what ivy said but i was already moving to vivian arms swinging loose and free my every motion full of intent vivian saw me and her foot scraped as she took a step back shes got a tracking amulet tuned to jenks i exclaimed without looking over my shoulder like i made for mia thats how shes been following us vivian took another step back her gaze darting from me to her pinto rachel ivy exclaimed rushing a coven member might not be the best thing i smiled at vivian that tracking amulet was mine vivians eyes were wide she swore then turned and ran her boots thumping on the walk running alongside the motel she was headed for her car instinct kicked in and i bolted after her arms pumping i gave chase my boots hitting the dirt as i tried to head her off look out ivy shouted and my gaze shot to trent head down as he came out of the motel room my pace faltered and glancing at me vivian put on a burst of speed turning her head just in time to smack right into trents door the thunk of her head on the thick wooden door was loud and i winced slowing to a jog trent scrambled dropping his toiletry bag as he narrowly caught her her hand opened and the amulet dropped going dark as it rolled off the raised wooden walkway and to my feet falling on its side in a tiny puff of dust i snatched it up and looked at trent now holding vivian as her head lolled and her feet splayed askew that wasnt quite what id planned i said then turned to the waitress leaning half out of the restaurant and waved shouting can we have a bag of ice i think shes okay the woman ducked back inside and i shifted to make room for ivy i missed the meeting didnt i trent said and i helped him ease her to the walk she was breathing okay and when ivy lifted her lids her pupils contracted equally given a little time shed likely be fine thanks trent i said as i hefted the amulet glowing again now that i was holding it youre being useful today i think you just saved me from beating up a coven member ivy looked from vivians pinto to my moms car now what i looked at the amulet my heart pounding as i saw how far apart the two little red dots were i wondered if oliver had made it looping the cord around my neck i crouched beside vivian you take her feet ill take her hands immediately ivy shifted and together we lifted her me straining far more than ivy trent backed up a step confused what are you going to do with her put her in the car i puffed moving awkwardly to my moms car trent scooped up his toiletry bag youre joking right rachel shes coven we cant take her with us im not going to leave her here i said and ivys eyes flicked to him as the unconscious woman seemed to gain fifty pounds with every step will you get the ice frowning he turned away but i couldnt help but be impressed as he gave the waitress a story about us traveling together and knowing her and her friends and that wed make sure she got home okay pace fast he caught back up with us in time to open the back door you cant be serious he started in again his eyes pinched as he held the door open they want to kill you maybe im trying sugar instead of vinegar i grunted as i scooted backward into my moms car hitting my elbow as i pulled vivian in after me ivy wrestled with her feet as trent stood behind her and watched his toiletry bag in one hand the ice in the other he looked totally different in his black clothes his hair slicked back his expression worried you should be tucking her away in that hotel room you rented he said and throwing her keys into the desert shed never find us then maybe or maybe it would just tick her off i said as i tossed my bag to the front seat and tugged vivian farther in my back hit the far door and puffing i opened it and backed out exhaling i looked at him across the roof tired im not leaving her unconscious in a hotel room a hundred miles from civilization to maybe wake up as someones desertbunker wife you put a zip strip on her and she goes from coven to incapable but frankly the real reason shes coming with us is that id rather have her tell the coven all our secrets than have a twentyfourhour gap that they can use to invent stuff seeing vivian laid out on the seat i carefully shut the door and looked out over the desert im driving who has the keys ivy opened the driversside door ill drive you work the amulet she said and i just looked at her my heart pounding and adrenaline surging through me like a sugar high her eyes dilated at the fear i was giving off and smiling wryly she tugged the keys out of her pocket and dangled them for me okay you drive she said ill sit with my head hanging out the window like a golden retriever thanks i said shaky as i came around to her side got in and adjusted everything ivy slipped into the front passenger seat as i cranked the engine over tossing her overnight bag with her dirty clothes in it over the seat at trent he barely got his hands up in time having been trying to arrange vivian in a somewhat upright position you want to wait a minute so i can move some of this to the trunk he said dropping the ice bag on the bump just now starting to rise on vivians forehead no everyones arms and legs were inside the vehicle and i put the car in reverse hitting the gas hard ivy already had her hand on the dash but trent went flying as the car jerked backward teeth clenched i hit the brakes hard and he was flung into the backseat where he belonged his door which had been open bounced shut from the quick stop and i jammed the gearshift into drive while ignoring trent yelling at me you think you like speed ivy said as i spun the tires and we left a cloud of dust bouncing wildly until we found the road youve never seen rachel drive with purpose yeah purpose if purpose meant scared to death and to hell with everyone else then id be driving with purpose the ride smoothed out and my eyes flicked to the rearview mirror not to see the restaurant grow smaller in the distance but to see jenkss absence i had a chance to find him a chance and if he wasnt okay i was going to do some serious damage to my already waferthin credibility as a good witch even if i was a black one ten my grip on the wheel tightened until my knuckles hurt i was trying to keep my worry from turning into anger but it was hard especially now that trent was awake i dont care how far weve not gotten i said tightly glaring at trent by way of the rearview mirror if we only make three hundred miles today then well deal with it they have to stop sometime i understand youre concerned about your partner he said in that same persuasive voice that was starting to sound patronizing but i doubt theyre planning on sacrificing him to their local god you have a locator amulet youll find him slow down let them land theyre running because they know youre chasing them it was a nice thought but they werent running because of us they were running to somewhere their path arrow straight and their pace unflagging i wasnt about to slow down and ivy didnt look up from her map a long white finger touching where our paths might cross again vivian kicked the back of my seat as she tried to find a more comfortable spot on the other side of the backseat trent frowned out the window okay so maybe i was going a little fast but id been driving a huge frustrating zigzag for the last four hours i had raced down i then gone south on to get in front of them as ivy had suggested we had only to see them rise up right over the car and swear at us we spent another hour on watching them go a rather speedy forty miles an hour paralleling us until we roared ahead to where crossed their theoretical path they simply flew higher shooting arrows at us when i demanded they stop from there wed taken north in an effort to get back to the interstate we didnt know the next time wed find gas and ms worriesalot in the front seat next to me was getting fidgety by now ivy had enough data points to predict where theyd cross the road next i was hoping that if we could get far enough ahead of them in time i could hide behind a rock and simply catch them in a big bubble every time they saw the car they raced out of my reach right now they were somewhere behind us me going about eighty and the pixies hitting a steady forty miles an hour it was their top speedwhich meant trent was wrong and that this was a planned snaganddrag pixies couldnt go that fast for that long they were switching off and carrying jenks carrying jenks who knew where it was about two in the afternoon and hot i was frazzled and ready to snap ivy wasnt much better leaning over the seat to shake vivian awake every half hour in case she had a concussionwhich was totally pissing off the coven woman trent had been up for only a few minutes but he already looked bored staring out the window and clearly irate that the time hed made was being wasted it was all i could do not to reach over the seat and slap him as i fidgeted ivy rolled her window down to let in a warm blast of air overpowering the hefty airconditioning my moms car had her eyes had gotten dark and her posture was tense she wasnt hot she was randy and i rolled my window down a bit as well i think they stopped she said eying the amulet somewhere by see she held out the map with her notations and calculations i didnt look teeth clenched as i blew past a van with a wizard painted on the side rachel just tell me what road to take i muttered she pulled a strand of her blowing hair out of her mouth the next exit she said putting on a pair of dark glasses to hide her eyes youre going to have to go north for a few miles before it loops around and goes under the interstate more backtracking trent said hardly audible shut up just shut up i yelled then exhaled trying to relax i mean i understand your concern i said softly ill get you to the west coast in time if i have to buy a trip for you from newt if only al wouldve jumped me there but he wanted me to fail but if you dont shut up im going to pull this car over and shove you in the trunk trent sighed and shifted his knees and ivy looked up from the map eyebrows raised im trying i said softly to her hes got about as much empathy as a demon its always me me me what if it had been quen who was kidnapped i bet hed be all over that like pixies on elf trash trent cleared his throat and i huffed point made you want me to drive for a while ivy said you need a break no ive got this i said quickly then added if i dont do something ill snap i waited for jenkss comment that i had already snapped but of course it never came checking the speedometer i pressed the accelerator we had to stay in front of them and there was a whole lot of distance left well find him ivy said the amulet getting dark as she set it aside to fold up the map silent i scanned the distant horizon for cops my senses stretching as i took in every nuance of light and shadow jenks was out there somewhere my stomach clenched this shouldnt have happened he didnt need me to watch him but this altitude thing had caught us all by surprise i should have made him take that curse ivy shook the map out with a rattle trent jiggle vivian ask her what her name is my name is vivian the irate witch grumbled clearly awake and if you touch me kalamack ill turn your hair pink i do not have a concussion leave me alone and let me sleep in a huff she repositioned herself in the corner her feet kicking the back of my seat as she shook out my moms shabby car blanket and rearranged it over her head i think shes fine trent said sourly as he looked out at the changing nothing the car was full of unhappy people heading west it was the great american family road trip all right whaaahoo i sniffed my stomach hurting from too much stress and not enough food i was upset but it was hard not to see the scenery and call it beautiful it was nothing but dirt and rock but it looked clean pure the angles and gullies standing out in the strong sun i could tell that trent was hot with the window open and the airconditioning going full bore but i was comfortable hed have to suck it up thats our exit ivy said suddenly and i slowed not wanting to take it at ninety miles an hour trent sighed again and i tapped the brake to shake him up its a state park i said seeing the faded petrified forest sign maybe this is where theyre heading the petrified forest trent said sounding interested i read about this place ivy leaned forward everyone whos been to school has read about this place ive never been here trent said his words clipped as he tried to hide his interest its not the kind of thing that they let you do huh i finished for him pissed for some reason im chasing down my partner from kidnappers and trents more interested in chunks of rock ivy handed the map to him over the seat nows your chance johnny boy scout she said apparently not needing it anymore were going right through it my heart gave a thump before settling into a faster pace there was a parkranger hut straddling the road crap vivian are you going to give us any trouble tell me now just let me sleep she grumbled let me sleep and ill sign a paper that youre a fucking angel i didnt know they let coven members talk like that trent said dryly probably trying to cover his curiosity but he was leaning forward wanting to see more fuck you kalamack the usually posh woman shot back oh yeah we were all having fun now ivy shrugged so i pulled up and rolled my window completely down hi can we have a day pass i asked after reading the rates painted on the brown sign that will be five fifty the weathered woman said and trent shoved some money at me over the seat let me get you a receipt she said ducking inside her window to hit a few buttons are you camping she said as she leaned back out and handed me a receipt stapled to a brochure we dont suggest it this time of year and youll need to take a class before you can get your camp permit if youre not prepared the desert can be deadly the class just takes twenty minutes twenty minutes to preserve your life i thought is that all weve got lots of water seeing trents eager hand on the seat at my shoulder i handed him the brochure and he settled back like a kid with a new toy its not just the water its the heat and elevation the ranger said her gaze on vivian is she okay the bar ahead of us was still down and i took a deep breath too much partying trent said over the crackle of new paper surprising me shes not even going to get out of the car the ranger smiled and the bar rose the gift shop is up on the right if you change your mind about the class they start every half hour thanks i said wanting to floor it but she hadnt given me our sticker yet well enjoy the park theres a large group of weres out at the hotel for a company retreat but other than that all the exhibits are open finally the little yellow sticker was stuck to the inside of my window and i exhaled turning it into something i could blame on the heat instead of relief thanks bye now waving the woman went back into her airconditioned hut and i crept forward at the posted forty miles an hour after blowing down the interstate at ninety it felt like i was crawling i started to fidget it says here the average person needs a gallon of water per day trent said reading from the brochure how much do we have none i eyed the empty water bottles in the cup holders its twenty miles to any road i think well be okay all im saying is if we have to walk we dont have any water ivy glanced at him youre not walking anywhere youre staying in the car from the lump of blanket came an irate im trying to sleep will you shut up ivy settled back and i said nothing dividing my attention between the unmoving dot of jenks on the amulet the winding road and the shocking views of sharpangled ravines and colors that were like nothing id ever seen before we passed pulloff after pulloff trent rolling his window down sucking the cooler air out of the car the flat of his arms on the frame to get a look at the admittedly spectacular views it wasnt until we found flat desert again that he sank back into his seat as expected we crossed under the overpass and headed south think well get to the place in time i asked my mood vacillating wildly between relief and impatience as i hit the gas lots of time ivy said fingering the amulet they arent moving anymore he cant fly not at this altitude damn it i was babbling hes wearing his red ivy said pointing out the sign for the auto tour it went into the desert and trent perked up his gaze going up and down as he traced our path on his brochure they might have taken him because he collapsed maybe they were trying to help yeah and thats why they were swearing at us when we caught up with them i said double damn what if i found him only to find that the size difference prevented me from doing anything the curse in my bag was for making little things big not the other way around driving with one hand i looked at my bag where my phone was if worse came to worst i could call ceri for the curse to make myself smaller id do it in front of vivian if i needed to again trent put his window down and the dry smell of the desert lifted through my hair as we drove a level course on the top of the world the canyons dipping an impossible distance down colored with purples grays and blueslike mountains in reverse it was a weird way to see things wed met no one since entering the park just seen a few ravens and buzzards silence still and uncomfortable and the sun hammering at everything without mercy slow it down ivy said eying the amulet are we there yet trent said sarcastically and vivian groaned pulling the blanket over her head despite the heat i drove past a sign about an ancient ruin and ivy stiffened back up rachel were close i think theyre at the ruins my heart pounded as i jerked the car to a halt so fast that vivian hit the back of my seat and even trent had to catch himself ignoring vivians snarl i flung my arm over the back of the seat and put the car in reverse trents eyes widened as i whipped the car around landing it between two white lines and jamming it into park intent i turned the engine off and bolted out of the car my boots scraping on the pavement as it threw up a wave of heat the silence hit me and i hesitated shocked almost there was nothing out here impinging upon me the impression of magnitude the hot wind shifting my hair had been in motion for hundreds of miles without impediment giving it a slippery feel as it molded around me and continued on elastic and not even recognizing me i couldnt see far enough my eyes failing due to their own limitations for the first time in my existence it wasimmense jenks the sun beat down making even the shadows hot i sent my senses out as i stood on the road to the ruins looking out over the purples and mauves searching for anything every part of me taking in the feel of the air listening for the hum of a wing and hearing only an aching emptiness i looked for a ley line finding a crisscrossing of faded nothing like hints of what had once been but was now gone empty everything was empty my head ached from the echo and i took in every nuance as i looked for a sign a breath a wing chirp every chip of rock every shadow stood out in sharp relief as i searched for him the image of the desert almost scratched on the inside of my mind and built around the faded images of ley lines that no longer existed they whispered hinting at a time when there was grass and trees here and huge animals roaming living dyinguntil they vanished along with the ley lines i wondered which had disappeared first al had once told me that demons made the ley lines in their efforts to escape the everafter but magic was older than that was what i was seeing now the faded remnants of lines gone dead had the demons destroyed the original source of magic in their attempt to banish the elves i squinted closing my eyes and reaching for a breath of understanding wrapping my awareness around an empty shell of a scratch between the present and the past finding no energy but only the lingering idea that power had once run here now gone leaving only the skeleton dry and dusty to hint at what had been it made me feel so damned alone a door slammed shut and i turned my last thought heavy in my heart get back in the car i said to trent and ivy slowly got out her head bent over the amulet in her hand trent looked me up and down his expression closed its an oven in there he said turning to the map on the brochure and besides its a bunch of pixies how bad can it be just go and get him youre a thousand times their size irate he leaned against and squinted at me in the sun the wind playing with his wispy hair and the heat made him look tired ill stay here unless you scream for me promise he said sourly yeah like that will happen jittery i looked at the map sketched on the big brown sign beside a trail seeing that there was a quartermile footpath that circled around a ruin according to it about four hundred people had once lived here almost a thousand years ago ivy shut her door with a backward kick the thump not going on for long before the silence soaked it up you should listen to quen more she said looking up from the amulet to frown at the slight rise of land before us pixies are deadly trent frowned at the sky and i ran a finger between my ankle and the heel of my boot a clan of wild pixies kidnapped an experienced runner i said they live in the desert what does that tell you they arent smart enough to move trent said and i made a noise of disgust ivy headed for the narrow footpath of paved asphalt and i turned to follow according to the plaque archaeologists had begun to reconstruct the village site but there were no walls higher than my knees reaching my awareness out past the faint scratchings of what might once have been ley lines i tapped the nearest real one my eyes closed as i found hundreds of them some as far away as the next state the lack of water had extended my reach much like the lack of trees expanded my sight having so much visual mindscape to play in was almost nauseating and i quickly spindled a wad of everafter energy in my head i remained holding on to the line knowing this was not going to be easy i didnt want to resort to magic if i couldnt convince them to let jenks go i wasnt sure if i could force them to without hurting them the click of vivians door opening was loud as i started out after ivy but she was only propping it open to get a cross breeze yeah there was the vivian angle to consider too anything i did was going to land in the covens ears frowning i picked up the pace until i caught up with ivy my heart pounding as we went up the slight rise the altitude was getting to me i tried to walk softly to listen for the clatter of pixy wings but there was only the wind how anything could survive out here was beyond me much less flowerloving pixies the only plant life id seen was tough and herbaceous something that id never give a second glance at if i was home but here the tiny flowers stood out trent is dumb enough to make me want to cover him in honey and toss him into the middle of them i said tightly as we passed down a narrow alley slumps of rocks to either side ivy didnt look up from the amulet too worried to notice the stark beauty around her it felt good to be moving even though the idea that i was a ghost walking down an abandoned alley lost to history was creepy i didnt like the fatigue creeping up my legs wed walked only twenty yards but it felt like a mile in the heat and elevation no wonder jenks couldnt fly the path turned and we halted at the end of the village looking over what was once probably the refuse dump below us at the bottom of a steep dropoff were figures etched into the rock the dark surface chipped off to show the white stone underneath most of the glyphs were indecipherable circles and spirals but the one with the bird holding a man in his beak was clear enough it looked kind of egyptian and i wondered if demons had been here look at those cave drawings i said pointing out the one with the storklike bird theyre called petroglyphs ivy didnt even look at them focused on the amulet okay but that huge bird is eating that man i said and she glanced up i think it says stay close to the village or the boogie man will get you i lifted my eyes to the open spaces over the glyph feeling like we were being watched right i said not convinced and those little tally marks under it are what she shrugged and i hugged myself wanting to scream for jenks where is he i said stifling my urge to take the amulet from her knowing better ivy felt helpless too i cant tell ivy turned in a slow circle her expression one of the lost i know theyre watching us pursing her lips she whistled below us in the parking lot trent pushed from the car i waved him to stay and he kicked a stone as he crossed the parking lot to crouch and feel the dirt between his fingers ivy and i strained to hear something but not even an insect broke the sound of wind on stone i didnt like this if they took jenks to ground wed never find them jenks i shouted then spun at a tiny rock falling careful ivy said her hand on my arm and we went forward together following the path over a small ridge and out of sight of the parking lot i crept along uncomfortable under the sun as the heat evaporated the sweat before it dampened my skin twenty feet ahead of us was another part of the village the corner wall rebuilt almost to waist height a small motion caught my attention and i stumbled to a halt there atop the wall hogtied and with his own bandanna shoved into his mouth was jenks i couldnt see his face but his quick motions told me he was ticked squirming with his words muffled by distance and his bandanna his wings werent moving either a black dust sifted from him he looked like a sacrifice and ivys words about the local gods echoed in my thoughts along with the image of that bird with a man in his beak maybe it was a pixy son of a bitch jenks shouted finally getting the bandanna off his mouth you cowardly sons of bitches he said again then accidentally rolled off the wall to vanish behind it with a yelp jenks ivy shouted lunging forward no wait i shouted reaching after her and feeling like the earth was going to drop out from under us a piercing whistle echoed my adrenaline pulsed rhombus i shouted cowering as my moleculethin layer of everafter rose up around us the protection circle snapped into place with a mindjolting echo and i looked up as tiny arrows plunked into it the sun seemed darker scaring me have i put that much smut on myself already stop a shrill pixy voice cried out ahead of me or we kill the blackhaired woman rachel stop jenks shouted and i looked up and blanched thirty no fifty maybe more pixies surrounded ivy all with a bow or a sword or both she wasnt in my circle her vampiric speed had moved her too far ivy i called out and she slowly licked her lips fingers spread as she put her arms up in capitulation her face was deathly pale and she barely breathed as the pixies in shades of brown and violet hovered over her their dust coating her in a sheet of red savage as they hooted and brandished their weapons i had the ugly realization that this was how they survived out herebringing down animals to supplement the traditional pixy diet of pollen and nectar shit we were in trouble ah sorry about this ivy said freezing when the pixies above her told her to be still if you hurt her i threatened and my gaze darted to the ridge trent was there tense and looking like he was ready to do something damn it i couldnt protect both of them what was he doing if they saw him theyd attack and i tried to tell him with my eyes to get the hell out of here the bright flash of yellow drew my attention back and i frowned at the colorful pixy dressed in a flaming yellow billowing outfit as he hovered before me he looked like an ill eighteenyearold whod been into the brimstone too much his dark skin wrinkled by the sun and too little rest his grip on his sixinch toad sticker of a spear was firm enough though and his green eyes were as sharp as any id ever seen why are you following us witch he demanded hovering inches from my barrier his words were so fast i almost couldnt understand him my eyes flicked back to trent and i shifted my shoulders as i realized he was gone just start the car and wait i thought knowing that was too much to ask he was going to do something and it probably was going to make things worse stupid elf from behind the wall i heard jenks shout what the turn is wrong with you theyre my friends the pixy confronting me darted to the wall liar he exclaimed gesturing for two pixies to get him theyre lunkers theyre my friends two pixies dropped down depositing jenks back on the wall right where hed started from looking pissed jenks stood wobbling as he tried to find his balance it looked like theyd weighted the tip of one wing to keep him from flying im not making this up jenks said in disgust im jenks of cincinnati im traveling to the west coast on a job and i cant stay here and im not going to marry any of your women i have a wife i exchanged a shocked look with ivy and she rocked back centering herself they had kidnapped him as stud material liar the head pixy shouted his wings moving fast in the heat you said she died i opened my mouth but jenks beat me to it shouting i dont want a new wife i love my old one do you have troll turds in your ears get this thing off me jenks shook his wings dusting heavily as the clip weighed him down two more pixies both in matching shades of sage green had risen to flank the head pixy he did complain the entire way the one with the length of steel said lifted his ass miles him bitching nonstop the other with the bow said this was weird id swear they were the same age but they didnt look like they were from the same clan pixies didnt cooperate like this at least pixies east of the mississippi didnt maybe they had to band together in the desert to survive that might explain why they thought jenks should take a new wife too he cant even fly the second one said pointing at jenks with his bow even without the shackles i say let him go they want him and for all his finery and height he cant fly hes from the east the pixy in yellow said hell adapt hes not used to the air look at how water fat his flesh is and his sword he said hoisting the one in his hand and my eyes narrowed it was jenkss this is pixy steel pixy steel fiftyfour kids he says he has all living at that the surrounding pixies rose up gossiping in words too fast for me to understand he lies a pixy said you cant keep that many children alive jenks can i said youre not helping ivy called out and i winced i bet he can the head pixy in yellow waved jenkss sword around look at him jenks stood with his hands tied before him and his gossamer wings dripping a black dust even i had to admit he looked good especially compared to the gaunt smaller pixies surrounding him in another world in another time in another sizebut he was jenks my friend and my anger grew i darent move though not with ivy having a dozen poisoned arrows pointed at her around us the pixy women tittered and i burned when one said loudly i dont care if he can fly or not id just unwrap him and wear him like a fur we stole you the head pixy said to jenks gesturing for them to back off you belong to us jenks doesnt belong to anyone i shouted but ivy was silent she was a vampire and vampires were born to be treated like objects given to others as favors for a day or a lifetime at my exclamation the pixy flew to the bubble and poked at it with jenkss sword youre not big enough to stop us get in your car and leave or well kill the vampire i swallowed feeling cold please i know this is weird but jenks has been working with us for over two years he owns the church we live in i pay him rent you cant keep him he has responsibilities a job a mortgage hes got to get back to his kids because im not going to watch them he owns property it had been the one with the bow and i nodded as the pixies buzzed over that his garden has so many flowers you cant step without crushing one i said the grass grows so fast i have to cut it every week his children are so clever they stay awake all winter they play in snow it sounds like paradise a pixy wearing a flowing brown tunic said with a sigh you arent helping ivy said softly her voice rising and falling like music the pixy with the bow frowned taking a higher position than the other two i told you we should have asked they do things differently across the mississippi we caught him the leader insisted but hope rose in me as i saw a crack in their resolve dragged his sorry ass across six clans and you want to give him up his wife is dead and hes on a quest to spread his seed to the wind why else would he be wearing all that red excuse me ivy made a small sound of disbelief and i turned to jenks he looked as mystified as me uh thats what we do where i come from to get safe passage through another pixys territory jenks said you dont just let them cross a pixy woman asked her brown silk furling as she darted up how do you find enough food to survive a cultural difference i thought the entire mess was the result of a misunderstanding over the color red im sorry for the mistake i said for the first time thinking we might get out of here without a fight can we have him back he wont wear red anymore we didnt know the pixies were flitting in the sun the shadows of their wings flashing over ivy as they argued in small knots slowly i began to relax hes a proven provider the head pixy said we need new breath in our children but the bows had been eased and the sword tips had fallen look i said taking a half step forward and halting when the pixies bristled anew at me he didnt know wearing red meant that he was trying to spread his uh seed yeah i didnt know jenks said flushing i cant stay i gotta get back to my kids im sure we can work out an exchange for your efforts in kidnapping him and bringing him here i added honey or something what do you want i held my breath as the three leaders looked at one another and then at their surrounding people as if considering it id buy them an entire tanker of honey if thats what it took can you get usmaple syrup the pixy in yellow said a gallon maybe the real stuff not that lizard shit with the corn syrup in it i exhaled my breath shaking in my lungs yes i said seeing the lines in ivys face ease the head pixys wings became a neutral silver and he turned to the other two leaders for each of us he added wanting more after id given in so quickly and i nodded smiling three gallons but jenks gets his sword back done the three pixies said simultaneously raising their weapons in salute and the pixy standing beside jenks cut his bonds jenks gave the buck a nasty look letting the cut rope fall to his feet his wings still flat to his back he raised his hand to catch his thrown sword clearly not happy jenks jammed his sword away it was over and the pixies by the far rock slide rose up in a whirlwind of sound and color shouting kusox the kusox shakuru a party i thought as the air around jenks and ivy was suddenly empty of pixy wings in celebration of a peaceful resolution and three gallons of maple syrup smiling i strode to jenks still perched atop the wall are you okay i asked falling to kneel before him hands curling around him but unable to touch never able to touch im fine he muttered looking embarrassed as he wedged that clip off his wing and wobbled three inches into the air and back down bought for the price of a gallon of syrup ivys shadow covered us and i looked up at her as she chuckled it was three she said and better that than my life jenks nodded ruefully im never going to wear red again can we just write them a voucher and go i stood pushing my nasty hair from my shoulder in invitation one of us will run into town for it and then well get out of here trent will just have to suck it up jenks rose unsteadily and laboriously flew to my shoulder and my earring pulled as he fell against it i looked up the path to the unseen car taking ivys arm to be sure she was okay too you didnt get hit by anything did you i demanded but she wasnt listening her eyes riveted to the outcrop of stone behind me the pixies were shrilling at the piercing croak of a bird and i turned a bird i thought and then everything shifted the kusox shakuru wasnt a party it was a bird a bigass bird like a stork and it wasits eating them i whispered horror filling me oh my god that bird is eating them i stood frozen in disbelief not comprehending it the second and third leaders were shouting directions so fast and highpitched that i couldnt understand them but it was clear enough as the arrows and spears once pointed at us now fell on the bird it cawed the harsh sound crawling through my mind and making me shudder as it echoed off the stone oh my god ivy gasped i spun blinking when a new shadow fell over us you i exclaimed stupidly as trent halfslid to a halt beside us breathing hard and looking tired i told you to wait in the car weve got this i can see that his words clipped trent eyed the battle his lips pressed tight shouldnt we be going pixies were screaming the sound becoming panicked what now i exclaimed we have to help them the pixies who kidnapped your partner trent said frowning why why i echoed him because it was a misunderstanding we got it worked out i just need three gallons of maple syrup trents face became white oh he licked his lips and shifted from foot to foot um maybe we should leave anyway he said taking my arm and pulling me a step up the path rache jenks warbled i cant fly do you not see whats going on here i said as i yanked out of trents grip and pointed my finger dropping when a pixy screamed trying to free itself from the birds long beak even as it vanished in a toss and a sharp snap the pixys clansmen and women were stabbing at the gray storklike bird firing arrows and throwing spears but it simply jerked its head to catch another warrior who got too close wings flapping as it hopped to a rock where its footing was better feathers gave it protection and it seemed immune to the poison there is a bird i said eating pixies do you have any idea how wrong that is we need to get out of here he insisted and my attention snapped back to him he tossed the hair from his eyes and my heart seemed to stop his ears were bleeding again what did you do i whispered scared trent began walking away and i glanced at ivy seeing her closed expression pushing into motion i followed him my heart pounding he stank like cinnamon and spoiled wine what did you do i demanded and he ignored me not slowing down i thought you needed help he said and i yanked at his arm pulling him to a stop at the top of the hill frightened i grabbed his chin and shifted his head he let me do it there was a handprint on his neck but it was the blood dripping from his ears and nose that struck fear in me the arch he had bled at the arch too and he smelled like elven magic thought we needed help tell me what you did i said as i looked down the hill to the car the trunk was open and my scrying mirror was out glinting in the sun vivian was slumbering in the back as if immune to the noise sleeping or out cold oh my god i exclaimed as i pieced it together did you use my mirror to make a deal with a demon the bird cawed ivy stood next to me and jenks started swearing trents jaw clenched jerking as a horrible croaking came from over the hill yes he said the single word hit me like a slap that was you under the arch i stammered being drawn forward as trent doggedly paced downhill to the car you put yourself in a ley line and called on a demon under the arch i accused that force i shoved into those assassins wasnt from you and it wasnt from the assassins it was from a demon and when i pushed the energy back into him he tried to bury us all under the arch you asked a demon for help and it almost killed you and now you go and ask for his help again are you insane jenks had taken to the air hovering backward and watching our backs as well as our faces he looked as scared as i felt it cant kill me now trent said his jaw clenched youll be fine trust me trust you i shouted and ivy grabbed my arm as i went to shove him feeling it trent stopped looking angry and unrepentant as he turned to me it cant snatch you because of me i exclaimed shaking off ivys hold and pushing him in the chest trent stumbled back but i was moving forward getting in his face you used me i freed you as a familiar and you used me trent became more grim looking his gaze darting behind me as the sound of fighting pixies grew loud and the harsh cawing of the stork echoed ivy was at my shoulder a hand on her hip the coven might be interested in that trent kalamack dabbling in demonology if you tell her then rachel doesnt have a chance he said and i realized it was true uh rache jenks said nervously perched on ivys shoulder theyre coming this way you are an idiot i said softly shaking inside you have no idea what youve done trent tugged his clothes straight as if he were wearing a threepiece suit and not a black tshirt and a pair of jeans i suggest we leave before it finishes eating them i dropped back a step almost laughing as disgusted as i was ivy was staring at him in disbelief im not going to walk away from this its eating them rachel no trent shouted but i was beyond listening and i leaned back as he came forward bringing my foot up just in time for him to run right into it he hit with a jarring that shifted me and he fell backward holding his middle taking ivy with him they sprawled on the paved footpath and as jenks darted to my shoulder i turned to the bird celero inanio i shouted throwing a ball of glowing everafter at the harshly croaking stork its ugly neck skin flapping yes it was a black curse but it was a bird eating pixiespixies i had found a way to deal with peacefully i was already mumbling i take the smut as the curse to boil the blood in a living creature sped across the short distance slamming into the bird to destroy it in a ball of curseridden magic except it didnt my ball of death exploded inches from the bird breaking against a flash of black that had enveloped the large bird protecting it sparkles lit the afternoon falling like a cascade over the protection bubble the pixies darted back with frightened cries gathering in a hazing cloud as the bird shook itself and the protection circle vanished cawing the ugly black stork turned a red eye to me my gut clenched as i noticed it was slitted like a goats you stupid fool trent gasped from the ground his eyes tearing as he tried to catch his breath its not a bird its a demon eleven um jenks i said taking a stumbling step back into a cloud of pixies now seeking shelter with me tell me the sun is up the sun is up he said hearing the panic in my voice and knowing what that black bubble had been about as much as i did damn rache you telling me thats not a bird ivy shoved trent off her and got to her feet trent was next and we walked backward to the car the pixies retreating with us as they continued to shout insults at the bird the sun was up it couldnt be a demon but it wasnt a bird either and i didnt know if that scared me or simply made me angrier an ignorant bird eating people might be forgiven but not if it was another intelligent being demon or not my instincts screamed demon but the sun was up this isnt possible maybe its a really bad witch trent thinks is a demon the cloud of pixies behind me started talking too fast for me to follow shrilling about kusox and fables and the past coming to life kill it the head pixy shouted and the snick of jenks pulling his sword rang in my ear no he yelled and they halted hovering behind me its not a bird you cant fight it as if it is my mouth went dry as the stork croaked eying me as it jumped from rock to rock coming closer crap it was getting bigger too my thoughts went to the petroglyph of the bird with a figure in its beak and i paled as the memory of a pixy scream echoed in my mind the bird gulping it down uh guys i stammered as i turned seeing trent and ivy still standing there scared pixies wreathing them wed better get to the car we ran arms pumping i followed trent and ivy down the hill to the car hitting the rocks and jumping over low walls to make a beeline for it rather than the safer serpentine route i could make only one circle we all had to be in it vivian included behind me the bird squawked and the pixies scattered with shrill sounds of panic as heavy wings beat the air make a circle i shouted as i saw vivian awake and standing next to the open trunk my scrying mirror in her hand her mouth hanging open as she gaped behind us make a friggin circle i shouted as the path became level and i ran on pavement instead of asphalt the heat ballooned up almost a wall ivy and trent reached the car first landing against it to turn and stare i didnt look as i skidded to a halt beside them searching my pockets for chalk that i didnt have i had been hunting pixies not a friggin daywalking demon it couldnt be but id seen its eyes it had made a circle behind me the bird croaked out a weird call it echoed in the heatbeaten stillness as if coming from time itself leaning into the car i found my bag and digging through it for my chalk i thought about my scrying mirror in vivians hands did trent swipe my chalk too a circle wont hold him trent said grimly and i pulled myself out of the car chalk in hand vivian was beside ivy and pixies circled darting about in an eyehurting mass its the kusox shakuru one shouted you brought the left hand of the sun upon us chalk i said triumphantly holding it up and turning oh crap i whispered it was flying and it had gotten even biggerthe size of a small plane maybe rachel duck jenks shrilled as it angled for me but i was already dropping i screamed as i felt talons rake my hair and i dropped to the pavement rolling under the car my cheek burned from the pavement and i held my breath as the wind shifted my hair then it was gone and i looked up to see it swooping around holy crap i had to do something is it a demon jenks shrilled inches from my face as i rolled out from under the car and got to my feet squinting in the sun as i wiped the grit from my palms trent looked shaken as he crouched beside the car and ivy was helping vivian off the ground pixies were a cloud over them drawn to the very person who had caused their kinsmens deaths well is it jenks asked again i dont know dazed i looked at the frightened pixies seeking shelter with us a daywalking demon it couldnt be but as i looked at trent i had a bad feeling that it was just trying to help eh thanks a hell of a lot what is that thing vivian asked i think its a demon trent said trying to wave the pixies away you think i exclaimed but the hard look he gave me stopped my next words cold ivy looked up from wiping her palms and even jenks turned hovering in the hot air over the car and as trent slid his gaze to vivian then back to me my jaw clenched and i remained silent i could say nothing if the coven knew hed summoned a demon even to help us his words in my defense would mean nothing damn it damn it all to the turn and back it cant be vivian scoffed missing the hatred i directed at trent its daylight its coming back the pixy leader exclaimed scatter no come closer i called out jenks get them closer then immediately wished i hadnt as he laboriously flew from the car to try to corral them so trent had summoned a demon to help us god save me from businessmen with too much money and not enough to do i thought as i leaned against the car and tried to imagine a circle big enough to hold us all it would be large for most witches but i could do it it wouldnt hold long either but if i did it right it would give me time to make a real one the pixies vacillated between following their leader now flying away and jenks almost browbeating them to get them to the car croaking three times the huge bird came at us talons outstretched i quivered remembering the time id been a mouse an undrawn circle wont hold trent said softly his eyes wide as he stood beside me two of the pixy leaders at his shoulder stupidass elf might get hurt but the demon couldnt snatch him and he knew it you need to shut up i snarled starting to shake i think youve helped out enough for one day okay he dropped his head and rocked back looking not nearly chagrined enough turning to the approaching bird i touched the line pulling it into me and imagining the strongest birdhating circle i could think of oh god the yellow claws looked as big as tree roots and they were getting bigger now jenks shouted rhombus i screamed flinging my hand out to give my spell more strength i went down on one knee as i pushed the energy out of me instead of letting it flow naturally with a clap of sound that reverberated like thunder my bubble flashed into existence screeching the bird tried to backwing head flung high and claws yanked tight to its body hold i whispered hands in fists as it hit oh god please hold the bird hit and i shook bowing my head as the impact reverberated through me and then my circle fell panting i looked up the bird had glanced off the top of the bubble pulling up enough to avoid a full necksnapping strike tumbling it hit the ground getting smaller as it rolled across the parking lot and smacked into a rock did you kill it trent said rachel did you kill it he sounded frightened and i gave him an ugly look for all the smooth callousness he showed the world perhaps he wasnt as immune to death as he wanted everyone to think we should be so lucky i said sourly crabwalking a quick circle around the car with the chalk to make a more secure barrier ivy looked frustrated pixies perched around her for security since trent had driven them from himself vivian was pale scared the lump of feathers now lying at the base of the rock wasnt moving but i invoked the circle shaking in the hot sun waiting are you going to go look at it vivian asked and jenks landed on my shoulder yeah right jenks said dusting heavily in exhaustion you dont poke the monster when its down you run away im not getting out of this circle i said give it an hour or two and if he still doesnt move we can throw rocks at him demon i was starting to believe that it was one trent edged closer stopping when i gave him a withering look but whether we should poke the downed bird or simply drive away became moot when the lump of black shifted and stirred fear tightened my shoulders as a man rose shedding feathers the footlong shafts of obsidian gray falling from him to reveal the simply cut gray pants and shirt underneath and the soft gray slippers his slate gray hair was silver where the light hit it and when he turned he smiled as if pleased that id hurt him he was taller than me pale silver shiny demon i glanced at trent thinking id rather have him as an enemy than a friend if this was his idea of helping trents head was down and it ticked me off that i was the reason he was safe and the rest of us werent god i was a fool al had been right vivian was staring slackjawed at the approaching form and jenks hovered at the edge of the bubble hands on his hips as he assessed the new threat ivy was scared but trying not to show it as the demon came to a halt before us looking stronger and more certain of himself he looked young even with the silver hair and i squirmed when his goatslitted eyes moved from vivian to me but its daylight vivian whispered and kusox smiled in delight his attention leaving me to touch upon trent and slide away cant touch this his look at me had been one of casual disinterest bet it wouldnt stay that way its the kusox the pixies shouted from the car and ivy waved at them to go away as they swarmed her the kusox shakuru im the eater the narrowfaced man said and i breathed crap his voice was as gray as he was silver and gray with a weird accent id heard only once it was newts kusox squinted at my bubble making me even more nervous as he leaned one way then the next evaluating its size and the black haze of demon smut crawling over it i blanched when i realized the smut crawling over my bubble was being attracted to him congregating where he was looking like it was trying to get to him guys i said wishing i could back up even more i dont think i can hold a drawn circle this size against him no you cant kusox said his eyes landing on me arent you an odd sort of witch he breathed deep surprise cascading through his expression wearing a mans clothes he added his bloodred eyes shifting to a pale blue how curious youre female look out jenks shrilled but i was suddenly gagging my hands digging at kusoxs fingers gripping my throat he had me his hands lightly around my neck as my feet dangled somehow he had yanked me out of my circle broken it without a thought it was too large for me to hold against him and hed taken it from ivys and jenkss shouts of protest i guessed that vivian had reset the circle she wouldnt have a chance of holding it either except kusox didnt seem to care about them anymore no i was freaking demon candy it must be the red hair wait i choked out still able to breathe and feeling his fingers firm around my neck he didnt stink like a demon and his eyes though still slitted like a goats had become a pale blue with a thin rim of slate gray on the edges his lips were thin and his chin was narrow al had once said he could change his eyes if he made the effort had kusox made the effort or were his eyes naturally blue fear was a cascade of sparkles through me and i shuddered as my toes touched the earth uh can we talk i managed and the man smiled wider his teeth were flat and blocky like als and very white can we talk he echoed softly looking at me in a notsonice way perhaps helllooo he drawled nice to meet you little redhaired witch let me out vivian jenks shrilled and i tried to see them dont you dare i managed then looked back to kusox as the grip around my throat shifted to my shoulders and my heels touched the pavement i could breathe freely again and my gaze was fixed on the mandemonkusox washedout pale blue eyes flicked behind me then back i dont know who you are i said boldly his long narrow fingers pinching my shoulder but you need to leave brave he said and i punched him in the gut when he tried to tuck me under his arm i didnt know what my fist connected with but he dropped me i got a gasp of breath in and then the pavement hit me hard the chalk was still in my hand and i refused to open it kusoxs slippers were inches from my eyes and my knuckles were bleeding scraped open when i fell i still had my chalk damn it i still had my chalk i could hear ivy yelling at vivian and i prayed shed keep her circle closed let me handle this i warned everyone pulling my head up to see ivy ready to throw vivian into her own circle and risk all their lives please i begged ivy and with a pained expression she let vivian go the coven witch hit the car and slid to the pavement shaken trent was a silent observer and jenks i looked away jenks was beside himself kusox only laughed but he looked cross as he felt his ribs youll be my first in a long time he said bending down to look at me with his hands on his knees do you have anything in particular youre not fond of shove it up your ass i panted kusox straightened ladys choice he said then reached for my shoulder owwww i howled as he flooded me with energy pissed i rose up under his hand shocking the hell out of him as i spindled the force and flung it right back at him knock it off i shouted as he staggered back his silver clothes seeming to shift to black in the sun kusox caught his balance eight feet away and blinked amazement on his thin face who the hell are you witch who dresses like a man i took a breath to tell him to screw himself my words going unsaid as my head seemed to explode gasping i fell to my knees he was in my head oh god he was in my head i was seeing snatches of my life with him standing in the shadows an orderly at the hospital when i was thirteen his blue eyes mocking my pain as my dad lay dying then he was at camp on the horse behind mine then he was at the park walking the dog id seen when id made the deal with al he hadnt been at any of those places in reality but now as i lived it again he was there learning everything missing nothing get out i shouted hands on my head as i tried not to hammer my forehead into the pavement rachel mariana morgan kusox said flinging a hand out i heard ivy fall back with a grunt the circle was down no please no who has been teaching you such dangerous tricks kusox said and there was a touch on my shoulder soft and hesitant go tohell i panted no not that memory i thought in anguish as i saw his reflection in the mirror while i held kisten as he died algaliarept the stitching in kusoxs sleeves glinted in the sun as he threw magic at jenks and i felt tears form falling hot on my knees they were trying to fight him as i sat crumpled on the hot pavement living my life for the demon why is the dullard letting you wander about here in the sun little familiar get out of my head i breathed as i tried not to remember that i wasnt a familiar but almost an equal get out oh he exclaimed suddenly as a memory of trent grew strong jonathan was there his face having kusoxs eyes and then i was gasping my fisted hand scraping the pavement as i tried to get up alone again in my thoughts panting i bowed my head as the heat soaked into me oh god it had been awful my life hed seen my entire life you can invoke demon magic kusox said softly bending over me with the faintest hint of burnt amber between us but if it was from him or me i didnt know my breath came in fast as i felt arms go around me head lolling i tried to focus failing he was holding me and i was too tired to even protest id lived my entire life in eight heartbeats and the heat washed out of me as i fell into shock sstop i managed jerking when kusox murmured a word of latin and vivian cried out in pain the only reason they were still alive was because he was interested in me my hand was in a fist and he brought my bleeding knuckles up to his mouth licking my blood working at it i managed to focus on him he had a scar on his eyelid like lee hed be minus an eye if i could move my other arm youre a link he said grinning at me like hed won a doll at the fair and you have red hair and wear pants i adore red hair i once gave an entire generation of witches that color that was before they locked me in the ground put me down i demanded and he did holding me until i got my balance but when i tried to escape his grip tightened about my waist seems as if i got out just in time he murmured looking me over again why are you dallying with algaliarept hes a hack but then hes probably the best they have now unless newt is still alive ive been gone for squinting he looked up at the sun in evaluation somewhere in the vicinity of two thousand years frowning his gaze dropped to me two thousand years and you have red hair hows that for a legacy he seemed happy about it but i was still trying to stand on my own feet i didnt like what i was hearing and i was sure vivian was even more pleased than she had been kusox was indeed a demon in the sun i needed answers but i wanted them from al notcute socks here vivian was ashen faced standing in front of the car with a bit of chalk in her hand there was an uninvoked circle around kusox and me and her intent was clear ivy was next to her and jenks the wild pixies still with us were under the car i met jenkss eyes and he shrugged pantomiming slugging him might work i thought id have a better chance of holding him in a smaller circle than keeping him out of one as large as a car my heart pounded and i pulled my foot back and slammed it into kusoxs shin the demon howled his grip easing just enough roll jenks shouted and i dove for the pavement feeling vivians circle lick my heels as i made it through a grunt slipped from me as i hit the parking lot again finding my feet a little more slowly hand still clenched around my chalk i turned panting the demon was in a circlea covenmade circleand it wasnt going to hold sure enough kusox was pushing at it with a determined expression smoke rising from where his fingers touched the familiar scent of burnt amber grew obvious and i scrambled into motion hunched i crabwalked around vivians circle praying that the magnetic chalk wouldnt skip wouldnt leave a gap it had to be perfect and it still might not hold rhombus i inhaled as i finished sitting back on the hot asphalt as the circle formed son of a were whore kusox shouted as his smoldering fist broke through vivians barrier only to smack into mine yanking his hand back he shook it as if stung his washedout eyes dropped to mine and i scooted back it was perfect it would hold it had to i couldnt hold him vivian panted and i looked to her haggard and slumped against the car i jumped at ivys touch then relaxed as she helped me up you okay she asked and i nodded slowly her touch slipped away and i took a deep breath as if trying to find myself trent was leaning against the car avoiding everyones eyes bastard i exhaled scooting back a little more before i got up and wiped the grit from my palms thank you i said to vivian as i tucked the chalk in my waistband then glanced at trent wondering what the hell his game was idiot summoned a demon he couldnt control what did he expect to happen i couldnt hold him vivian said again and i shuffled to her tired the upside at least now the coven had proof that demons could be in reality while the sun was up al had done it once while in lees body but i didnt think kusox was possessing anyone this was something different swell i couldnt hold him vivian said a third time and i frowned pierce might have been able to make a circle to hold him but he wasnt here hes a big guy i finally said glancing at kusox and away everyone okay much to my relief kusox didnt start spouting threats or monologing and the chorus of pixy shouts brought back memories of jenkss kids memories that kusox had now i didnt like that if he knew my history then he knew what i was going to do to him it wasnt even a very big circle clearly shaken vivian sat sideways in the open front seat dejected and weary i looked back at kusox patiently waiting and vivians useless scratchings on the pavement its a tough world limping to ivy i leaned back against the warm car i dont know this one i said talking to vivian but accusing trent hes nasty nasty kusox said and my eyes jerked to his at the hidden threat his words held if you ever touch me again i said softly i will explode your nads got it trent had his head down in thought worrying me if i wasnt so darn tired i would have barked at him too demon i started and kusox grinned in anticipation making me shiver he wanted to be released wait trent said his hand outstretched you will leave this place and return to the everafter not to bother us again i finished trent slid to a stop turning away to hide his disgust but id seen it for now kusox said his eyes going from trent to me they vanished first then his body until finally all that was left was a black obsidian feather making me shudder when it finally melted in the sun my eyes shut and i heard ivy sigh i really hate demons she said i agreed okay everyone smaller than a teapot get out of the car i said loudly jenks you stay and i swear if you feral pixies give me any trouble im going to jam you all in a box ill send you your syrup by mail and youll be happy with it clear without a protest the pixies began to leave in threes and fives their excited chatter making my already pounding headache hurt all the more the head pixy wasnt around and i didnt care like hed ever say thankyou my headache throbbed when trent walked stiffly past me sweat matting his pale babyfine hair letting him go like that was a mistake he said in passing and i lashed out spinning him around to a shocked angry halt against the car you think we could have used him i shouted and ivy putting my scrying mirror away in the trunk hesitated maybe traded a jump to seattle for his freedom stick to helping with your checkbook well all live longer jaw clenched trent held his ground as jenks joined me im just saying nothing okay i was shouting but i had a lot of adrenaline to burn before i got back in that car and drove out of here as if nothing had happened that was a demon one in the sun you think youre smarter than him youre not you mess with demons and you die his gaze flicked to vivian you work with them he said think youre special that had been barbed and pointed and it made me angrier still i wish i wasnt trent i said managing not to shove him im so special its going to kill me that one i pointed to my empty circle that one is bad banishing him might cause a problem tomorrow but nothing like keeping him around and trying to harness him would and the sooner you get that through your thick skull the longer we all will live it was my decision to banish him and you will sit down shut up and enjoy the ride he finished the last of his suave businessman exterior vanishing as he bent at the waist and smoothly slipped into the car he slid to the opposite side and slammed the door shut waiting ivy gave me an unreadable look scratching her neck as she got in the backseat beside him and rolled the window down i was hot and sticky and vivian slid across the bench seat to put herself behind the wheel freeing me to weave my way through a passel of pixies and ride shotgun i got in feeling trents glare on the back of my neck the heat of the sun on the fake leather seats warm under me my neck itched and i realized that wed been pixed somewhere along the way damn it this was not my day i thought you were tired i said as i looked across the seat at vivian and she frowned im awake now saying nothing more she cranked the engine over and i fiddled with the vents aiming them at me i felt awful not having showered two mornings in a row the pixies were gone and i whistled for jenks he zipped into the car without his usual flair almost falling as he latched on to the stem of the rearview mirror his long curly hair swung as he dusted heavily and i wondered where during the last miles hed lost his hair band thanks for driving vivian i said and she carefully pulled out onto the road actually using her turn signal the young woman was silent pensive as she rolled her window up while the airconditioning took over he pushed through my circle like it was nothing she said gaze flicking to me and back to the road looking embarrassed and what was he doing in the sun she looked at me scared did you call it i rubbed the blood off my knuckles stiffening as i forced myself not to turn and glare at trent my blood looked like anyone elses but everyone who had blood like mine died unless theyd had three years of illegal genetic tinkering disguised as summer camp did you she asked again frightened and i shook my head staying silent jenkss wings clattered and i couldnt meet his eyes trents voice might be all that stood between me and an alcatraz jail cell and i wasnt going to get him labeled as a demon summoneryet jenks would be quiet too and ivy demons are coming vivian i said as i rolled my window up and angled the vents to me theyre finding ways around the rules the genetic checks and balances have been broken and the demon genome is going to repair itself were going to become who we were maybe not this generation maybe not the next but when it happens the witches can either be ready or they can be pixies being eaten by giant birds vivian stared at the road her thoughts on my words i have to get to san francisco i have to talk to the coven me too leaning back i turned my face to be in the light seeing the bloodred spots of sun even behind my eyelids i didnt want to be labeled a black witch and imprisoned but i was giving the coven a very clear picture of what might happen if they let me live and i couldnt stop myself twelve the warmth of the sun on my face turned into an irritating come and go of shadow and light and i stretched the crackle of a fastfood bag reminded me of why my back ached and why i was sleeping sitting up feeling fuzzy i opened my eyes glancing at vivian currently alternating her attention between the busy urban street and the clock she was trying to change it must have been the beeps that woke me up apparently wed crossed into another time zone sixeighteen but i felt like it was nine somewhere id missed another meal vivian gave me a quick neutral smile and turned away i looked up at the washedout buildings on either side wishing i had my sunglasses we were off the interstate and there were palm trees but it didnt look like la the timing wasnt right either the street was busy clogged with traffic and people pedestrians were everywhere and my eyes widened at the three guys dressed in velvet capes vampires in the sun living to be sure but they were gothed to the max where are we i asked las vegas trent said from the back his voice sour vegas lips parting i sat up and looked a little closer oh yeah where else would you get a pyramid and the eiffel tower on the same street leaning over i found the map at my feet why are we in vegas i thought we were headed for la which probably had vampires roaming the streets in capes as well come to think of it vivian tightened her grip on the wheel as if id brought up a sore subject her professionalism was running thin and the petite woman frowned im not driving to bakersfield she said through clenched teeth were going the long way my gaze went to ivy in a question and she shrugged whats wrong with bakersfield i finally asked feeling the tension between vivian and trent nothing vivian frowned but she still looked cute tired but cute its im worried about there are no gas stations after kingman and we would have run out someones bad planning trent said softly the right person could make a killing vivian made a huff of noise someones good planning and make a killing is right the people there dont want anyone driving through going to vegas doesnt add much time stop complaining we all want to get to the west coast as soon as possible i hid a smile apparently vivian and trent hadnt been getting along either settling myself i ogled the people and buildings acting like the midwestern goober i was id never seen so many flamboyant people flaunting their differences it was easy to pick out the tourists with their pale faces and cameras id never thought of myself as a conservative person but this was like halloween and mardi gras lumped together a true inderland playground as long as we dont stop i said thinking it would be easy to lose a day here were stopping ivy said voice low and confident from behind me trent muttered she speaks so we must obey you showered this morning ivy said more loudly than she needed to i showered this morning vivian and rachel didnt and rachel fought off a demon in hundreddegree heat we can stop for an hour there was a hesitation followed by a soft besides im hungry fine trent said sounding like a passiveaggressive teenage girl but when we get back in the car im driving a shower sounded more than good and worried about the backseat dynamics i stretched again could you pick me up a burger or something i said around a yawn eying a tall blond vamp pacing down the sidewalk in sixinch heels her clothes hardly covering her important bits the faster we get out of here the better burgers trents voice dripped disdain and my tension spiked we are in vegas this is the first time we might find something that passes for food and you want burgers i turned in my seat surprised by how tired he looked washed out and worried trent was never worried not enough to let it show anyway dude why dont you stop and think about what your mouth is saying i said tightly children vivian said not entirely joking if you dont stop arguing im driving right through i turned back around and trent muttered i get to pick the restaurant ivy sighed and the hotel he added and she growled in annoyance i suddenly felt a whole lot ickier and hungry leaning forward i began tidying the front seat tucking the map away and picking up trash more milk duds boxes jenks you okay i asked still not having seen him it wasnt like him to miss a chance to join in with picking on trent and he wasnt on his usual seat on the rearview mirror peachy came his voice from under the napkin draped over the open dash ashtray hes altitude sick ivy said i resisted lifting the napkin but just are you okay i asked again eying the white square you dont sound good leave me alone he said a green dust spilling over the rim of the ashtray then sifting to the floor of the car ill be fine you want some pop or anything it wasnt the right thing to say in a flurry of motion jenks flung the napkin off flying to an empty cup and throwing up in it his wings flat against his back as he retched oh god trent exclaimed hes doing it again jenks i exclaimed almost frantic i mean when someone throws up youre supposed to hold their hair back or make sure nothing hits their shoes and i was way too big to do either hes fine trent said so callously that i glared at him theres some honey on the dash it helps i was ready to smack him but vivian handed me the packet saying flagstaff was really hard hell be okay i dont feel so good jenks said flying wobbly as he got back to his nest i shoved the cup in the bag with the rest of the trash really worried i knew jenks tried to hide it but if he didnt eat every couple of hours he suffered throwing up could be a big problem are you sure youre okay i asked as i tore open the packet and set it next to him looking pale he pulled a pair of chopsticks from his back pocket nodding my head hurts eating a bit he sighed slumping to fall back when vivian stopped at a light we were right on the strip but worried about jenks i couldnt look up to see the sights better he said with a sigh then gave me a look of clarity before the honey kicked in ill be okay just keep the honey coming i exhaled relieved hed tell me if there was a real problem wouldnt he just what we need i said finding a smile a drunk pixy in vegas well fit right in not if i eat it slow enough he said easing back looking relaxed but worn out crap now i have to pee my smile turned real and i looked out the window at the people i wished i had my camera but then id stick out well stick out more than two witches a vamp an elf and a pixy in a powder blue buick with ohio plates already did but then i saw the pack of weres trotting down the sidewalk and i decided we didnt stick out at all i said i have to pee jenks said again louder this time and i appreciated that he wasnt going to go in a cup vivian leaned forward as she made a turn hold on i know a quiet hotel off the strip off the strip trent complained and i realized just how this trip was wearing on all of us we are not stopping at some werebitten hole in the wall when we can stay at a decent establishment vivian said nothing as she pulled my moms car into a lowbudget chain with very little neon on the sign were not staying she said when trent voiced his disgust were taking a break and were stopping here because you wont get past the front desk of one of the big hotels without being recognized she turned to him her childlike face smiling cattily you want to be recognized trent said nothing and satisfied she put the car in park at the front office youve been nothing but a pain in the ass she said as she grabbed her purse just about the only thing she had since wed kidnapped her no wonder rachel doesnt like you i dont like you and i like everyone his hand went to his chin and trent silently looked out the window clearly peeved but seeing her logic ivy though was stirring putting her boots back on and grabbing her purse is that elvis i had to ask seeing a were in a white leisure suit and gold boots coming out of the office door the stitching was glowing in the shadows the man was wearing neon and he had a chihuahua in his arms the dogs collar was neon too vivian reached for the door handle barely glancing at him thats bob and chico she said shortly i lived here before i moved to the coast well not here exactly but just outside town the ley lines are spectacular really i thought as she opened her door and got out id heard they were numerous but i had always thought it was part of the sell line everyone stays here okay she said from outside looking harassed a hand on her hip and her clothes rumpled she hadnt put on any makeup and her onceslick hair was more like straw now it made her trendy purse look like a cheap knockoff ill get a room and then you can all go get something to eat she said eyes narrowed in annoyance i dont need a bunch of you in the office with me i can handle this ivy of course was getting out and vivian gave her a tired look i dont trust you ivy said with absolutely no remorse or guilt no hard feelings none taken the small woman said with the same detachment the rest of you stay jenkss wings hummed but he didnt move from the tissuelined ashtray i gotta pee he grumbled but vivian had shut the door and the two walked in together vivian looking small next to ivys bruised and battered height i really have to pee he said again this time his eyes beseechingly on mine i cranked the window all the way down and he rose unsteadily into the air when did vivian become everyones mother i said and he flew in a wobbling path outside stay close okay i said noticing that he didnt have a scrap of red on him yeah whatever he said then flew giggling to the sheared rosemary lining the path to the door i watched him unable to stop my sigh silence descended and as the insects buzzed i became keenly aware of trent in the back he had summoned a demon not once but twice a daywalking demon he said hed done it to help i wanted to believe him but this had to stop he wasnt proficient with magic and he was doing more harm than good twisting to see trent i said we need to talk his eye twitched without a word he unlocked his door and pushed it open his foot catching the heavy door as it bounced back into him getting out he shut the door and leaned against it his back to me as he looked toward the strip a few blocks away peeved my eyes narrowed i was too tired right now to push the issue after i had a burger id pin him to the wall and demand some answers even though we were off the strip there was a definite flow of people headed for it passing us with either a fast pace with loud chatter or silent with a dull drudgery the highmagic amulet detector on my bag was glaring red but the lethalmagic one was quiet remembering what vivian had said i reached for a ley line to see how some little city in the desert stacked up to my cincinnati oh my god i breathed as the reason for my slight headache became apparent the ley lines were everywhere thick thin long and short crisscrossing in a chaotic mess in every compass direction it looked like someone had dropped a handful of pickup sticks las vegas was on a damn rift or something time fractured and barely holding together awed i shook myself from the mental sight of so much power hovering over the desert sand then promptly sneezed my hair flying in my face at the quick jerk oh great i thought as i wiped my nose but the sun was still up so there was no reason not to answer al if al it was leaning over to the drivers seat i popped the trunk and got out what are you doing trent asked belligerently as i shuffled through the trunk for my scrying mirror giving him an insincere smile as i pulled it out you ever use my mirror without my knowledge again and im going to bust it over your head i said and we are going to talk we could all have gotten killed back there or worse leave the magic to the professionals businessman he frowned as he took in my threat and he looked like a spoiled brat standing there with his arms over his middle wearing black from head to toe a slight flush to his cheeks damn he looked good though and i sneezed again as i sat down leaving my door open for the cross breeze trent turned to watch me set the mirror on my lap and i shivered as the cold glass seemed to adhere to me going right through my jeans the silverandwine color threw back the haze of the setting sun looking more beautiful yet another sneeze shook me and i frowned yup it was al ignoring trent as he moved around the car to better spy on me i put my hand on the scrying mirror in the cave of the pentagram i connected to one of the smaller lines and the rest was easy rachel calling al come in al i thought dryly the link formed in an instant with a fury that left me blinking son of a bitch echoed in my thoughts foreign adrenaline slamming into me al was in pain he wasnt talking to me he was in excruciating mindnumbing pain al i thought confused as flashes of power and halfunderstood spells roared through my consciousness too fast to be realized my lips parted and i pressed my hand more firmly into the glass furious latin uncoiled from his mind as he twisted communal stored spells they rose from the depths of two thousand years created during a time of war and all the uglier for having been roused and thrust into existence with no warning black and sickly i felt them pass through my mind coating me in als memory of what it was like to be in pain and how to crush another with ones thoughts al i screamed into our shared thoughts scared that the magic might turn on me he was pulling on a line through me and damn it if it didnt feel good even as i tried to cut him off get over here rachel i need yourow al thought as he finally heard me but then his splinter of awareness jerked away and his howl at a burst of energy created to liquidize fat burned itself into my brain he nullified it in an instant leaving me dizzy and panting but knowing how to do it al i thought but i must have said it aloud because trents shadow covered me whats going on trent asked more irritation than concern in his tone heat exploded in my chest and al and i both reactedhim with a furious shout and a thrown counterspell me slamming my rising palm back to the mirror before my fingertips could leave the glass line give me a line al thought and i did loosening my grip and letting the energy flow through my hand and into his mind the pain cut off and i groaned in relief my hand was trembling and i pressed it more firmly into the scrying mirror i looked up feeling unreal past the car windows the sky had gone hazy with red and the gritty wind was blowing somehow i was using my second sight seeing las vegas as if it was on fire it looked like hell the casinos and buildings burning crumbling and reforming to crumble again it had to be from the ley lines there were so many that nothing was stable i stared transfixed as in the back of my mind al moved dodged and fought someone using spells so complex they looked like another language rachel whats going on trent asked again his voice a faint buzzing as i struggled to hold my connection to al hed all but forgotten me as he fought al was fighting handtohand teeth clenched as he struggled to keep something from his eye al i shouted shoving the line into him it burned through his mind and he groaned directing it into his attackers face outside the car an explosion in the everafter ripped off the corner of a building i watched in awe as it fell in slow motion a red dust rising from the impact in als kitchen i felt him shove someone away and al rolled to his knees his savagery making my lips pull back in a snarl i blinked and i was suddenly seeing realitythe demolished building became whole and serene its elevator rising up the windows glittering with neon trent touched my shoulder and i jumped as our auras connected from als kitchen a savage explosion shook me the curse falling from als lips was like tinfoil between my teeth serrating into my spine and brain and trent felt it too i gasped as al pulled on not only me but trent and with a bellow of rage al flung the ball of death hed pulled from us across his kitchen exploding it against a quick black figure with silver hair the attacker hit the wall the tapestry that i hated going up in green flames the fabric screamed and with a clap of rushing air the figure attacking al vanished on the floor the tapestry shrieked and writhed as if in pain trents yelp of shock echoed in me as he pulled away stunned i sat alone with my hand on the mirror a slithering blackness had risen and i felt it settle over al as he huddled on his cold black floor whispering i take this i take this before the smut could hurt him i shivered as the smut lapped about my consciousness touching me and recoiling like a living thing before it slid back to al sweet everlasting shit were in trouble i felt in our joined thoughts the attacker was gone and i cut off the energy flowing between us al i cautiously offered and i felt his consciousness gather trying to pretend that he hadnt almost just died rachel he started and then we both clenched in pain a new rush of adrenaline poured into me and i heard in our joined thoughts you little runt there was another grunt of pain and i doubled over with a pop i felt als thoughts leave mine it wasnt the snap of disconnection because i could still feel what he was feeling it was something else something was wrong and this time al was in trouble his mind wasnt working at all al i shouted forcing my thoughts into his and finding a glimmer bring me across i gasped as my body dissolved in a flash of thought there was the burst of an expanded awareness and then the awful division of self when i was again alone in the universe a ping of fear lit through me with a speed that left me reeling i was yanked through the nearest ley line stumbling as i suddenly found myself holding my scrying mirror and standing in als acridsmelling kitchen a thick haze of dust in the air stinking of burnt amber choked me and the only light was coming from a book burning in the corner chunks of rock had been gouged out of the raised circular fire pit where al twisted his larger curses more chunks of rock from the ceiling littered the floor if it was wood it was charred if it was glass it was broken the tapestry was silent a liquid black dripping from it like blood as it hung askew half on the floor before the smaller hearth on his back was al out cold and bleeding from several gashes as he lay before the black fireplace and over him was pierce a black ball of death in his hand pierce i shouted and he turned shocked what are you doing here he exclaimed the blackness in his hands flickering al groaned pierce spun to him latin coming from him fast as als eyes opened in fear i didnt think just moved slipping on the chalky stone dust i lunged at pierce knocking him from al and landing front first across the demon frantic i scrambled up hearing al grunt in pain as my elbow dug into his gut almost in the fireplace pierce had gotten to his feet as well the invoked curse still in his grasp for an instant our eyes locked and then after shaking his head he threw the spell at al what is he doing rhombus i shouted and pierces curse hit pinging through my awareness as i slapped his magic aside it went spinning into the broken remains of als kitchen and my anger peaked are you addled pierce yelled his blue eyes showing his anger as he stood his hands bereft of magic what the blazes are you doing at my feet al groaned and i felt a twinge on my awareness as a redsheened sheet of everafter coated him dropping away to leave him looking half dead but no longer bleeding i had him pierce shouted arms waving i bloody had him and you knock me away deflect my curse whats wrong with you woman i could have been free my mouth dropped open and i glanced down at al gazing up at me holy crap had i just saved als life uh i stammered as al levered himself up onto one elbow his head drooping to the floor and his dark hair covering his eyes i had one chance pierce shouted shaking as he stood by the fireplace and septiens al wheezed and pierce collapsed seizing as if having hit an electrical field al wait i shouted seeing pierce writhe and you blew it the demon said ignoring me as he staggered to his feet before the small hearth his red goatslitted eyes fixed on pierce killing me when im downnot very sporting my heart pounded and i remembered the ugliness leaking out of pierces hand pierce was a demon killer and i was basically a demon would he try to kill me next i had to believe no but i hadnt thought hed try to kill al either i hadnt thought at all apparently let him go i pleaded as pierce shook his neck muscles straining as he tried to breathe al i shouted smacking the demons shoulder it wasnt hard just enough to get his attention for a long second al looked at me his goatslitted eyes searching mine then pierces breath rasped in and his entire body went flaccid panting he lay on the floor and didnt move perhaps youre right al said looking disheveled as he leaned against the fireplace and eyed his kitchen halfburned wood was scattered on the floor and the book in the corner was going out seeing it al snarled and muttered a word at pierce pierce screamed shocked into pain again as his back arched selling him might pay for this mess al finished his expression ugly i reached out to protest then hesitated pierce had saved my life but he had tried to kill al stop i finally whispered touching als sleeve but what i was thinking was why did i help you if id let pierce kill him all my troubles would have been over except they wouldnt have been al was my protection in a world that i was probably going to be trapped in very soon al frowned and he looked at me as if only now seeing the dirt grime and bruises he twitched and i heard pierce collapse behind me my gut unclenched as it grew quiet pierces breath sobbing in and out in relief part of me was angry part of me wanted to lift pierce up and wash off his face i didnt know which part was stronger moving slowly al staggered to the stone bench circling the center fire pit coughing on the dust as he began arranging sticks for a fast fire his fingers were shaking it was dark and i looked for a candle to light all i found were puddles of wax spattered like blood at a loss as to what to do i looked at the devastation then went to help pierce you did this i asked as i pulled him upright against the broken remains of a bookcase and pierce winced his eyes still closed the shelves were leaning askew and a thick tome fell glancing against his shoulder still he didnt open his eyes but pushed me away grimacing id seen them fight before almost a year ago pierce had gone into this familiar partnership with the intent to kill al i hadnt thought he might actually do it he wishes als tone was flat and i turned to see his thick fingers nursing an infant fire in the circular fire pit hes a cowardly runt the new flame flickered lighting als features into an ugly mask and from pierce came a ragged i utilized my resources to the fullest demon spawn youre a bloody coward al shouted then coughed trying to kill me when i was down i stood between them not knowing who to help he had tried to kill al what happened i asked remembering the deadly worldkilling curses that al had drawn through me my god the power they could use and didnti was like a child playing and i suddenly felt both scared and stupid al looked up his wavering gaze landing immediately on pierce you go he said pointing and before pierce could do more than widen his eyes he vanished hey i exclaimed and al pushed himself up he looked beaten and his clothes were dusty showing blood and rips though the skin under them was unmarked hes alive the demon muttered dropping a chunk of what had once been his chair on the flames i simply shoved him in a box for when i decide what to do with him he tried to kill me please tell me you arent still clinging to the idea that he loooooves you he mocked that witch is a demon killer youre simply lower on his list than i am grow up and accept it i didnt want to believe it and i searched the floor hoping i hadnt cracked my scrying mirror pierce had said he loved me and i truly believed he hadnt been lying but the memory of him standing over al hurt and unconscious with a black curse flickering over his aura ready to kill himcould i afford that kind of blind trust depressed i picked my way through the devastation to get my scrying mirror breathing shallowly to avoid the dust feeling awkward i sat beside al the slight curve of the bench between us you dont look good i said my thoughts on vivian trent would tell them what had happened jenks would be angry that he hadnt been there ivy would be ticked because trent hadnt done anything and vivian would have another chapter in her lets shun rachel book even better i was going to stink like burnt amber when i got back if i got back i dont look good al wiggled his fingers at his own scrying mirror just out of reach and i leaned over to get it feeling a dizzying amount of other selves trying to get through to him as i handed it over he wasnt wearing his usual gloves and it made him look vulnerable exhaling heavily al put his thickfingered shaking hand on the mirror and it fogged up you say i dont look good but youre the one in trouble my gaze went from his foggy mirror to my crystalline one but i stopped him not that al said and he let his mirror slide to the bench sighing he rubbed his forehead leaving a smear of black ash ive temporally blocked the collective because i cant answer that many calls at once but pretty soon im going to be entertaining lots and lots of irate angry demons in my tiny little living room it will be embarrassing my reputation will be utterly ruined i dont have enough chairs he finished lightly turning his lip in and chewing on it you mean trent i said standing up and distancing myself with the excuse of gathering bits of broken furniture i told you already i didnt teach him anything but a sliver of worry had started to wiggle in me trent had summoned a demon i hadnt taught him that but they wouldnt believe me al chuckled low and long and i stifled a shiver if only it was that he said wryly i know youre driving to your little witches meeting tell me you werent in st louis yesterday oh god im in trouble the arch falling was not my fault i babbled the broken chair leg in my hand clattering to the floor it was trent he did it not me damn my dame it was you al said grimacing as if hed eaten something sour it was trent i said wondering how he knew the arch had fallen but my voice lacked conviction and i became more worried yet when al wouldnt look at me nervous i tucked my rank hair behind an ear and fidgeted i dont know what kind of spin i can put on this al finally said his eyes on his dirty fingers and his shoulders slumped al i said really concerned he looked up and i blanched at his empty expression and then this afternoon he said reaching out to rub my hair between his fingers i didnt pull away and he leaned forward to sniff it you were in the badlands of arizona yes he asked looking up at me from around his sweatsoaked bangs i didnt feel so good and i sat down a hand to my middle this is about kusox isnt it i said more of a statement than a question he made a sighing groan and i knew it was then youve met he said his thoughts clearly on the daywalking demon funny you dont look dead his hand touched my chin shifting it so he could see where id been pixed the blisters itchy and red im surprised you survived the little designer dump i nearly didnt at least he doesnt know who you are yet i winced and als hand fell away he knows doesnt he al said flatly and i nodded making the connection now between kusox and the shadowy figure id seen fighting al before id come over and found pierce ready to finish him off maybe i shouldnt have banished kusox to the everafter he lived my entire life in eight heartbeats i admitted i tried not to whine but i knew by als so what rise to his eyebrows that it was there bet that was fun he said and i wondered if al could do the same and hadnt knowing it for the gross violation of self that it was not rape but worse almost that adds something a little unexpected to the mix he said as an afterthought sorry i said and al slumped rubbing his forehead with his stubby fingers from behind us the tapestry finally became quiet and the silence was almost creepier than the weird burbling sound it had been making licking my lips i stood what is he i asked a shiver went through me and i wondered if it was the need to feel like i wasnt alone that i wasnt a freak is he like me i asked lips barely moving als eyes were glowing in the light of the fire when i turned to him the demon seeming to be gaining strength as the flames warmed him still he said nothing and after dropping the broken seat of an upholstered chair on the fire i stood next to the weary demon seeing him slowly regain his strength and knowing that we were really really in trouble al i asked again hes you twin feelings of fear and excitement lit through me but the fear won if he was me and he was bad then everyone would think i was bad by association a link between demons and witches al continued nodding to acknowledge that i realized what this meant but not made by trents father kusox shakuru was our attempt to bridge the gap when we found out what the elves had done it didnt work he said sourly and we decided not to do thatanymore hes missing something yeah he looks a little crazy i said dryly crazy perhaps hes missing something from his soul al said and my lips parted that might explain him eating pixies i said and al cocked his head at me the glimmer of his usual bluster returning kusox was eating pixies cold i wrapped my arms around myself and sat down while al built the fire higher his chairs burning with the smell of varnish and burnt amber i shrugged then scratched at a little welt under my shirt trent thought we were in danger my fingers slowed and i tucked a foot under my leg as i gazed into the fire the idiot called kusox to get rid of the pixies he showed up as a bird and when kusox started eating themi looked up at ali hit him with a curse it sort of got his attention youre a bright girl for someone so stupid al said and i frowned affronted as he got to his feet and unsteadily went to his bookshelf nudging the books scattered on the floor until finding the one he wanted and retrieving it i told you to take that elf firmly in hand my itchy witch al sighed as he sat back down closer to the fire than before square reading glasses had appeared on als nose and he squinted through them as he turned the pages of the book on his lap that new mark of his makes him immune to everything his eyes met mine making me shiver despite my anger everything rachel hes probably the only person on the planet who could free kusox shakuru without getting killed in the process free him i asked al made a questioning face at me and i figured it out the arch falling the power id shoved back into someone kusox saying hed been gone for two thousand years locked in the ground you mean kusox was imprisoned under the arch trent didnt summon him he freed him i said aghast al had gone back to his book i told you to take him firmly in hand yeah i said seething stupid on top of stupid god i was ready to smack trent into next week but he loosed kusox before i gave him his freedom i said remembering the blood coming from trents ears and nose maybe trent was stronger than i gave him credit for al made an uninterested sound and turned a page and of course the first thing kusox did was find me because youre my teacher i said and al laughed the sound ending in a short cough no he said clearing his throat and waving his hand i shivered as the dust in the air fell like rain and i brushed it off not everything is about you itchy witch kusox and i go back a long way the son of a bitch completely yanked asia out of my grip just when things were becoming interesting i couldnt get a familiar there for nearly a hundred years until newt finally trapped him and tucked him safely away in reality the demon is a genius kusox was als rival great and he can be under the sun i prompted wondering if he had meant kusox was a genius or newt al blew the dust off a page and turned it that was the entire point of creating him he said distantly as if it bothered him and there was nothing he could do about it i wanted to go but i thought he was working on something for me the drip drip drip of the blood falling from the silent tapestry was loud and sullenly i said im sorry a short guffaw broke from al and he looked at me that makes me feel sooo much better ill be sure to tell everyone that my student freed her familiar who let loose a demon we didnt want to kill and just barely managed to imprison newt will be most vexed honestly you told me you were going to be smarter this isnt it its not like you ever tell me anything i said sourly if youd said dont go to st louis and free the crazy demon under the arch i wouldnt have nervousness pulled me to my feet and i went to the bookcase shelving the scattered books one by one in no particular orderwhich might be a problem since none of them had names and i didnt free kusox trent did what trent does is not my responsibility a hint of deviltry was in als voice when he asked me you severed all responsibility yes i said as i shelved another book one hundred percent you didnt even keep a callback clause al asked then waved his hand and answered his own question of course not youve had the worst upbringing of any demon ive seen i turned the book i held pulling the heat from me through the binding im not a demon i said and al stood to bring me the book he was looking at splayed open on his palm which emancipation clause did you use this one right i leaned over to look at the curse he was pointing to and though it was in a different book i could tell it was the same that looks like it al smiled and seeing it a knot of worry eased for the first time that awful smile of his made me feelgood trent is bound to come to your aid when you ask did you know that al snapped the book shut and shelved it beside the one id just placed there i think that puts him in a slightly higher standing thus freeing you from responsibility for his actions really i said willing to give trent the high ground if hed get in trouble not me his pace a jaunty limp al crossed his kitchen kicking bits of rock and wood out of his way i do believe your dogooder tendencies have finally come home to save you he said as he pulled a chest from the wreckage opened it and fingered through whatever was inside trents in trouble not you go back to your little scavenger hunt its not a scavenger hunt i said indignantly im trying to clear my name whatever al dramatically waved a silver amulet youre taking the runt with you pierce i came up from the floor with another book in my hand the image of him standing over al ready to kill him sifting through my mind he just tried to kill you yes but for all his anger he still thinks he loves you al squinted at the black jewel centered in the amulet muttering a word of latin to make the stone glow a brilliant silver and then darken youre going to need protection if kusox is free to come and go a demon killer is just the thing to keep you safe id do it myself but i dont want any taint of interference to mar our agreement that if you cant get your shunning removed you abandon reality al i protested thinking my strolling into the coven meeting with a witch theyd buried alive for black magic wasnt going to look good hes going to get me labeled a black witch al looked at me over his glasses almost pouting youre going to be labeled a black witch anyway love he smiled snapping the chest closed and dropping it down the stairway to his herb cellar to shatter by the sound of it remembering the look of fury on pierces face directed at me i shook my head reaching for books as fast as i could place them as if helping al clean up might win me some favor i do not want pierce tagging along on this magic carpet ride but just yesterday i had which is why this is so perfect smug al dramatically snapped his fingers cocky again in a soft pop of displaced air pierce flashed into existence his clothes disheveled and his hair everywhere immediately his confused look turned to one of angerdeepening when his gaze landed on me youre a mess al said almost his old self as he smacked the man so hard he stumbled the smack had been a curse of some sort because pierce stiffened shuddering as a sheet of red everafter coated him changing his outdated clothes into something more modern he was still wearing creased black pants and a longsleeved shirt but now there was a colorful patterned vest and a sharplooking trendy hat in his hand he looked good even with his hair disheveled and i squashed the thought youre going on a field trip runt al said as he looped the amulet hed taken from the chest over pierces head you will keep my student alive or die trying hands off pierce all but growled and al smacked his face taking the hat out of pierces hand and smashing it smartly on the witchs head i tensed but clearly pierce was used to the manhandling and he only frowned more deeply you will make sure that nasty demon kusox doesnt kill her al said conversationally understand youre angry but you still like her yes want to have wild demon sex with her even if she ruined your attempt to kill me keep her alive and you might get some eh eh youd like that mmmm al i protested and pierce looked at me like i was trash id sooner lie with a whore pierce said and i gasped affronted i halfexpected al to smack him again but all the demon did was brush off the amulet and say well shes been called that so wheres the problem al i exclaimed but no one cared better al said nodding once sharply as he took a step back and looked pierce over all nice and pretty for itchy witch pierce took his new hat off and dropped it to the dusty floor even though i saw that he liked it youre doing this because i can kill you i could kill you right this moment i gasped as al reached out and slapped him the sound of hand meeting flesh giving the fast movement away pierce reeled catching himself against the broken chair that had once belonged to ceri im getting rid of you al said calmly because youre a clever witch who wont stay in his box glaring pierce straightened from his half fall looking at me as if i was the source of his woes hey dude i wasnt the one trying to kill al al no this is not a good idea i said seeing pierces anger as i backed up a step its a capital idea al took three steps to close the distance between him and pierce the shorter man tensed but al only put an arm over his shoulder he looked like a dad threatening a date and i halfexpected him to tell pierce to have me home by ten but what he said was keep her alive keep her alive or i will know about it pierce looked at me and i remembered his hand painful against my mouth forcing me to be quiet as inches overhead trents horses and dogs searched the woods for my blood he loved me i was sure of it but he had tried to kill al with black magicand as the memory of him leaning over al with power leaking from his fingers replayed itself in my mind i began to question my judgment of him my face became cold as i abruptly realized that for all pierces claims of compassion for his clever mind and quick loyalty for all his justifications of black magic as acceptable if the cause was good pierce truly was a black witch he had tried to kill with magic it didnt matter if the charm was white black or polka dotted with silver sparkles the coven of moral and ethical standards had been right about him they were right and if they were right about him maybe they were right about me i dont care if she dies he said and i looked away remembering and i will cry when i go because i could love you forever son of a bitch id done it again al smacked pierces face a little too hard then lets just say you keep her alive or i will give you to kusox like a free toaster for opening an account in the bank of degradation pierce shoved als arm off him with an indignant look youll be dead first al shook his head i thought you might say that you will excuse me and itchy witch for a moment pierce opened his mouth to say something and al punched him hard i blinked shocked as pierce dropped and the demon swore and wrung his hand damn i forgot how much that hurt he said then reached down and hauled the unconscious wouldbe demon killer up by his vest front it was silk and linen enough to put even trents wardrobe to shame i stood there feeling like i should protest at the brutality but i didnt know what to think anymore pierce was black was i rachel al said as he held pierce like a drowned kitten im hanging by a thread both my life and my reputation take pierce and keep him away from me kusox is not crazy he is smart clever and has had two thousand years for his hatred of everyone on this side of the ley lines to fester into his chaotic nightmares he knows everything i do everything that newt has forgotten he cant be reasoned with or pacified were in trouble and i cant have a familiar who is ready to take advantage of a moments lapse pierce knows more than you and youll need him turn your feminine charms on and seduce him if you need to in order to have him save your scrawny witch ass god help me i thought no wonder the coven wanted to kill me pierce was a black witch and i had been defending him unaware of the confusion swirling through me als attention lingered on pierce i dont think hell ever forgive you for saving my life pride hes full of pride i shivered as his eyes came to me that same look of evaluation in thembut this time it was tempered with gratitude thank you he said as he shoved pierce at me forhelping me at a loss i took pierces weight staggering until i found a new balance no good deed and all i said not knowing how to say youre welcome i was glad id done it but did accepting his thanks mean that i was aligning myself with demons all the more did it even matter anymore unaware of my thoughts al nodded looking tired dont forget your mirror he said as he handed it to me and i struggled to hold it and pierce both and dont let your freed familiar use it again better and better i thought as i felt pierces weight vanish and then me too dissolve into nothing for the trip back to reality i hardly had time to form a protective bubble around myself and pierce before we misted back into reality my boot heels scraped as i got my balance i was standing in the sundrenched parking lot where the car had been the shadows had shifted and i let pierce slide to the pavement not caring how he hit the hot ground as long as my mirror didnt break from a secondstory walkway ivy vivian and jenks were collectively yelling at trent as they looked for their room number the soft oof of pierce hitting the pavement caught jenkss attention and his long whistle pulled everyone to a stop ivys eyes found me next and she was smiling as she looked down leaning against a support pole trent was silent plucking the key from ivy and vanishing with a bang behind a redpainted door vivian stood in openmouthed awe her small figure looking small next to ivy youre back she said eyes wide as she recognized pierce just now starting to stir is thatgordian pierce i bent to help pierce rise and he pulled from me holding his jaw and not meeting my eyes yup i said feeling hurt somehow we were back but for how long i didnt know thirteen if it wasnt for the lack of an ocean i would have believed i was in florida sitting at a touristtrap beachthemed restaurant whose target audience was college kids on spring break the floor was of gray dock planks the stairs had stiff rope railings fishing nets that had never seen the water were strung under the high ceiling it was busy and trents hundred bucks had bought us a booth in front of the stage bypassing the fortyminute wait maybe money couldnt buy happiness but it could get you a table that looked like the back end of a deepsea fishing vessel tired and disillusioned i looked over the booth it even had fake fishing poles out the back between us and the stage where a scruffy were was singing about a last shaker of salt no his lost shaker of salt according to the paper place mat it must bother jimmy buffett that no one could understand his slurred lyrics even if he had them painted on the thick support beams too yep we were in margaritaville and it was steaming trents shrimp that we were still in vegas uptight i ate my last piece of shrimp cocktail and took a sip of soda eying the beautiful servers moving around the tables every last one of them was a living vampire and i thought it odd that vampires and the beach seemed to mix so well still hungry i ran my finger through the shrimp sauce and licked it off i was on the outside of the semicircle with my back to the kitchen ye olde demon killer was to my left then trent vivian and ivy on the other end jenks was on the candle centerpiece almost asleep despite the noise my phone said it was seven thirty but it felt like ten thirty naptime for pixies and elves on east coast time jenks looked better now that wed quit moving i was feeling better now that id had a shower and was in a fresh pair of jeans and a black camisole i hadnt yet talked to trent about his new friend kusox i was still trying to wrap my mind around pierce he was a black witch there was no denying it maybe instead of trying to figure out if it was wrong to like him or not i should do the smart thing andforget about him grimacing i turned my phone to vibrate and tucked it in a back pocket jenks had talked to his kids earlier and id fielded another chat with bis apparently hed woken up this afternoon for a few minutes and wanted to talk to his folks about having seen the sun they were at the basilica a good five minutes flight away and he didnt want to leave the pixies alone unless we knew about it he was a good kid i was surprised though most gargoyles couldnt stay awake during the day until they were much older hey ivy i said leaning across the table how come everyone working in here is a vampire some kind of union thing vivian looked up from her corn chips clearly eager to answer but ivy was quicker id seen her watching some of the prettier ones with more than a passing interest theyre working off their debts she said as she sipped her soda looking as sexy as a vodka commercial i glanced at our server flirting with a table of four businessmen then the vampire stud ivy had been eying since we walked in really really vivian said when ivy airkissed her chosen one the head vampire in vegas has a policy of free movement on his turf otherwise there might be a drop in revenue from the gambling no one leaves with an outstanding debt dead or alive trent was nodding as if hed known but id never heard of an undead vampire having control of another vampires family member even temporarily i turned to ivy to see her blushing a faint eager red thats why were stopping in vegas i guessed and she nodded eyes on the table as jenks snorted himself awake with a burst of yellow dust fewer issues to deal with when i she stopped eyes on the vampire shed culled from the herd he was pretty enough i guess you think a human is bad at not knowing when to quit at the gambling table she said chewing the toothpick the cherry had come on try being a vampire bored and seeing an eternity to find the money you might lose tonight she licked her lips for someone elses benefit and i stifled a shiver my eyes flicked to trent and pierce okay they were watching her flirt too both of them weirdly intent and detached pierce was not happy to be here which i thought rude since his other option was als box in the everafter hed showered as well so he smelled like hotel shampoo instead of burnt amber frowning he watched everyone from under his funny hatit had shown up during his showergulping his bubbly soda and wiping his eyes when he drank it too fast tumbling his clothes in the hotel drier had taken care of most of the stink on them and he was back in his tidy slacks casual shirt and a vest that was probably from his s closet but looked new he was still wearing that silver amulet i had no idea what it was but i thought it telling that pierce hadnt taken it off even when hed been in the shower trent wasnt good company either seeing that our planned pit stop had turned into a fourhour break at a restaurant he hadnt picked out we all had to get out of the car for a while and i still wanted to talk to trent about kusoxto find out if he knew how bad kusox was before he let him out or after ivy shifted her motions screaming sex as she smiled up at our waitress when she came back with another soda for pierce do you know what you want she said as she set it down voice raised over the music ill have the pasta i said pointing to it on the menu same pierce said and i wondered if he could read anything other than latin hed been born in the early s and it was possible he couldnt clam chowder trent said as he handed his menu over ill have the tilapia vivian said brightly a vestige of her usual polished self showing as she settled into a familiar haunt with asparagus oh god save us jenks said dramatically holding his nose we do have over a thousand miles left to go in that tiny car my moms car isnt tiny i said and trent frowned it is with five people in it he muttered ivy was handing her menu to the woman i want the steak sandwich she said in a togo bag i gazed at her in question but the woman was nodding ill put these in she said making a last note on our bill anyone else need anything by the look of it and the slight nudge vivian was making at trent to get him to slide over ivy needed someones neck i shook my head but trent spoke up handing the waitress a folded bill i want another beer he said and if you can get everyones meal out here in five minutes theres another one of those in it for you the woman looked at ben franklins face and tucked it away ill see what i can do honey she said smiling at ivy before she sashayed away beer and soup jenks said as he dusted a thin sliver of silver his own light hardly making a dent in the dusky shadows in here thats going to mix well youd be surprised by how a good beer mixes with clams trent said his attention on the male waiter ivy was blinking at slowly god this was getting uncomfortable and i put a hand over my neck as it started to tingle hes uptight about his timetable ivy said almost sighing the words and youre not trents expression froze when she turned to him smiling to show her little fangs excuse me she said as she got to her feet in one languorous move that made pierce shiver course it could be the cold pop hed just slammed down no one said a word as ivy sat on the back edge of the fake boat and swung her feet over moving with liquid grace she made a beeline for the vampire shed had her eye on people were getting out of her way and the vamp in question was smiling waiting for her what is she doing trent asked but vivian knew her eyes cast down as she shifted on the bench to make more room for the rest of us hell even our waitress knew what ivy was doing i took a sip of my soda watching ivy drape her arms around the man and whisper something in his ear keeping the rest of us safe i said trying not to worry about her shed be okay and if vegas had a freethinking master vampire then this was probably the only spot between home and the coast that shed be able to take the edge off jenks frowned clearly not happy but as willing as i was to let her take care of her own needs i didnt know if i should feel upset or not i wasnt her keeperbut i was her friend pierce was ignoring everyone and trent didnt seem to care apart from ivys tryst possibly slowing us down vivian though pushed her glass around clearly screwing up her courage and i wasnt surprised when she asked she and you no i said before jenks could offer his opinion were not sharing blood i felt trents eyes on me but pierce didnt look up from his drink we tried i said talking to the entire table though my gaze was on vivian well we tried it enough to know that for it to happen one of us would have to change too much if i bend shed lose what she loved in me and if she bends i lose what i love about her i shrugged flaming red in embarrassment but that was my problem jenks clattered his wings rising up and down as if testing his strength ill keep an eye on her he said then frowned when pierce made a rude noise to be sure she stays safe he added sharply im not going to watch tinks a disney whore im not a peeping tom jenks gave me a meaningful head toss to trent and flew away taking a high path between the ceiling and the fake fishing nets we dont have time for this trent said suddenly and i wondered if ivys and my relationship bothered him curious youre the one who wanted to eat i said i meant the rest of us could grab a decent meal while you showered not a fivehour sightseeing excursion ending up in a sideshow restaurant that was just rude not to mention an insult to jimmy buffett fans everywhere weve been trapped in that car for two days i said we need a break and i need to talk to you stupid elf trent ran a hand over his hair leaving it attractively mussed his eyes showed his mood dark and irate as he looked over the vacationing people who had nowhere to go for the rest of the night his frustration peaked i need to be in seattle by sunday i said interrupting him yeah i got that part i took a sip of my drink which infuriated him for some reason will you relax have a margarita or something i told you id get you there and i will trust me that last jab had been sarcastically bitter but i was ticked i mean why ask me to protect him on his way out to the west coast then free a demon to do it vivian was watching me her intelligent eyes squinting in question she knew something was up just not what trust you trent shifted in disapproval seattle is fifteen thousand miles from here just getting to san francisco will take us eight hours even if we take whoa whoa whoa vivian said loudly and the couple in the next boat over looked at us are you crazy no one takes which means we can go as fast as we want trent said his eyebrows bunching we are not taking vivian said fervently and i tuned them out watching ivy and her blood buddy slip out the back jenks gave me a color flash of green and i turned back to the table if you get on you dont stop vivian finished intently trent took a swig of his beer looking normal i dont plan on stopping vivian tossed a hand up in the air and pushed herself back into the cushions im coven not one of gods angels its too dangerous maybe hes relying on his demon friend i thought bitterly i didnt think any big bad uglies on would be a problem even if we had to stop hell wed already evaded elven assassins and one severely disturbed demon a soul eater crap on toast i had to talk to trent hed better not have any idea of what he had unleashed because if he did and hed done it intentionally i might be pissed enough to just walk away from this completely trent leaned toward vivian i dont see any other way of getting to seattle in time other than taking he said softly his anger just in check i said id get you there i said watching pierce eye two women in shorts his ears turning red have some faith in the people you ask to protect you feeling a hint from my last words trent leaned back giving pierce a good view of the female vamps making out in the corner his back against the cushions trent unrolled his silverware and arranged it perfectly with stiff motions ive seen how you protect people telling me to have faith isnt inspiring oh but summoning daywalking souleating demons is pierce pulled his eyes from the vamps long enough to snort his agreement and my face flamed have i ever not come through trent fingered his knife no but your collateral damage is generally more than i want to paymorgan this from the man i had to save by going into a partnership with a demon i frowned pierce looked happy for the first time since hed gotten here and whats on your mind demon bait i snapped at him enjoying the show immediately pierces smile shifted to a frown i could have killed al if not for you he said and vivian started you almost killed a demon she asked eyebrows going high in interest her attention flicked from the two women to me and back to him her demon aye he said glancing at me darkly she stopped me whos going to protect me in the everafter if not al i said fumbling my words as suddenly everyone at the table was looking at me like id killed bambis mother al is the only thing between me and newt or worse you look at me and think ive got this all under control and i dont trent smiled as he moved his nearly empty glass of beer just so thats not what i see when i look at you me neither pierce said under his breath and may god strike me dead if the two men didnt start to bond what i meant i said patiently feeling like the butt of a joke is you think that im safe with them but im not if al dies im up crap creek pierce spooned a piece of ice out of his drink not my problem he said teeth clattering against it my jaw dropped hey you were the one who went to him with some stupid idea to be his familiar just so you could kill him its a capital fine idea pierce said indignantly glaring at me from under his hat and it would have worked if not for you vivian leaned closer you tried to kill a demon i almost made a fist of it yes pierce said his features still holding his anger at me it was the only reason i did tuck with them and i opine that if the truth were known then the coven might have to apologize for burying me alive and they wouldnt want to do that would they expression becoming pinched vivian sank back into the seat i said nothing as far as i was concerned he was a black witch and it bothered me probably because i thought i might be one too maybe i was being too harsh maybe pierce gave me an angry look id be free tonight if not for your misguided ignorant stupidity yeah yeah yeah i said unable to look up at him its all my fault and if you killed al where would i be you cant protect me from newt like it or not i need al go kill someone elses demon to make yourself a man mr black magic user pierce became silent as the were in one flipflop finished his set and got down amid a tooenthusiastic round of cheers to freedom trent said startling me his glass was raised and fingers fumbling pierce picked up his mostly empty glass and the two clinked men well excuse me for trying to stay alive i said elbows on the table i didnt like being here without ivy or jenks and i thought you didnt like trent pierce had taken a gulp his eyes watering at the bubbles popping i can drink with a man and not like him he said and trent smiled that infuriating mensclub smile i bet you can i said but i was busy looking over the moving heads for ivy shouldnt she be back by now how long did it take to bite someone anyway or was it the cleanup that took so long id never been bitten where i wasnt fighting for my life three seconds later must be i was doing it wrong excuse me trent said suddenly and my attention jerked to him as he rose and nearly pushed vivian out of the booth where are you going i asked suspiciously trent hesitated next to the table and vivian slipped back in the washroom his eyes went to his empty beer glass then back to me slipping into the narrow path he wove his way to the back of the restaurant past the kitchens and the big sign proclaiming buoys and gulls catchy my head started to hurt this might be my only chance to talk to trent alone sighing i stood saying vivian you got pierce okay vivian looked at me in bewilderment letting go of the straw she was downing her soda with he needs watching whats he going to do i dont need watching pierce said indignantly and i swung my legs over the edge of the boat the way ivy had shed probably looked better doing it though not answering vivian i pushed into motion to follow trent noticing that he was getting some appreciative glances from the surrounding patrons he didnt give any indication that he knew i was behind him as the noise of the restaurant was replaced by the clatter and steam of the kitchen and then the muted noise of the back hallway trent i said as he reached the door to the restroom arm stiff he pushed the door open and went in not acknowledging that i was behind him i didnt slow down following him in with my breath held and my shoulders tight trent was at the mirror head down as he held the sides of the white sink with a resigned air about him glancing up his eyes twitched when they found me in the mirrors reflection get out arms swinging i let my held breath out and decided it didnt stink too much in here ugly things urinals going past him i looked under the single stall then kicked it open to make sure no one was standing on the toilet trust me hed said but he had summoned kusox and i needed to know why you hired me for protection i said stiffly thats what im doing trent turned to lean against the sink its a bathroom wait outside i stood with my hand on my hip angry seems like i remember that the elves who attacked you under the st louis arch had the same bits that you do i said and he frowned sauntering forward i all but pinned him against the sink remember st louis the arch fell down why the hell did you free a daywalking demon didnt trust me to get you there huh turning his back on me he pumped the soap dispenser having to go to the next one before anything came out the rims of his ears were red and my anger grew i know you girls go to the bathroom in packs but id appreciate some privacy he said his jaw tight and the skin around his eyes pinched no selfrespecting assassin takes their mark in the john and no selfrespecting assassin makes a hit on an interstate either i moved closer well within his discomfort zone you want to tell me what in the hell you thought you were doing freeing a daywalking demon from under the st louis arch trent didnt pause his smooth motion never bobbling as he turned off the water shook his hands and reached for a paper towel silent he turned his expression closed a quiver rose through me and tightened my gut i wanted to shove him but i managed to keep my hands where they were through the cement walls i could hear cheers as the next band took the stage kusox was halfway to killing you until i shoved that energy back into him he knocked down the arch trying to kill both of us i said pushing forward until we were only inches apart and then i freed you from your familiar bond and made you immune to him what i want to know is whether youve been planning this from day one or if youre making this up as you go along he turned his back on me not looking at my reflection as he arranged his hair ive known about kusox since last year he said and i dropped back not knowing if i believed him or not his eyes flicked to mine in the mirror you think ivy is a planner she has nothing on a motivated elf with too much money he looked away shifting one thin lock of hair over his ear ive got this under control i blinked trying not to lose it but my hands shook i could almost hear him add dont worry your pretty little head about it yeah i barked glad id waited until we were alone to bring this upthis way thered be no witnesses when i killed him do you have any idea how much trouble youre in the demons are pissed they cant control this guy cant kill him thats why he was imprisoned trent slowly turned gesturing as if waiting for me to leave trying to catch him the first time was a friggin war i said remembering als spells slithering through our connected brains kusox isnt confined to the everafter during daylight and he eats people to absorb their souls he eats people trent a flicker of emotion crossed the back of trents eyes a soft twitch at his lips i pounced on it seeing a sliver of humanity you saw him eating those pixies i said hammering the guilt home thats what he does he eats people because his soul doesnt work right kusox is a magically engineered disaster the demons created while trying to break the curse your people put on them in your stupid war what they got was something so horrendous and disturbed that they buried it in the next world over and you go and free him trents green eyes hardened i have this under control i snorted like you got him to stop eating pixies just because he cant kill you doesnt mean you control him the demons arent blaming me for this theyre blaming you this emancipatedfamiliar thing makes you liable youre going to have demons with little red robes coming at you for breaking the law of uncommon stupidity if youre not careful his gaze on mine narrowed and he turned away i have this under control hes sworn to protect me did he not get it protect you i yelped he ate pixiesaliveto distract them so we could escape with jenks youre welcome for that trent interrupted and my head pounded if you didnt think i could protect you then why am i here huh i asked hands on my hips as i stood between the door and him a small infuriating smile showed on his face shocking me because quen wouldnt let me out of cincinnati without you my teeth ground together and i forced them apart i didnt think quen knew about kusox and i sure as hell believed that ceri didnt you are an idiot i managed hands in fists trent turned back to the mirror and brushed nonexistent dust off himself the motion lost something with his being in a casual shirt instead of a thousanddollar suit right back at you babe babe did he just call me babe shaking i turned on my heel this guy was a piece of work ill wait outside for you i said not trusting myself with him right now if you feel you have to pissed i stiffarmed my way out of the bathroom you can die here for all i care i thought the warmth and noise growing as i stalked down the empty hall trent was a jerk a jerk and an ass the demons might not blame me but the coven would and then id have to take care of kusox myself what in hell was i trents maid not looking at the man i pushed past i peered out over the kitchen archway to the restaurantthen paused cinnamon cinnamon and wine my anger vanished and i turned to the man now heading for the mens room nice slacks nondescript windbreaker soft shoes dark hair well built smelled like a snickerdoodle dunked in wine shit the guy was an elf fourteen heart pounding i ran back down the corridor i hit the mens room door with a bang that reverberated from my arm to my toes breath held i slid to a stop as the unknown elf turned trent still stood beside the row of sinks hunched under a claustrophobically small circle something close to panic was in his eyes quickly turning to his familiar cool dispassion but id seen it and i knew he was glad to see me the air smelled like ozone and the last of the attacking elfs green aura trying to break through trents circle flickered and went out i put a hand on my hip and gestured with the other at the man in his trendy windbreaker and utterly blank expression trying to kill trent on my watch i dont think so if i cant kill him then neither can you i said and the assassins lips twitched i moved tapping one of las vegass lines even before he threw a ball of magic at me striding forward i flashed a circle into existence for the bare second i needed to deflect the greenhazed everafter into the corner it hit the tiled wall and spread out a gelatinous ooze smelling of bone dust emanating from it nice i said thinking it must be a charm to break someone in half you want to leave before i hurt you hunched the elf backed up trying to keep enough distance between us so that he could throw something at me and not have it bounce back at him i kept going forward trying to get under the guns so to speak grasping him by the front of his windbreaker i shoved him into the wall slapping aside his attempt to flood me with everafter i said you need to leave i said unimpressed but i hesitated when i felt the prick of wild magic brush across my aura like sandpaper eyes wild and frightened the man smiled at me and a quiver rose in my chi as i thought of black snakes unwinding from als head to kill kusox the man made a gesture lips moving and fingers twisting into an awkward figure he gasped as his hand contorted and i heard knuckles pop and hazy black enveloped his fist alarmed i dropped him before his magic could flood into me demon whore he shouted clearly in pain as he threw whatever it was at me i flung myself back to dodge his spell hitting the stall door and falling backward into the toilet even as my protection circle sprang up arms and legs flailing i caught myself with the ohsohelpful railing they put in there sprawled across the seat with my arms straining i stared at the horrifying green aura only a handsbreadth from me slithering over my bubble as if looking for a way in it was wild magic it had hurt the assassin to cast it it might make it through i didnt think it was going to be sunshine and lollipops if it broke my bubble in the corner the assassin was getting to his feet shaking the pain from his hand i wasnt keen on the gleam of anticipation he still wore licking my lips i glanced at the charm burning its way to me then back to him stricto vive gladio i started and the mans eyes widened in fear as he recognized the bounce back charm he scrambled to his feet almost flinging himself at the door in his effort to flee gladio morere transfixus i finished and the green haze coating my bubble vanished the fleeing elf skidded to a halt between trent and me his back arching as all his muscles seized mouth open in a silent scream he reached behind him as if trying to touch something gurgling wetly he collapsed his back scraping on the sticky floor horrified i broke my bubble and pulled myself out of the stall looking at the man contorting under the charm meant for me his lips moved as foam bubbled at the corners while he tried to speak the countercharm sorry i said wincing maybe you should have tried to kill me with something that didnt hurt so much a soft pop sounded and trents face turned ashen i think the guy had just dislocated something groaning the man collapsed but it had been the curse breaking not the mans spine and he lay on the floor gasping for breath maybe you should leave now i suggested and he rolled to his hands and knees reaching for the sink he pulled himself up grime from the bottoms of a thousand shoes coated his back and sweat glistened on his neck panting he looked to the door as it creaked open becoming even more frightened i looked as well and a heavy spike of fear slid through my ribs and into my lungs kusox damn it trent i said as i edged over to stand by him i told you i have this i do not need any help kusox stood before the closed door in a bluegray trendy suit his pale eyes gleaming as he adjusted his silver tie he had upgraded it seemedeaten an executive on hollywood boulevard maybe with one hand he opened the door music drifted in along with muffled conversation and kitchen clatter the assassin didnt need to be asked twice soft shoes squeaking he fled youll never make it in time he said to trent as he slipped past kusox oh yeah i shouted as the door started to close you dont know nothing silence fell as the door clicked shut crap as compared with you who thinks she knows everything kusox said smiling my thoughts flashed to him as an ugly stork in his beak a pixy fighting for life even as the demented demon tossed his head to shift him headfirst down his throat stifling a shudder i nudged trents bubble to get him to take it down but he didnt his face set in grim determination no fear though stupid man hey hi kusox i said mouth dry uh no hard feelings okay al had you beat before i got there instead of the expected threats the demon nodded as if id answered a question i thought it was you al had slipped into he said blue eyes slitted if it had been newt i might have been hurt you are full of unexpected talentsrachel i can call you rachel can i not he came in another step and i backed up hitting trents bubble and slipping backward when trent took it down there was a new caution in kusox and that gave me hope even as my palms started to sweat damn it jenks where are you i should have guessed kusox said sniffing as he took in his image in the mirror and his nose grew a shade narrower and his tan deepened even al knows better than to let newt hold his energy field she might have snuffed him for the fun of it blue eyes meeting mine he frowned this alliance with al doesnt bode well for your future i will take drastic measures if you persist in it its all in the early training i should know having beentrained get us young enough and we can do anything wait too long and we never break our bad habits i took another step backward teeth clenched i was going the wrong way but this guy scared the peas out of me im not being trained and trents not in any danger i said proud of the way my voice didnt crack you can go now hes safe i had held als energy field i thought even as i looked for a way out of this id assumed it had been the other way around but maybe not go kusox shifted his shoulders watching his reflection as his suit broadened and he became wider across the shoulders the scent of carrion seemed to tickle my nose going is an excellent idea we shall start your rehabilitation right away no wait i said my hands raised to fend him off but it was too late and he wrapped an arm around my waist and tucked me under his arm watch it i cried out when my head almost hit a urinal as he spun i was still connected to a line and i smacked him with it kusox trembled shuddering in what could have been pain but what i was betting was pleasure maybe it was both more than adequate to get started he said as he headed for the door trent stood at the sink helpless as kusox picked me up like a kitten and walked away maybe hed get it now it only looked like i was safe around demons fingers scrabbling for the edge of the stall i managed to stop us for a half second still think you can find a way to control this then tell him to stop i said to trent then yelped when my fingers burned as kusox yanked me off the stall my butt hit the door and the music got loud as we left the mens room three steps later kusox swung me up putting me over his shoulder i was helpless if i threw anything at him id get it back in spades i wont let you jump me i said his shoulder cutting into my lungs and making it hard to breathe he slowed as we entered the restaurant seeming to enjoy the music and high spirits to the everafter why would i want to go there when we have the sun here he said adjusting my weight to make my breath huff out there must be a boat somewhere in a sea of salt im going to pick you apart find out how much of a pain in the ass a naturalspawned demon is going to be to raise properly or if id be better off destroying you all in the womb so to speak oh that didnt sound good im not a demon i said jamming my elbow into his back wondering if i grabbed a knife off a passing tray and hit his kidney hard enough he might drop me the blood was pooling in my head hurting ive tasted you kusox said softly youre like me only natural born with a mother and a father even over the noise i could detect his jealousy and why was no one saying anything maybe men toting women out of the back was normal here i hit his back harder and he tightened his grip you might be strong enough to give me pain he said heading for the door you might not be i want to know before more of you show up let me go you freak i shouted feet kicking as we started to pass tables but everyone thought it was part of the show and only clapped where is trent washing his hands im not a freak he hissed pinching my middle until i gasped in pain extending my arms to his back i pushed myself up looking wildly for ivy jenks hell even vivian would be a help orienting myself i sent my gaze to our table pierce i shouted and the man turned from where hed been watching the two vamps in the corner beside him vivians eyes widened a little help here maybe jeez did i have to sing it for them pierce stood his face ashen rachel he called cutting through the music and catching everyones attention without missing a beat the band shifted to love lifts us up where we belong and the crowd exploded into cheers i could understand their confusion kusox looked like an especially attractive billionaire rescuing his woman of the week from a lifetime of minimum wage tight over my head came a clatter of pixy wings and i looked up to get a face full of pixy dust jenks get ivy i shouted between coughs the image of a pixy and a bird flashing through my mindterrifying me more than kusox carrying me away my head dropped as i wiped my eyes and i glimpsed trent at the top of the kitchen corridor focus blurry i felt more than saw ivy at the front of the restaurant in a puddle of light by the register hands on her hips and looking svelte and refreshed finally i could see again and i let out a little shriek ducking when a black ball of everafter arched toward us pierce hed thrown something it struck kusox right in the head little pinpricks of his aura hitting me like sleet kusox stumbled as if shocked and i scrabbled for a grip as he began to fall the curse flashed through kusox jerking his muscles stiff but then it was me screaming when the son of a bitch shoved pierces curse into me instead i howled as the arc of electricity jumped from neuron to neuron burning i caught a glimpse of pierce horrified and then the pain was gone and i was panting trying to breathe as i hung limp over kusoxs shoulder what are you doing vivian shouted from a thousand years away you think your white charms are going to do anything against that pierce yelled back and the band started to falterexcept for the drummer lost in the throes of his passion please dont do that again i slurred head hanging conversation hummed in my stunned ears and i caught a few uneasy whispers we passed another table and i started to rally it was up to ivy magic wouldnt do itit had to be physical thank you god i said as i heard her scream at him the world spun and i hit the floor sprawling and hip bruised i looked up to see ivy and kusox in a tangle on a table shouts of protest rose high as glasses and plates hit the floor my phone was humming the buzz in my back pocket almost lost in the vertigo that was hitting me dizzy i rolled to get out of the way people were starting to scatter we had to do this fast or the freak would start eating people jenks i shouted ducking under the table when a chair ivy had thrown shattered near my elbow get trent out of here i shouted again thinking that maybe if trent was gone the demon might be constrained to follow jenks hesitated in midair hovering between ivy and me clearly torn tell him to get the car i yelled a little ding from my back pocket telling me whoever it was had left a voice message bring it here the demon would follow him or not either way wed have a quick way out of here when the shit quit hitting the fan leaving a burst of frustrated dust jenks darted from ivy to me his long hair swinging his sharply angled face twisted up in indecision but before he could say anything ivy yelled in pain we both looked to see her slide across the floor on her back until slamming into the bottom of the stage blinking she shook her head trying to focus the drummer finally stopped and in the sudden hush she slurred im okay get the freak of a demon that did it and even as kusox dramatically turned people surged to the doors in a panic in seconds the emergency door began screaming and the people trying to get out of the jampacked front surged to the rear kusox seemed to be enjoying the chaos raising his arms in benediction and soaking it all in as the fear rose and the noise grew louder i jumped when jenks landed on my shoulder beside me was trent and i grabbed his arm and started dragging him to the kitchen there had to be a back door vivian and pierce could take care of themselves my phone was ringing again and i ignored it nice going trent i said as i yanked us to a halt to avoid a panicked waitress her eyes black in fear i had this under control until you called in kusox yeah you stupid cookie maker jenks snarled resting on my shoulder quit trying to help okay i didnt call him he just showed up trent said indignantly and i would have laughed but it sounded too familiar why dont you just hit him with some magic he said and i stopped in the hallway just outside the kitchen doors people were screaming trying to get out but no one was coming this way what and end up dead i said not having a problem admitting that there were people stronger than me kusox almost killed al i said my pointing arm dropping when i realized kusox was eying the frantic people as if mentally culling the herd i cant beat that you freed a serial killer trent flinched but i think it was from the explosion behind me more than from what id said i spun to the wave of heat at my back and by the familiar green tint to the fading aura id guess that kusox had deflected one of pierces curses a table was burning with a green flame and the fire licking the nets was beginning to crawl along the ceiling a drop of it fell to the floor and i felt myself pale when someone collapsed with an ugly scream writhing in pain and clutching his leg in three seconds the man was engulfed creating a second panic as people trampled one another to get away okay safety note dont step in the green fire pierce i shouted the choking air smelling like burned limes youre hurting people his long coat furling he spun to me my face went cold there was no remorse in him no softness only the demands of the fight he needs to die in flame pierce shouted angrily demons die in flame true but so do people i strengthened my hold on the ley line when kusox started for ivy but the shrill sound of the man burning pulled kusoxs attention like a sirens song he shifted his focus and started for the screaming man instead flinging people aside if they didnt move fast enough standing before the writhing man kusox hesitated for a blissful second soaking in the sound of the alarm and the fleeing people as the man gurgled his last the demons eyes widened in anticipation and he flushed before plunging his hands into the slumped stillburning form kusox shuddered in pleasure his expression one of gleeful enthusiasm pulling back his twohanded grip was holding something hazed with a soft glow holding it over his head kusox squeezed his hands and a black viscous substance oozed from his fingers to fall into his mouth his soul was it the mans soul burnt and burning holy crap i whispered scared to death i looked across the restaurant to pierce seeing that he was as horrified as i was beside him vivian shook utterly terrifiedshe had nothing to stop a souleating demon i hadnt even known you could pull someones soul out like that both vivian and i jumped when a rifle shot exploded through the sound of alarms and terrified people only the ringing door alarm broke the sudden silence as everyone turned to the front where a huge bear of a man a were by the look of it stood in a sifting of ceiling dust there was a rifle as big as he was in his thick hands all right he said and i nudged trent to get the hell out of here the cops are coming you just clear out and well have no more trouble it was a nice thought but he clearly didnt know this wasnt your average brawl supernatural or not get the car i all but hissed at trent and finally the man started to drift back toward the kitchen under the ringing alarm i could hear a woman crying ivy stood slowly able to focus again apparently she had a hand to the back of her head and i hoped she was okay i didnt dare move yet kusox seemed to have forgotten me and i was too chicken to remind him maybe we could all just slink out of here real quiet like stay with trent jenks i said unable to look away from kusox and the pixy dropped to hover in front of me dont make me leave he said his fear obvious what is that marvelous creation kusox exclaimed looking across the restaurant at the rifle and when he moved people started for the door again at least the alarm to the back door had gone quiet and it was only people screaming this time my gaze flicked to jenks and i felt a stab of shared fear i dont trust trent we need the car do this for me my palms were sweaty and i wiped them on my jeans youve got my back jenks i said as he hesitated in frustration make sure trent brings the car im counting on you damn it back to the turn jenks swore looking both pissed and scared as he darted through the swinging kitchen doors to follow trent a silver sparkle dripped from his path and i prayed trent wouldnt cross us jenks would kill him shaking i turned back to the restaurant maybe i could salvage something i dont want no trouble the were manager said as he cocked the rifle again maybe not my shoulders slumped and i held my middle as i exchanged a look with ivy across the tables knowing what was going to happen next we could do nothing but watch as kusox strode forward his hand outstretched the were shook his head in warning grimaced lowered the weapon pointed and pulled the trigger i jerked as the bullet exploded the wall behind the demon people screaming as the splinters of wood and plaster went everywhere the managers mouth opened and kusox yanked the gun from him not angry at all but curious please make it fast god i whispered i couldnt stop this i couldnt stop it it works like this kusox said turning the gun around and blowing a hole in the mans chest i couldnt tell if the noise or the color came first the blood and tiny bits of bone coating the register in a speckled red wash of thunderous noise people screamed and the were looked down at the hole in his chest in shock red bubbles frothed from his lips as he tried to speak then he dropped to his knees and fell forward into a puddle of his own broken insides it was ugly and i leaned against the wall as the rising fear hit me along with the stench of gunpowder and hot metal i wished this had never happened that id never agreed to help trent that id never ever gone to the library two years ago looking for a way to do whatever it was id been hoping to do i didnt even remember anymore whatever it was it had been a mistake shutting my eyes wasnt making it go away though and i opened them to find pierce standing resolutely on a table his moving fingers wreathed in blackness as his whispered latin buzzed through my brain an echo of his rising curse i turned to the exits seeing that everyone had gotten out but the few collapsed in fear vivian i shouted seeing her not panicking but not knowing what to do either get them out of here thank god jenks is gone i dont want him to see what i do next what a waste kusox said as he looked at the rifle in his hands then tossed it from him to clatter across a table it killed you far too quickly scanning the nearby tables he found a woman in white sobbing curled into a ball and spending her five minutes in hell youre still alive though he said and the woman shrieked as he plucked her from under the table ill eat you instead he said and the woman came to life as he held her up ignoring her clawing hands as he pulled her closer his jaw opening to fix on her throat it was like a demented kiss and the woman had one breath to screama terrifying shriek of pain and fearof shock at what was happening and then he pulled her from him with a sudden jerk his face bloody and a two pound gap of flesh in the womans neck she still struggled though her head flopped at an impossible angle bits of bloody froth spraying from her torn throat as she tried to scream her lungs still working though her voice box was now inside kusox i wanted to turn away but i couldnt i wanted to run to leave it for someone else to deal with but i couldnt it was me or no one oh my god vivian said and i jumped when i realized she was next to me clutching my arm i swallowed my bile down before i emptied my stomach this is why i know how to do black magic i whispered vivian looked at me as kusox finally ate enough of the woman to kill her vivians eyes were wide her mind not yet having found a way to believe what her eyes were telling her even dead vamps remember pity ivy said coming up on my other side hehe vivian stammered white faced and unable to say it you think i know black magic for kicks i said harshly im trying to survive i shoved the sight of a demon in a silver suit biting a womans throat out to the back of my brain to wake me in a cold sweat later what can i do i thought as i found pierce throwing up behind a table burn him like the curse i almost did in the garden could pierce vivian and i kill a demon together my heart pounded and i took a step forward feeling ivys hand take my bicep i doubted we could kill him but it was all i had killing kusox wasnt murder it was survival and if it made me a black witch then so be it my memory flicked back to pierce crouched over al and ready to end the demons life for his freedom maybe there was no difference between us after all and the reason i was mad at pierce was because i was seeing reflections of myself in him and i didnt like it kusox looked to the ceiling as a cascade of redtinted everafter washed over him rebounding at the outermost point of his aura and soaking back into him tucking the dead woman under his arm he headed for the door i could hear sirens out there and my heart hammered black craft or not i couldnt let him leave are we letting him go pierce shouted angry as he wiped his mouth and came out from behind the table i glanced at ivy to tell her we werent then vivian who still didnt understand the reality of demons yep i lied leaning back and crossing my arms over my chest and rocking back on one foot this is not my problem what vivian said and i lifted a shoulder and let it fall you cant let him walk out of here he just killed two people she raged her anger at her own naivete her fear and her disbelief finding an easy scapegoat in me i should have told her that this was all trents fault but i held my tongue as ivy slinked away to take up a defensive position what do you want me to do ms coven member youre telling me to do black magic huh cause thats the only thing that hes going to notice she licked her lips clearly at war with herself kusox though was almost to the door hell notice this pierce said and then pulling on the line so heavily even kusox felt it he threw a spell vivian gasped as it flew the distance burning the very air as it passed kusox spun bouncing it back at us with a quickly instigated bubble down i shouted and i dropped to the floor the curse hit the stage and the amp exploded sending sparkles of ozone over us damn it pierce watch what youre doing mmmm kusox said as he started back in our direction curious accent to your spell work not at all like hers who taught you we cant stop him vivian exclaimed duh i said trying to decide if vivian was scared enough yet if i could convince her that someone needed to know black magic they might let me keep my mind when they shoved me back in alcatraz sort of a plan b in case demons came visiting again pierce jumped onto a table shouting latin and seeing that he had kusoxs attention i pulled ivy and vivian to me i have an idea i said silently thanking god that pierce was hereeven if he was a black witch i needed him al was right vivian hesitated but it was ivy who said like the fairies i nodded even as my heart seemed to clench i was going to burn kusoxand i wasnt going to stop the curse vivian we need your help her face became more frightened and i looked at pierce winding up and throwing another curse at kusox okay the man not only knew what he was doing but he looked good doing it pierce followed the first charm with a second scoring on the demon when kusox didnt see the one hidden behind it a black sticky something coated kusox and the demon dropped the dead woman to claw his way out of the green aura covering him a casting i said watching pierce flick his hair back as he caught his breath we have to do a casting i doubt it will kill him but he might go somewhere else to lick his wounds pierce his gaze never leaving the demon pierce raised his hand in acknowledgment my heart gave a hard pound ivy shed be safe but shed have to stay with me thats vivian began to say starting to look aghast again and i wondered what it was going to take to convince her casting isnt illegal i interrupted her just the curse and ill twist it not you down pierce yelled and i dropped yanking vivian with me and snapping a protection circle over us a redtinted ball of death exploded behind us and the smoke alarm started going off outside i could hear sirens we need a decision here ivy said looking shaken i cant do a black curse vivian babbled the last of the professional young woman dropping away as she pushed her hair out of her eyes im coven bloody hell paste kusox was shouting still not altogether out of pierces last spell all you need to do is hold the inner protection circle against all creation pierce said his blue eyes sharp with an old anger at the reluctance of uptight women you dont need to sully yourselfwell do that i dropped my bubble so pierce could join us and he took a symbolic step forward he knew the spell i wanted to use my outer circle wont hold him long pierce youll have to be quick in the casting if he breaks it the curse will incinerate half of vegas ivy looked scared get it right witches scuse me pierce said with a grunt throwing another ball of goo at kusox this time kusox absorbed it the black mass dissolving in a cascade of sparkles he had mastered the countercurse we had to work fast im of a mind to see if youre as grand as you think you are pierce said to me and i smirked back same here i said exhilarated even as i was scared to death okay lets do this look out vivian shouted and i jerked as kusox backhanded pierce into ivy they slid across the floor in a tangle of arms and legs the spell that pierce had begun fizzling in a sparkle of green and red crap when had he gotten that close hey i shouted as kusox wrapped an arm around my neck and started dragging me away i struggled trying to break his hold as he headed for the door shit shit shit i could still make the outer protection circle but i wasnt ready to sacrifice myself to get rid of kusox but then i remembered him tearing that womans throat out and her silent screams as she tried to breathe burning would be better than that i think you have the nicest hair kusox said as he yanked me up and i felt him touch behind my ear i stiffened when he ran his nose down my neck and my breath sucked in as he found the vamp toxins sunk deep in my tissues ohhh youre flawed he murmured how delightful oh shit i whispered scrambling for anything to slow us down shit kusox said speculatively and he loosened his grip until my heels dragged on the floor again ive heard that several times now is that the word of choice i do so like allencompassing words verb adjective noun yes you are shitted my heels thumped as he dragged me backward youd better let me go i cried reaching out to grab a post kusox yanked me off it pulling me another foot until i snagged a table i wouldnt let go and the added weight slowed him down even more we were almost to the door and i could hear radio chatter and yelling people in the street you know why my brethren didnt kill me kusox said as the table i was dragging hit a post and we stopped they couldnt even newt and she tried they made me special the wonder child of the future now our ignoble past designed to bridge the gap between demons and witches and bring us back into the sun able to walk in reality and the everafter both and all of us capable of holding as much energy as a female he hesitated yanking me until my grip slipped and we moved forward again you can understand why male demons might want to fix that unfair quirk of nature i think i turned out quite nicely dont you you dont look special to me i panted seeing pierce horrified and afraid to do anything he was next to vivian and ivy was at their feet i have to get back to them but i am kusox snarled sounding almost unhappy you know why newt killed her sisters i told her to newt i could control but the others they were a danger and had to be killed females can hold more energy than males they have to in order to hold a second independent field of energy inside them without absorbing it that was interesting and my thoughts went back to what kusox had said earlier about my holding als energy supplementing it had i been able to do it because i was female two souls in one body kusox said shifting his hold on me and smacking my hand until it went numb my grip slipped away and he started forward again two energy fields bound by one aura without the smaller being crushed or absorbed thats where babies come from rachel not cabbage leaves and once i got newt to kill all her sisters there was no one left to tell me no especially when all i needed to do was slide into reality to escape and then i find you natural born unknown possibilities stronger weaker lets find out crap we were almost to the door im all for finding out whos stronger i said and then i reached for the line id never fully released demanding all that vegas could give me energy raced in hot and electric tasting of dust sand and lightning that beat on the desert floor the power of the sun kept clean and unblemished the sands storing it like a battery i pushed it out through my pores teeth gritted it didnt hurt but it burned like fire howling kusox flung me from him i arched through the air grunting when i hit a table i slid to the floor hurting damn it felt like my back was broken youre right i slurred as i felt ivys hands reach under my armpits and drag me back to vivian and pierce i can hold more than you when i could focus again i looked up to see vivian fear on her face for what she was about to do pierce took my hand and i dampened the energy flowing through me so i wouldnt fry them vivian took my other and when pierce grasped her free fingers completing our circle i took a deep breath feeling the alienness of them with me fire in the hold i whispered opening my mind and gathering both pierce and vivian into my thoughts now realizing that i could like a mother with twins it was akin to sharing a spell as we had done in my garden but there would be no will but my own here for an instant their souls were minemy strength was lent to them and they didnt know the difference didnt know that i directed them mine vivians bubble snapped up around us coated with my smut i felt pierces aura shift melting with vivians so his magic could pass through her bubble my outer circle was next encompassing most of the restaurants front room and a slice of the unseen back alley kusox ran for us his clawed hand looking like a birds foot as he screamed and tried to break it but vivians will was supplemented by mine and he couldnt celero inanio the words ripped from pierces throat pushed by my will and his fear i could feel vivians despair and shame but fear for her life burned in her i felt pierces pride then wallowed in his shock when he realized i was holding him holding them both in slow motion i felt the lava ribbons of the curse snake out from vivians bubble moving like lightning as the energy darted to the edges of my containment bubble snaking up the sides and running to the peak above us as one the six ribbons struck the apex a flash of energy exploded from it crisping everything in a burst of heat i pay the price i whispered gathering the rising smut to me as if it were a blanket the black curse was mine i deserved the price pierces head was down and vivian was staring upward in amazement as more power than she knew existed spun through her it wasnt that the dark side was stronger but that everything was the dark side all magic was inherently wrong and it was only us fooling ourselves that some of it was good some of it was bad magicjust was and so it was only i who saw kusoxs face go white in the realization that i might be as strong as newt but not insane and therefore not easily twisted the cloud of burning molecules drifted to him in slow motion sparking from one to the next as fast as an electron can spinand in a bare second before the air in his lungs turned to flame he vanished snarling in anger he was gone and the air burnedempty of his flesh i closed my eyes and the sound of glass breaking sliced through my disappointment we had missed damn it we had missed god forgive us vivian whispered the curse felt me weaken and it broke upon itself flashing upward and turning into real flame with a snap both my and vivians bubbles collapsed hands pulled from mine in haste and i dropped to my knees ivy caught meher hands gentle with compassion tender with hesitation i opened my eyes to find that the sound of breaking glass had been the lights we were in the dark lit only by real honest fire dancing at the ceiling it grew even as i watched the light becoming brighter more dangerous the ceiling is on fire i whispered we should go disappointment made me slow and ivy helped me to my feet as the smoke detectors continued to scream and the water system clicked on ivy and i searched each others expression in the dim glow of the flames the water mixing with her tears shining in the comeandgo light from the fire she knew by my expression that hed gotten away and yet she thought nothing less of me either for failing to kill him or because id tried in the first place evil witch black demon let me help you she said and i nodded thinking she was beautiful inside wewe vivian stammered clearly in shock as the water misted down pierce started for the kitchen turning when he realized no one was following him time to pull foot he said yanking vivian not me we she tried again slipping but at least we were moving the floor was charred slick under my steps unseen in the dark the air was heavy a weird mix of heat and moisture i glanced toward the front glad i couldnt see the smoldering bodies of the people dead and left behind i could smell them though and see the little puddles of wax burning on the tables still left standing kitchen i said leaning heavily on ivy weary cops and firemen werent coming in which meant they were going to count the building as a loss as soon as the right people arrived they were going to circle the place and let it burn we should probably get out before then we hit the kitchen at a staggering run ivy grabbing a takeout bag in passing once we got past the arc of my circle that had contained the curse i wasnt sure if she was supporting me or if i was supporting her when we hit the kitchens service doors and a slice of harsh mercury lamplight from outside spilled in my head came up as the air changed it was still hot but now it had the stink of garbage ivy was first out looking at trent waiting beside my mothers car before taking the threefoot jump to the lower pavement and looking up at me vivian sat down to slide off leaving a long wet mark glistening in the streetlight pierce hesitated only briefly before he jumped hitting the ground in a soggy splat ivys hand was extended for me and i took it still shaky kusox had left sure but now he knew i was a threat we got the devil pierce said clearly in a good mood as we all limped for the car just twenty feet ahead it was running maybe trent had learned something after all you think kusox is dead i said as i stumbled beside pierce i didnt see a body in there did you see a body anyone see a body i sure as hell didnt pierce jerked to a stop and ivy left me with one hand on the car for support as she got in and slid to the drivers seat water dripping from her vivian dived into the back yelling at us to get in no one could survive that pierce said water flinging from him as he pointed at the burning building i jumped when the citys fire codes clicked into play and the buildingwide circle snapped into place to contain the fire thank god we were out of it we had only moments before someone would come back here and find us they might have been waiting for us to get out maybe if killing that freak was that easy dont you think that the demons would have done it i said feeling ivys eyes on me hes still alive i said as i slowly got in the car numb he was alive but i might know how to kill him now and i dropped my eyes ashamed to even be thinking it it was said that newt had killed her lovers by running a line through them obviously i could do the same otherwise why had kusox convinced newt to kill the female demons that the elves had missed i looked at my hands trying to see them shaking in the dim light i had to talk to newt great just friggin great maybe shed think i was a demon and decide to kill me too pierce get in the car ivy shouted from behind the wheel and he shoved me to the middle as he got in the car shaking as he slammed the door a cop cars light played over our car and swearing trent ducked ivy gunned it bouncing my moms cars fender off the bubble containing the fire as she spun in a tight circle pierce gaped behind us as ivy drove like the devil himself was after us jumping curbs and driving over the bare ground vivian and trent cried out in protest from the back there was a final jolting thump then the road smoothed as ivy found the way to the interstate no one followed i closed my eyes enjoying the smell of excited vampire on my left and the rich tang of witch on my right the lights of oncoming traffic glowed through my eyelids and i opened them when my phone started to hum jenkss wings were a beautiful web of silk and diamonds as he held on to the rearview mirrors stem watching our back always watching our back everyone here i needlessly asked my fingers shaking as i flipped open my phone to see that it was bis the last two calls were from him as well he had to be feeling me pull heavily on the lines he was waking up in the day too maybe he was older than i thought jenkss wings hummed to life turning as gray as my soul as they deflected the light their beauty lost yeah everyones here he said clearly not believing they were just going to let us drive away i hesitated briefly before letting biss call go to voice mail and tucking the phone away i couldnt talk to him right now vivian was sobbing in the back trying not to be obvious about it i thought it callous of trent not to give her any comfort but if she was anything like me his show of compassion would only get his face bitten off and he probably knew it the hum of the engine grew steady never varying as we sped north on i flexed my hand trying to see it in the faint green glow from the dash the memory of how much energy id channeled into kusox had left my body unmarked but it had shaken me it had been enough to fry anyone else to a cinder my fist closed and i saw ivy look from it back to the road her eyes were worried taking a breath she pushed her wet hair back steadying herself for whatever i might do next she looked too young too beautiful too perfect to put up with my crap and when i touched her hand she jumped wed gotten away but my heart was like ash as black as the coating on my soul vivian had seen the depth of it taken part in it maybe shed leave this part of the trip out of her report hey jenks said his thoughts clearly on the same path as mine is it true what they say about vegas no vivian said and i caught sight of her redrimmed eyes in the rearview mirror when the lights of a passing car lit up her misery im telling them im telling them everything trent shifted uncomfortably and jenks took a breath a darkly glowing dust spilling from him i calmed him with a soft nod i wanted them to know it might be the only thing that was going to keep my body and soul on this side of the lines that and maybe trents testimony that i was a good person i was in trouble if they ever found out kusox was his demon double jeopardy trent whispered its double jeopardy his eyes met mine when i turned to him it always has been fifteen it was the changing sound of the engine that woke me but the cars motion never shifted so i snuggled deeper under my coat and leaned more heavily against the door a bleary glance at the clock told me wed been on only for about an hour and therefore were probably coming into reno four hours of driving a hundred plus in the dark had been more than a little unsettling but wed made great time trent was driving again had been since getting off he could keep the job for all i caredeven if he bitched incessantly until we cut our bathroom and coffee breaks down to almost nothing the road between las vegas and had been nerveracking even though we hadnt seen anyone thered been lights in the air lots of them and theyd kept pace with us no matter how fast ivy had gone trent and jenks had slept through it all three eighteen i mused as the clock changed and i resettled myself against the door still achy from hitting the floor wall table and whatever else kusox had thrown me into the mercury light of a truck stop flashed over me then another i slowed my breathing trying to seduce sleep back to me if this was almost reno then san francisco was only about miles away a spike of adrenaline lit and died tomorrow it would all start tomorrow shell get you there in time jenks said his soft voice paced a shade slower than usual and carrying a hint of both irritation and the altitude sickness he was dealing with id offered him the charm to make him big and hed refused saying the car was crowded enough you keep saying that trent said just as softly id never have heard them if i hadnt been in the front seat well you keep pushing the pedal to the floor he shot back his voice putting him in the ashtray not the rearview mirror you should trust her she had every right to dump you on the side of the road for freeing kusox and she didnt that must have been some conversation you had in the john because if it had been me your ass would be under the grass right now sleep vanished but i didnt move jenks would know i was awake because of my aura brightening or some such crap but trent wouldnt and i worked to maintain my slow sedate breathing vivian too must be asleep or jenks would never have brought up the demon you dont know when you got it good elf boy it had been a soft mutter but i knew trent heard as there was a creak of plastic and the vent started blowing cold air i have my reasons trent said you have trust issues is what you have jenks said and turn the air off what are you a friggin penguin you dont know half of whats going on you got that right i thought as the air turned warm again my nose was tickling from a thread on my coat but i didnt move hoping trent would say more he might jenks and trent had been spending a lot of time together while the rest of us slept and jenks liked to talk especially when he was cranky anything over feet above sea level and he had a hard time flying hit feet and he was down well jenks said sarcastically almost daring him a small sound of mistrust slipped from trent youd tell her so so i dont want her sympathy sympathy i cracked my eyes open enough to see a faint haze of pixy dust in the ashtray glowing in the predawn gloom come on trent jenks wheedled as he shoved the doughnut napkin off himself and sat up what is so damn important in seattle maybe i can help again came trents huff of disbelief you talk too much indignant jenks flashed his wings making a wobbling flight to the dash he stood with his hands on his knees bent over and wheezing i helped quen lift your paperwork from the fib he said between breaths i never said anything i can help its allowed i checked if youre really on an elf quest youre allowed a pixy pixies helped elves on quests all the time elf quest i thought it sounded soundignified like an overdone renaissance fair show and i stifled a smile imagining trent in costume riding through his woods to rescue the imprisoned princess crap is he going to come back to cincy with ellasbeth im breaking into a highsecurity location not riding across the countryside on some fairytale adventure trent said tightly his thoughts clearly akin to my own so youre in a borrowed buick instead of on a mighty steed and your pixy sidekick can short out security systems instead of spot orcs its the times trent roll with it jenks was laughing at him and though i couldnt see trent i could imagine his tight mouth and red ears when he grumped its not like that it looks like it to me jenks said even got your band of ragtag misfits in the seat behind me ivy shifted for a moment neither one said anything what are you doing jenks whispered scrambling the withons tax returns i let out my held breath almost missing trents soft im claiming something ellasbeth has it its mine he wasnt after ellasbeth then thank god and why did trent have to prove himself old traditions apart from going into the everafter for that elf dna sample hed been coasting on his fathers legacy was this some way to prove to the remaining elves that he could lead them as if the cure for the demon curse wasnt enough i can help jenks said tell me what youre doing the car drifted to the right avoiding traffic by the sound of it reno must be close why do you want to help me trent asked as he settled into a new lane you dont owe me anything ive given rachel nothing but trouble true jenks admitted but working with quen got me a church and security for my family he added and i slitted my eyes to see him sitting on the dash in front of the wheel his wings almost blue with cold and altitude but mostly its because if you get caught rachel wont have you to speak for her at the coven meeting there was that thats not enough to risk your life for me i want to know why trent insisted jenkss wings hummed and i lifted an eyelid a bit through the windshield gray buildings passed in the gloom where are you going jenks asked his tone one of mistrust as the turn signal clicked on again we were changing lanes the buildings seeming to tilt as the car moved seattle i bolted upright stiff muscles complaining hey were going to san francisco trent jumped clearly shocked but the car was in an exitonly lane hhow long he stammered but i was more concerned about the seattle this exit sign that flashed past we are going to san francisco i hissed not caring if i woke everyone up get the car back on the interstate trent stared how long have you been listening to us my teeth clenched seeing the broken white line turn solid so help me trent if you dont get back on the interstate im going to tohate you forever jenkss wings hummed as he laughed id get your ass back on the interstate cookie maker you wouldnt like it if rachel hated you forever i dont have time to stop in san francisco he said stiffly two hundred miles might be the difference between my making my appointment or not my side hurt and holding it i stared at him ill get you there i dont see how ill get you there i exclaimed oh god the triangle of gravelly pavement was getting bigger trent trust me just trust me you asked me to trust you i could see the frustration in the set of his jaw on the dash jenks waited tense and not a slip of dust escaping from him trust me if he didnt then why should i trust him in a moment there would be a metal barrier between and and an even larger one between trent and me trents face became ugly and with a growled curse he yanked the wheel to the left hey ivy exclaimed from the backseat as the car swerved violently my heart was beating fast and i pulled my hand from the dash jenks had made it to the rearview mirror and he was grinning are we there yet came vivians sleepy voice and i glanced back to see her with a really bad case of pillow hair no go back to sleep i said noticing that pierce had never even woken up pressed into the corner behind trent and huddled under his long coat i settled back pulling my own coat up in the chill trent kept the car in his face was set in a determined angry expression we were back on and headed to the coven meeting but he wasnt happy hed said he trusted me but his body language said otherwise im not going to make it he said and i smiled when the san francisco miles sign flashed over us he was going to make it and even better i was too thank you trent i said my headache easing a little im not going to make it he said again sounding more lost now than angry it wasnt like i could pretend to be asleep anymore so i reached for the bag of sugar and carbs wed gotten in another state and rummaged around until i found a squished brownie who in the turn is buying the milk duds youll make it i said as i tore the cellophane open and the scent of enriched flour and chocolate hit me i took a bite the chocolate had too much wax and the peanut chunks tasted stale but it was sugar leaning forward i handed jenks a chunk as big as his head soon as i check in with the coven ill have al pop you up there i said around my full mouth qed the noise that came out of trent was sort of a strangled cough of outrage caught in a steel trap of fury i turned from jenks who was saluting me with his brownie to trent now staring at me want any of this i asked holding my brownie higher in explanation you could have jumped me there at any time trent said hotly yeah jenks said voice muffled from the brownie you just click your heels and think theres no place like being pwned trent clenched his jaw and corrected for the truck we were barreling toward rachel he said that one word holding an entire argument he was pissed his grip tight on the wheel our speed too had gone up by about fifteen miles per hour no i cant do it at any time i want i said with a huge grin lips closed so i didnt look like a goober with brownie in my teeth the magic doesnt work until you learn a life lesson i teased wasnt it fun though only two hundred miles left we can do that on our heads unless it violates your elf quest i mean if im your sword your shield and your mirror then its fair if im the one who gets you there right there was a snuffle from the back clearly ivy was still awake but i think that had slipped trents notice two thousand miles rachel he said tightly and i guessed that no it didnt violate the rules of whatever he was doing out here because he sure wasnt out here keeping the coven from attacking me i have eaten nothing but slop for two days and used facilities i wouldnt let my dogs urinate in and what about that couple in the rv outside texas ill never get that memory out of my head i nodded working the brownie out of my teeth i couldve done without that visual myself i could have done without the entire trip trent grumbled but his anger was slowing as he realized he was going to be in seattle in a matter of hours i tucked my foot under me and turned to him you want me to work with you right i said as i crumpled up the cellophane and tossed it into the bag consider the trip your interview jenks choked on his brownie looking at me as if id lost my mind red faced as he alternated his attention between me and someone in the back probably ivy i shifted my lips in a soft grimace at the pixy what was i going to do here realistically either i cozied up really close to trent to get him to say the right things at the meeting in two days or i wound up first in alcatraz then the everafter when i admitted id lost my bet with al and fled to his protection some choice but really trent was the better of the two even if he had let kusox out of his box stupid elf trent made a huff of noise you were interviewing me you interviewing me i stifled a shiver maybe i could feel ivy staring at the back of my head it almost hurt his lips turning up trent smiled at the road his expression becoming one of confidence and satisfaction not surprised i collapsed in on myself and rolled my eyes he was going to milk this forever so youre saying you might work with me he asked apparently needing to hear it the tone of the engine dropped and for the first time since leaving las vegas the speedometer dropped into double digits how did i do trent asked a smile in his voice on my interview damn it he was laughing at me but a knot had loosened in my gut i might work with him id said itadmitted it to myself i wasnt going to sign his paperbecome his witchbut a jobi might do a job i was going to need something while i earned the trust of cincinnati back and the work trickled in youre not much of a team player i said as i scraped the last of the sticky cake off my fingertips with a napkin so stiff it was nearly useless inclined to take on too much and not let other team members know what youre doing which causes problems that could easily have been avoided trents entire demeanor had changed relaxed he let one hand fall to his lap and drove with the other it just about pegged my attraction meter but i frowned when he said sounds like you but on the whole a good risk i added sourly if the benefits were there and i felt like it and i cant make rent jenks dropped down to his ashtray burying himself under a tissue and a doughnut napkin all this good feeling is making me sick he said hidden away we had the mountains to get through it was going to be a rough couple of hours i cant believe you let me sweat over this rachel i ate fast food trent complained and tomatoes in public i said remembering the soup it felt good didnt it not hiding what you are a slow smile came over him hard to see in the dim light it did he said so softly i might have missed it if i hadnt known it was coming and you got to see the petrified forest i added from the ashtray came jenkss voice saying and pixies being eaten alive totally his fault i said and jenks poked his head out not looking that good and you got a vacation i offered my own mood brightening it had been a long tiring run out here and id be glad to see it done jenks laughed sounding like wind chimes in the snow vacation the tinkblasted arch fell on him again his own fault i said blinking innocently at trent gee trent maybe we should have left you at home after all trent said nothing his gaze fixed on the road stretching out before us and i fiddled with the heat until it blasted out to warm jenks i think you enjoyed this i said and trent looked askance at me appearing charmingly irate you had the chance to see what it was like to be in a family i added and his eye stopped twitching and to answer your question yes it was exactly like being in a family i said as i leaned to dig out one of ivys bottled waters from the bag at my feet id rather have had a coffee but i knew he wouldnt stop and really i couldnt just pop you there whenever i felt like it i said as i opened it al owes me big he wouldnt have done it before silent trent shifted in his seat as he angled the vents away from himself sighing i looked in the back at vivian slumped between my vampire roommate and my blackmagicusing shunned demonfamiliar beau whom i didnt trust all the black magic that id done in front of vivianasked her to help with maybe now that shed seen what they faced if they ignored the coming problem with the demons they might think more kindly of me maybe having kusox attack us would help my case would they really try to kill me if there were worse uglies out there uglies they couldnt handle people had died in the last few days but not because of my magic and more would have died if i had feigned ignorance and let kusox do whatever the hell he wanted you sure you know what youre doing trent i whispered hoping he knew i was talking about kusox and his fingers stiffened slightly i wont say its not like you because using dangerous things like theyre flash paper has you written all over it but do you have any idea what youve done jenks was basking in the new warmth but his eyes flicked from mine to trent is it ceri i guessed are you trying to impress her be the elf she thinks you should be lips twitching trent ran a hand over his head to get his ventblown hair to lay flat it was one of his tells and he caught himself lowering his hand to grip the wheel i have my reasons he said simply yeah because you dont trust me to keep you alive i set the bottle in the cup holder and put my boots on the dash knees bent as i tried to find a comfortable position trust has nothing to do with it trent said as he glanced at my boots and jenks made a rude noise i trust you rachel i never would have left cincinnati if i didnt i trust you though youre quick tempered and jump to conclusions too fast god knows why my brow smoothed out and i took my feet down really he gave me a sidelong glance its important to you isnt it i looked out at the world starting to go from black to gray yes it is no one likes to be given a compliment then find out its fake a small noise came from trent and he frowned i never thought of it like that sorry tinks a disney whore jenks swore from the ashtray did he just say he was sorry trent glanced at him in irritation but i was grinning shhhh dont ruin the moment jenks i said it might never come again trent chuckled his good mood returning i could fix that though and after a moment i asked again very softly so why did you do it you little goober i added in my head eyes on the mountains he was silent i didnt do it because i didnt trust you i did it because hes part of myquest he finally said clearly embarrassed oh my god jenks exclaimed take me with you trent ive never been on an elf quest before pleeeease quiet jenks i murmured not wanting trent to stop talking then turned to trent so youve got a way to take care of what you um started right when its over i wont know until i finish it trent said looking at me in snatches he shrugged i never intended all this to happen i turned away having a hard time getting mad at him i was too tired welcome to my world i said thinking id done some pretty stupid things in my day too ive got a way to take care of things trent insisted but i doubted it and his usual tells werent telling me anything my gaze dropped to jenks and he shrugged at a loss as well jenkss going with him was looking better to me i wanted to know what trent was doing that was so risky he needed a demon to help him god what was wrong with us still i looked inquiringly at jenks twitching my fingers in the pixy signal that meant scout and he nodded maybe that had been jenkss intention all along sitting up i looked over the seat at ivy lurking under a blanket she was awake her eyes black in the dim light she grimaced rolling her eyes at trent and nodding as well it was unanimous then i think you should take jenks with you i said as i turned back around his grip tightened on the wheel no noooo jenks whined hey if its about the altitude sickness seattle is lower than cincy ill be fine i exhaled loudly gathering my strength jenks is right if youre allowed a pixy on an elf quest you should take one im not having this conversation trent said and jenkss wings hummed my eyes narrowed and i turned the heat up even more trent you are a stiffnecked overbearing cold im not cold impersonal son of a bitch try making a decision by looking at something other than logic you might have more friends that way jenkss mouth shut and he looked surprised trent too seemed taken aback just because i dont wear my heart on my sleeve you dont even wear your heart in your chest i interrupted but one thing you arent is stupid i flung a hand in the air exasperated with him and not even knowing why i was trying to help hed given me nothing but grief and a chance to save myself i dont know what youre doing i said frankly i dont care as long as you dont land your butt in jail when i need you standing up for me at the coven meeting so just consider this me being selfish asking you to let jenks help you do me a favor huh jenkss wings shifted and trent stared out at nothing as we drove into the dark or are you so proud that you cant accept a sidekick trent looked at jenks hes not a sidekick he said and i blinked a compliment awww i think im going to fart fairy dust jenks said clearly pleased as he managed to make the flight to the rearview mirror now that he was warm again from the back ivy piped up take him it will save me from pounding you when you dont show up by midnight tomorrow trent jerked his head to glance at her youre awake too vivian stretched yawning i think you should take him the coven member said you cant be expected to work alone no one but a fool works alone trent cleared his throat dryly and i exchanged a worried look with him hoping she hadnt pieced together that the thing wed been talking about was kusox how about you pierce i said trying to distract her you want to weigh in on this decision aye he said the lump he made not moving im of a mind you should do it alone surprised i turned to look at pierce as he sat up his mood surly but only so that devil of a demon doesnt eat jenks he added i wouldnt give a horse apple for the son of a kalamack but jenks is a fine warrior and id be sad to see him make a die of it for whatever foolish quest youre on oooooh strike one not a twitch not a single movement gave away trents thoughts he wasnt going to go for it and whatever idiotic thing he was about to do in seattle was going to bitchslap me with no advance warning probably at the least opportune time i glanced at jenks jenks shrugged the slight rise of his shoulders almost unnoticed with the thin glow of pixy dust sifting from him face it you little cookie maker jenks said almost sounding fond in the last couple of days youve seen what its like to be in a family with all the touchy tempers and irritation that goes on now you get to see the other side where we do stupid stuff for each other just because we like you rache is the little sister ivys the big sister im the uncle from out of state and youre the rich nephew no one likes but we put up with you anyway because we feel sorry for you just let me help huh it wont kill you im the little sister i thought looking back at ivy for her opinion finding her smiling a soft closedlips smile silentthinking i hopetrent drove not really seeing the road as we barreled into the mountains fine he eventually said to make jenks explode with a burst of pixy dust but im not telling you what im doing until we get there okay okay jenks said making a swooping flight to his shoulder both trent and i stiffened but jenks was oblivious tell me when we get there i can adapt damn rache this is going to be fun yeah fun i said giving trent a sharp look if jenks didnt come back i would be all over trent like a pisseddemon no airplanes on the way home i added and trent nodded carefully so as not to unbalance jenks no airplanes trent said and keep him warm he likes it warm god rache shut up jenks said sitting down looking right on trents shoulder ill be fine were probably just going to steal his grandmothers ring back somehow as i settled back into the leather i doubted that and i couldnt help but wonder if id just saved or damned my ass sixteen the sun was almost up and i stretched beside the car in the brightening predawn damp feeling all the bruises that id gotten in margaritaville there werent many people around this time of day either inderlanders or humans and a quiet hush held our voices down it was either that or we were all too numb to say anything here among the buildings the fog had retreated but the glimpse i got of the bay on the way in said that it would be a while before it lifted and id get a glimpse of alcatraz squinting up at the brightening sky i breathed deep to bring in the scent of salt old garbage exhaust and the sticky smell of the petunias in the huge planters outside the hotel the air felt slippery from the salt and i shifted my shoulders as if trying to fit in a new skin the hotel stretching above us looked nice i guess ivy had made the reservations so it would have to be trent had a room here too which was convenient he was currently with vivian and the doorman i lifted my bag out of the trunk then trents ivy already had her bag and was heading in the small carryon rolling quietly behind her i hurt all over and i set the bags down with a click of plastic jenks stay close i said when i caught sight of the pixies tending the huge flowerpots they looked almost militant a traveling pixy was almost as rare as a sole traveling vampire jenks darted from me to prove he wasnt scared the overhead light glinting on his sword god it feels good to be at sea level he said facing the unseen bay smell that i winced my thoughts drifting to alcatraz it seemed a whole lot more real that i might end up there now sure nice but it did feel good to get out of the car you want to go in and check the lobby for lethal charms it might be overkill but we did have reservations and i wouldnt put it past the coven to hit me hereseeing that vivian had ridden almost the entire way with us and they probably didnt want a credible witness to my death giving me a thumbsup he followed trent inside when the doorman returned to his station to call a cab for vivian she was staying down on the bay with the rest of the coven in someones house glancing at pierce who was standing alone and looking like a doorman himself with his vest and hat she came up to me smiling i dont know if i should thank you or not she said her purse over her shoulder her hair was mussed and her clothes were wrinkled she was far away and distant from the trendy polished coven member i remembered from the grocery store this last spring the confidence was still there though she stuck out her hand and i took it feeling an odd sense of peace when her small fingers met mine ill say it then i said thank you for helping hesitating i pulled my attention from pierce trying to talk to the hotel pixies im glad you saw everything vivian squinted as she ran a hand over her tangled cartrip hair i have to tell them i nodded thinking she looked positively bedraggled good maybe theyll begin to understand the inherent problems in shunning black magic to the point of ignorance my gaze went to pierce i didnt know what to think anymore my world had gone from black and white to shades of gray a long time ago and there were no answers easy or otherwise i couldnt condemn pierce for trying to kill al by using magic unless i condemned myself for having tried to kill kusox with the same sure kusox was bad but so was al that al was important to me wasnt a good enough reason everyone was important to someone a deep breath went in and out of vivian and she couldnt meet my eyes theyre afraid hell rachel im afraid were at such a disadvantage theyre going to want to bury everything and hope we dont have to deal with it for another generation my gaze flicked back to pierce it worked last time why try anything new clearly having heard her pierce turned a mix of determination and irritation on his face thats what ive abided by all along and look where it got me hands in her pockets vivian shrugged she was one of six and the youngest i carefully lifted my bridesmaids dress out and shut the trunk with a thump hearing the solid sound echo it was as if the world was still asleep here on the verge of a new day they should be afraid i said as i draped the dress over my arm its not going to go away they have to do something i hesitated hoisting my duffel bag in my free hand besides giving me a lobotomy that is vivian rocked back as her cab pulled up and the doorman opened the door for her well thank you she said chuckling ruefully its been an education her gaze went to pierce now standing beside me and trying to take my suitcase if i dont get the chance to see you alone again good luck good luck id need it oh wait i said as she started to turn away and i let pierce take my bag then made him hold my dress too ive got something for you i said head down as i rummaged in my shoulder bag vivian paused and i held my breath in annoyance until my searching fingers found the little möbiusstrip pin this is yours i said as i handed it over feeling flustered for some reason i didnt magic it or anything i thought you might want it back seeing as you dont have oneanymore a huge smile spread across her face as she took it pleasure and real gratitude in her expression thanks she said softly her smooth fingers curving over the pin possessively ill probably have to give it up because you touched it but thank you brooke her words broke off and her gaze dropped brooke gave me hell for losing it there were new wrinkles at the corners of her eyes when she looked up and a deep sadness leaning forward she gave me a hug her fist holding her pin pressing hard into my back she wasnt very tall and i was again struck by how someone so slight could be so powerful thanks she whispered as she stepped back her eyes flicking to mine as if embarrassed she had smelled like redwood and i wondered if she had sensed the stink of burnt amber on me when she turned and headed for her cab her eyes unable to meet mine the door thumped shut behind her and she waved looking worried as the car pulled away the sound of the engine was muffled in the rising fog and it was just pierce and me standing outside a squat hotel in the middle of san francisco the doorman waiting for the keys so he could park my moms car pierce had my stuff so i handed the attendant my keys along with a couple of bills and the guy thanked me his suspicions easing pierces eyes widened at the amount but he was probably still running on eighteenthcentury gratuities and i dont think a nickel would have done it the car vanished in the same way as the first and i looked at the hotel almost losing my balance as i ran my eyes up to the brightening sky the thought of earthquakes slipped through me and i took my garment bag back from pierce it would be just like the coven to destroy an entire building to get to me my lethalamulet detector hung conspicuously from the side of my bag as i headed to the double doors with my dress over my arm it felt like i was entering a war zone a minor shiver lifted through my aura as i passed over the threshold and my shoulders dropped pierce grunted as he felt it too and i was guessing it was a rather expensive calming charm temporary to be sure but effective this looks nice i said as i looked over the deep receptionliving room designed in solid blocks of color that were rich and sophisticated the ceilings werent that high but they were decorated to hide the retrofitted earthquake support to my right was the reception desk where the night clerk was talking to ivy trent was standing before it chatting amicably to the manager he must have been dropping hundreddollar bills again because the man in the suit was almost bowing and scraping ivy though was having trouble clearly not happy with the woman behind the desk jenks was snarling something at her a red dust pooling on her keyboard trouble pierce muttered as he set my bag down and put his hands behind his back feet spread wide as he scanned the place of course theres trouble i said as ivy stepped from the desk her eyes were black and her motions were edging into that eerie vampiric quickness jenkss wings were clattering in anger and i sighed knowing what was coming they lost our reservation jenks shrilled the tinkblasted hotel didnt hold the room so sorry he said in a high falsetto nothing we can do we drove two thousand miles and we dont have a room no one in the city does because of the convention ivys lips were pressed tight her anger in check las vegas must have helped i made that reservation through rynn cormels secretary she complained it was a good thought i said as i tried to think but i was too numb well find something a park bench maybe the parking lot of the local wally world yeah thatd be safe i could wear my bridesmaids dress and fit right in with the kooks trent ambled our way a hotel envelope in his hand he looked too satisfied to live the manager with him scooped up my bag and i felt a surge of adrenaline when he dropped it on the luggage trolley with trents my protest died though when trent smiled that infuriating smile of his and handed both ivy and me a plastic key ready to go up he asked pleasantly ivy closed her eyes in a long blink then tossed her bag onto the trolley keeping her smaller computer bag right where it was over her shoulder sweet mother of tink jenks swore what did you do buy the place something like that trent said his smooth suave demeanor slipping back even if he was still in jeans and a casual top you dont have a room because i booked the top floor for us can we hurry up about it i have an appointment im already late in seattle i thought starting for the elevators when the manager still blathering at trent about parking and how to call for a car pointed them out the calming spell took hold again and my tension slipped away thank you trent i said as i hung my garment bag on the trolley and fingered the little plastic card it was small for the amount of grief it had just saved us i dont know how you do it i mean i know but how they know were together trent angled in front of ivy to push the elevator button and i smiled i hadnt known he was a button pusher jenks was too i couldnt care less who hit the buttons as long as we got there i bought the place last year trent admitted then turned to look past me to the lobby this is nice i should come out here more jenks and pierce were with the bellhop who was clearly not going to accompany us but would take our stuff up through a secondary elevator the elevator before us opened to show a lift the size of my closet earthquakes i thought balking rachel pierce said loudly interrupting my sudden panic attack jenks and i will mind the plunder er luggage theres not enough room in the lift nohow i stifled a shudder as i minced into the elevator okay i said not wanting two more bodies in here anyway even if one could fly see you up there just get me up there and out of this box i thought as the doors slid shut again i wasnt claustrophobic and i didnt mind elevators where was this coming from trent reached past ivy to push the topmost button and i caught a whiff of cinnamon heavy in the cramped quarters the car shook as the gears shifted and we headed up far too slowly for my liking i breathed deep watching the light move beside me ivys eyes flashed black she edged away from me as trent chuckled i didnt know you were afraid of elevators rachel he said his voice holding a light mockery im not i said as i gave ivy a worried look my thoughts flashed back to kisten and our first kiss in an elevator and she pretty much flung herself into the corner not knowing what i was thinking but tasting the memory of fear and desire flooding me better and better i thought as trent looked between us amused its not the elevator its the coven i added when the elevator finally dinged i held my breath as i waited forever for the doors to open but it was ivy who was first out brushing past me in a spicy wave of vampire incense that made me quiver trent leaned in whispering its when im gone that youre going to have to be careful oh really i thought my attention on the brightly patterned carpet as i stepped from the elevator into the hallway slowly so it didnt look like i was bolting were on the end there trent was saying as he checked his envelope but ivy again was ahead of us steps fast as she strode to the end of the short hall where the big window looked out onto a fire escape she tried the last door and i could hear her sigh when it opened she was inside and gone before trent and i were even halfway down the corridor either she had some intestinal problem she had to take care of or my fear in the elevator combined with the memory of kisten had hit her hard it felt funny walking down the hallway with trent both of us carrying the small items we thought were too important to risk coming up on the trolley i caught glimpses of us in the long mirrors set next to the occasional door looking like fake windows and again i was struck by the idea that we were with each other but not together like the night on the boat when it had blown up under us and we were the only two to survivetrent because i had made a protective bubble around us by using the connection made through his familiar and then me because hed pulled my frozen ass out of the ohio river and kept me from dying of hypothermia but now as we walked down the hallway there was a new awarenessnot of kinship but an understanding and it made me nervous even as it wascomforting hey rache came jenkss hail from behind us and the rattle of the trolley as pierce helped the bellhop at the distant end of the hall top floor jenks said proudly were in the penthouse suite wheres ivy inside already i said and trent ran his card and held the door open for me jenks darted in and i followed eager to see what a penthouse suite looked like nice i think the word would be nice or really nice id go as far as friggin nice wow i whispered stopping somewhere in the middle of what id probably call a living room arranged with two couches facing each other a coffee table in between decorated with stuff to make it homey and inviting to my right was a small kitchen a bar with three stools making a pleasant place to eat if the small table in it wasnt enough there were fruit and cold cuts laid out and breadfresh by the smell of it i think the maid had baked it in the oven while she tidied the place looking past the living room i could see a second living room with a bank of windows it was on a platform and looked more plush and comfortable there was a huge tv between the two rooms that seemed to rotate on a swivel a wet bar took up one side of the upper living room and it all looked out on a spectacular view of the bay i hadnt realized we were up so high in the hills and though it was still foggy i could see the tops of the bridge poking through a room with a viewof alcatraz trent dropped his small satchel on the coffee table this is pleasant he said gaze darting to the closed doors off the raised living room which had to be the bedrooms not closets better than roadside hotels anyway i would have gotten angry with him but he was smiling probably remembering that nasty shower id dragged him out of and i couldnt help but wonder what the bathroom here was like i was betting nice trailing a silver dust jenks buzzed out of one room and tucked under the door of another ivys faint shout to leave filtered in and jenks darted back into the living room in an instant he was at the windows checking things out at least we knew where ivy was id just about kill for a shower i said as the trolley rattled in pierce holding the door for it his eyes widened upon seeing the room and he stumbled out of the bellhops way in a burst of noise ivys door was flung open the bellhops spiel faltered as she strode forward grabbed her bag and then vanished behind her door again i flopped onto the couch with my back to the window my gaze going to the second bedroom id be willing to bet trent would claim it even if he wasnt going to be here tonightoff doing his little elfquestthing shes a little cranky jenks said distracting the bellhop who looked more than a bit startled as he turned from hanging my garment bag in the front closet dialing zero will get you the front desk the bellhop started again glancing from trent to pierce and then to me clearly trying to match us up before attempting to move any more luggage trents bag was headed in with ivy until trent cleared his throat andsure enoughclaimed the second room with little more than a nod i guess ive got a couch i said and the bellhop simply emptied the trolley and left the luggage in the entryway jenks was still checking the place out and pierce had joined him whistling when he found the bathroom next to the kitchen will there be anything else mr kalamack the bellhop was asking when trent bodily took him by the elbow and delicately propelled him to the door privacy trent said leaving him at the door and going back for the trolley no deliveries leave them at the desk no turndown service no incoming calls except from me a table for dinner would be pleasant say about ten family style if at all convenient chefs choice heavy on the vegetables no deepfried anything its been a long trip yes sir the man was saying now in the hall with the trolley thank you sir he added when trent handed him a folded bill welcome home mr kalamack smiling and nodding trent shut the door in his face he waited until the faint sound of the trolley creaking away came through the door and then he sighed his shoulders slumping for all of three seconds before he pulled them back up i could hear pierce trying out the faucets in the bathroom and i smiled as i draped my arms across the top of the couch this is nice trent flashed me a look picking up his smaller bag he headed for his room excuse me he said and i would have been hurt but for the reminder that though i could relax for a while his quest was just starting hed given himself three seconds to relax that was it three from the bathroom pierce said you could wash a cow in here look rache jenks said from the windows behind me you can see that bridge theyre always yammering about huh its not that big the one nick drove off is way bigger hey look theres an island oh great the fog had lifted alcatraz i said turning to see but hed darted to my bag landing on it with his hands on his hips wings moving so fast i couldnt see them my shoulder hurt from yesterday and i gingerly felt it i had a pain amulet in my luggage but it wouldnt work here maybe they had aspirin in the lobby i gotta get changed jenks said as he slipped into the pocket that had been designated as his trent wanted to leave like five minutes ago pierce came out of the bathroom immediately going into the kitchen and opening the cupboards to see what there was in a burst of silver dust jenks popped from my bag you going to be okay here with mr adventure my gaze slid to pierce then back to jenks go have fun dont let him kill you kay jenks nodded then tossed his head to get his long curly hair out of his eyes in a flash of dust he had darted into trents bedroom with a wad of clothes i hadnt seen him this excited about a run since matalina died and it was depressing in a happy way i wasnt too keen on jenks leaving every time he did i got into trouble that everyone would think trent was still in the room might buy me some timeas long as i didnt leave either but there were worse places to be a prisoner the hair on the back of my neck prickled and i stood my gaze drawn to the window and the newly exposed bay yep there it was i stood for a moment twenty feet back from the window and just looked at the dark blob that was alcatraz the small clink of pierce at the wet bar caught my attention and i moseyed over to the kitchen a little sandwich of overpriced crackers and cheese would wake up my appetite and i made four of them oh this is ood i said around my full mouth salivating as the salt and bite of the cheese hit the sides pierce youve got to try the white cheese its sharp pierce gave me a noncommittal mmm and i headed for trents room with my napkin of goodies i didnt know where trent wanted to be dropped if i left it up to al he might leave them on top of the needlethe outside of the needle trents door wasnt shut and i tapped on it with my knuckle trent i heard a buzz of pixy wings and then trents distant come in it had come from somewhere deeper in the room and after brushing the cracker crumbs off i pushed open the door hey trent where do youwow this is nice if the living room and kitchen were well appointed the bedroom was opulent with more pillows on the bed than we had in the entire church wallpaper and metal appliqués disguised the retrofit for the earthquakes and id be willing to bet the canopy over the bed was sturdy enough to handle more than dust i ate another cracker sandwich wondering where trent was until i heard him talking to jenks from a room off this one trent i called not wanting to walk in on him in his skivvies in here having that as an invitation i crossed the room feeling the deeper carpet and noticing the lack of even a hint of an echo it felt nice in here the first room i peeked into was an office but the second was clearly a bathroom you decent i asked hesitating at the door depends on who you ask rolling my eyes i stepped over the threshold my toes edging the tile work trent didnt look up from where he was standing over a sink leaning toward the mirror to apply something to his face hed changed out of his jeans and i hesitated drinking him in with my eyes damn he was in a skintight black twopiece of spandex and cotton not only that but he was wearing it extremely well and i stood for a moment and just appreciated what he usually hid behind his suit and tie all lean muscle and long lines his fair hair was slicked back and the slightly darker color and flat look changed his entire appearance making him look less professional boardroom and more professional bad boy a utility belt rested on the counter holding what were probably thief tools hovering at his eye level and rubbing a dark smear under his eyes was jenks the two of them looked remarkably alikeonce you dismissed the wings and size difference seeing him unaware i could appreciate how slim trent was athletic with just enough muscle in all the right places a runners body i tried to keep my eyes where they belongedthen gave up letting my eyes linger where they wouldthen warmed when my eyes rose to find trent watching me in amusement in the mirror his smile shifted as he recognized my appreciation the slight movement of his body an invitation to look more god he was teasing me and flushing i took my eyes off him ellasbeth your name is fool what is that youre putting on your face i asked to try to move the nonverbal communication away from how good trent looked and how smug he was that id noticed it smelled like cut grass in hereclean refreshing and carrying the bite of chlorophyll i didnt think it was the toiletbowl cleaner pulling back from the mirror trent capped a bottle and jauntily tossed it to me i had to move fast almost dropping my last two cracker sandwiches as i snagged it onehanded my shoulder gave a twinge as i caught it it covers my scent he said and i set my napkin down so i could open it i gave the nondescript white stuff a good sniff to verify that this was where the cutgrass smell was coming from my shoulders eased as the scent slipped into me reminding me of summer all this and he smells good too you dont stink i said as i dabbed a bit of it on the back of my hand and from nowhere the question flitted through me of what he had wanted to be when he grew up thank you i appreciate that his voice was light teasing and i stayed where i was as he reached for the jeans hed had on earlier his motions becoming tauntingly slow as he put one foot in then the other i suppose i should have said it will mask any smell ill pick up in the everafter he added turning to give me a sideways view as he zipped up his pants the familiar sound hit me and i jerked my gaze away pretending to be looking at the flatscreen tv they had in here okay so hed been wearing a lot less just a moment ago and id seen him just about naked in the shower but something about seeing a guy hike up a pair of jeans followed by that distinctive sound of a zipper was sovery intimate and the worst part it was obvious he knew he was pushing my buttons knowing it as well jenks sighed at me and continued arranging his hair his long blond ringlets were oiled back just like trents and i wondered if there was some kind of heroworship thing going on frowning i set the bottle down trent was putting on his casual shirt over his skintight top and i didnt dare look at him as he got dressed but his reflection caught my eye as he stretched showing every lanky inch of himself damn it seeing him getting dressed was almost more tantalizing than seeing him getting undressed might be you look great i said unable to stop myself you should wear thief more often how do you know i dont trent teased as he sat on a bench that was in here and began to put his shoes on no laces slip on slip off easy the casual clothes over a black outfit the scentdisguising salve shoes too soft for any real useit added up to a breakandtake sure trent had the look and the talk but could he walk the walk ah trent i started arms crossed as i leaned into the wall trent looked up from his shoes dont worry ive practiced this nothing in that belt pack is lethal right i persisted wanting to go look not that i care i said when he eyed me but if youre caught lethal usually gets you put in jail smiling faintly he stood up and looked at himself and if it looks like a harmless prank they let you go i got that part thanks he buttoned another button to hide the black shirt underneath if they catch me ill be dead not in jail i pushed away from the door frame whoa hold on a sec i told quen id watch you just what are the risks here jenks clattered his wings but i couldnt tell by his worried expression if this was something hed known about before or not quen puts the odds of my being successful at eleven percent trent said not meeting my eyes but with jenks i think its much better than that eleven percent i echoed the same odds quen had had of surviving that experimental treatment last year the same odds that trent didnt believe were really possible my risk not yours trent said as he draped the utility belt around his slim waist and fastened it i could tell he was nervous somewhere under that facade of calm he had developed in the boardroom its an elf quest right he said forcing a chuckle youre not responsible for me once i hit seattle quen knows that ive already notified him what happens to me from here on out is not your problem but id gotten him here and i couldnt help but feel responsible forwhatever he was doing what was he doing i licked my lips and lowered my arms trying to play the i dont care game youre serious about the dead thing i couldnt help but ask he didnt answer and jenks remained silent as he sat on the tvs remote his knees almost to his ears i grimaced realizing that jenks had already slipped into backup mode he never said much when i was on a run with him either he wasnt wearing a scrap of red and it worried me damn it if trent came back and jenks didntid make him suffer if i did nothing else in this world id make him suffer bad seeing me ready to call the whole thing off jenks blurted out ready trent trent looked at me his hair slicked back and his green eyes holding excitement yes you were just kidding about the dead thing right right jenks hovered by my shoulder take a chill strip rache he said theyre faster than the pills and come in convenient dispensers ive got this covered hes not doing anything that you wouldnt do thats what im worried about crap i was used to beating the percent but trent didnt believe it was possible it was often belief that made the impossible real jeez maybe i should go with them as if knowing my thoughts jenkss expression darkened trent took off his watch leaving it on the counter his wallet was next and he took most of the money out of it and tucked it in a small slot in the utility belt before setting the smooth leather next to his watch i took a slow breath if i said anything now jenks would be insulted trust i had to trust but it was hard where do you want to be dropped off i asked softly trent was giving himself a last look fussing with the hair about his ears train station he said shortly preferably on the platform not the track he drawled nervous i pushed myself into motion okay ill call him i headed for the living room trent followed with jenks on his shoulder pierce was looking through the front closet as we entered and i couldnt help but wonder if this was what it would be like working for trent amicable conversations in penthouse suites in foreign cities the excitement of a run coursing through me and the coming satisfaction of knowing id done something no one else had before very secret agent was this why nick did what he did i sneaked a glance at trent as i sat on the couch thinking he looked fantastic standing therehis color high and that calm confidence he always had tightened by excitement twice he had called on a demon and survived admittedly it had been a mistake but hed done it he had the gutsor stupidityto work with wild magic elven and dangerous he had a pixy on his shoulder and was ready to do something clever and dangeroussomething that if he failed would mean his death i didnt know who he was anymore and i felt a stirring inside feeling my eyes on him he lifted his head what for a moment i said nothing tasting the emotions coursing through me as he tried to read my mind was i confusing adrenaline with attraction was i losing sight of my desire for independence distracted by quick clever people who didnt give a damn about whom they hurt to get what they wanted or was i just now seeing who he really was trents face lost its questioning expression shades of mistrust seeping in around his eyes jenks buzzed his wings at me and i shook myself nothing be careful okay not convinced trent stood beside a comfortable chair waiting pierce scrambled to catch the clothes iron as it fell jenks flew up and down at the noise but neither trent nor i even looked okay i breathed as i tugged my bag closer and brought out my mirror turning halfway to the back of the room i shouted ivy im dropping trent off ill be back in five minutes i thought for a second maybe ten okay came her muffled voice and i felt a surge of tension wait jenks exclaimed i have to give ivy my phone shes going to call my kids for me while im gone i glanced at trent expecting to find a tired exasperation surprised when i found only a patient understanding maybe theyd been talking more than i thought jenks buzzed off ivys closed door hardly slowing him down as he slipped through the crack pierce finally got the iron back where it belonged and he shut the sliding closet door with an attentiongetting thump rachel he warned me and my blood pressure spiked pushed by the adrenaline already coursing through me his blue eyes were pinched and his jaw was tight reminding me of when he had once stood in the snow in a borrowed coat and tried to stop me from helping him with a run id flipped him into a snowbank then and id do the same here well minus the snow of course dont start with me i said and trent scuffed his foot on the carpet impatient al owes me for saving his life the scrying mirror was warming on my lap and i set a hand on it feeling a ping of energy equalize thanks for that by the way i might be able to milk this for years id meant it to be funny but pierce came closer sitting on the edge of the chair opposite me the coffee table between us the table had expensivelooking picture books on it of the work of local artists most of which looked too sophisticated for my tastes i dont like this he said i dont like it much myself i said almost laughing as i exchanged a look with trent from ivys room came an exasperated i got it jenks every four hours go away and let me sleep jenks darted out looking browbeaten and i turned my attention to my calling circle it was as beautiful as ever and i had made it with a curse is it going to work trent asked suddenly startling me the salt in the air i slid my fingertips to the cave of the pentagram touching the proper glyphs no reason it shouldnt its demon not earth magic i looked up jenks are we clear jenks landed on trents shoulder shocking the elf give me a break he said snidely i checked for bugs like three seconds after i came in what do you think i was doing looking through cupboards for no reason like a goober pierce grimaced scooting to the back of his chair looking embarrassed lets do it then i said and reached for a ley line my face screwed up and i swear my eye started twitching an awful metallic taste blossomed in my mouth and my stomach twisted oh god the lines here are awful i said finding one that was reasonably clean it was as if theyd been fractured and were picking up rust and dirt maybe it was the earthquakes my gaze went to the bolts in the wall and i forced myself to look away steadying myself i let the awful ley line fill me reaching out and touching a finger of awareness into the everafter by way of the calling circle rachel calling al come in al i said sarcastically come in your immenseness standing across from me trent raised his eyebrows in question and i pressed my hand more firmly finding it harder than usual to hold the divided awareness soon as al picked up the interference would vanish but until then i was left feeling disoriented abruptly my focus blurred and my muscles were suddenly loose a warm lassitude soaked into me and i realized that though al had acknowledged me and made a connection he wasnt altogether conscious he was sleeping al i pushed into his mind only to find myself surrounded by tiny slate blue butterflies in a field of amber grass the tips waving at my waist al was trying to catch them but every time he tried hed open his whitegloved hands to find them crushed and stinking like carrion the grass grew tall until it waved over my head and turned into a maze al kept trying to catch the butterflies and they began vanishing through cracks in the walls al i shouted disoriented and the dream vanished als panic coursed through me confusing me even more i felt him bolt upright then gasped when a black magic swirled through me burning my brain there was a huge drop in the line i was connected to as he pulled on it through me al wait i shouted but it was too late and i winced as i felt him throw a ball of unfocused energy at a shadow its just me i shouted as al cowered swearing when he realized his mistake rachel pierce said leaning over the table to put a hand on my shoulder feeling the line burning through me he pulled away with a disturbed slant to his eyebrows he was sleeping i said in explanation dizzy as i tried to see both pierce and decipher what was going on in the everafter simultaneously i had to wake him up were good now the hell we are al swore and i felt his surface emotions swirl around and the feel of a soft robe he was draping over himself i blew a blasted hole in my wall damn it rachel what do you want i was sleeping so i noticed i said thinking it curious that he was dreaming of butterflies they looked exactly like the butterflies hed once made out of snowflakes brushing them from his sleeve to die in the snow except for the chrysalis still on my kitchen windowsill at home im sorry to wake you but i have a favor to ask trent cleared his throat we drove all the way out here and you havent asked about this he said sounding alarmed but not surprised its not a big deal i grumped if he doesnt ill ask newt i need to talk to her anyway what al said suddenly a whole lot more awake ask newt what i resettled myself on the sofa tucking a strand of hair behind my ear as i noticed my reflection bouncing back up at me coated in red and silver i need a trip through the lines for two trent and jenks jenks buzzed his wings proud to be counted as a person but id never seen him any other way al huffed in his thoughts sending me the feeling of warm slippers being scooted onto his feet im not your taxi service no youre my teacher i said and i saved your life im not going to bargain for favors in return for saving your life im asking for some consideration from one lost witch to a lost demon i said silently glancing at jenks when he hummed in disapproval knowing id said something just not out loud im exhausted al thought and i caught a glimpse in my mind of him looking into a mirror tweaking the skin around his eyes can it wait ive been in meetings all day yammer yammer yammer and no pierce to fix my lunch he makes a marvelous fish sandwich ask him dove he was using pet namesnot good you made me take him i said and pierce stiffened knowing we were talking about him al i need this its not a matter of convenience he made a noise and i pressed my fingers more firmly until it felt like the ice of the glass was touching my bone look let me dream a little longer okay i thought silently not wanting to share with jenks my low expectations of what was going to happen in the next couple of days i know how slim a chance i have to get out of this but its a chance al was thinkinga good sign id saved his ass and he was going to give this to me i need to see this through if only to be able to walk away knowing who my enemies are i said aloud i couldnt help it and my eyes rose to find pierces not missing a beat pierce pointed to trent trent cleared his throat affronted but al was talking and i had to concentrate growing up is hard love otherwise everyone would do it spare me i muttered i need a jump for trent and jenks to seattle and back i know youre going to do it or you wouldnt have gotten out of bed a devious spark lit through al making me smile one way it costs too much he said theres no inflation in the everafter al call it a recession then one way i looked at trent and smiled he relaxed exhaling as his shoulders dropped okay one way i said but i want to see them off so its one way for them two way for me deal al thought sharply and jenks made a burst of gold dust yelping holy crap the pixy swore and the fractured disjointedness of san franciscos ley lines sliced into me jangling my nerves i snapped a bubble of protection around my thoughts large enough to include jenks and trent i could feel trents flash of fear dissolve into acceptance and jenks readying himself his steady courage flowing into me like a memory that wasnt mine surrounding us like an oily smoke was als presence but i pulled most of his reeking burnt amber and selfishness to me not wanting trent and jenks to have to deal with it embarrassed maybe the train station al i shouted in my thoughts not wanting to show up in traffic on the platform i added my nonexistent heart pounded and i felt the lines grow pure around me again the taint of salt and rust fading away to be replaced by the taste of ozone clean pure and fast a glimpse of an immense dirty room not yet formed sifted through my eyes the presences of trent and jenks were with me and i dissolved the bubble holding them as i felt their souls slip from my grasp and return to the memory of their bodies i ached to take a breath but as soon as i thought i might have lungs i was yanked back into nothing my forming body dissolving so fast i swear it hurt al i shouted disoriented and then it was al sheltering my thoughts i threw up another barrier between us as he laughed the platform dissolved and reality swung around i waited for the trendy furnishings of the hotel in san francisco to appear and gritted my nonexistent teeth to endure the fractured ley lines the witches were forced to use here but the tinfoilonteeth feeling never came instead the line grew warmer comfortable familiar crap on toast i thought as i reached for the top of the leather wingback chair my fingers ghosting through until i yanked them back and tried again to find them solid i was in als library trent jenks i called out as soon as i had lungs damn it had it all been a trap i should have let pierce kill him not here itchy witch safe at the train station as promised al said and i spun to see him in the robe id felt him put on standing by the huge hearth with a bowl of marshmallows on the hearth beside him come sit by the fire he said patting the leather seat we need to talk seventeen the intention was for me to say goodbye i said almost setting my scrying mirror down then changing my mind at the last moment i wasnt stayingif i had any say in the matter al scooted his chair closer to the fire sitting on the edge before he shook his robe sleeves to his elbows and carefully wedged a marshmallow on the end of one of his toasting forks leaning in he held the puffed sugar close to the flames his muscular arms looked almost tan in the firelight feet spread wide he hunched toward the flame his bare feet showing from under the hem of his brown robe they were surprisingly normal looking behind me shelves of books were silent witnesses in the dark your intention was to see that they got there safely al said in a low voice focusing on the marshmallow they are off to make mischief on an elven scale which means worldwide and yet somehowtotally insignificant you need a new hobby rachel something other than nasty little men with visions of world domination the marshmallow caught fire and he pulled it close somehow looking suggestive as he ran his fingers down the length of the stick to take off the stillflaming puff i want to talk to you about magic and sweat he said the light from the burning marshmallow glinting in his eyes of good deeds born from stupid ideas of honest mistakes leading to dishonest graves his eyes met mine and he pursed his lips gently blowing the flaming sugar puff out oh god hes talking funny i thought nervous as i looked over the dark room deciding to stay behind the chair i let my scrying mirror slide down to rest on the soft leather i wanted both hands free al stood and i froze his movement had been graceful a studied motion of power that i seldom saw in him the marshmallow was gone and he was licking his fingers watching me from under his lowered brow my pulse quickened as he went to the fire taking a second marshmallow from the bowl what in hell is he playing at this trial of yours tomorrow he said odds are three to one that pierce will betray you i thought you said he was going to kill me i said trying to be flip a smile lifted his lips odds are eleven percent there but the bookies dont know that he loooooves you he mocked as he put the puff on the end of the toasting fork stay here forget it all and stay here with me let me spare you that i felt better with him eight feet away and my eyes rolled spare me the crap will you al i want to go back to the hotel shit he was a demon why did i keep forgetting that al crouched before the fire with the toasting fork looking threatening somehow his eyebrows were raised when he turned to face me mocking things have changed stifling a shiver i scanned the room but there was nothing here to help me damn damn damn why had i trusted him please dont tell me youre making a pass at me i said unclenching my fingers from the back of the chair it will make the next five hundred years really awkward besides the last guy who said something like that to me while wearing nothing but a robe i beat senseless with a chair leg al blinked looking surprised as he glanced down at himself as if only now realizing the impression he made but then he smiled and that smile was cruel he stood and i dropped back a step heart thudding that demon your familiar let loose kusox he said softly poised as i started to sweat hes like nothing youve come up against he wants to play with you take you apart slowly while you scream the collective would throw me naked into the ley lines if i let you run about now pierce isnt enough youre staying here like hell i am is this because i have a shot at getting my shunning permanently revoked angry i came around the chair so i could glare at him straight on i just might win our bet so youre going to keep me here so you can win by default willing to bet your life on it al almost growled as he looked into the fire his back hunched im not good or bad my livelihood is connected to your continued existence he said as his marshmallow burned call me selfish but youre staying here you might be scared of that thing you all made but im not i snapped his sensitive bits are right where yours are kusox is a demon and im getting used to beating you guys off i beat him off before i can do it again al turned from the fire his goatslitted eyes landing on me with an unexpected intensity i felt myself pale he looked dangerous crouched before the fire his eyes glowing as the promise of violence drifted over him a low sound lifted into the air and my foot slid it was my undoing al leapt for me the toasting fork clattering forgotten to the hearth panicked i turned to run there was nowhere go it was pure instinct i caught back my cry of terror as his fingers clamped on my shoulder the world spun as he turned me around al i managed and then i felt myself lifted shoved into a bookcase hard thumps hit my shoulders and my lungs collapsed as i hit the tomes little sparkles of energy pinging through me my breath came in with a rush and i stared at al inches from me his bare ruddy hand gripping my shirt under my chin i hadnt even seen him move you think you can beat kusox off lets practice get off me i spat at him strands of my hair on his face his expression became a snarl and i jerked when his other hand reached behind me and grabbed my thigh this should be fun hey i shouted trying to shove him away then i shrieked when he pushed me back into the bookcase his entire body pressing into me get the hell off i think youve misjudged your strength itchy witch al said his voice iron hard and im going to prove it how by squishing me to death i wheezed and then my eyes widened as als mouth covered mine savage and demanding the stink of demons assaulted me hard and fast a thread of ley line spilled into me from him diving to my groin and flashing into heat it could have been ecstasy but i was too angry his body was heavy on mine and his leg forced its way between my knees holy shit i thought my arms pinned behind me i couldnt breathe couldnt move i thought al was trying to prove i couldnt protect myself i wasnt scared i was pissed furious i tried to get my knee up between us feeling it al let go of my wrist long enough to punch my rising knee with a heavy fist i gasped at the sudden explosion of pain and my knee went numb my hand was free though and i went for his eyes gouging my fingers dug in with a sickening give al took the abuse quickly grabbing my wrist and almost yanking my arm out of its socket as he slammed it back into the books not nearly enough dove he said smiling as he bent toward me again my teeth were clenched and i tasted his blood as he forced his mouth on mine again you son of a bitch i screamed muffled from his lips and i reached for a ley line al felt it and i got in a clean breath as he pulled back long enough to laugh at me thats it he said breathing heavily his expression alight i think youre pissed enough now give me what youve got ill slip it back into you so slowly youll scream in pleasure and beg for more it was then that the fear took hold the ley line he was tracing through me felt good really good i knew what a witch could do to another and pain wasnt far from ecstasy this may have started out as an object lesson but al could take my abuse and make me writhe for it i was halfway to climaxing already this was not what i wanted al saw the realization in me and smiled shifting his weight suggestively his eyes half closing in anticipation you think you can handle me algaliarept i snarled and his eyes opened as i used his true name but his grip on my wrists was painfully tight god rachel you are such a tease he said and then he leaned in his mouth was demanding rough as he let go of my wrists and grasped the back of my head crushing himself to me the line he held sang in me lighting my synapses in a cascading flash that spilled from my lips down to my groin and i relished it even as i despised what he was doing id fucking had it with men making inappropriate passes at me my hands pushed against the books and we shifted forward our kiss never breaking as he found the back of the tall chair and stopped i never could have done it if he hadnt let me but i wasnt gouging his eyes out and since what he was doing to me felt really good he probably figured i was his he was still holding my head and his tongue was making inroads causing my pulse to pound a small sound of desire slipped from me and al let go of my face lifting me up so i could wrap my legs around his body feeling him against me my hands were in his hair as i drank him in taking the line through him learning the paths that the energy took from him to me god it felt good this careful exploration and i shivered i knew he was doing the same and it only made me angrier al broke from me and we both gasped itchy witch he said looking me up and down as he held me to him my god you aredamn you have no idea how long its been i smiled my arms around his neck and my fingers running through the hair on the nape of his neck i dont think so algaliarept i murmured leaning in and playing with the corner of his mouth with my own im not a tease i needed to know tohurt you he sucked in his breath but it was too late my legs tightened around him and i pressed his face to mine my thoughts dove into his finding the path among his synapses that hed first burned eons ago to safely bring a ley line into him punching through his thin film of surprise i grasped the ley lineand i pulled no he shrieked realizing his mistake my back arched as the power flooded in painful and delicious i could hear al cry out but it was as if i swam in glory itself and i pulled him to me closer wanting more arcing it through me back to the line burning clean and bright lighting the smut in me with pure fire from the gods the soft pop of displaced air almost went unnoticed as my soul chimed tuned to the ley line i was drowning al in but a faint whisper of selfpreservation caused me to open my eyes everything was bathed in a silvery white light everything that is but the flat foot in the purple slipper headed for me i tried to disentangle myself from al and the foot hit me flinging me across the room like i was a rag doll i hit a bookcase numb my fingers splayed over my chest and i couldnt breathe shit i think my ribs are broken i thought and i slid sideways to the floor my cheek burning on the carpet you lied to me newt screamed and i tried to cry out in pain as she lifted me up and slammed me against the shelf again i killed my sisters for you my mouth was working but nothing was coming out my head lolled and my focus was blurry the line id been connected to was gone and my gore rose and then i was screaming as the line i had yanked through al was arcing through me tulpa i thought trying to spindle it and i feebly pushed at newt to get her hands off me newt stop thats rachel i heard al croak hoarsely and the sharp sound of flesh smacking flesh the world lurched and i hit the carpet again i lay on the floor in a crumpled heap my fingers rubbing the soft bumps of the carpet my breath went in and out and it felt good it felt good not to be on fire my head pounded and i pushed most of the spindled energy out sagging in relief newt its not kusox al shouted again and i heard a bang and smelled ozone and the acrid scent of burnt books i killed my sisters for him newt raged get out of my way gally als soft hand touched my shoulder and i jerked managing to sit up al was standing beside me in his robe the hem trembling newt was in front of us wearing her purple martialarts robe her funny tallsided hat almost in the fire she had hair again the straight black strands cut short in a pageboy style and her long ugly feet were bare it was hard to tell what she was looking at since her eyes were black but i was pretty sure she was looking at me hatred pouring from her this isnt kusox al said his voice shaking and i wondered why he had stopped her its rachel she smells like kusox because she fought him its not kusox newt looked at me then her black eyes went to als she survived him are you sure maybe kusox is wearing her skin he does that al took a breath exhaling long and low his hand touching my shoulder left me and i sat where i was slumped over my knees my hair in my face i had tried to hurt al to get him to leave me alone and i think i might have gone too far drew a line through him like a familiar and almost fried his little kitty soul its her al said ruefully and i looked up to see him shuffle to the arrangement of furniture before the fire and fall into the chair farthest from me newts expression became one of familiar confusion have i forgotten something again she asked suspiciously it appeared as if she was killing you or were you two she hesitated then put a hand to her mouth and laughed gally you dog you tried to seduce her shes been living in my kitchen for almost a year he said sullenly forgive a man for testing the waters she wasnt screaming and my name is al now remember testing the waters i echoed him ticked you almost had me on the floor id be furious if i hadnt given him back as much as he gave me god men were pigs al frowned having to look over the couch between us you looked like you were enjoying yourself i know i was and thats why you were screaming like a little girl right i barked then hunched into myself and held my ribs ow yeah i had liked it but not with him never is it a pajama party gally newt asked and a wash of black everafter coated her my chi ached as newt shrank until the everafter fell away showing her looking like a child in bright red pajamas her hair was gone and her eyes were hollow she looked ill and in sudden shock i realized she was one of the kids in the brat pack at the hospitalthe one who had forgiven me for doing black magic shed died with one of my stuffed animals clutched to her and newt wore her image as if it meant nothing thats not nice i said and newt smiled like a beautiful bald angel with the wisdom of the world in her hurting me even more newt laughed again this time with a high childlike innocence making me shudder and forget what i was mad about she was coming toward me with her little hand extended to help me up and i got to my feet not wanting her to touch me i was trying to provoke you into defending yourself al said loudly from the couch rubbing a hand over his hair he looked both sheepish and worried im worried about kusox newt since you are here whats your opinion is she reasonably safe seeing as she was halfway to killing you id say she has a sporting chance newt said in her child voice and i stifled another shudder thats great i snarled limping away from newt and toward the fire god my life sucked so i can go back now right i said sullenly as i picked up my scrying mirror and sat down crap i was sore i was probably going to have to get my ribs wrapped this was going to look swell tomorrow at the trial oooh marshmallows distracted newt almost skipped to the overflowing bowl beside the fire the visage of a dying child somehow suiting her al i prompted holding my ribs i think hed about crushed my knee too al slumped in his chair until his butt almost slid off the cushion his robe had fallen open and i couldnt help but look dude he was hung like a horse his ruddy complexion almost black down there no way was he getting his tackle anywhere near me fine he grumped oblivious that he was waving in the wind if newt says youre reasonably safe you can go he said sullenly youll be back in twentyfour hours anyway yes i thought in victory i was going to have to take a long shower to get rid of the burntamber stench but i imagined theyd bring up more shampoo if i called down newt turned from where she was kneeling in her pajamas before the fire a lightly browned marshmallow at the end of her stick bring a ruler with you when you return she said her voice high and childlike the everafter is shrinking but i cant prove it unless i have a tape measure from reality all the ones here are shrinking too scrying mirror pressed to me i watched al cringe shrinking i asked slowly she said her pinky sticking out as she tentatively squished the marshmallow to test how done it was the rate will quicken exponentially as we have less and less to lose the ebb and flow of energy between reality and the everafter has shifted its not all coming back theres a hole somewhere she looked at me with her black eyes and i shivered al sat completely up and tugged his robe closed thank god the lines have been balanced for eons nothing has changed he said but his voice was too sure too confident smiling with a dead childs face and beauty newt awkwardly sat crosslegged before the fire you havent been to the surface lately turning away she put the toasting fork back into the flames unsatisfied with the puffs doneness i try to avoid it al huffed the buildings newt continued as if he hadnt said anything are falling at an astounding rate remembering the buildings in vegass everafter i took a breath and al shot me a look to keep quiet worried i felt the bumps of the lines on my scrying mirror buildings always fall al said his eyes darting to his books yes gally she said her voice having a childish lisp but now they are on fire crap had it been me id made a ley line maybe i hadnt done it right um al i said scared again al grimaced telling me to shut my mouth it was probably your brat kusox he said and i clutched my mirror feeling the cold soak in al was lying he was lying to newt it hadnt been kusox it had been me and al knew it shit what had i done kusox is not my brat newt said as she pulled her marshmallow off the stick her littlegirl pinkie stuck way out i was against giving him the ability to hold that much energy you all vetoed me remember holy crap al was outright lying to newt and it scared me in a way that al making a pass at me never could have a marshmallow rachel newt said leaning over the coffee table to hand it to me consider it a prize for almost killing al numb i took the perfectly browned puff okay let me see if i have this right al provokes me into defending myself i nearly kill him then newt tries to kill me thinking im kusox al stops her saving my life and now were all going to have smores together what in hell is wrong with these people thanks i said softly sticking the puff into my mouth the ugly taste of burnt amber hit my tongue and i gagged spitting it out into my hand oh my god what is wrong with your marshmallows his ears red in embarrassment al handed me a napkin that hadnt been there a moment ago i wadded it up with the marshmallow inside leaving it on the low table between us the real ones cost too much al said with a sigh thats why i burn the hell out of them so if theres a hole in the fabric of time how do we find it and fix it i said wondering what they were made from if they werent real the coffee wasnt any good either brimstone you cant pinkie high newt plucked a marshmallow from the bowl and stuck it awkwardly on a stick before handing it to me your turn the toasting fork was warm in my hand you cant pinpoint it or you cant fix it i asked thinking that was an important distinction newt didnt say anything kneeling on the hearth and running her fingers through the fire as if it were a kittens fur als slippers shifted a hairs breadth and i realized he was more than a little nervous at the sound of the soft scuffing newt glanced at him a sly look on her face as she smiled with her black eyes my gut hurt as a second haze of everafter sifted over her leaving her looking as she had when she slid into als library and suckerkicked me youre sweet she said as her intent expression turned to me and i shivered dont you want your marshmallow i just want to go back i said and then i stiffened when she got to her feet with a boneless grace coming to sit on the couch angling herself so her knees almost touched mine and back you will go she said her hand touching my hair if the everafter is shrinking maybe she should stay here al said and i stiffened newt saw my anger and my hair slipped from her hand i proved i can hold my own against kusox i said besides pierce is there in case i do something really stupid you owe me this chance if i cant survive the next twentyfour hours then ill never survive here newts thin eyebrows were raised in question she saw my scrying mirror and i stiffened when she took it from me such a pretty little triangle she said as she gazed at her hazy reflection in my mirror then shifted her appearance to look like me al wants to kill pierce she said tucking a strand of her now curly red hair behind an ear making me shudder but he cant leave rachel alone and vulnerable in the sun and pierceshe handed my mirror to mewell he is going to destroy you whether he wants to or not scheming scheming such little mens desires flow around you it was more than a bit disturbing to see myself dressed in newts clothes this was one of her bad days i think pierce doesnt want to kill me i said my thoughts flashing back to our night under the earth then his sullen temper when id saved al maybe hed forgive me if i told him id almost killed al too he had a moment of pique is all hell get over it she was nodding looking like me as she sat on the couch they all get over it dont they and then hell destroy your hope kill your soul he wont even know what hes doing until its too late i can tell the future because my days are always the same i stiffened as she touched my hair again head cocked as she studied it feeling it between her fingers that looked like mine right down to the wooden pinkie ring and the chipped red nail polish between you and me youd be better off with both of them dead she finished al cleared his throat newts gaze shifted to him and she made a soft noise al you are a fool she said as a sheet of black everafter coated her and she turned back into her usual androgynous self you might have more than two curses to rub together if you didnt allow both your familiar and your student to run about in the sun plotting against you then she should stay yes he said and she threw her head back and laughed no rachel goes back she said and i sagged a little in relief theres more than one bet to be settled tomorrow and they made me the referee again they never let me bet anymore not since i won minias where is he anyway oh thats right she eyed me speculatively i killed him great newt was a demon bookie on top of everything else what are my odds of getting my shunning permanently revoked i asked having to know newt smiled and handed me my scrying mirror youre going to lose because of pierce didnt you hear me or do you forget things too i couldnt answer trying to find enough air to breathe do i have a shot at this or not thats my girl she said her eyes holding a shared pain as she saw my confusion al where are you going to put her not in your room shed pull a line through you and kill you when you hog the blankets ill take the waif in i promise ill bring this one up properly newt patted the sixinch space beside her thigh and my face became cold oh god anything but that al stood tugging the tie on his robe tighter i have everything under control newt waved a thin hand in dismissal and thats why she was arcing a line through you yes she said then vanished the seat cushion rose slowly and the fire flared as new air was sucked down the chimney to replace her mass i forced my teeth to unclench and i shifted my grip on my mirror now al i prompted and al slumped back in his chair again al i said again louder and he glanced at me his fingers searching the chair cushion until he found a little tin of his brimstone opening it he sniffed a pinch up each nostril his head going back as he closed his eyes and sighed great now i was going to set the brimstone dogs off at the covens meeting tomorrow you do like doing things the hard way he said eyes still closed you said youd send me back i warned him and his head came down his eyes looking a little redder than usual i am i am he said but he was just sitting there pinching the bridge of his nose he did that only when i really screwed up like the time i used foxglove instead of peppermint and the curse i was working on turned his ink into stone i dont know if i should hope you win your bet or lose he finally said huh i said i thought you wanted me to lose i do he said but if youre in reality it will take longer for anyone to figure out that you were the one who made the hole in the fabric of time nice going rachel worry clenched my chest and i set my mirror across my knees why are you assuming it was me maybe it was kusox he did make the arch fall down i didnt do anything that you didnt do when you made a ley line but al was shaking his head sighing heavily he let go of his nose i made my ley line while jumping from the everafter to reality you made yours jumping from reality to reality its leaking i licked my lips i guess the collective is going to be pissed huh his bark of laughter startled me and i tried to hide my jump yes the collective is going to be pissed i just hope i can find out how to fix it before they listen to newt and realize shes right uuh i stammered and al frowned at me uuh he mocked then reached beneath his chair to the bundle that hadnt been there a moment ago here youre going to need this for your hanging tomorrow i caught the clothwrapped package he threw at me scrambling so as not to lose my hold on the mirror what is it i asked thinking it was too heavy to be someones head his red eyes landed on me seeing me scared cold and disheveled you are a mess wear it im not picking you up tomorrow in rags hey i have a chance here you know this is supposed to be a formality he grinned at me with his blocky teeth you dont have a rainbows chance in hell to get your shunning revoked he said fingering a marshmallow before dropping it back into the bowl you just traipsed across the continent black magic spilling in your wake freeing demons and destroying a national monument you knocked out a coven member kidnapped her let her watch you use demon magic to fight off said freed demon twice hell girl you burned down margaritaville his smile widened you are so screwed he said hitting his brit accent hard shut up i shouted holding my scrying mirror close between me and the package a puff of burnt amber wafted up and i winced whatever he had given me was going to need to be dry cleaned all right all right al said as he sat up and rubbed his hands together you can go home or to your pathetic little hotel room whatever he added when i made a noise of protest im going to have a busy day today and youll just muddle it up if youre whining about here ive got to make reservations at dalliance its a little tight but if i drop your name something will open up and there are your quarters to arrange he looked up at me are you sure you dont want to be roomies you can have the soft pillow i closed my eyes and tried to find strength please dont start i had a chance didnt i go go go al said quickly and here sorry for being so rough i didnt think you had it in you my eyes opened and i saw him make a tiny leyline gesture just before the ley line took me warm and tasting of salt it slipped into me dissolving me into nothing but memory i tried to listen to the line like bis said he could or sense an auratic color but nothing could get through my protective circle al even took the smut for the trip which i thought was odd and with very little disorientation i caught my balance as the curse touched my thoughts and rebuilt myself from my memory my jeans still stunk of everafter but my aching muscles sore back and pulped knee felt perfect that small gesture al had made before sending me home must have been a healing curse because traveling the lines wouldnt do that to a person id tried the walls of trents penthouse suite shimmered into existence and the soft sounds of music apparently pierce had figured out the mp player my dusty boots pressed into the carpet and i shivered as i suddenly had a body again and the cool dry airconditioned air hit me pierce was standing at the windows watching the light of the unseen sunrise spill over the bay his stance was worried and he clearly didnt know i was back the fog had lifted and alcatraz was visible i took a breath and he turned youre back he said his voice giving me no clue to his mood but his featuresit was all there to see his blue eyes held thick worry anxiety and relief all mixed up he didnt move toward me and i didnt know where we stood anymore obviously he was glad i was back but not enough to touch me he wasnt confident enough of the future to cross the room and tell me today was going to be okay that i was going to see midnight come and goand be better for it im back not looking at him i carefully set the scrying mirror down and dropped the package on the coffee table behind me god i stank i didnt think the hotel soap was going to cut it a fiftyfivegallon drum of tomato juice might pierce hesitated then went to the chair by the window taking up his long heavy cotton coat and shrugging into it what took so long kalamack giving you trouble why did i care what he thought al was messing with me i said shortly not wanting to get into it pierce hesitated in his motion to adjust his collar and he looked at me from under his shaggy bangs are you okay i nodded and he turned away watching his reflection in the mirror as he arranged his sleeves where are you going i asked as it was obvious he was leaving his eyes met mine in the reflection to converse with vivian about me pierce i started remembering what newt had said about my odds having a shunned witch speaking for me wouldnt help not about you he said as he took his hat from the stand beside the door and arranged it on his head im wanting her opinion concerning me trying to reclaim my spot before they fill it it will give you another positive voice my lips parted but you were dead i said and he turned to me his dark eyes smiling i was he said inclining his head almost hiding his face behind his hat thats a tricky word was once a coven member its for life and im alive his smile deepened as his gaze became unfocused wouldnt that beat all creation a coven member who is also a demons familiar it would make you look rathertame gaze sharpening he took a step to the door and stopped do you have your phone call me if you have trouble i bobbed my head he was going to try to reclaim his spot in the coven i bet that would shift the odds in the everafter if anyone knew good then pierce said and i did nothing completely shocked when he leaned into me and gave me a quick almostnotthere kiss on my mouth and then he was gone before i could even find the scent of redwood in my soul wish me the luck of the dead he said half in the hall half in my life good luck i whispered and the door shut he had kissed me he had kissed me and like an idiot id done nothing it wasnt as if hed never kissed me before but clearly something had changed in his thoughts between my taking trent to seattle and now when id left he had been cold and broodyangry with me for having foiled his attempt to kill al and rightly so id done nothing to apologize and he knew id do it again in a heartbeat and yet he had kissed me and left to claim his old position to help me i wanted to mistrust this i wanted to believe that it was a trap to further his own standing and perhaps find a way out of his servitude with al because with mistrust came distance and my heart would be safe but a small wiser part of me knew that for all his dark power for all the crap he had made of my life pierce was true to his beliefs and wouldnt stoop that low if he was trying to help it was genuine he had set his own desires aside to further mine and the knowledge of that was scary his sacrifice made it far too easy for me to put him in the position of hero inviting me to turn a blind eye to the darker side of his psyche so i could feel the rush of falling in love again not this time i vowed my hands in fists as i wiped off the lingering taste of redwood from my lips he was a black witch who would use forbidden magic to kill those who threatened his life or the lives of those he cared about so was i but that didnt mean i had to love him for it eighteen id already used the glassandtile shower in the front bathroom scrubbing my scalp until it hurt as i worked to get the last vestiges of the burntamber stink from my hair the hotel shampoo smelled far too masculine for me and i thought it irksome that the management assumed only men would be renting the top floor but then again they probably hadnt expected trent to blow into town with two women fortunately i had some of my own shampoo and detangler and i was again smelling like strawberries and oranges i smiled settling myself deeper into the bubbles yes i had already showered but there was nothing like a long soak to prepare oneself for a lynching especially when you could watch tv while doing it clicking from the weather channel to the news i set the remote next to my plate of crackers a halfempty bottle of water stood beside it the scent of coffee slipped in under the door telling me that ivy was up i felt like a prisoner even after having been a guest at alcatraz and knowing what true incarceration felt like never again i thought as i adjusted the towel wrapped around my hair if i couldnt beat this id go live with al but i didnt want to my gaze drifted to my heavymagic detector the disk a flickering sickly green it wasnt working well and i couldnt trust it i felt like jenks at five thousand feet leyline magic too was messed up because of the ley lines fractured and broken by the seismic activity this was why the coven had their convention here unless you lived here you were at a disadvantage and didnt dare use your magic in a pique of anger or implied insult demon magic worked though i thought bittersweetly as i extended an arm up and looked at the lack of bruises that curse al had given me before sending me back had rubbed out every ache the tv detailed californias latest wildfire and i stretched out all of my five foot four in the water with room to spare fires mudslides earthquakes smog broken ley lineswhy did anyone live here i breathed deeply my eyes flicking to the short dress that al had given me i could still detect a whisper of burnt amber drifting from it as it hung on a wooden hanger on the back of the door and i was hoping that the moist air might help apart from the purple scarf it was allwhite leather from the cap to the boots supple like butter and having a luster that would show off my curves i knew without trying it on that it would fit i didnt want to know how al knew my size apart from the color id look like catwoman meow my first reaction when i had shaken it from the paper wrapping had been is he kidding no one wears white leather especially not head to toe but now after id been looking at it for over an hour i thought why the hell not skimpy as it was leather did have a small resistance to thrown potions there wasnt a clock in here but the ticker on the bottom of the news said it was getting late and i sat up the water fell from me creating bubbles and i stood and reached for a fluffy towel it felt good not to hurt and i dried myself off going over every inch of my smooth unblemished skin that should be aching and purple from fighting first kusox and then al demon curses better than bandaids and they didnt wash off in the tub either the tv switched to an onthescene reporter yelling as she tried to be heard over the fire trucks it was a small warehouse fire on the docks of seattle jenks i wondered god i missed him and i hoped he was okay they were supposed to be back by midnight but i doubted theyd make it so much for trents promises i was sure hed have a pixy dust of an excuse wrapped in a white robe embroidered with the hotels initials i undid my hair and tried to go through it again i could see the tv in the mirror the woman was going on and on about numerous minor problems all over seattle from an elevator becoming stuck in the needle to a catfight at the international cat show seattle was hosting to hundreds of fender benders that seemed to happen simultaneously across the seattle area she was asking everyone to be patient apparently the system had been scheduled for maintenance and the load of calls had crashed the backup jenks you little devil i thought with a smile but then changed my mind jenks was good but he couldnt be in more than one place at a time this had all the earmarks of a demon my motions to comb the detangler through my damp hair grew rough and i frowned all this for a wedding band i didnt want to believe that trent had released a dangerous daywalking demon to be a friggin distractioneven if it was to control the direction of the next elf generation and since elves had their fingers in everything everyone was going to feel it damn it trent youd better know what youre doing the knock at the bathroom door made me jump and i set the comb down with a clatter when ivys voice came through the thick door saying rachel can we talk what did she want give me a minute to get dressed sure there was a moment then from deeper in the room louder but muffled do you want something to eat i reached for my underwear then hesitated you mean like room service god i felt like a prisoner and in a sudden decision i took als outfit off the hanger instead might as well make sure the dress fit no she said voice softer i wouldnt eat anything they bring up now that they know were here if you dont want cold cuts or fruit ive got milk duds ivy is the one buying the milk duds uh no thanks i zipped up the side zipper on my hip gratified that nothing pinched or bunched when i bent to put on my socks you want to see my gototrial outfit white was he serious sure she sounded depressed even through the door and i became worried as i adjusted the sleeveless top over my bare skin it laced up the back and had a neckline that would show off what little i had to my best advantage accentuating instead of hiding what wasnt there i uh had three gallons of syrup sent out to the petrified forest she said standing by the door by the sound of it youre kidding how she was silent and i imagined her shrugging internet she said shortly jenkss freedom cost us but most of that was to pay for someone to deliver it i couldnt help my smile i hadnt forgotten my promise to the pixies but leave it to ivy to know how to arrange it online have you given any thought to tomorrow ivy asked her voice hesitant i posed in the mirror stuck out my chest then slumped and reached for the boots they were white too all the time no i mean really have you thought about tomorrow sitting on the edge of the tub i slipped the lowheeled boots on they fit perfectly and the zipper was well oiled my estimation of al knowing what a girl likes went up i thought of that kiss of his and squinted ivy im just trying to get through tonight if i dont make it then im i took a breath as i stood and looked at myself damn i looked good like a leather teardrop then im in the everafter i finished slightly depressed fear flared up and i squashed it i didnt want to come out of the bathroom wearing leather and stinking of fear ivy was good at resisting temptation but she wasnt above taking a lick of frosting from the cake before it was served putting the cap on my head i looked at my reflection my hair still damp and my skin still holding the glow from the bath maybe i shouldnt call it fear maybe it was dread my throat became tight and i sent my gaze to the purple scarf purple was how a demon showed pride or favor to its familiars and it made me feel like it was the first day of school when you know youre too chicken to stand up for yourself and you dont have any friends to rely onall alone and your mother telling you at the car youd be okay my hand ran across the scarf feeling it cool and smooth against my fingertips i couldnt make myself put it on ive been thinking about it ivy said from the other side of the door if you have to go im going to shut down the firm whoa i pointed the remote to shut off the tv flinging open the door i found ivy sitting beside the window in the bright light her back curved and her shoulders slumped she looked tired why i asked as i crossed the room youre great at this what about jenks you just going to leave him alone in the church ivys head came up and she tossed her hair from her eyes smiling faintly her gaze traveled over me taking in the leather dress i like that she said you look good in white and before you get uptight jenks will be fine hes thinking about going to work for trent if things go wrong tonight i looked at her shocked work for trent he told you this shrugging ivy pushed back into the chair every motion screaming of an inner pain weve talked she said her voice low one of the reasons he was so hot to go with trent today is because hes trying it on her eyes flicked to mine and held them theres nothing for him in the garden anymore especially if youre gone i was not believing this trent are you kidding me ivy looked out onto the bay i know youre focused on tonight but in case there isnt any time to talk before you goi wanted to let you know that i enjoyed being with you oh my god she was saying goodbye agitated i came to stand before her not knowing what to do with my hands i am not dying i said finally sitting down on the edge of the nearest chair and taking my hat off i can come back for visits and stuff her jaw was clenched i know she looked at me and i suddenly realized that this was for real my eyes filled and there was a sudden lump in my throat i wanted to touch her shoulder but her body language said not to i can visit ivys eyes were just as full but neither of us would let a tear fall let me say this she whispered will you just let me say this i put a hand to my middle to try to get it to stop hurting why are you saying goodbye i whispered she lifted her hands and let them fall because i cant follow you she said suddenly i started on this trip two days ago and it wasnt until arizona that i realized i wasnt doing a damn thing i was driving sure but you dont need me you never really did yes i do i said quickly but i shut my mouth when she shook her head not like i want you to youre moving fast rachel and vampires are slow its like youre from the future and youre here trying to yank everyone forward so some of us have a chance to survive whats coming youre leaving jenks and me behind anger flared but it was at the universe not her this demon thing wasnt my idea im not talking about the coven and shunning im talking about you changing everything ivy crossed her legs and gripped her biceps looking vulnerable the weres the elves the vampires youre stirring everything like a catalyst and youre leaving us behind its okay were not mad sad maybe but not mad she let go of her arms and met my eyes i knew ever since you sealed that room in the tunnels that you and i werent going to work even if you woke up some morning and wanted it to i felt the power of what you could do i saw it i saw the fear in eddens eyes it only made me love you more i blinked fast and you dont think i need you after that ivy it was your soul that protected me she nodded hiding her face as she wiped her eyes youll do better once you let us go jenks and me both well be okay my head was shaking in denial ill beat this ivy i always do her chin came up eyes black she snapped what if you do you think we can drive back to the church and go on like nothing happened it wont work i cant pretend anymore that one day youre going to wake up and be anything different from what you are right now im not talking sex and blood im talking about you and change how you make it happen and how you adapt to it your mind lets you jenks and iwe cant ivy i never had a chance she whispered ivy i said louder and she focused on me i never had a chance she said again but thank you ive seen what its like to be normal been a part of a family even if i was on the fringes i reached over the space between us touching her youve never been on the fringes she looked at my hand on her smiling almost ive never been in all the way either and dont start thinking that you did me wrong hell rachel if id gotten all the way in i would have selfdestructed destroyed myself you knew that she said and my hand fell away i donti didnt have a way to cope to accept that i deserve good things but i feel good right now she smiled looking at the ceiling as she wiped her eyes again do you know id never remembered feeling good before you kisten was safe but you felt good even when you werent around even when you were out doing stuff even when i was out with one of my blood partners and i knew that when i came home she hesitated i knew that you would be there or would be back soon and you wouldnt look at me and hide your disgust at what i am but would let me work it out you were like a warm finger touching my thoughts pushing the black down and not letting it rise up keeping me sane ive felt good so often that now i can recognize it even when it doesnt come from you i can feel good about other people my chest was tight and i could do nothing but look at her miserable happy face maybe i should let her go my expression must have shown my thoughts because ivy smiled even as a tear leaked out and she wiped it away i wanted to say thank you before jenks and trent get back and things start to happen i know i can find the good again now that i know what it feels like i can recognize it keep from destroying it she touched my knee and i blinked back my own tears i cant ever repay you for that its more than i ever thought id find thank you youre killing me ivy i croaked throat so tight it hurt payback is hell isnt it i tried to say something failing just say youre welcome ivy said standing up to look out the window at nothing there were lots of things i wanted to say and none of them was youre welcome i wanted to say that i was going to lick this that nothing was going to change that this was just a bump but when my gaze focused past her and found the blocky gray shape of alcatraz i didnt know if it was true feeling a sense of mild panic i stood ivy turned looking at me she leaned in and gave me a hug i held my breath so i wouldnt start crying so i didnt breathe in her soothing vampire scent but i knew it was there my arms went around her and i had a fleeting thought that she felt small for such a big person reluctantly ivy let go and dropped back i hope you get your shunning rescinded i hope we drive back taking our time and actually sleeping i hope that nothing changes but even if we can make all those things happen let me go right now i need to move on and find something good that i can hold on to i stared at her black eyes shed come a long way wed never have been able to have this conversation last year but she leaned in taking my face in her cool hands this is goodbye rachel oh shit i knew what was going to happen and i let it ivys lips met mine and my eyes closed my heart gave a thump her lips moved against me tasting lightly of coffee all the tension that had been winding up in me unraveled in a rush of endorphins followed by a spark of adrenaline glowing through me like pixy dust for the first time there was no fear from her vampire teeth no worry of the promise of ecstasy and danger she held she was just ivy and her hand slipped to my waist pulling a ribbon of feeling through me my blood rose pounding responding to her touch she smelled like incense and soap she held me to her without binding without promise only passion in her embrace her mouth was soft unbelievably soft blood humming i felt her tongue whisper against me and her grip quiver against my jaw as the scent of her tears lit through me salt and blood oh so close and my own closed eyes spilled over as my body ached she began to pull away i realized i was tasting what i could have hadbut now was gone and it hurt feeling it ivy let go i blinked trying not to cry even as she stood there id lost her even though shed never been mine now she was gone i didnt want anything to change but i couldnt stop it she was right even if everything went perfectly tonight nothing would be the same tomorrow youre not leaving me she said her eyes damp im leaving you the knock at the door shocked both of us and i stifled my jerk when ivy turned to it with her vampirequick reflexes i wasnt thinking the heat of that kiss still aching she looked at me her soft smile the last thing i would have expected from her right now ill get it she said motions like an old jazz song as she drifted past me in a wave of happy vampire damn it whats wrong with you ivy i said shaking nothing i feel good hell of a goodbye kiss goodbye kiss god she had me in the everafter already whoever it is dont let them in i said wiping my eyes and were not done talking here yes we are ivy said as she looked through the peephole its your mother and some guy with red hair robbie i jumped up and started for the door let me see i said as i got close and she shifted away in the hallway looking anxious in a yellow sundress and a straw hat was my mother beside her was robbie his hair slicked back and a pleasant expression on his face its my mom i said reaching to open the door it cracked open and then it slammed shut slipping right out of my grip i turned to ivy and i heard my mother huff through the door ivy i protested her black eyes setting me back a step thats not your mom she said and i got cold nineteen i stared at the closed door hearing a muttered conversation behind it what do you mean thats not my mom i asked ivy again my voice hushed and she shrugged how would she know youre here you call her i didnt no i hadnt and i looked through the peephole to find her and robbie discussing things she knows im somewhere in the city i said shes crazy not stupid and the press probably knows where trent is staying rachel my mom called i want to talk to you before your trial sweetie ivy shook her head shes not swearing and when has robbie ever been happy to see you i frowned squinting through the peephole to try to see my mom better her shoes didnt match her dress and robbie was still smiling it was the last one that did it youre right raising my voice i shouted nice try go away i dropped down to my heels feeling like the little goat who didnt let the big bad wolf in to eat her is trent there the man who wasnt robbie asked his voice off ivy leaned toward the door no she said belligerently whatcha going to do about it i smacked her shoulder with a huff and she blinked innocently at me the growing rim around her eyes vanished and i backed up a step what did you tell them that for to hurry things up i want to see the sunset over the bay this evening i sighed leaning to look out the peephole again but i only got a glimpse of them their heads clustered over a glowing leyline amulet before i flung myself away pulling ivy with me her shout of protest was drowned out by a loud bang and the heavy steel door burst inward landing askew on the front couch in the lower living room holy crap i exclaimed struggling to find my balance as i held ivys arm i reached for a ley line as the door frame smoked but the energy source oozed through my mental fingers like slivers of broken mirror it hurt and i scrambled to fill my chi with the nasty stuff the smoke cleared and i let go of ivy when my mother and robbie came in it was obvious it wasnt them and i frowned when i recognized wyatt and that young coven witch behind them son of a bitch trent had been right they were going to try to off me you i exclaimed then yelped ducking and trying to set a circle when robbie pulled a small air gun from his jacket pocket and pointed it at me holy crap they all had air pistols the circle around ivy and me gave a hiccup and died it just flickered and went out shocked i just stood there as ivy snatched the serving tray from the coffee table the last of the crackers and cold cuts went flying as she pulled it up to intercept the splat ball it hit with a ping of sound and a hiss of magic yellow foam bubbled quickly turning black as the salt in the air interfered her lip curling in a sneer ivy threw the tray like a lopsided frisbee at my notmother drawn gun dropping my notmother jumped out of the way knocking into robbie and ruining his aim his splatball shot hit the ceiling trent was going to be ticked the tray thunked into the wall and stuck quivering it would have broken a couple of ribs easily whatever was in those splat balls robbie was shooting was nasty robbie hell it was oliver i could tell by the way he snarled and shouted shoot them both down ivy hissed jerking me up the steps into the upper living room and behind the couch my circle didnt hold i said feeling betrayed as i took them in there were four of them oliver looked like robbie that was probably amanda posing as my mother seeing that i recognized wyatt with his steely brown eyes and stern expression and the last geekylooking witchleon if i remembered the papers right you couldnt wait until tonight huh i shouted then ducked down behind the massive swivel tv that was almost a room divider yellow froth bubbled where ivy and i had stood and four new splatters outlined the angle of their reach ivy smelled of excited vampire as she crouched beside me her eyes going blacker by the second my bag was on the couch there was nothing in it to help me anyway i thought you said earth magic didnt work on the coast ivy said breathlessly and i yanked her back down when i heard twin puffs of air it generally doesnt i said running through my repertoire of magic tricks and coming up short they had timed this perfectly no wonder they hadnt tried to kill me on the way this was the only place id be helpless but theyre coven i said eying the mass of black bubbles and trying to guess how long it took for the salt in the air to naturally break the charm you know best of the best all they need is for the charm to work long enough to get close enough to kill us i looked at her starting to get worried as i listened to olivers demands for us to come out how long does that take three seconds if youre not resisting she said grimly yeah that was about what i thought too damn it where was pierce when i needed him mr black magic man would be helpful right about now the splats had stopped and i wasnt surprised when i heard oliver say shes not coming out you go that way and ill go the other ooh they were going to split up bad life choice i looked at ivy thinking we might be able to salvage something ill take the two guys you take my mom and robbie ivys focus became distant as she used her ears to place everyone no offense rachel she whispered but your mother is going down i nodded but ivy was already moving a scream coming from her as she dove over the spelltainted carpet and back to the broken door i rose seeing her stand from a roll right in front of my shocked mother kicking at wyatt she backhanded my mom sending her sliding into the wall beside the quivering tray amandas arms splayed awkwardly and the gun slipped from her grip and hit the floor ivy snatched it up grinning as she turned the men had scattered the more levelheaded wyatt going for the bathroom where he could get a better shot at me the less experienced leon diving into the kitchen to hide behind the eatat peninsula oliver seeing that gun in ivys hand dove for the kitchen as well hey i shouted standing tall and then ducking to evade wyatts shot oliver peeked above the counter shooting wildly almost hitting ivy grimacing she grabbed amanda as the poor woman struggled to find her feet still dazed from hitting the wall olivers next spell hit her square on amandas eyes widened and then she slid into oblivion her anger at oliver dissolving into a spellinduced coma shoot her shoot the vampire oliver demanded and wyatt peeked from around the bathroom door his range wasnt as wide as he probably liked and he needed to expose himself if he wanted to get a good shot at me but it wasnt me he was aiming at and i threw a vase at him my eyes narrowed when it bounced off a quickly invoked circle and broke on the tile either he was used to the crappy lines here or he was using a familiar peeved wyatt shot at me and i ducked back but it gave ivy the second she needed to find cover she was beautiful with adrenaline as she slid back to me rocking to a crouched halt in the lee of the tv i got you something she said smiling as she handed me amandas gun and my gaze darted to amanda out cold the spell wasnt breaking as fast as i thought it might must be strong stuff i bet shed be ticked for having been taken out by one of olivers spells again thanks i said as i hefted the weapon then squeezed off a couple of shots in the general direction of the kitchen and bath just to let them know i had it hey i shouted still eying amanda what you got in these splat balls boys i asked is amanda going to be okay or should we call a timeout cover me oliver screamed at leon and ivy snickered at the young witchs refusal just because youre good at magic doesnt mean you like to risk your life wyatt poked his head out and i shot at him the flash of his bubble deflecting it to the ceiling where it dripped to the carpet it gave me an idea and i aimed for the ceiling in the bathroom two quick puffs of air and there was an evillooking foaming mass hanging over the threshold and making a venomous stalactite with any luck it would drip on him how come his magic is working ivy asked i pressed deeper into the shelter of the tv hes used to the lines here i wished i was but in all fairness his bubbles werent lasting long either maybe that was the trick to it hey ivy i said a sudden thought coursing through me i couldnt tap a line worth a damn but i knew a spell that used just quick bursts instead of long drawnout pulls like a circle maybe if i kept spindling power filtering it as it were i could do something ive got an idea i said turning the gun over and opening the hopper ivys confused expression softened to one of amusement as i shook a little yellow ball into my palm clearly remembering our games in the graveyard where i deflected splat balls shot by ivy and thrown by the pixies all i needed was some leyline energy and a focusing object but you cant tap a line she protested as i jammed the hopper back into place and handed the gun to her i can i just cant hold on to them for very long i said shifting my shoulders as the broken energy seeped in filling my chi and spilling over to be spindled in my head my damp hair would stay flat not giving me away here you take the gun ill deflect what they shoot i didnt need pierce we could do this together like we always did relying on him had made me soft ivys smile grew ready she asked ducking as a splat ball zipped inches over her i wasnt but she had already leapt into motion the little poppoppops of compressed air joining her howls as she made the jump to the broken door and propped it up to hide behind i stood the splat ball lightly held in my left hand hey i shouted and heads turned his eyes alight oliver shifted to aim at me my heart pounded four puffs of air sounded loud but my hand was moving already the thumb and pinkie showing direction and distance the three middle fingers giving my spell strength iacio i shouted feeling a drop in my chi my leyline spell hit the splat ball headed toward ivy and the yellow plastic bounced as if hitting a wall deflecting back to wyatt his eyes widened as he pulled back and the ball vanished somewhere inside the bathroom i could do this it would work iacio i shouted again and i bounced a second ball at leon the man ducked back behind the kitchen peninsula his brown eyes wide in fear rhombus i shouted and the two shots from oliver simply hit my bubble as i ducked not willing to trust it the balls slowed as if hitting cotton then fell unbroken to the carpet rachel ivy shouted and i spun hand raised to ward off wyatts next shot i didnt have enough time for a spell and my circle was sputtering out its existence i dove for cover his shot went wide as he pulled back too soon ducking behind his own circle for an instant crap this wasnt working but even as i prepped to deflect another charm i watched the glob i put on the bathroom ceiling finally drip wyatt jerked as the spell hit his head reaching up to touch the cold spot his expression shifting to alarm his eyes met mine and i stood hearing ivy shooting at oliver and leon son of a bitch wyatt said hatred in the expression he directed at me and then his eyes rolled back and he dropped two down at least until the charm broke from the salt in the air grinning i pulled heavily on the shattered lines spindling energy that tasted like broken rock deep in me ivy was out of ammo and she threw her gun down in disgust still she didnt hide behind the door but boldly strode forward to the kitchen beside me my brothers thin face that oliver wore was red and ugly as he stood in the kitchen and shot at me backing up as i came forward his eyes became more and more frightened and his shots wilder as i absorbed his magic in quickly invoked bubbles i took down as soon as his magic hit them i felt like a demon unstoppable and a part of me was worried even as i enjoyed the sensation why wont you die he yelled at me and i backed him up past leon the young witch was crouched in the corner his gun shaking but oliver still didnt get it four coven members reduced to two soon to be one all because of a little more knowledge and it wasnt even black i could spindle leyline energy and they couldnt it had made all the difference you need to shut up i said and feeling ivy behind me i swung my foot in a wide crescent kick that oliver still looked like my brother was going to be a bonus olivers eyes widened and his mouth opened in protest as he saw my foot coming no he managed and then it connected with his jaw the shock reverberated up through my leg and i jumped back hopping on one foot as the other throbbed the pain a sharp stab this was exactly why i hadnt used my fist and i staggered ivy gripped my arm and together we found our balance you really need to just shut up i whispered my weight on my good foot as i looked down at oliver out cold and slumped into the cupboards spots of potion hissed and subsided and i looked up to be sure there was nothing on the ceiling ready to drip on me i felt drained and i frowned as ivy let me go my eyes went to leon pressed against the cupboards scared he dropped his gun and kicked it across the tile toward us seemed like it was all over but for the lawsuits as ivy smiled at the frightened witch i crouched before oliver fingering the cord to the questionably legal leyline charm that turned him into my brother expeeeensive giving it a yank i broke the chain and tossed the amulet into the sink the image of my brother wavered and shifted and oliver took shape still out cold and drooling i rose wishing i had some zip strips there was a red mark on his cheek swelling already damn my foot hurt you going to be good ivy asked leon and when he nodded she sauntered out of the kitchen i watched her slightly concerned she had taken care of herself yesterday and so wasnt hungry but fighting brought out the worst in her watch out for that dripping potion i warned her and she dragged wyatt onto the carpet before hoisting him up and dumping him unceremoniously next to oliver amanda was next at least i thought it was amanda what are you going to do to us leon whispered and my eyes flicked to his holding his gaze we will be missed you cant just kill us my god do you really think i want to kill you i said disgusted though chucking them out the window had occurred to me they would just send assassins after us until i fled to the everafter and everyone i ever knew was in jail but he had brought up a good point i had them now what why couldnt you just leave me alone i said irate i slid aside to give ivy more room as she pulled the image of my mother into the kitchen and let her slump over wyatt the womans eyes were twitching as the charm began to break oliver too was stirring his wincing eyes shut as his fingers fluttered up and over his swelling cheek good i had a few things to say to him that the potions had lasted this long was a testimony to coven magic oliver might look stupid and slow but he wasnt he was just backward as all hell do you have an anticharm for this i asked leon wanting to hurry things up he was still pressed into the corner and his eyes darted to the front pocket of wyatts jacket ssalt water he stammered thanks i said gingerly searching the spelled witch until i found a couple of the little vials only now did i take the amulet off my notmother smirking as the slightly chunky blond earth witch shimmered into existence yeah it was amanda i flicked the top off a vial of salt water and dumped it on her she came to sputtering as she pushed herself off oliver and sat with her back to the cupboards wyatt was next glaring at me as soon as he could focus if you move i break your fingers i told the leyline witch then turned to amanda crouching to look in her eyes hi amanda i mocked and her lips moved but she didnt say anything terrified dont worry i said as i straightened and backed up im not going to eat you at least not today if you make me go hide in the everafter i might have a different answer for you ivy silently handed me one of the two remaining guns before she took up a position near the wide entryway to the kitchen blocking their exit and still having a good view of the hallway through the blownoff door her feet were spread wide her hands were on her hips and her eyes were dark the fear and anger werent dissipating nearly fast enough sure the coven was down and we had their guns but what was i supposed to do with them now trent would slap a forget curse on them pierce would probably want to give them to al seeing that those of their ilk had buried him alive i wasnt going to do either and i was the one they called black it just wasnt fair frustrated i tucked the splat gun in the small of my back youll burn for this oliver snarled id had enough angry i grabbed his shirtfront shaking him as he tried to get his eyes to focus you should have listened to vivian i said then shoved him back against the cupboard wincing he felt the back of his head not nearly scared enough well ivy said you want me to find some friends and drain them she was joking but leon paled i scowled wondering if vivian knew they were here and if she was okay maybe they just didnt tell her what they were doing i have to make a call i muttered rocking back to get my phone out of my bag if any of them move break their fingers if any of them speak make it their teeth ivy smiled to show her fangs and amanda shrank back unspent adrenaline made me jittery as i found my bag and pulled out my phone on impulse i flipped it open and scrolled to the camera function smile i said snapping a picture of the four of them slumped against the cupboards then carefully punched in vivians number not that the press would believe a photo but i wanted it for my scrapbook oliver glared at the fake sound of a shutter clicking and he almost got up settling back when ivy cooed at him she was doing remarkably well only the faintest widening of her pupils giving away her bloodlust i sat on the arm of one of the chairs where i could see out into the hall and them the proppedup door was nearby and i kicked at it i hadnt let go of that broken ley line slowly replenishing my chi and spindling it in case they tried something else finally vivian picked up hey i said before she could even say hello did you know about your friends crashing my hotel room this afternoon they made a bloody mess no but that explains a lot she was on the conferenceroom floor if the background noise meant anything and i held the phone closer when i heard pierces low inquiry of my state of being everyone still alive she asked for the moment and only because they stocked their splat balls with nonlethal charms they blew the door right off my room and im not paying for it arent coma spells a little too close to black magic for you guys your word against ours oliver said snidely and ivy moved threatening to hit him his voice was far too confident i took a breath to tell him to shut up but his eyes narrowed in victory and he smashed the back of his hand against the cupboard there was a snap of glass as the stone in his ring broke down i shouted and ivy dove for cover i cowered behind the proppedup door but nothing happened oliver was laughing and slowly i got to my feet embarrassed vivian was yelling through the phone but ivy was staring at me her eyes a scared black a second later i knew why earthquake she exclaimed and i staggered for balance as the floor suddenly became jello get under a table rachel vivian was yelling get in a doorway a chunk of ceiling fell between oliver and me i froze not knowing what to do as one the four witches ran for the door it was all i could do to stay upright and i fell into the couch as they found the hallway and vanished pictures were falling and one of the windows cracked sounding like a gunshot rachel ivy cried then grabbed my arm and yanked me into the threshold of the door to the hallway we stood there holding the doorway to remain upright as the ceiling flaked and bits of plaster covered the burn marks finally it stopped but i was still shaking my eyes went to the empty hall they were gone why do people live here i asked looking at the room as if id been betrayed as i took the gun out of my pants and dropped it on the couch did they do that make the earthquake ivy asked probably her pupils were still black and i shifted away from her not wanting my own fear to tip her over the edge i put my ear to the phone to find that the connection had been lost pierce was probably on his way back already a day late and a dollar short the damage to the room from the quake had been minimal and the broken door from their attack could be dismissed by a paidoff insurance adjuster i still had my photograph though and they call me a black witch i said as i closed my phone and gingerly picked my way through the burns and plaster dust to the window to look down and see if i could spot them leaving i couldnt help but wonder how many of the smaller quakes that the coast sustained were from the coven this was just nasty but at least i was alive ivy had gone to the wet bar and the hiss of something full of sugar and bubbles opening was loud we both were alive thank you for helping me i said ivy exhaled long and loud as she came up from her drink youre welcome any time i smiled but my thoughts were on her last words before the coven had shown up ivy and i worked well together we always had too bad id totally screwed it up twenty i leaned forward over the backseat to look up at the tall conference hotel we were trying to turn into feeling lost as we waited for traffic to clear we werent in my moms car since it would be impossible to find a parking spot no we were still cashing in on trents hospitality and wed ridden across town in the car his hotel had on reserve for when their most important guests wanted to go somewhere the car was long black and shiny and came with a driver only problem was that trent wasnt in it no jenks either to say i was worried would be like saying pixies were a tad mischievous it was getting close to midnight and the conference was starting to kick into high gear lights from the oncoming traffic were nonstop pierce sat beside me his feet spread wide as he tried to look unaffected by the crowds but i could tell they were getting to him he wasnt happy that the coven had used his chat with vivian to take a shot at me and hed apologized several times thinking i blamed him i didnt but the odds the demons had given me were sounding more realistic than they had pierce was wearing his long coat despite the weather being too hot for it and he held his hat like a life preserver dressed in brown slacks and a brightly colored vest over a white shirt he made an odd statementone that was probably going to go unnoticed just from the car i could see three witches in traditional robes and hats behind them was a woman wearing wings for the ball tonight and behind her three guys dressed like neo from the matrix to be fair though there were just as many people wearing business suits as pointy hats and the clothing of choice seemed to be jeans goth was still in and almost every fifth person had a glowing bracelet with san francisco blinking from it this years knickknack of choice apparently ivy is going to fit right in i thought as i glanced at her up with the driver the turn signal of the car ticked as we sat in silence waiting for someone to move so we could pull into the dropoff area i leaned back into the cushions my curiosity rising when pierce reached into his coat pocket and pulled out a badge with security on it when did you get that i asked as he looped it over his head the name on it was wallace smyth holy crap pierce stole it he smiled teeth glinting in the light of the oncoming traffic this afternoon he said shuffling through his pockets again to bring out two more before the cowardly dogs attacked you you cant get past the first floor without a badge ivy here is yours i thought youd like the black ivy took the black lanyard looking bemused her badge had her name on it thank you pierce she said looping it over her neck and he smiled and rachel i picked up yours as well it was good i did you may have paid for it months ago but theyd lost it and it took three people an hour to produce another im not surprised i said feeling the cool plastic in my fingers mine said presenter great i was part of the entertainment thanks pierce i said as i attached it to my bag hoping there wasnt a bug or a charm on it if we got stopped because pierce had stolen a badge i was going to be mad but i really appreciated his picking them up i didnt give him enough credit and a pang of guilt twanged through me the hum of my phone from my bag made it worse and my foot started to bob as i ignored it i knew who it was without looking ivy turned from the front eying me if you keep avoiding him he will think you are mad at him she said clearly able to hear it as well i know i said wincing thinking it curious that she knew who it was too maybe i was telegraphing my body language louder than i thought who pierce questioned looking up from arranging his badge ivy smiled softly bis is waking up in the daylight when rachel pulls on a line the man made a surprised grunt and i flushed how do you know i asked her wishing the traffic would clear so i could avoid this conversation in my bag my phone continued to hum i take his calls ivy said dryly then turned to face me fully rachel hes older than you think hes not looking for a date hes just confused talk to him im confused too i exclaimed softly my guilt growing stronger i never asked him to be my gargoyle its wrong its slavery exhaling in exasperation ivy rolled her eyes to the cars ceiling i know what slavery is and this isnt it she said he does have his own life and dont forget he sought you out not the other way around you are something he needs and i dont think you have a say in it talk to him he thinks you dont like him she added and i bit my lower lip even more concerned that was not at all what i had wanted to happen hes bonding with you already pierce said his eyes wide hes just a kid see i said and ivy turned around in exasperation even pierce knows its wrong she was silent but i could see she was clenching her jaw frustrated i took out my phone it wasnt humming anymore a soft depression had taken me not all of it from the upcoming trial he is isnt he i said softly as i looked at the tiny screen more of a statement than a question pierces hand touched mine and i jumped there is nothing improper about this relationship he said seriously making me all the more uncomfortable this is not a bond of love but of necessity you need a gargoyle to teach you to jump the lines and in turn you will give him a holy place to live safe from demons safe from demons i said and the driver shifted uncomfortably the back of his neck stiff yeah right but i slipped my phone into a tiny pocket in my bag hoping i didnt miss his next call hell i should just grow a pair and call him back while i still had a chance i was running out of time my stomach hurt and i ran my hand over the smooth bumps of the french braid my hair was now in outside the car people were moving quickly their excitement making their pace fast and their words highpitched a spot finally opened up and the car pulled into the dropoff area pierce was out of the car even before it stopped moving coming around to open my door ivy dropped her head and searched her purse for a tip and i gathered myself to get out glad to put off my chat with bis for a few minutes more the scent of exhausttainted wet cement mixed with the sound of hushed tires and loud conversations over engine noise was bis bonding with me it sounded sodemonic rachel it was pierce and he had his arm out to escort me giving him a worried smile i looped my arm in his and together we went to the curb i felt like i was in a spotlight but no one was looking at me despite my wearing enough leather for a small cow id left als purple sash at homeand the cap i didnt care if i was the only one who would know purple was a sign of demon favor it felt like a leash ivys door shut with a solid thunk and the car took off immediately replaced by another just like it ready she said as she joined us her eyes bright and her motions quick she was wearing her boots and they clicked smartly on the pavement as much as ill ever be i said turning to the twin set of double doors pierces hand landed on mine and with him on one side and ivy on the other we went in my highmagicdetecting amulet sputtering a hazy red i wasnt surprised when every last erg of painstakingly gathered everafter washed out of me hotel security you cant have a group of witches this size without some kind of leveling field pierces hand left me and he shifted his coat on his shoulders as if trying to fit into a new skin our pace slowed as much for the people clustered near the door as for the sound of a hundred conversations beating on our ears single file we passed among the groups of people gathering here to either step out to make a call have a smoke or just use the front as a place to meet their friends i followed pierce with half my attention more interested in the huge chandelier that stretched up six stories dominating the entire interior cave the everafter draining out of me when we had crossed the threshold had been caused by something and i was betting it was this it looked a lot like the device lee had had on his boat but a whole lot bigger my dropping gaze landed on a blacksuited man with absolutely no expression on his face he was wearing sunglasses and staring at me nervous i set a hand on pierces shoulder anxious not to lose him in the crowd i see them too ivy said from behind me them there was more than one pierce turned waiting for us to catch up with him as we finally got through the worst of the crowd i walked the place this afternoon he said glancing first at the man i had noticed then to another by a bank of elevators registration is that way food is that way rest areas are on the first and third floors i was guessing he meant bathrooms and a sudden urge to cross my legs and do the littlegirl dance took me relax rachel i should have been doing that ivy muttered and pierce nodded ticking me off ivy had been there to help me beat off the coven he had no right to make her feel guilty still not undoing his coat he led us across the lower floor you were a mite busy keeping rachels body and soul together pierce said then pointed up to the overlooking second story the common entry to the auditorium is up there there is an entrance on the ground floor but its guarded coven members only good an escalator i said stifling a shiver since when are you afraid of elevators ivy said as she got on before me and pierce got on behind me his hand on the small of my back steadying me id take offense but i was ready to bolt and my knees felt like rubber im not i protested pulse quickening god its about to happen my entire life is going to change in the next hour im thinking about the coven taking a last potshot at you i know ivy came back even with me as we passed a group of harmlesslooking witches on their way down i dropped my gaze so i didnt have to make eye contact adjusting my badge on my bag if i held my arm just right it would be obvious i had a badge without making it easy to read my name i didnt want to be recognized but i think i was by the amount of whispering and pointing going on unless it was my dress ivy was first off and i found myself exhaling as i followed pierce bumped into me and looping his arm in mine he almost pulled me to the set of double doors across from the wide lowceilinged lobbylike area people were clustered here too and i felt myself pale as the conversations stilled and faces turned to us i heard the click of a phone camera and i shook myself chin high pierce said softly but i was nauseated id been running from this for what seemed like a lifetime his fingers touched mine and i felt a tingle he was wire tight but it was the faint pulse of cracked everafter in him that caught my attention how are you tapping a line i said as we settled in at the back of a short line to get in they were checking badges and i was doubly glad pierce had picked up mine pierce curled his fingers to take a stronger grip on me and my shoulders eased when i felt the warmth of a masculinetasting energy fill me i borrowed an amulet from a security member he said shooting me a sly glance then looking dead ahead and his badge dont worry wallace never reported it hes being entertained from pierces wry expression i had a pretty good idea of how wally was spending his evening oh man that is going to look great if they find out beside us ivy chuckled and i felt tons better as pierce funneled energy into me slippery or not it would leave as soon as i let go of him but in the interim it was nice you are a cad i whispered leaning in to smell his redwood scent mixing with a woodsy cologne when did he have time to shower but a smart one ivy said good thinking pierce pulled his gaze from the head of the line i wont let harm touch you if theres trouble ill be there and as soon as we get through security ill give you the amulet i could see the sense in that and i nodded as my headache began to ease the line moved forward and i took the pen after checking my lethalamulet detector it wasnt working but old habits die hard as the bored woman behind the table talked to her neighbor i signed the paper adding a period at the end of my name to break any psychic connection i handed it to pierce who immediately gave it to ivy im her security he lied to the woman taking my bicep a little more firmly i eyed pierce letting him manhandle me since he seemed to enjoy the excuse and i couldnt protest without causing a stir a flash of interest broke across the womans face and she looked from the paper ivy was signing to the badge pinned to my bag to me in one breath her expression went from pleasant to disgusted oh its you you have a reserved seat up front oh its you nice thank you i said pointedly as ivy pushed the paper back toward her do you know if trent kalamack is here yet no she was breathing fast and the ladies to either side of her were silent my gut twisted black witch they thought i was a black witch and they could hardly stand me were going to need one more place i said indicating ivy and the woman shook her head she cant go in id had it with women who thought they had ultimate power because theyd been given a tiny task but i exhaled trying to relax why not i asked voice level as i hitched my shoulder bag higher witches only pierce looked up scanning the crowd behind us as someone began calling yoohoo in a loud demanding voice trent kalamack isnt a witch i said my temper rising pierce let go of me to wave at someone and the power that had been seeping through me drained away a headache slammed into me and i stiffened mr kalamack is part of the proceedings the woman said she isnt angry i put my hands on the table and leaned into her slightly ivy drew me back her eyes holding a surprising lack of anger ill get in another way she murmured no i pulled from her and the woman looked frightened that pierce wasnt paying attention to me ive been shot at bugged and attacked i want you there and theres no reason you cant come in the woman fidgeted nervously glancing first at pierce then the people starting to pile up behind me its for security reasons she said and i nodded dramatically uhhuh which is exactly why i want her with me rachel a familiar cheerful voice exclaimed at my elbow and i spun pierce was grinning beside him was my mother a shopping bag under her arm a big yellow hat on her head and a broomstick in her hand she was beaming and every thought went flying out of my head mom i exclaimed eyes wide as i gaped at her what are you doing here damn you make even white leather look good she gave me a huge hug dropping her bag and pulling me close the scent of lilac and redwood filled my senses and the broomstick pressed into my back she stepped away with a hand on her hat to keep it from falling off and her eyes glinted with unshed tears i flew in this morning she said glancing down at her badge i wanted to see you i knew if i waited around youd show up in the middle of trouble and here you are i gave her another hug not believing this the woman at the table gestured for the next person in line and we moved to the side mom im glad youre here i said thinking she looked great her red hair cut in a bob and her jeans and tshirt showing off her figure now that she wasnt dressing down we could almost be sisters dread hit me though as she started moving us to the double doors if things didnt go well this might be the last day id ever see her come on she said taking my arm and leading me forward as if we were going for coffee not finding seats at my trial trenton got us seats up front but if you wait too long numbnuts start trying to sit in them she turned to look behind us hi ivy its good to see you she said and ivy murmured something back never quite comfortable around my mother my moms pace faltered as she gave pierce the onceover wallace eh she said dryly you must be pierce nice to finally meet the man who got my daughter her first is record youll do i suppose i hope youre good in bed its a pain in the ass trying to train you men to do what pleases a woman i caught a glimpse of pierces shocked expression but my last fear had been banished it was my mother not a lookalike if it came into her head it came out of her mouth mom i protested but she was off again saying it was good to see me and that she liked my hair like this asking me if id been in st louis when the arch fell down and what about that earthquake this afternoon wasnt that something i knew her chatter was her way of coping and i said nothing but made the odd noise at the right moment the double doors opened before us as someone went in my eyes rose and my feet kept moving the muffled noise hit me first and the smell of foam and the cotton fabric on the chairs it was all blue and gray and they were piping in music it was nearly full already and the sound of a hundred conversations was daunting even if the acoustics had been arranged to soak it in the stage was a good fifteen feet below where wed come in well lit with a podium in the middle and an oval table holding six chairs facing the audience oliver and leon were already there ignoring the mass of people as oliver talked and leon listened my heart thumped and i froze is that your mother pierce whispered i started to answer and the door attendant moved in front of us maam you cant go in he said to ivy and my head snapped up already inside my mother turned her chin up and her eyes glinting get the hell out of the way she said loudly as she shoved her way back to us and claimed ivys elbow dont you know who this is move or ill jam this broomstick up your ass pierce stood speechless but i was grinning yep thats my mother i said then followed ivy when my mother yanked her over the threshold glaring at the man as if ready to make good on her threat if he made so much as a peep the door attendant was way outclassed and he gave up cowed ivy glanced over her shoulder at me as my mother led her down the steps to the floor of the amphitheater slowly my smile faded there were too many people in here and the stage looked huge your mother isnt afraid to speak her mind pierce said and my shoulders eased as he took my hand and the everafter seeped in i knew it wouldnt last and i gripped his fingers afraid to let go shes like that i said head down as i watched my step people had noticed our entrance and the conversations were shifting more whispering more bitter gossip pierces grip on mine tightened and i looked up feeling a warning in his touch vivian had come from the back looking confident and unique in a flowing princesslike robe of tiedyed colors all purple blue and green her hair was arranged off her neck and she looked like an upscale san francisco hippie as far from my whiteleatherclad sleekness as a bird was from a frog worry flashed through me robes flowing she strode to the podium bending to pull out an amulet she looked good rested and ready i wished i was test she said simply as she held the amulet and when her voice rose with a pleasant volume over the babble she dropped it into a pocket and went to talk to oliver the entire auditorium had the feeling of preparation and excitement and i gave vivian a stupid little hand wave when she looked up following olivers finger pointing to me he was wearing an impressive suit and again i felt nervous in my outfit white thanks a hell of a lot al vivian straightened breaking eye contact with me before i could get any sense of what she was thinking oliver was supposed to vote for me but after this afternoon i doubted that would happen despite the agreement wed come to in an fib interrogation room two thousand miles away i was hoping i wouldnt need my gentle fourword reminder that i could bring witch society down we came from demons finally we made it to the ground floor and the small space before the stage my mother and ivy were waiting at the head of an empty row of seats actually the three rows after that one were empty too no one wanting to get too close to us nerves wouldnt let me sit and we clustered together in the aisle as pierce and my mother made small talk i scanned the rising rows for trent ivy leaned in smiling with her lips shut you look green you want me to go up there with you and hold your hand cant you be nice to me for once i said and she laughed trent isnt going to show i added wondering what my mother was telling pierce his eyes were wide and my mothers expression was intent is that necessarily a bad thing ivy asked and i tried to decide if she was joking im worried about jenks i said and she nodded has he called i asked for the umpteenth time and she shook her head eyes falling from mine i thought of my phone in my bag wondering if i should turn it off i didnt want to miss jenkss call if it should come in a flash of guilt hit me it was too late now to call bis too a stir at the door we had come in caught my attention and i turned away when the man my mom had threatened came in pointing our way dont look i told ivy thinking that they were going to haul her out but my fear vanished in a wash of elation when the familiar clatter of pixy wings sparked through me jenks i exclaimed suddenly feeling ten feet tall as i saw the glint of pixy dust i didnt care if people were staring and whispering loudly i waved like a fool grinning when a bright sparkle at the top of the theater dropped to us oh my god jenks i said elated and feeling the size difference between us keenly as he came to a pixydustladen halt in the center of our group he was smiling a long tear in his black sleeve and his hair matted but he was okay how did it go are you all right wheres trent i asked wanting to give jenks a hug but having to settle for extending my hand for him jenks nodded to everyone zipping around ivy to wreathe her in silver sparkles im good he said wings moving well and clearly overflowing with energy youll never believe it rache he said eyes sparkling with news trents here hes in the bathroom with lucy lucy i asked wondering if ellasbeth had a younger sister what did you do jenks landed on my hand then sprang into the air unable to contain himself youll never guess he said darting back and forth the guy is slicker than toad snot trent is a daddy ivy interrupted her gaze fixed on the door wed come in i spun as jenks yoyoed up and down shrilling so high and fast i couldnt understand him my eyes bugged out and beside me my mother swore no friggin way i said trent was on the threshold in his usual thousanddollar suit rearranging his badge and surrounded by too many women one was jiggling a fussing infant a girl from the looks of the sweet little bonnet lucy no friggin way i said again touching gazes with ivy before i looked back and saw trent take the baby my eyes widened she was his yes way jenks was saying and pierce sighed dropping back a step i about crapped my pants when i found out no wonder trent wouldnt spill thats his kid his and ellasbeths thats what he was doing rache we were baby snatching like elves used to in the old days trent had done the nasty with ellasbeth ewwwwww pierce seemed bored by it but my mother was melting into a puddle of anticipation her hands almost outstretched as trent made his way to us it was some ancient elf quest to prove himself and become a man he had to steal a baby and not get caught jenks said still too excited to land anywhere and i couldnt look away no friggin way trent had a kid he stole her jenks said finally landing on my shoulder right out of her crib like in the old days when they would leave changelings but trent only left a crumpled bit of paper in the crib rache he sang this weird little song and she just woke up and loved him i had to admit that trent seemed to know what he was doing as he patted the little girl to make her stop fussing he looked up his eyes meeting mine still holding a blissful happiness tempered with a severe protectiveness he traveled three thousand miles to steal a baby his baby not just any brat jenks said wings fanning my neck his and ellasbeths you got fairy farts in your ears she was pregnant when you broke up their wedding lucy is the first elf baby to be born perfect even before ceris the first without the demon curse and every baby born after her will be perfect because of you i licked my lips and pierce moved to make room for trent the next elf generation lucy was the beginning thats what trent had meant and it was because of me no it was because of trent jenks ivy and me wed done it together the noise of the auditorium seemed to fade as trent scuffed to a halt before us his ears red as he met everyones eyes trent i managed and then my mother broke down ohhh let me hold her my mom exclaimed hands reaching out immediately everyone relaxed trents attention fell from me focused entirely on his little girl as my mother came close ms morgan trent said his hands changing position as he carefully moved hisdaughter shes a temperamental little thing she might not like you of course shell like me my mother huffed people were watching and onstage the last of the coven members had assumed their places my mother took lucy and the little girl began to cry green eyes spilling over as she refused to look at my mother searching until she found trent then making a face as if shed been betrayed oh dear my mother said jiggling her carefully knowing that it was a lost cause such a beautiful thing you are dont cry sweetie your daddy is right there jenks was laughingnot at my mother but at my and ivys shocked expressions youre a dad i tried again and trent shrugged his attention lingering on my dress it happens rachel you take her my mother said clearly uncomfortable she might like you no mom no i protested but it was my mother we were talking about and it was either take the baby or have her hit the floor i had no choice and as trent stiffened i found i was holding another person in my arms i couldnt look at her as her blanket fell away scared almost as she cried but i held her against me and burn my toast if i didnt jiggle a little on my feet she was kind of soft and squishy but she fit nicely against me i gave another hop and when i looked into her eyes she quit crying trents hands dropped from where he had been going to snatch her away pale eyebrows up he said she likes you as if he didnt believe it of course she likes rache jenks said belligerently leaving me to hover before the baby and make her sneeze from his silver pixy dust cooing lucy flung her hand outsearching for jenks probablybut latching on to my finger instead shit her tiny hand gripped mine with a surprising warmth and in a shocking wash of emotion i felt everything i knew shift the scent of cinnamon and baby powder hit me and as my eyes widened my heart melted making room for her as i gazed into lucys green eyes and seeing her pale hair and perfect face it was as if something had flipped a switch in me id held babies before hell id babysat for my old friend at the is but this small person holding my finger had looked to me for protection from the noise the crowd and the frightening sparkles of pixy dust all of a sudden i didnt want to give her back my gaze came up fastening on my mother unshed tears made her eyes dark she was gazing at lucy with longing remembering robbie and me when she glanced up i gave her a rueful smile damn it shed given me lucy for just this reason it wasnt an elf thing it was justlife she likes you trent said again but he was reaching for her jealous maybe perhaps she knows you helped her survive ivy said from the background look at her ears rache jenks said as he returned to my shoulder and i moved away from trent you gotta look at her ears her ears pulling her back to me i leaned closer breathing in cinnamon as i peeked under her bonnet trents jaw was clenched but he let me do it lucy just cooed and i stared as ivy leaned close to me to see as well youve got to be kidding i whispered my attention darting up to trent as he frowned theyre pointy trent was annoyed but i was almost laughing you guys have to dock your ears to fit in i said in a hushed voice not anymore he answered reaching to take her lucy gurgled as i felt her almostnotthere weight leave me kicking in frustration until her fatheroh my god trent had a babytook her my shoulders slumped and i felt her loss on the stage they were making motions to start the meeting and pierce was trying to get my mother and ivy to sit down is she really yours i asked trent as they took their seats in the second row while he rearranged lucys blanket around her he wouldnt look at me in about six different ways he said and remembering how id felt after holding her for just one minute i knew what he meant trent why didnt you tell me you were after yourchild all around us people were settling in hushing themselves getting ready for a show but he was oblivious to them as he looked at me a mixture of embarrassment and reluctance in him that id never seen before i dont know he admitted seeming more honest more bewildered than hed ever been before it sounded lame me going three thousand miles to steal a baby im a product of the twentyfirst century not some elf with a title living in a castle with servants yeah but it was your kid jenks said having finally parked it on my shoulder lucy was kicking at her blanket and he tucked it back not even knowing he had done it she wasnt mine until i saw her his gaze was unfocused as he remembered shes he stopped unable to put it into words as he looked at her she was entirely her own person but needed him for everything shes beautiful i said softly trents attention flicked to me and his grip on her grew possessive id do anything for her risk anything i never got it until now i never understood true sacrifice huh maybe lucy was going to save us all jenks clattered his wings going to distract her and make her squirm just like any parent trent he said as he hovered over her reminding me of who he was think you can do anything for rachel for the next hour you owe her i may have helped you get lucy but rachel got you here alive to do it even with your help my chest tightened and where i was came rushing back trent was nodding and vivian began tapping her amplifying amulet for attention just about anything he said smiling with half his face he looked at me and even that vanished rachel its going to get bad youre going to have to trust me youve got to lose before you can win oh that makes a lot of sense i said darkly you arent old enough for wiseoldman crap even with a threemonthold in your arms he leaned close as jenks zipped off to talk to my mother i mean it he said lucy reaching up for my face oliver is going to weasel out of his promise no matter what i say he knows youre not going to tell anyone that witches were born from demons if you do witch society will crumble in a century of witch hunts that will make salem look like a puppet show no i said but he wasnt listening youre going to lose he said firmly and when you do im telling you dont do anything stupid go with it go to alcatraz go with al i dont care but just go with it its not over when that bell rings trents gaze went to the silver bell on the covens table and fear slid through me i heard what he was saying oliver was scum trent didnt see me walking out of here he had me lost and was planning a comeback i looked at ivy and her eyes dilated at my fear take your seats please vivian said loudly from the podium her words bouncing through the auditorium and silencing percent of the noise pierce was at my elbow and he pulled me down the empty aisle of seats putting us right in front of my mother and ivy trent edged in next and we all sat on the stage there were two empty chairs at the covens table one for vivian one for brooke i could not lose i couldnt id be in the everafter taking my sun in thieving snatches vivian gestured at the silver bell and it chimed making me jump a wave of force had echoed out of it having the feeling of a bubble going up the auditorium was closed for the duration no one in or out it had begun twentyone i said pipe down vivian said crossly when the room reacted to the doors locking trent tried to quiet lucy with an offered pinkie and she protested refusing it behind me my mother piled her stuff on the empty seat next to her and settled in completely unfazed pierce ran a nervous hand over his soft curls taking his hat off and dropping his hand to finger his stolen badge you will shut up vivian shouted cheeks coloring when oliver said something only those on the stage could hear as the junior member of the coven its my responsibility to maintain order at these proceedings and you will be silent or ill gag you myself my mother leaned forward between pierce and me shes a bit of a hardass she said and jenks buzzed his wings youve no idea ms morgan he said then he sat on my shoulder his wings tickling my neck it was good to have him back vivian put her hands on her hips and waited frowning slowly the witches grew silent as she used a sixthgradeteacher stare on them i put a hand on my stomach feeling sick everyone i cared about was around me oliver had promised to clear my name if i publicly apologized for using black magic and never went to the press with the fact that witches were stunted demons i had held up my end of the bargain even when the coven had tried to off me but trent playing peekaboo with lucy believed theyd back out of it scared id go to the press with the ugly truth anyway if oliver called my bluff i didnt know if i could do it not only would it destroy our society but it would upset the balance of everyone elses ill hurt him ill friggin make oliver sorry if he screws me over i jumped when pierce touched me a slow trickle of broken everafter turning into a rush that made me feel ill once he had my attention you need this he said slipping me the security amulet pierce no i whispered not taking my eyes off the stage as i tried to shove it back into his hands but he only dropped it in my pocket neither one of us was touching it but it was a leyline charm and i tried to dampen the flow to something that didnt feel like tinfoil on teeth my headache eased and i was starting to wonder if i needed to be in touch with a ley line to feel good thank you i whispered and he sat in his chair totally happy with himself its a trifle he said and i touched his hand with my free one completing the circuit and giving him a taste i mean for being here with me i said and he smiled i know from my other side trent sighed dramatically and pierce pulled away turning his attention to the stage thank you vivian said sarcastically not a hint of overdone dramatic flair in her speech this is going to be a long night and i want it done before sunrise so you princess wannabes can hit the fairy ball on the beach so im going to throw out all the dramatic crap youre all used to from oliver and cut to the chase the casual matteroffact manner in which she was conducting herself had caused a stir but i was relieved vivian was a bit of fire and spit and i didnt think i could stomach seeing her standing before us in robes and speaking with the airy distance of pomp and circumstance this doesnt mean i will be dispensing with the rules she said accentuating the word as if talking to oliver alone and since we cant do anything without a full quorum were going to take five minutes and swear in a new coven member beside me pierce trembled his hands formed fists and then he opened them setting them on his pants with his fingers spread wide there was an excited reaction from the crowd and my attention went to the five hopefuls sitting in the same row we were but on the other side of the theater initiates vivian said her mood shifting to one of ceremony excuse me pierce said as he stood causing a stir among the people who noticed him trent looked up at him in surprise where is he going i didnt answer instead leaning back when ivy touched my shoulder and whispered this should be interesting vivian hadnt noticed him crossing to the second set of stairs focused on the other five hopefuls coming up the left side after much deliberation she began then hesitated as the crowd reacted to pierce taking the stage and walking steadily forward vivian turned to him and i swear her eyes held amused anticipation pierce halted just shy of center stage may i approach madam coven member he asked voice booming so he could be heard without an amulet oliver reached to touch his own amulet no he said flatly and vivian gave him a withering look you gave me this job oliver she said sharply let me do it and as oliver frowned she turned and dramatically crossed the stage to hand him another amulet the coven recognizes gordian pierce pierce fingered the metal ring his eyes going everywhere but to me as he took off his coat and went to set it over the podium slowly he took over the stage without saying a word his head came up and the crowd became still he wasnt wearing anything unusual just brown slacks a white shirt and that flamboyant vest carefully buttoned and holding a pocket watch the way he carried himself evolved as he stood there and i stifled a shiver as trent grunted in surprise he was different dangerous and i had no idea what he was going to do im of a mind to beg your pardon madam coven member he said softly his words going out perfectly with the help of the amulet and with all due respect to those fine witches you have assembled here sworn in and ready to commit their lives to service there is no coven opening i am here i am the sixth and thats all the pie there is the crowd stirred most of the noise swallowed up by the space with a sliding sound of wood oliver stood get him out of here he roared stirring the people into a buzzing whisper pierce didnt recognize him fixed on vivian waiting out the noise you are a black witch oliver shouted shunned and pierce spun and olivers words choked off bricked into the ground aye where i gasped out my last six feet under buried alive and breaking my nails to bloody stumps as i tried to claw my way free and i died despite it but im a coven member nonetheless and i have returned to claim my position and years of back pay ivy leaned forward and tapped my shoulder i take back everything i said about your sleeping with him gee thanks i said dryly and trent stifled a guffaw jenks though clattered his wings for us to shut up so he could hear the other coven members put their heads together and i waited watching them amanda looked scared oliver full of bluster wyatt peeved and leon like he wanted it to be over it took only a moment and then oliver said you are a black witch tried and condemned you have lost your claim security dropping back a step pierce took a stiff stance i knew he couldnt tap a line but it was dramatic and the approaching men halted before they even hit the puddle of light i will be heard he shouted eyes angry this meeting called for rachel morgan to apologize for using black magic in her effort to save lives is a farce the goal here is to validate or deny the use of black magic for the greater good not apologize for using it i opine that until you make a fist of the issue i have a claim vivian waved security back and pierce relaxed from the audience rose a nervous murmur oliver though seemed too catty for my comfort he looked to his left then his right to get everyones opinion and their nods and sat back down with a magnanimous gesture crap it was all or nothing now apologizing wasnt going to do it i had to justify myself thanks pierce vivians smile grew wide as if that was a good thing and i let out a breath unaware that id been holding it the vacant coven membership remains in question then she said glancing back into the wings to someone on the support staff all in favor of exploring the validity of legalizing black magic in specific people for the intent of the greater good and using the case of rachel morgan as the cornerstone as one they all muttered their ayes opposed it was simply a formality but no one breathed as she waited to the count of five clearly pleased vivian looked down at me and my heart stopped rachel is this okay with you ssure i stammered when trent jabbed his elbow into me can we have two more chairs up here vivian asked someone in the wings and a skinny tall man in black slacks and shirt emerged with two plain brown folding chairs well get your ass up there jenks said and i had a moment of panic wish me luck i whispered as i set my bag on my chair and stood i was feeling jenkss loss already as he stayed perched on the back of my chair beside trent where his dust sifted over a cooing lucy reaching for him with her little hands i felt unreal as i watched my steps head down and looking at the redandsilver pattern in the carpet as i made my way to the stage the stairs had treads on them but i still held the railing as i went up my palms starting to sweat someone in the crowd hissed as i found the light it was warm up here but i shivered pierce stood beside the podium where the two new chairs waited he wasnt smiling and i was so friggin scared come on rachel jenks shrilled youre a badass not a bad witch my head came up jaw clenched he was right and i gave him a bunnyeared kisskiss someone laughed i couldnt see who it was through the lights but i breathed easier vivians möbiusstrip pin caught the glint of the spotlight and wisps of her blond hair that had escaped her elaborate coiffure drifted in the heat as she approached me confident and sure she looked miles away from the tangled mess in the back of my car handing me my amplification amulet she gave my shoulder a squeeze to publicly show her support it was a bold move on her part and i appreciated it she couldnt be fired but as pierce had proved you could be retired its a leyline charm she said but you have to touch it for it to work good luck thanks i looped the amulet over my head making sure that the small disc wasnt touching skin i didnt want anyone hearing my private words to pierce he sat a moment after i did and i tried to look attractive but not slutty in my leather dress i had a moments thought for the cap id forgotten on the couch back at the hotel and then i turned to pierce as he said are you well im okay yourself i was going to puke i knew it pierce sent his gaze into the glare about the same having died once the outcome of a public trial has lost much of its threat id think it would be the other way around i said then jerked when vivian called my name she was back at the podium waiting rachel i think everyone knows why youre here would you like to say anything some of the crowd muttered and i thought i heard black witch but i stood trying to gather everyones attention with a moment of silence i picked out trent through the glare thinking he looked worried as he tried to keep lucy quiet i darent look at my mother or ivy and jenks was too small this would be tricky if i lied the silver bell on the table would ring i had come here under the lie of having been forced into black magic to test trents security systems that wasnt the issue anymore and id have to be careful with what i said finally there was silence i took a breath feeling dizzy i reached to touch my amulet im here because of manipulation by both the coven and outside forces and im claiming my shunning should be permanently annulled youd think id dropped a bloody vampire into a sweetsixteen pajama party the crowd burst into noise and i felt sick when from up in the balcony the chant burn her burn her drifted down steady rachel pierce said his eyes narrowed as he sat beside me theyre ignorant and frightened yeah but they can still kill me i said thinking longingly of my kitchen enough vivian shouted you want me to clear the auditorium and do this behind closed doors fear tightened my shoulders and i almost panicked a private trial would be my end the threat of my going public with our origins would be gone id never even get my say but would be shoved on a boat and be on my way to alcatraz on the midnight run but vivian was only trying to get them to be quiet and it worked still holding her frown aimed at the crowd she gestured for me to continue i was forced into learning black magic in order to survive i said truthfully nodding to trent in the first row that a hundred circumstances had forced me not trent was beside the point and i couldnt help it if they thought i was talking about him i know black magic but ive never hurt anyone but myself and im not going to apologize for it my eye twitched as i thought of the fairies and from the covens table there was a tiny ping of sound as the silver bell rang giving evidence of my lie no thats a lie i quickly amended as the crowd stirred i killed fairies to keep them from burning down my church and massacring my partner and his family when the coven started taking potshots at me but ive never hurt anyone who wasnt trying to kill me first the crowd responded with an almost disappointed ferocity i felt my face pale when i realized that these people whom i counted as my own were actually eager for my blood they reminded me of trents dogs and my knees became weak im sorry rachel pierce said touching my hand im so sorry fairies arent real people jenks shrilled his familiar voice cutting through the noise that doesnt count oliver leaned forward to pour himself a cup of water looking too satisfied to live but rachel believes they are people and she used black magic to kill them he said as he touched his amulet i say it stands i could see the rest of the night with crystal clarity vivian would be on my side but oliver would pick holes in everything until there would be nothing left of my defense i found trent in the haze and he shrugged having known it already frightened i took a breath to refute the statement though i didnt know how pierce stood surprising the crowd into soft whispering i was there when rachel twisted the curse to burn the fairies he said i was part of it as much as she was more so there was no way to survive but for burning them rachel took part but she drew the curse back into herself at great cost before it was fully invoked turning a deadly curse into a nonlethal one saving most of the fairies at great hurt to herself she drew a curse into herself and survived someone shouted shes a demon thats what she is my eyes widened and i swear my heart stopped i looked to trent panicked i hadnt told i hadnt told anyone everyone in the audience started talking and oliver just sat back and enjoyed it arms crossed in confidence i was going to be branded a black witch and sentenced to alcatraz there was no way around it damn it al was going to win the issue at hand is not whether killing fairies is lawful trent shouted as he stood and those around him quieted who here hasnt accidentally killed one of the winged folk its a tragedy but should we all be considered murderers for it i exhaled and let go of pierces hand then winced when he shook it trying to get the circulation back i hadnt even known id taken it jeez i probably looked like a scared little girl and trent had spoken for me vivian walked to the podium and pulled another amulet from under it the coven recognizes trenton kalamack ill give trent one thing he knew how to make an entrance he was already halfway to the stairs and lucy babbled as he took them the crowds noise rose and fell and i detected a softening it was hard to think ugly thoughts when you were watching a highly successful businessman with a happy baby in his arms trent and vivian murmured a few words their heads almost touching and then he took the amulet lucys cooing rang out and then trent disentangled her little fingers from the amulet whispering to her in what sounded like another language the crowd liked that and i wondered if hed done it intentionally trent gathered himself and when he looked pointedly at me i sat down my chair scraping that same guy brought a third chair out placing it between me and the podium if i may continue trent said not sitting and pierce touched my knee stilling my bobbing foot should rachel morgan be held accountable for her actions when she was manipulated by outside forces into a place where to survive she had to learn a dark skill forced to learn and utilize black magic at the whim of another i dont know my intent would have been twofold first to see if my security systems could stand against the worst a witch can produce which i think we can all agree is the magic done by a black witch and second a minor question of mine curiosity really i wanted to know if a good witch could use black magic and not bewicked the crowd buzzed and i wasnt pleased that little silver bell wasnt ringing had trent taken advantage of the situation to find out if i was trustworthy son of a bastard is this to be a morality trial oliver asked and i swallowed hard with the room out for my blood there was no way i could win and telling them of our beginnings would make things doubly worse damn damn and double damn perhaps trent said his soft melodic voice spilling out to fill the room with confidence what would have started out as an experiment in security has left me racked with guilt this is my fault he said and people started to listen i was blind to how seriously the witch community would respond to black magic if id known i would certainly have chosen another method for testing my security why in the hell wasnt that bell ringing i asked myself unless trent was confident that his wording put everything into the theoretical i couldnt have gotten away with it but i wasnt a bloody politician i feel remorse for having manipulated such an honest person into a bad place trent was saying his words hitting me hard i want to make reparations rachel doesnt deserve imprisonment for the things she has done he turned to the covens table holding lucys hand away from his face there was an arrangement oliver it went too far she should be pardoned and you know it vertigo was dancing about my brain and i was glad i was sitting trent was referring to the deal wed agreed to in the fib interrogation room and with sudden clarity i realized i was lost if oliver called my bluff i was lost my gaze found ivy and my mother both dealing with the stress in their separate ways i couldnt turn society upside down by telling them where witches had come fromand oliver knew it vivian invited oliver to speak and he laid a hand on his amulet as if covering his heart you offered her a job if i remember correctly the highestranking member of the coven stated perhaps this is a ploy to get yourself a black witch on your payroll mr kalamack a legalized black witch who you think isgood at heart the auditorium buzzed and from the front row came jenkss highpitched go to hell oliver rachel isnt working for no scummy politician vivian gestured to the bell sending a clear pinging out to silence the crowd if i may bring the conversation back to what were here for she said when they quieted oliver leaned over to look at her and just what is that vivian if not holding witches accountable to our laws laws that have kept us safe for thousands of years trent was walking toward me a faint smile on his face as he sat in the rickety folding chair beside mine his expression was both confident and satisfied and not any of it was from lucy babbling in his arms something was up and i probably wasnt going to like it you took advantage of this to find out if i was a good witch i said softly and you wonder why i dont like you see the course through he said careful to keep from touching his amulet there will be hell to pay but i will see you back on this side of the lines before im done trust me frustrated i sat and crossed my arms over my chest vivian had taken the floor and slowly the crowd became quiet rachel morgan and gordian pierce knowing black magic is only part of the issue here she said head rising to take in the edges of the room her voice had taken on the cadence of a storyteller and i fidgeted this is more than a trial of black witchcraft but a question of how far we allow accepted morality to stretch to maintain the public safety two days ago i was sent to watch rachel on her journey here two days ago i was certain that black magic under any circumstances was grounds for shunning oliver leaned forward eager for the kill and now he drawled she hesitated took a breath then let it out oliver were in trouble she said her voice heavy with concern it was as if she was speaking to him alone and i felt a stab of alarm for what might come out of her mouth rachel wasnt the reason the arch fell she said then for all the good it did held up a hand against the rising crowd it fell because of saltdissolving adhesive oliver muttered but his voice was completely overwhelmed by the crowds noise beside me pierce grimaced trying to look positive but coming across as ill to my other side trent was stone faced i couldnt tell if this was part of his plan or not on his lap lucy was falling asleep the bright lights and heat hitting her hard silence vivian yelled without the aid of her amulet and most of the crowd shut up let me tell you what happened my foot quivered and i looked down then up into the faceless crowd i traveled first behind rachel then with her vivian said only to be interrupted by oliver and you expect us to believe that you are seeing things clearly vivian spun to him her tiedyed robe furling you know im not spelled oliver she said tartly disagreeing with you does not equal having ones judgment impaired and if the rest of your bootlickers would grow a pair we might have some justice here and maybe save our asses we are in dire danger and its not from rachel the crowd became silent pierce leaned over to me and with his pinkie just touching the amulet he whispered i like her someone laughed and vivian shot me an encouraging glance i stand before you in the sphere of the covens truth charm and i say that i traveled with rachel drove her car after she fought off a demon a daywalking demon she said loudly when the noise rose she didnt call it it came of its own volition i stand here now because she bested it it was beyond me not a sound came from the audience as they took that in a daywalking demon someone shouted thats impossible trent scuffed his feet to pull eyes to him they exist a demon possessed one of my associates and was able to stay on this side of the ley lines in the sun it was rachel who banished the demon and freed my friend daywalking demons are here your safety is severely compromised the rules are evolving he had to shout the last and vivian looked worried i could well imagine the fervor going on past the doors where this was being piped out vivian twitched her dress to gather the crowds attention unfortunately mr kalamack is correct demons are finding ways around the rules something has changed and they can walk in daylight unsummoned as we are now we cant stand against them oliver cleared his throat nervously of course you couldnt stand against a demon vivian you may be coven but you were also alone thats what im saying oliver she said sarcastically anger at her own lack of ability bleeding through i was alone but so was rachel and she beat him back my drawn circle fell as if it wasnt there rachels didnt it held firm im not saying that black magic is stronger but her magic has the strength of earth magic with the speed and flexibility of leyline charms and by continuing to ignore all of it because of the fear of some we will condemn ourselves along with a good woman i was going to cry pierce took my hand and i squeezed it even if i didnt make it out of here someone had said i was a good person it was worth the two thousand miles of bad food dirty restrooms and two nights without a bed just to hear someone say it vivian stop inflaming the issue oliver stated when he could be heard again and vivian turned to the crowd talking to them i have seen my skills brushed aside as if nothing and i am scared ignorance and denial will get us enslaved or dead dont let fear blind you dont let fear cause you to destroy someone who can stand against them rachel fought off a daywalking demon that was released when the arch fell and you want to shun her she was shouting but most people were listening we all saw the news she said gesturing we all felt the tragedy saw the lives ended i cant stop it the coven cant stop it she can i think she freed it oliver shouted standing to point a finger at me she was there the crowd held its breath and in the silence i sat straighter i didnt release the demon from under the arch i said and there was no ping of the bell oliver grimaced as his trap sprang with me safe outside it the auditorium quieted beyond the haze of the lights and olivers chair squeaked as he leaned back what scares me vivian said softer now that she had everyones attention is that my circle well drawn and able to handle anything was nothing to him this daywalking demon brushed through it rachel saved my life at great risk to herselfknowing that i had been sent to spy on her with black magic oliver muttered are you that stupid oliver vivian belted out and i realized that most of my trial was going to be a fight for power between these two the rest of the coven would vote with the winner my life hinged upon a narrowminded man and his fears of course she used black magic vivian said demons are laughing at us for our selfimposed ignorance rachel used black magic against a demon it hurt none but herself and saved my life i have a hard time finding wrong in that vivian dropped back a step to let people think about it what about las vegas oliver stated too confident in himself to get up property damage and lives ended the same demon yes the same black magic vivian nodded yes it took both pierce and rachel that time and the curse they used unfortunately set the building on fire the bodies found therein were ended by the demon before they could banish it i can truthfully say that rachel and pierce both used restraint in twisting curses rachel uses more restraint actually she said as she glanced at me and while the demon was not destroyed it was successfully banished oliver chuckled to do more mischief hey i blurted out making lucy jump in her sleep we were trying to survive and the demon just showed up oliver asked looking from me to the bell the demon just showed up i said clearly daring the damn bell to ring you are a menace oliver said loudly when it didnt i say we give you to this demon and maybe it will go away my mouth dropped open and from the higher seats a few people clapped nearer through the haze i saw frightened expressions and heard a soft murmur rise give me to a demon was he serious vivian strode dramatically across the stage gathering eyes to her and taking them from me do you even hear yourself she said putting a hand on the table and leaning toward him oliver drew back but he was clearly unrepentant if shes a black witch then giving her to a demon isnt a crime no it would be a joke i thought at the end of the coven table leon raised his hand for everyones attention im not going to agree with any plan that gives a person to a demon he said shocking oliver amanda and wyatt nodded looking less sure but agreeing with him emboldened the timid man took a firmer grip on his amulet i am willing to consider that legalizing black magic in certain individuals might be permissible he said and the crowd buzzed id like to explore this in greater detail that perhaps a coven member might be allowed to become skilled in black magic if the ends are good pierce exhaled and i smiled at him if his claim to the coven was accepted then id have two strong votes for me trent too looked less stressed and the soft clench of his jaw eased maybe this was how they planned on getting my shunning permanently revoked working for the coven to fight a demon was a hell of a lot better than living in the everafter or being trents witch i relaxed seeing an end i could live with even if it would cramp my style working for the coven ha but at least id get paid for doing something id probably have to do anyway seeing his victory dissolving in a wash of common sense oliver stood we should adjourn and discuss this in private whoa whoa whoa i said grabbing my amplifying amulet uncrossing my legs and leaning forward past trent to see oliver better i was promised a trial before my peers along with my shunning being removed and an end to this but first things first pierce stood tugging his vest straight and reaching for his amulet a private council is how i ended up in the ground he said i wont accept going behind closed doors a hole in the ground a cell with no windows i could always call on al but if i did thered be no way id get my shunning removed i fidgeted as the crowd buzzed and the witches at the table discussed the issue finally wyatt rang the bell for silence i want to do this here he said and oliver fell back in his chair with a dramatic expression of irritation i dont want to spend days on this i have just one question he looked at the other two witches silent but clearly as interested as he was perhaps this is a morality trial after all morality i thought starting to sweat i could do this i didnt know what to do with my hands and i envied trent who was holding lucy he could suggest running me through with a flagpole and as long as he was holding that baby all they would say would be awwww vivian looked questioningly at me and after glancing at pierce i nodded seeing my acceptance she inclined her head at the witch and he reached for his amulet as he leaned forward i want to hear why they each risked shunning to learn black magic the crowd quieted and i felt a wash of hope survival id done it for survival and i could say that without that stupid bell ringing who would blame me for that very well vivian said a faint worry line on her brow giving me pause rachel why did you learn black magic pierce sat down and i stood nervous as i took a step forward by necessity i said thinking of all the curses id used and the soulsearching that had come before them to stay alive and to save the lives of those i love the audience was silent waiting for the bell that never rang even as the truth came out i was saddened they had truly believed id done it because i was a powerhungry monster gordian pierce vivian said the chair creaked as he stood and i watched him step a little past me i learned black magic to kill demons a wave of soft sound rose and fell from the people beyond the haze and oliver leaned forward his little eyes glinting and have youkilled demons he asked with your blackarts skills i have had moderate success he said and from the corner of my sight i watched trent bow his head holding lucy close as if he were hurt i have tried pierce stated loudly as the crowd showed their disbelief just two days ago i almost killed a demon al i thought grimacing then i went cold turning to look at pierce in horror shit but you failed oliver needled him why should we allow you to rejoin the coven if youre not skilled enough shit shit shit i thought as i silently begged pierce to keep his mouth shut but i couldnt move if i moved it would look worse i would have succeeded pierce said hotly the hell spawn would be dead but for pierce stopped his eyes wide he looked at me in fear im so sorry he whispered knowing what was going to happen rachel i didnt think i swallowed hard as his words went out to the hundreds assembled waiting but for what oliver said standing he gestured but for what gordian trents head was bowed and vivian looked pained she knew she had heard us talk i failed pierce stated it was my failing im not good enough why olivers voice was demanding if youre not good enough then this claim of learning black magic to save ourselves is a load of crap and you should be buried alive again pierces eyes closed his jaw clenched refusing to speak my chest hurt and i said the words for him because i stopped him twentytwo trent bowed his head as the auditorium erupted in noise in trents arms lucy woke and began to wail i knew how she felt rachel pierce said and i pushed his hand from me standing with my chin high even as i felt my one chance slipping away damn it damn it back to the turn and hell again youd have us pardon the black witch who stopped another from killing a demon oliver was shouting and i cringed if youre afraid and want the taint of black magic among us the choice is simple we should choose a demon killer not the one who saved him all in favor of pierce regaining his position my head came up they wouldnt vote for me not now the crowd became even louder and as security came forward to keep them back a bubble snapped into place over the stage at the coven table grimfaced people raised their hands one two three four trust me trent said standing with his lips inches from my ear as lucy howled you saved me from demons and i will save you from the witches just play it out trust me i dont understand i said feeling his grip too tight on me trent we are voting vivian oliver stated and the woman spun to him her face tight in worry either say yea or nay or your voice wont count i vote against pierce she said quickly oliver wait but oliver was striding to the front of the stage the noise was loud and he shouted that is four for pierce one against pierce regains his position exonerated from his past crimes of black magic and is given leave to use such skills to destroy demons and save lives this was a good thing but my stomach was tight and oliver was far too happy pierce was being pulled backward to the table absently shaking hands with nervous people now sworn to protect him by a brotherhood only broken in the direst of situations and he in turn would protect them from me all in favor of permanently rescinding rachel morgans shunning and reinstating her as a white witch capable of doing black magic oliver stated wait i said then fumbled for my amulet it was going too fast and trent was backing away with a crying lucyabandoning me oliver vivian said loudly over the clamor of a hundred voices this is not fair and you know it he grinned at her looking evil for or against vivian i vote for rachel she said breathlessly as do i pierce said but there were four hands raised against me and my heart seemed to turn into a black stone it was over it was over that quickly you lose oliver said smiling i fell back stumbling until i put the three chairs between me and them i had that security amulet and i wasnt helpless you promised me a fair trial i said but no one was listening oliver i swear youll give it to me or i will talk ill tell them everything no you wont oliver wasnt using his amplifying amulet his back to the assemblage and i felt myself pale i looked past him to the crowd visible now that the house lights had come up i found my mother clutching her hands to her chest and crying my gaze fell then to ivy who was ready to live at lastwithout me and then i found jenks looking aghast and unable to reach me because of the bubble between us hed be fine hed go live with trent the bastard and his children would play with lucy theyd all be fine without me i thought my throat closing as i fumbled in my pocket for the amulet that pierce had given me i was not going to alcatraz id call al first i did no wrong i said reaching out and tapping a line feeling my hair start to float as the broken jaggedness filled me i know black magic and i will use it when threatened im not a black witch take her oliver said motioning for security and pierce stiffened surrounded by his new peers i motioned for him to relax al was waiting for me i could hide out in the everafter until things cooled off and then come back i could always do a disguise or something who was i kidding theyd know it was me oliver you already tried alcatraz trent said his voice calm and smooth as i recall that was a dismal failure you need something more permanent i turned toward trent livid like a lobotomy what are you doing i all but hissed and he retreated putting more distance between us as lucy howled theres nothing to stop her from escaping again trent said matteroffactly ive a better idea someone grabbed my arms from behind me and i struggled grunting when a zip strip was slipped over my wrists as pierce stood made helpless by his new position the jagged ley line left me what do you have in mind oliver asked as i shook the security off and stood in the hot spotlight hearing some people cry for my blood and those i once trusted either silent or plotting against me trent had said to trust him but every instinct i had said to fight i can curse her trent said and vivians eyes widened send her to the everafter which is where shed flee anyway but curse her so that she cant return unless summoned you son of a bitch jenks shrilled a hot red dust spilling from him like the demon she is oliver said smiling wickedly but i could do nothing except stare was there such a thing or was this part of his plan put some fake curse on me so i was off the coven radar brooke had offered me something similar what would my life be like now if i had accepted well she is a demon isnt she trent said with a nasty boysclub smile on his face i didnt know what to do he had said trust him but this oliver we cant vivian exclaimed aghast enough to tell me she thought it might be possible thats inhuman shes a demon oliver shouted human morality doesnt apply to her a thump reverberated across the barrier sheltering the stage and everyone cowered as the shimmering everafter pulsed ivy had ripped a chair from the floor and thrown it she looked wild eyes black shaking with anger given free rein oliver gave the incensed vampire a disparaging glance can you do it he asked trent pierce was being restrained i knew he could break from it and was following my lead of waitandsee trent glanced at him before nodding my heart thudded trust him i need a collective he said and i could imagine my life ending id never be able to return id never see the sununless this was part of his plan how bad had it been i wondered when he had been a demons slave how much hatred had he hidden from me was he going to laugh at me now hurt me you putrid elf thats my daughter my mother screamed and trent twitched hed been named his secret was out but i didnt think it mattered he had left his daughters ears undocked the elves were coming out of the closet with her the directive of the next generation hed given me a say in it or had it all been a lie oliver shifted into motion isolate them he directed pointing at my mother and ivy now struggling violently form a collective we do this now oliver we need to think about this vivian demanded as she confronted him but oliver motioned for security and she was restrained you are outvoted oliver said with satisfaction put her with coven member pierce i felt sick unable to move it wasnt the plastic straps with the charmed silver at their core that kept me from reacting it was trent he had said to trust him he had said i had to lose hed told me to go quietly but i didnt know why the light from above was eclipsed as security shoved me into a circle one of the junior coven members had sketched and i fell to my knees trents shadow lay heavily on me i looked up his stonecold face scaring me lucy was bawling in someone elses armsher wailing giving my unvoiced fear a sound ttrent i stammered he could do it he said he had a curse and i believed he could do it hed been dropping elven wild magic the entire trip and apparently he had a new trick to show me betray me and ill never rest until youre dead i vowed my hands bound behind me kneeling before him and the entire witch council he grabbed my shoulder hauling me up as the crowd shouted its approval not as far from our witchburning past as i had hoped i guess ive got a demon curse to give you he breathed for me alone green eyes turbulent as his wild magic seeped from his fingers and sent tendrils of power i couldnt use through me tingling warming seductive ive been carrying it since the arch fell kusox gave it to me i had to take it to free him it doesnt do anything to me but give me a headache you though i think it will work on kusox i went cold the memory of an elven assassin singing me to death rising high in me pulled into existence by trents magic seeping through me like a soporific soothing even as excitement sparked from his touch id almost died under wild magic and now he wanted to give me kusoxs curse with it i was a fool elves fought demons hed used me again trent leaned in closer his hand light on my shoulder once i give it to you you can no i cried my bound hands coming up to shove him away but trent had grabbed me his eyes looking behind me id sooner get a lobotomy i said scared you son of agony exploded in my knees as something hit me from behind exactly where the guards in alcatraz had gotten me gasping in pain i crumpled my knees exploding i looked up finding trent staring down at me his brow pinched his unsaid words swallowed in frustration curse her oliver said as i tried to breathe and hurry up about it he added squinting in pain i looked up when trents shadow fell over me you not trusting me is going to get you killed he said his expression grim as he bent to lift me up failing when i refused to cooperate as i was saying take the bloody curse and give it back to kusox my muscles went slack and my mouth opened in an o of surprise give it to kusox that would mean id have to liketouch him seeing my understanding trent stopped trying to get me to stand up and turned to the audience a goldtinted wash of everafter sprang up around us and as the watching people chanted in unison to show their collective spirit i felt the tingle of wild elven magic spark through me again making me tremble kusox wanted to dissect me and trent thought i could hold him still long enough to curse him was he nuts or just tragically overestimating my abilities trent was inside the circle with me and i tried to get up falling back against it when he shoved me back down no i pleaded my hands bound before me but he began to chant low and under his breath as he gathered his magic i took a wild breath collapsing slowly when a wave of lassitude spilled into me carried by his music circling over and over in my mind becoming my world wild magic oh no it promised peace and even as i tried to fight it my eyes slipped shut against the harsh glare my soul hurt and needed to heal too much had happened and i wanted it all to be over thats what the magic promised and i wanted it even as i fought its peace my head bowed and trent knelt before me singing in words i couldnt understand his beautiful voice rising and falling so softly it was only for me to hear a tear slid down my face a tear for all that i hadnt done that i should have done differently regret but it didnt matter now trents energies prickled against me and i suddenly realized he wasnt singing anymore rachel he breathed and i lifted my head numb si peccabas poenam meres he said softly putting a hand on my shoulder and i shivered as the curse slid gently from him to me settling like tattered silk atop my aura why i pleaded thinking id been stupid to trust him my eyes met his begging for mercy it was just us though we were surrounded by hundreds bearing witness to the event because youre the only one who can he said and i stiffened as the curse began to soak in making me want to scream like a thousand beetles boring into my skin i felt the curse burrow into me finding a place among my cells wiggling squirming maggots embedding themselves in my soul a smuttainted wash of everafter coated me and as i heard the howls of the crowd become muffled i knew i was being pulled into a ley line and yet trent gripped my shoulder not done with me yet shes still here oliver shouted his ugly face shimmering behind trents circle the first part shifts the curse trent said talking to oliver but looking at me his fingers pinching my shoulder so hard it hurt its the second one that severs it from me and banishes her he was telling me how to do the curse but i could hardly focus on him my drive buried under wild magic and my senses dulled somehow my gaze found my mother in the mass of howling people she was crying leaning on ivy who stood stoically as her heart broke seeing me look at her my mom rallied pushing away the man blocking her and striding forward give them hell rachel she shouted at the edge of the bubble tears streaming down her face im proud of you trent yanked me up by the shoulder and i staggered my knees barely able to hold my weight i curse you rachel mariana morgan to be fixed to the reality i banish you to there you are cursed to remain until summoned be it day or night forever bound as a demon his eyebrow lifted mocking me you got all that want me to write it down for you the curse he wanted me to give it to kusox should i be pissed or marvel at his foresight okay i said numbly and a hint of a smile flickered in his eyes my jaw trembled and doubt hit me why was i trusting him trent wait i cried out knees throbbing just so you know ive trusted you since camp trent said then shouted dramatically facilis descensus tartaros his hand let go and it was as if i was sucked into myself yanked backward into nothing the jagged disjointedness of the san francisco lines took me dissolving me to thoughts and memories and dropping me into the infinity of time he trusts me i thought trust me trent had said i wanted to but to risk death to curse kusox why should i even bother the world had turned its back on me i should turn my back on it twentythree sliding i hit the red soil facefirst eyes clenched shut and teeth together so i wouldnt bite my tongue as i scraped against the ground for several feet before coming to an ungraceful stop the shift here had been rough almost as if no one had been assisting the subtle calculations that brought one back into reality standing and stable completely absent my first breath was choking and i sat up babying my knees and wiping the dirt off my bare legs and trying to figure out where i was yes i was in the everafter but where this wasnt cincy the ley lines were too jagged and the skyline wasnt right it was dark the moon unseen behind boiling red clouds the surrounding buildings slowly melting slumping into themselves and burning as they collapsed the thing was they never seemed to fall completely the best way i could describe it was that it looked like the world when youve been on a merrygoround for too longeverything a jumping mess knees throbbing i tried to find the moon or some gravestones to fix on if it was like cincy then they would be solid free of the nauseating red sheen on everything but there was no moon and if there were any graves they were unmarked not only was i two thousand miles from home with my knees busted again but i was on the wrong side of reality at least i had gotten rid of the charmed silver though and i rubbed my wrist glad i could tap a line again even if they were nasty broken things on a whim i tapped a line wincing at the ugly taste of it but holding on all the same al could usually feel it when i tapped a line in the everafter and would come and fetch me otherwise i dont know how hed know i was here stupid elf i muttered wrapping my arms around myself and shivering in the same nervegrating wind god i hoped i wasnt being more stupid than usual had i really sat there and let him curse me because i truuuuusted him the earth shook with one of the west coasts frequent tremors and the building across the street collapsed and collapsed and collapsed again for an instant i saw a flash of black sky with stars and a hint of peaceful gray water and then it was gone and the redsheened glow was back shivering violently i took a step toward the fleeting image as a breath of saltladen air pushed aside the burntamber stink for the briefest of instances did heaven lay just underneath the hell surrounding me visible only on the farthest arcs of the pendulum swing a rock fell behind me and i turned my welcoming snarl freezing it wasnt al heart pounding i licked my lips and squinted in the reddish glow at the top of a small slump of rubble oh hey hi i muttered seeing the thin raggedy figure standing belligerently above me a bent stick in his grip his bare foot moved and another rock rolled clunking to where i was sitting yeah i see you i said as i painfully got to my feet and then i yelped ducking when he threw his stick at me holy mother pus bucket i yelled dancing back as the surface demon jumped from the rubble to land ten feet in front of me the slump of debris behind him slowly melted into dust and blew away and a park bench took its place only to crack and crumble as the demon inched closer look home slice i got no beef with you i said as i hobbled backward tugging my dress down im simply in the wrong place at the wrong time give me a minute and ill be out of your hair off your turf outta yourcrib he snarled at me honest what had i ever done to him but when he picked up his stick and his blackeyed stare went behind me i had to look swell you got brothers i said rising out of my crouch and putting my hands in the air as if giving up bad decision one of them threw a rock and i ducked pulling heavily on the ley line and wincing as a lameass circle wobbled into existence the chunk of concrete hit my bubble inches from my head and slid down and the surrounding surface demons edged closer there wasnt any salt water around to interfere with my magic but the more heavily i pulled on the broken ley lines the harder they were to work with until it felt as if i were trying to hold a cat going boneless and slipping out of my grip the surface demons were wincing even as they crept closer and i wondered if they felt the line i was trying to hold it was giving me a headache too lets all be friends okay i said as i backed up i dont want to be here any more than you want me to i jerked when two more rocks hit the bubble behind me but a third one got through and i gasped when my circle fell and the rock hit my shoulder hey i exclaimed popping my circle back into existence as i rubbed my arm look im not a demon okay well maybe i am but im not like the rest of them i can walk under the sun wincing i added at least i used to be able to maybe we can come to a mutual understanding i help you and you dont stone me to death the first surface demon raised his stick yelling and they ran at me maybe not i whispered wideeyed and i pulled harder on the ley line shoring my wobbly circle up al i shouted wondering where he was i hadnt wanted to admit defeat but hells bells i needed some help the surface demons barreling toward me suddenly skidded to a stop their black eyes wide as they tasted the night now youre going to get it i said guessing al was coming when the ones in the back scattered you should have been nice with a weird cry the closest surface demon fell back but it was too late a flash of red light exploded overhead smashing the buildings away as if i were at the center of an atomic explosion the surface demons scattered like brown leaves the remnants of their clothes and auras fluttering it was al and he burst into existence in a grand mood an oldfashioned lantern in his hand and a walking cane at his side rachel mariana morgan he shouted enthusiastically raising the lantern high and i painfully rose from my crouch breaking my bubble with a small thought ive come to save you love i winced even as i was glad to see him hed won and with a cheerfulness that made me sick he strode over the rubble between us kicking rock and rebar out of the way i couldnt help but notice that the buildings he had destroyed with his entrance were back again this was unreal no wonder the surface demons were crazy done already he said his mood expansive from witch to demon in less than an hour it must be a record and what are you doing in the badlands theyre somewhatunnerving are they not especially now i was scanning the edges of the ragged horizon looking for heads sticks rocks whatever yes im done you were right oliver lied pierce is an idiot they should all eat toads and die can we go home oh god the everafter was my home al blinked tucking his cane under an arm and a whitegloved hand turning my chin to him as he peered into my eyes rachel love what did they do to you i blinked shocked to find that tears suddenly threatened nothing they cursed you he whispered flinging his walking cane at a surface demon the creature squealed and a putrid puff of green smoke was torn apart by the gritty wind it was that elf wasnt it al said i smell the stink of wild magic on you you cant go back unless summoned no i cant i admitted feeling stupid but trent has a plan my words trailed off and i felt even more like an idiot what was the point i was here even if i cursed kusox i was still shunned a virtual exile i told you to take that piece of elf crap firmly in hand al said pulling himself to his full height and frowning sternly at me now look what hes done you were a daywalking demon free to come and go as you please and now youre chained like the rest of us what a waste stupid girl i said nothing and al stepped back his lantern making a hazy gold glow around us he has a plan eh he mocked bless it back to the turn yeah i said yanking a strand of hair out of my mouth where the wind had put it but it doesnt matter anymore can we get out of here it stinks and my knees hurt shaking his head al tsktsked making my face burn i suddenly felt small beside him and i shrugged out of his arm trying to go companionably over my shoulder this is why we dont live on the surface he said as he tried to cover up my rebuke by tugging his frock coat straight ive never seen it this bad though usually the buildings dont fall like this he sniffed and adjusted his smoked glasses shall we go shivering i hobbled up to him feeling his warmth i was starting to get depressed i was never going to see the sun again thank you for picking me up i said and al beamed its what i live for rachel i have a treat for you what i said cringing at the idea of another one of his parties dalliance he said dissolving me into a memory and pulling me into a line im taking you to dalliance twentyfour the transition was smoother this time as we crossed merely the everafter not realities and my feet barely stumbled as the stink and grit of the surface echoed once and died replaced by a heavy bass thump and the sound of clinking glasses laughter mocked me and i looked up numb as we misted into existence damn it trent trust me he had said trust me did he have any idea of what he was asking right on the tick al said jovially his arm in mine as he checked his pocket watch clean yourself up rachel dalliance is a respectable establishment i didnt know whether to cry or scream id put my trust in a scheming elven drug lord al was right how stupid could i be id lost id lost jenks ivy my churcheverything cursed to remain on this side of the lines unless summoned if that didnt make me a demon what would a bar was to my left full of demons in trendy clothes reaching over one another to get their drinks the music was so loud that shouting replaced talking in front of me was a much more refined restaurant sedate but borrowing from the energy at the bar the theme seemed to be art deco with a lot of thick glass etched with circles and triangles grayandwhitepatterned carpet mixed with tile again using the circles and triangles theme it was modern expensive and looked mildly excessive the smell of food made my stomach growl which ticked me off how could i be hungry a host wearing a tux was talking to the three people ahead of us his goatslitted eyes telling me that they used demons as workers here not familiars trendy and expensive indeed the music thumped and laughter broke out from the widespaced tables where waitstaff eased through like boats in the fog the restaurant was only half full and the host led the demon trio ahead of us to a table their clothes and manners making them look like ceos out for a night of schmoozing on the companys account men everyone here was male behind the hosts mahogany desk dalliance floated in mist sparkling like jenkss dust jenks i blinked fast my jaw clenched a tingling at my shoulder pulled my attention to al hed changed from his crushed green velvet coat and lace into a threepiece charcoal gray suit a red handkerchief peeped from the breast pocket and his hair was slicked back he looked like a professional businessman right down to the eight pm stubble cheer up rachel he said shifting his shoulders as if fitting into a new suit this is dalliance youre not still moaning about pierce are you well pick up your little pet tomorrow tonight is for celebration where did you get that i asked not caring about pierce he looked at me new lines in his face as he played the part my closet you dont think i am a onetrick pony do you hold still first thing tomorrow im teaching you a brushandwash curse i took a breath to complain even as i felt a wave of his energy cascade over me easing the pain in my knees if not the ache in my heart yes i was depressed and yes id just lost everything but i felt like a slob with the grit of the surface on me and if it would clean me up then all the better i shivered as the curse slipped away looking up as al took out a pair of modern wire glasses and perched them on his nose they had a bifocal line and i knew he didnt need them much better he said with a sniff no one takes you seriously if youre in rags i jerked when his energy flowed over me again and my tight leather melted away into an uncomfortable gray business suit a purple gucci bag was in my hand and a palm pilot on my hip hey i exclaimed my hand going to my hair to find that it was back in a bun my shoes were so tight they hurt what was wrong with the leather dress you picked it out for me the host was coming back and al pulled me forward as if i was his arm candy this is dalliance if we dont fit the theme we cant stay the thought of bis made my brow furrow i should have called him when i had the chance i just lost everything in the world that means anything to me and youre taking me out to eat i protested ignoring the host now looking at us al waited until i brought my gaze up to him before saying you just gained everything in two worlds and im taking you to dalliance you dont eat here you network my shoulders slumped networking i was sick of demon networkingpartying the host sniffed at us and al turned his jaw a little heavier than he usually had it his hair a little thinner what do you really look like i wondered thinking of that blackskinned demon with the tail hed scared his gargoyle with reservations for two youll find it under algaliarept al said hooking his shiny dress shoe behind my leg and pulling me forward the man looked at the folder open on his desk youve been declined he said distantly his voice clear over the music thumping around us a growl escaped al and the skin around his eyes tightened theres been a mistake looking al straight in the eyes the demon said your credit sucks sir ah al poked me in the ribs making me jump and stick out my chest how long have you worked herecalvin calvin closed the file long enough to know that dali is not your personal friend but your parole officer no table dali what did dali have to do with this al was starting to look ticked true i didnt want to be here but i wanted to be at als little fourroom palace even less al im tired i said wrinkling my nose as if i smelled something rank this slop will likely give me the runs cant we just go home for a cheese sandwich the host turned his attention to me sneering his expression became empty of emotion and then i gasped when he reached across the desk grabbed my arm and yanked me closer youre not a familiar he said his face inches from mine youre that i yelped as i was jerked back al having taken my other arm and reclaimed me shes not a that shes a whom hands off the lady hey i said my arms out like i was being crucified if you both dont let go of me youre both going to be singing soprano just because i was in heels and carrying a gucci bag didnt mean i didnt know how to use them in new creative ways the two men looked at each other and let go simultaneously regaining my balance i snatched my bag from the floor and tugged my uncomfortable skirt straight god this suit made me look like a dullard a heavy balding man in a tux strode from the kitchen looking bothered as he started for us eyes fixed on us he gave a final bit of instruction to one of the waitstaff and continued forward my eyes widened i knew this demon it was dali and suddenly the name of the place made sense demons could look like anything why dali wanted to be an older overweight civil servant who ran a restaurant was beyond me you got her he said to al his bushy white eyebrows bunched as he took me in shes with me al said as he beamed taking my arm in warning dali flicked his eyes over me and youre sure shes als smile grew even wider she is i felt like a cow hed traded a handful of magic beans for im what i asked and al inclined his head at me his expression becoming decidedlyworriedlyfond a demon al said and calvin sniffed his disbelief we are here to celebrate and this pile of crap wont seat us the host stood firm and dali looked at the list as if he didnt care dali she is al protested i know it they cursed her and everything dali she isnt i muttered and the older demon sighed tapping the paper with a thick finger behind him six tables sat empty i suppose i could give you a table by the kitchen he finally offered the kitchen al echoed appalled dali let the folder hit the desk with a smack and calvin looked vindicated ive seen nothing from her that warrants anything better dali said and al huffed cursing her doesnt make her a demon im telling you she is leaning in dali said calmly youre a scam artist on the skids i am a procurer and instructor of fine familiars for the discriminating palate al interrupted youve bought from me yourself and im not about to fall for one of your henry higgins cons dali finished affronted my mouth dropped open hey al lost some of his confidence hunching slightly daligive me this one thing a table thats all im asking how can i prove her birthright if no one sees her the music shifted to a faster pace and dali frowned sit them in the corner he finally said and al straightened beaming im not a demon i said as the host moved to show us to a table thats what im thinking too dali said his head down as he scratched something in that folder of his al pinched my elbow if you cant say something nice keep your mouth shut rachel you are not helping mood ugly i followed als notverysubtle push to go first my feet hurt in the gray pumps but at least my knees were okay beside and a little behind me al nodded to the demons we passed as if they were great friends only to get a lackluster response unlike most of the places al had taken me there were no familiars and i didnt like being the only girl in the place al i whispered as he led us to the back im not a demon i know i said i was but that was for the coven because i was mad im not really one smiling at someone al waved i believe you are and the sooner you accept it the sooner we can get out of a fourroom apartment and into something more suitable okay i was more than arm candy i was his ticket to solvency al relax itchy witch smile i have a name i grumped my stomach pinching me harder yes but it has no pizzazz raaaachel racheeeeel he said trying it out in different ways no one will tremble in terror at that oh my god he said in a high falsetto its rachel run hide id had boyfriends who might differ with him but i was silent when the host stopped before a booth behind a pillar al smoothly pulled out a chair from the adjacent empty table relax he said as he invited me to sit youre the only female demon besides newt and shes fucking crazy let them look at you uncomfortable i sat amazed when al expertly scooted my chair in without a scuff on the carpet theyve seen me can we go home now ive had a hard day home his home not mine a pang hit me making it hard to breathe ivy jenks my mother trent better not have screwed this up i was going to freaking kill him al sat beside me both our backs to the wall and the host sniffed before he walked away a bite of supper is just the way to end a trying day al said as he snapped out my napkin and draped the black cloth over my lap dont you think not saying anything i settled back trying to figure out what was going on i mean i knew i was at a restaurant and was on display but al wasnt being lewd lascivious lustful or any other nasty l word i didnt know where i stood and that made me uncomfortable al i said suddenly as i looked over the table he didnt leave us menus how am i supposed to order if he didnt leave menus al was fiddling with the lit candle playing in the curl of heat like a fiveyearold you eat what youre given it doesnt get better than that i frowned not liking not knowing what i was eating no wine no eggs nothing with a sulfurbased preservative it gives me headaches sighing al looked at me over his new bifocals rachel dali himself doesnt get real eggs or wine chill and enjoy yourself will you chill had he told me to chill al looked funny still himself but older as he played the part of the successful businessman taking his main squeezethatd be meout to eat one of the waitstaff set twin glasses of water before us her aggressive welcome to dalliance can i get you something to start with bringing my head up brooke i exclaimed and the older woman snarled at me her eyes tired and her hair slicked back in an unflattering cut close to her skull you sold her as a waitress i stammered at al she was coven quality and they had her slinging orders and clearing tables brookes grimace curved up into a weird semblance of a smile she was wearing a tight gray uniform that went with the décor but didnt look good on her the starched white collar and the cut making it secondclass subservient her möbiusstrip pin still decorated her lapel but it looked like a joke now spotted with something spit what would you like madam demon she said looking extremely pissed see even brooke knows what you are al said as he moved his empty glass tell the piece of witch crap what you want to drink hurry before theres a shift change i stared my heartbeat fast shes a coven member and they made her a waitress brooke waited her face becoming red what do you want me to do al said not looking at all embarrassed if i sold her as a skilled familiar id get her back in a week to tell you the truth im a little disappointed brookes jaw clenched can i interest you in the specials tonight she asked the hatred in her voice coming in clear over the thumping of the music my head was shaking in disbelief brooke im so sorry i tried i really did can i start you off with a drink she asked tersely the brimstone bomber comes highly recommended al gestured flamboyantly and leaned back two of those yes and whatever the chef suggests something sweet for the lady and something earthy for me as you will it she said and turned to leave her pace slow and giving the surrounding demons a wide space i saw why when one reached to grab her ass laughing when she scooted to avoid him i felt sick why hadnt she listened to me id told her not to summon al hand to my middle i looked away shes too expensive for me to buy back isnt she al nodded watching her walk away very much so dali has wanted to bring familiars onto his waitstaff since he started dabbling in the entertainment field but he hadnt found any able to handle the shifts as i understand it shes been good for business who wouldnt want to have their ass kissed by a coven member relax enjoy yourself that was the third time hed told me to relax and i was getting tired of it but i froze when he took my hand his usual white glove gone as he lifted my fingers to kiss them uncomfortable i pulled away ignoring his snort of amusement as i looked over the arriving people the tables were starting to fill because of me my feet hurt and i wanted to take off my shoes demons were looking at me and i didnt like it al how old do gargoyles need to be before they bond with a uh witch i asked him thinking of the little guy al was making the phone me gesture to someone several centuries why he asked seeming uninterested once bound they live as long as we do i played with my silverware feeling guilty several centuries bis couldnt be that old he acted like a teenager and i remembered him saying he was only fifty with a soft sound of linen al turned to me his strong features bunched up in question i said why rachel is bix getting clingy like falling asleep in my kitchen no i lied and its not bix its bis al rubbed his hands together in delight i thought as much they dont bond well until they can remain awake during the day bis is too young yet my expression went flat oh my god it was happeningwhether i wanted it to or not bis was going to tie himself to me and then we would both be stuck here no i wouldnt allow it hey theres newt i said to change the subject and as if my speaking her name caught her attention her gracefully long neck turned our way dont look at her al exclaimed dont he groaned as the crazy demon smiled and changed her path to us shit he added slumping shes coming over what i said uneasy but seeing two empty places at our table shes the only person i know here besides you al looked at the ceiling as if in pain as newt made her way to us her pace both provocative and flat her motions feminine but her figure androgynous she was wearing a mans business suit and it changed to match mine as she approached well thats an improvement al muttered as he brought his gaze from the ceiling see rachel youre having a positive impact already pasting a smile on his face he stood newt love im so surprised to see you here please join us sit down gally she said turning her cheek so he could give it a perfunctory kiss i know you loathe me down to my mrna my eyebrows rose and i met his gaze glancing to me as he helped her with her chair you seem unusually cognizant tonight he muttered taking the purse that appeared as she handed it to him newt now wearing a blond pageboy cut sniffed its amazing what one remembers given time hand long and thin she gestured for brooke to bring her a drink then focused on me black eyes wide and wondering did you bring me my ruler rachel my mouth opened then shut um i forgot i said sorry newt love al took her hand and gave it a kiss lets not talk business not tonight newt pulled her hand from him with a little tug looking disgusted no lets talk of the future did i not say i could see the future id like to hear of your day rachel mariana morgan my gaze fell and i remained silent she saw the future all right but seeing that i had a pattern of being screwed over it wasnt hard to predict al cleared his throat as if bothered that i was unhappy and newt tried again rachel she said leaning back in her chair with her glass do you enjoy looking like a rungclimbing peon who has to sacrifice the fruits of her ovaries to have status in a mans world no i muttered then go put on something new in the jukebox she said handing me a coin my treat something exotic and old when women were recognized for the goddesses they are als eyes widened in wonder as i took the tarnished gold coin she slid across the table to me it felt slimy almost and i glanced to al for guidance was i being gotten rid of go he encouraged indicating what looked like an accurate representation of a jukebox complete with colored bubbles and s it didnt fit the décor but it still looked as if it belonged there in the corner i stood not appreciating that newts smile was probably because id looked to al for direction my shoes hurt me and i kicked them off leaving them under my chair as i padded across the carpet my head up and not looking at the demons watching me as i gave them a wide birth shes sweet i heard newt say as i left look shes afraid no she isnt al grumbled thats the problem mmmm if she ever has sex with you ill kill you you dont think i know that he muttered so give her to me now and be done with it you cant handle her newt coaxed yes we all saw how well you did with kusox and then i was out of easy hearing range with a whole lot more to think about i came to a halt before the jukebox fingering the greasy coin in speculation id never held a chunk of demon smut given real form before and i was going to buy a song with it everyone in the place was watching me i could feel them taking in my kneelength skirt and the blah nylons my hair in that ugly bun and that i was barefoot thanks to al putting me in toosmall shoesi think they might have fit ceri my back to them all i forced my shoulders down and looked over the titles none of them was remotely familiar not a single barry manilow or rob zombie the titles seemed to be places and dates only a smattering in english cuneiform i mused aloud never having actually seen it in use but thats what that weird writing among the french german and latin had to be immediately i dropped the coin in hearing it clunk through the machine before i pushed the proper button behind me the lights dimmed a wave of conversation rose along with masculine groans from the bar as the modern loud thumping shifted to an ancient set of drums and flutes i wrinkled my nose thinking someones dinner smelled like a barn and when i turned i could do nothing but stare wow most familiars cant handle the shifts now i understood that al hadnt been talking about lengthy hours but shifts of reality the restaurant had changed there were reed mats on the dirt floor and the tables were made of rough wood and were lit by candles and tarnished metal lamps filled with flaming oil and hanging from an overhead shade we were outside and a breeze shifted a strand of hair that had escaped my bun it was night and beyond the glow of a central cooking hearth more stars than id ever seen stretched in a sparkling wash brilliant all the way to the horizon because there were no city lights to dim their glow the wind carrying the scent of salt to me was warm it was incredibly realistic reminding me of dalis seaside office on casual friday the grit of sand was beneath my feet and the reed mats and the muggy air smelling of horse and wet wool was hot one by one the clientele sitting at the roughhewn benches was changing flashes of everafter cascading over them to leave the much skimpier attire of homespun robes and sandals dressed in a business suit i was totally out of place oh for the two worlds colliding dali shouted as he burst from a maroon tent that had once been the kitchen his new black robes flapping who the hell put in mesopotamia you know how hard it is to get lamb to taste good he finished sputtering to a halt when he saw me standing before the jukebox in my nylons and machinemade fabric embarrassed i looked at al seeing that hed changed into sandals his chest and much of his legs bare but for a draping gold cloth regal and confident newt reclined beside him on a cushion with a silver goblet that she distantly toasted me with her hair was in beaded dreadlocks and shed ringed her eyes with a dark pigment al dali said red faced she fits in or you go al grinned and blew me a kiss i shivered as the wind brushed me with his intent and my uptight gray suit melted into a robe of rich golds purples and reds little green rocks had been sewn into the fabric and i felt the new weight of it settle comfortably on my shoulders nice i said my hand jerking up to keep my headdress on when i leaned over to see my new sandals yuck my hair was oiled flat to my head that was going to take forever to wash out but i fit in now and grimacing dali turned and vanished back into the cooking tent his voice raised as he yelled at the staff okay im a mesopotamian princess pulse faster i headed back to the table amid whistles and a few complaints from where the bar had been everyone there was now sitting on the sand around a huge fire pit in the open air instead of a kitchen waitstaff brought wooden bowls and platters from a second cooking fire and apparently lamb wasnt a favorite interesting choice al said dryly as i wove my way past the benches and cushions the upper echelon were seated on and eased onto a smooth tooled chunk of wood newt set her tarnished silver goblet down i rather like mesopotamia she said airily its so easy to distinguish the haves from the havenots smiling she regally motioned for brooke to bring us a plate of cheese and flat unleavened bread and the wannabes no need to be catty newt al replied then nodded at brookewho was now in rags see i told you she was good it takes an unusually skilled familiar to stockpile all the changes needed to run this place on a busy day there might be three shifts an hour three shifts i said now understanding why you didnt bother to order from a menu you got what you got so brooke has to change herself it doesnt just happen al grunted his answer grabbing a handful of bread as brooke set it down newt can you remember the last time you saw mesopotamia i cant remember the last time i was here newt shot back and i smiled nervously not sure if she was kidding or not so all those buttons are different restaurants i asked looking at the jukebox now totally out of place like a british police call box on the deck of the titanic al bobbed his head and downed a glass of red wine they are memories he said looking at newt apart from the last one weve not had a new one for thousands of years newts brow furrowed and she flicked a grape at him i apologized formally for that she muttered it was kusoxs fault kusox i breathed in wondering if al had made this memory as i snatched up something that might be a cracker after a few thousand years of civilization how kusox had anything to do with the lack of new memories at dalliance was beyond me maybe hed broken the machine he certainly had broken my life he and trent stupid elf you can summon me back any time now ivy stay away from kusox rachel al offered as he filled my empty glass from a flaccid wineskin my nose wrinkled no way was i drinking anything that came out of a bag with fur still on it from its previous owner not a problem i said besides last i saw him he was hiding out in reality and what are the chances that hed come back here newt sipped from her silver goblet her fingers playing in the candle flame everyone finds his way home eventually she said and as i watched her eyes changed though she made no move as she reclined in idleness like a goddess on a throne the light behind her black orbs went from complaisant to virulent hatred al noticed too and he motioned for me to shut up you want to kill him newt asked me her mild tone a stark contrast with her hidden anger yes i blurted out then hesitated when i saw her fondling a knife on her hip uh thats two of us then she said interrupting me give me enough time gally and ill have the majority no one likes the little genetic designer dump al said trying not to look at her but it was hard not to but we cant kill him same as we cant kill you love he said to newt clinking his glass to hers genetic material is genetic material al newt pouted as i puzzled over the designerdump comment is that what i am to you genetic material of course not love he said playing with her i want your library too i watched newts mood sour as she stabbed a grape and ate it off the point of her knife i despise the bastard even more than you do rachel though that might change as he takes everything you love you need to be clever to best him are you clever rachel oh god she wants to know if im clever i glanced at al and he stared at me then shrugged licking my lips i said its the shiny pot that puts a hole in the sky als mouth dropped open but newt thought about it her expression thoughtful and her fingers finally leaving her knife very true she said as she eased back into the cushions with a soft click of his teeth als mouth shut his eyes were cross and he seemed peeved that id found a way to satisfy her without compromising myself at all hunching into his drink he muttered dali is headed this way newt i swear if you get me kicked out of here tonight ill never sell you another familiar as long as i live boohoo newt said a wiry arm rising delicately to the demon approaching behind her an invitation to take it i suppose sure enough the robebedecked extravagant civil servant gone tent restaurateur elegantly touched his lips to her fingers before gesturing for more fruit and cheese is everything to your liking dali said only the slightest hesitation hinting at his annoyance with newt being here inside me a feeling of warning coiled tighter there were too many eyes on our table as always dali al answered and the demon frowned at him i was asking newt newt beamed fully aware that she wasnt welcome and relishing the fact that they had to put up with her i can truly say i dont remember a more perfect evening dali as algaliarept says its as wonderful as always a brief flash of teeth and dali turned to me his veneer of pleasantry becoming transparent and you rachel enjoying mesopotamia uuh i stammered not liking being put on the spot crap the demons watching us were pointing now i can honestly say ive never had an evening quite like this dali was hunched a little too close his mood a little too aggressive even for a demon if everyone in the place hadnt been watching us before they were now why is he over here al seemed to be thinking the same thing as he set his cup down and pointedly looked at dali newt too cocked her head clearly waiting its not me of course but others dali said a thread of his eagerness to cause trouble coloring his voice some of the clientele feel that a member of your party is not a demon and therefore should wait outside rachel not a demon al shouted dramatically and i twitched who dares i do exclaimed a strong voice and my head turned to the tattered awning that now marked the entryway to the restaurant shit it was kusox twentyfive frightened i stood amid a smattering of exclamations some were against me but most were protesting kusoxs presence clearly he wasnt much liked but there was far less anger than id expect from a demon they had imprisoned in the next reality over even if the demons at the informal bar fire were enthusiastically exchanging bets the drums had stopped and loud conversation had taken its place i was scared but newt was smiling deviously as she stood my bench upright from where it had been pushed over when id found my feet in the flickering oil light dali took a dramatic step back his sleeves dropping to his elbows when he held his hands up in placation calm down or ill sling all your asses out of here he bellowed and the noise was cut by about half i agree that the question of her status should be settled he smiled cattily at al isnt that why youre here newt toasted me to show her support as dali smiled at me with false benevolence my eyes closed as i finally understood what was going on my standing was in question and needed to be settled before a gathering of my peers if i wasnt a demon i was a familiar and if i was a familiar i was in deep shit and there id been saying i wasnt a demon kusox shoved his way through the camels and bales of cloth until he stood with the roughhewn table between us his steel gray hair was slicked back and he was wearing a masculine reflection of my attire beads clicking he looked me up and down his expression one of disgust not a flicker of concern that id almost burned him alive in margaritaville my pulse raced as i recognized the barely leashed hatred from both al and newt as kusox started in on a harsh harangue aimed at me he wouldnt be tucking me under his arm and popping outunless he thought he could get away with itso i was safe sort of demons were wimps more inclined to take their rivals down with red tape than a physical approach they only beat up people they knew couldnt fight back trent wanted me to curse him why should i risk it i thought as kusox started demeaning als reputation bringing up events that had happened thousands of years ago and still made al red with anger why should i curse kusox to be stuck in the same reality i was in now but then i hesitated tuning out kusox as i thought a little more deeply if i shifted the curse to him as trent thought i could then i wouldnt be stuck here at all id still be shunned in reality but there were ways around that right right regaining my ability to be in reality even in snatches was a small thing but after having imagined living in the everafter without ever seeing the sun jenks or ivy again i fastened on it like a lifeline my foot twitched and newt slid her blackeyed gaze to me nodding at the look of desperate thought i must now be wearing everyone else was focused on kusox raving about purity and halfbreeds polluting the genetic pool my eyes fell from newt to the hardpacked earth and i lightly tapped a line glad my oiled hair wouldnt float and give me away the barest hint of everafter seeped into me not enough to be noticed by anyone but i was sure newt felt it she was jiggling her bejeweled foot black eyes edged in kohl sliding from me to kusox the barest hint of a wicked smile replacing her anger my knees were wobbling and an odd feeling was sifting through me almost a ringing in my ears or soul slowly i searched my theoretical self surprised when i could feel the curse trent had put on me it hadnt been with me very long and the alien greasy feel of the elven aftertaste made it easy to sense like a faint ache even odder was that the curse seemed as if it lay in my chi like shavings of iron all of them aligning themselves to orient on kusox like a flower to the sun it had been created for him like the focus had been created for the weres it wanted to go back to him damn i might be able to do this my shoulders stiffened and i scrambled to remember the words trent had used to tap into the communal collective and set the curse one phrase to transfer it one to sever the bond and prevent it from coming back something about deserving punishment newt was watching me as kusox grandstanded gesturing as he maligned my mother my father and al all in the same breath i gathered the curse together in my chievery last bitand held it in my fist the pressure of it aching and throbbing like i was holding an exploded bomb si peccabas poenam meres that was the invocation phrase i knew it i could do this that is not a demon kusox shouted as if in finale spinning in a flamboyant circle making his purple robe furl and it should be destroyed prove it i shouted lunging the curse glowed like black fire in my hand and i jumped at him right across the table newt grabbed the plate of cheese and yanked it to safety als wineglass wasnt so lucky and the wine spilled like blood over the rough wood the candle flared and i hit the hanging lamp sending flaming oil splattering on the watching demons a cry of alarm went up and the sound of sliding benches and the sudden pulls on ley lines spun through me like threads of glass kusoxs eyes widened and then i had him my hand around his throat as we crashed to the floor si peccabas poenam meres i thought desperately seeing my freedom in kusoxs shocked expression elation filled me as i felt the painful sensation of pinpricks in reverse as the curse left me it was working and i writhed as the curse soaked into kusox while he screamed get her off kusox shouted and someone grabbed the back of my shirt pulling me away get her off me no i howled i wasnt done yet i hadnt fixed it into him facilis descensus tartaros i thought frantically and my eyes widened as i felt the curse stretch between us like a rubber band but with a snap that made newt jump it pulled from kusox even as it had wanted to stay cleaving to me instead id done something wrong it hadnt worked no no no i raged as the rising imbalance ebbed to nothing and the surrounding demons laughed thinking i was simply trying to scratch kusoxs eyes out let me go you idiots id done it wrong id done something wrong or it would have worked and i would have had him al had an arm around my middle physically holding me against him as my feet slipped on the reed mats while i struggled for purchase no fighting in dalliance rachel he crooned and i shoved his hand off me as soon as i got my weight over my feet again you see me i shouted at kusox glad id finally gotten rid of that headdress thing now broken on the floor if you ever touch me again ill lay you out i threatened him almost spitting in frustration they only laughed except for al standing nervously beside me and newt who had felt what i had tried to do dali was at the outskirts knowing something had happened but not what and kusox of course who was sallow faced clearly knowing how close it had been why hadnt it worked slowly kusox regained his pompous air as he shook off the goodnatured offers of assistance but he would meet my eyes only in quick glances equal amounts of caution and loathing in him but id seen him screaming like a little girl and i knew hed been terrified he ought to be afraid id almost had the perv now it would be harder he was warned and id lost my easy chance you dare to call me less of a demon than you i exclaimed pissed as i shook in anger with nothing between us but air im not the one doing the bidding of a lameass elf i said pointing at him you owe your freedom to an elf one that i let go the surrounding jeers and calls from the watching demons rose high and kusox frowned as the helping hands fell away in the distance i heard a fox bark and the puddle of light grew when someone stilled the wildly swinging lamp and relit it with a tweak on a line an elf dali was leaning casually against a support pole kusox you owe your freedom to rachels castoffs it wasnt the angle id been going for but it made kusox angry his eyes squinting as he bent to beat the dust from his robes that thing is a witch he said pointing at me a stunted double x that algaliarept is dressing up like a demon to further his pathetic attempt at familiar procurement pathetic al drawled as he sat down leaving me standing alone youve been gone too long you little zit pus im more of a snag artist than youll ever be and i know talent when i see it rachel may be born from a witch but she is a demon as much as you are a pain in the ass with the social skills of a dog still eating souls kusox thats like eating gods shit you know nothing kusox shouted red faced as the surrounding demons laughed im stronger than all of you i can take this world and destroy it open a hole to reality and drain this world to nothing until youre bumping around in a universe the size of a closet and you all get sucked into oblivion the conversations stilled and dali cleared his throat in the sudden silence kusox stopped the hem of his robe swinging as he dared anyone to comment his chin high and a defiant gleam in his blue goatslitted eyes every demon in the place wore hatred and fear on his shadowed candlelit ruddy face and that of course was why they didnt kill him if they tried and failed he might destroy the everafter laughing all the way to the sunny side of reality and his survival their prodigal son was fucking insane youre not stronger than me newt said into the quiet and kusoxs eyes narrowed arent you dead yet you old hag he grumbled the demons started to whisper and dalis slippers were a soft hush on the reeds as he came forward he was looking at me with speculation and now i knew why is she the one is it her what he meant was am i a demon can i kill kusox testtube brat al said as he stood his empty wineglass upright with a thump dna degenerate magical mistake youre picking on rachel because she might be a better demon than you her kusox exclaimed and al simpered at him im the way back to our rebirth and you will respect that me not her shes born from a witch a stunted damaged witch newt shifted coyly on her cushion the only one who hadnt left her seat throughout the entire scene no poor boy you are a mistake we loved too much to put down i still think you would have turned out fine if dali hadnt dropped you when you were but a blastocyst you are deluding yourselves kusox said frowning i am your rebirth my dames ashes al muttered the poor boy is going to go off now to brood about world domination a few of the demons sliding back to their tables laughed and kusox flushed in anger something is wrong with you my lovely little boy newt continued the silver goblet of wine in her hand as demons drifted away and the tension eased in your head even demons do not eat souls is it because youre worried that you dont have one i have a soul kusox said with a scowl but i wondered of course you do otherwise you wouldnt have an aura newt said brightly come sit with us oh theres a good idea i thought sitting down between al and newt leaving kusox to stand by himself that he said pointing at me again isnt a demon i need proof we all do he looked over the assembled demons there were more people now than there were tables they must have been coming in all this time filling the mesopotamian darkness with soft mutters and speculation it takes more than being able to invoke demon magic to be one kusox said do something demonic this last had been aimed at me and my hands clenched in my lap like rip your heart out come a little closer rachel al said as he reached across the table and patted my shoulder a little too hard god i felt like i was one of two little kids on a playground from her cushion newt cleared her throat rachel should make us a new memory the surrounding demons exhaled the sound rising like a sigh of excitement i turned to her surprised you want me to do what be reasonable newt al protested his face suddenly pale shes only a few hours old i havent had time to teach her anything yet doesnt matter newt said as she ate a grape with an odd precision if shes a demon she can do it al looked deathly worried and i watched dali energetically stride to the jukebox and press his hands to it invoking who knew what as it glowed a hazed black splendid idea he was muttering rachel what do you want to call it call it at a loss i looked around the table seeing worry on als face and satisfaction on kusoxs call what give us a memory newt prompted the beads in her hair clicking only a demon has the mental fortitude to channel enough energy to make a tulpa construct this size one that anyone can share oh my god i looked at the fake restaurant the fire the stars the smells you want me to make something like this i squeaked are you nuts i dont know how to do that she admits shes not a demon kusox proclaimed and als grip on his wineglass became whiteknuckled as he hunched against the raised voices around us lacking a skill doesnt translate into a lack of ability he growled but the demons were rearranging the tables making an open space of sorts wanting me to try newts eyes narrowed only a demoness can make a freeexisting tulpa and only a male demon can fix it into reality i say its a fair test al put your money where your mouth is or should i say where your student is i looked wildly from one end of the midnight mesopotamia to the other despairing as i realized why newt had apologized she had killed everyone who could do thisexcept herself i could not make this it was immense of course you can newt said as she leaned toward me almost as if having read my mind making a construct is easy every one in that box there was made by my sisters and they werent nearly as clever as you newt raised her goblet in salute thats why i could kill them you see my heart pounded and i sat down before i passed out uh maybe i shouldnt do it then kusox laughed but newt poured her wine into my glass thats not why i killed them but thats why kusox tricked me into it to make a lasting tulpa one that can be stored and lived in one must have the ability to safely hold more than ones own soul demons cant do it a demoness can its on that little extra bit of x gene that they dont have i listened to crickets that had turned to dust thousands of years ago on a continent id never set foot on youre able to hold a soul so you can gestate a baby i guessed and she nodded solemn kusox is a fool but hes right you need to prove yourself and now is as good a time as any i will not have your standing in doubt dont you agree al she added lightly al looked sick shes rather stupid yet i am not i exclaimed and he pointed at me there see she is newt waved a hand at dali still standing by the jukebox even a dunce can have a baby all it needs is stamina and a little imagination rachel i am not stupid i said again shut up al hissed as kusox gleefully ate someone elses cheese you dont know what youre doing so teach me i hissed right back thanks to you i cant be a witch anymore i may as well be a demon my heart was pounding god what was i doing i only knew that i had to be somewhere and right now this was it al stared at me hope dying in his eyes i cant teach you this i can newt said and my breath came fast crap on toast i will she added and i swallowed hard i will teach you you will make one and al will fix it to reality i dont have the balls to do that part literally no one was even whispering all eyes were on me the tables full of demons in robes and a small crowd bunched outside trying to listen in i hadnt counted on this i mean al i sort of trusted at least i trusted that he needed me alive and reasonably well but newt she looked sane and that was worrisome come here she prompted you want to do this yes not really taking a slow breath i stood feeling weird in these clothes with the green rocks sewn into them they clinked as i came around the table kusox moving in agitation as he stood looking young next to dalis tired jadedness als hands were in fists on the table a bead of sweat trickled down his neck sit before me rachel newt prompted her voice oily and i wondered if this was how shed killed her sisters lulling them she shifted on her cushion to sit crosslegged pointing for me to take the tiny bit of padding right in front of her back to me better and better my gut was so tight i thought i was going to vomit and my arms felt like sticks everyone was watching as i gingerly sat pebbles clinking as i tugged a bit of cloth to cover my bare legs thats a love she murmured and i jumped when she touched my hair someone laughed and i whipped my head around to see who it had been but newt was there rubbing my forehead from behind trying to be soothing but only making it worse shes not even going to be able to make a picture on the wall kusox predicted al stood nervous shut up kusox or ill close your throat for you kusox grinned pointing to the camels groaning at the outskirts would you like to step outside old man i beat your sorry ass before and i can do it again kusox shut up i said not liking anyone talking to al that way then wondered where my loyalty had come from but a thread of fear was in als motions so subtle that i didnt know if anyone but perhaps newt and dali had noticed he has a right to be afraid newt said leaning forward to whisper in my ear and i shivered hardly breathing if you cant do this then you will be a familiar and i will buy you from al but i think you can no pressure i grumbled and her fingers touching my forehead lifted briefly as she laughed it sounded weird her laugh and i saw more than a few demons grimace close your eyes tap a line and find the collective newt said gently i took a last look at the faces ringing me al with his false confidence dali busy calculating the odds the expressions of hope and doubt on demons id never met i didnt know why they cared one way or the other maybe they had a bet going maybe they were bored i said newt prompted mildly ticked close your eyes i closed them immediately feeling claustrophobic i tapped a line wondering what demon had made it and if he was watching me or dead and turned to dust i settled myself plunging into the thick morass of collective thoughts reeling when i found no one there well almost no one i kicked them out newt thought and i gasped almost flinging myself out again but she grabbed my consciousness with a soft thought and hauled me back you dont want them here seeing your soul she explained and i got the impression of her swimming naked in a sea of stars enjoying the solitude of a moment alone in her infinity my soul i mused alarmed but she only seemed to twine her consciousness around mine keeping us separate but close rubbing her energies across me old and jumbled like a west coast ley line you dont want the entire collective to see you helpless and vulnerable she explained giving me the impression of halflidded eyes and a sultry whisper having gally see you as such will be punishment enough for almost killing him i imagine whoa al i thought worried and she swam closer making me nervous as i remembered him pinning me to the bookcase and spilling leyline energy into me and then me slamming his theoretical dick in a drawer why him al she reiterated seeming bothered shed forgotten his name again you want dali to peel the memory from your thoughts instead hes likely more skilled at it and its often easier for strangers to see us naked thanjust what is gally to you anyway i shook my head or at least i would have if i had one i dont know well when youre done bring gally in to separate your construct from your conscious thought let him in rachel ignore the fact that he will see everything moment by moment every little desire and hate you have your soul sifting through his fingers as he pulls the construct free what he doesnt see might be left here so let him entirely in she thought and i had a moment of perfect panic its rather more intimate than pinning you to the wall for a kiss she mocked i didnt like this but what choice did i have it wasnt as if al hadnt been in my thoughts before wait i dont know what to do i thought as i felt her start to distance herself newts consciousness swooped and dipped about mine making me dizzy creating a collective thought real enough to touch is to prove you have the ability to shelter another soul within yours without absorbing it or accidentally changing what should not be changed i felt a wave of melancholy come from her dimming the stars do you know why demons are born able to twist curses their mothers curse them while still in the womb so they can defend themselves from birth but it takes finesse to lay a curse within anothers soul while youre sheltering it within your own making a tulpa and allowing another to exist freely in it is the same its also why algaliarept cant remember what he looks like under all that prettiness he shows the world he cant pick out what is rightfully his and what his mother added beautiful beautiful baby i never had any but if i had id have made her look just like you it was starting to make sense making a construct would show i was fit to be a mothera mother to demon children i would never have sowhat do i do i asked wondering if the demon who had helped newt make that memory of an upscale bar was still alive or if shed killed him maybe it had been minias newt swam in circles around me sending out ripples to the edge of the empty collective i do so like it when no one is here quiet newt i prompted and she returned remember a place make it real in your mind fill the void here and al will separate it from you and make it real thats their part all you have to do is let him in i had to trust him damn it how did i get here just think of a place in my mind it was as if i could see her bobbing in the water before me silver stars running down her face like water drops what do you miss the most now that youre here forever what do i miss i echoed thinking immediately of jenks ivy and my church but sharing that with the demons wasnt going to happen my garden in the sun the sun i would never see again heartache seemed to double me over the sun i was going to miss the sun that was what i could show them not the sun in my garden but somewhere else where the sun ruled everything not just now but for all the past and all the future i would give the demons a forest so old and dead that only stones remained id give them that and nothing more with a ping that hurt my soul i felt the memory of the desert rise in me carrying all the lonely empty desperation id felt when i thought id lost jenks i hunched my eyes pinched tightly shut as my heart ached resonating with the reality that id lost everything empty everything was empty and the echo of space washed through my skull heat soaked into me like an internal blanket first frightening then soothing the hint of the abandoned ley lines in the desert seemed to glow dead and gone and useless from the inside of my eyelids came a reflection of them etching through the collective like girders bracketing time and from there everything built upon itself the entire desert melting back into existence the chirp of insects the soft click of a beetle the wind pushing against me oily and slippery not recognizing me as i stood in the middle of a lost field of power and begged for a miracle the memory resonated in me pulsing from me like a wave it cascaded over my mental landscape coloring everything making it deeper solid real i had been helpless then and i was helpless now and i held back a sob refusing to cry the scent of rock rose strong ancient air that dinosaurs breathed finally loosed by a rockslideonce frozen by chance but now free to move again i felt the immensity of my loneliness and it hurt open your eyes little demon newt whispered in my thoughts i opened my eyes blinking at the glare oh my god i said my lips drying out in the sun that existed in my thoughts i was in the desert almost high noon i was wearing dusty sneakers and a shortsleeved shirt clung to me from a sweat that barely existed before the dry air stripped it from me grit ground under my feet as i turned taking it in hearing the emptiness feeling the space i knew it wasnt real but it felt real i stood on a paved road my shadow small under me behind me was my mothers car before me spilled the world so vast that my eyes defined the edges with their very failure to comprehend the sun was high savagely baking the pinks purples and oranges out of the rock the ground fell from my feet like a mountain turned inside out a wind i knew existed only in my thoughts pushed on me with the affronted force of a god being asked to stop and i had made this shocked i turned to newt beside me she was dressed in tight capri jeans and a brightly colored top dark sunglasses hid her eyes and a ribbon of moisture ran beside her nose a silk scarf covering her hair made her look like a fifties movie star out on location i think she had dressed me because i certainly hadnt is it real i asked is it done the sky was so blue i might never see it again but i had it herein my memory she smiled her lips too red and an overabundance of blush on her cheeks let al in only al this needs to be remembered they all need to remember this i had no idea what she meant but i thought of al a quiver went through me and the world seemed to hiccup in a cascading wash he spilled into my mind as if he had been there waiting and when i opened the door he fell in he stood beside me in his mesopotamia robes his mouth open and his pupils so small his eyes were like pools of blood shock poured from him as he saw what i had doneand fear but if it was because of what i had done or because now he had to peel it out of my brain i didnt know my god he whispered taking it in she even has the old ley lines al i warbled scared and it was as if he caught my soul as he grabbed my shoulder when my knees gave out he hoisted me into his arms trying to see my construct and search my eyes at the same time take it al newt said softly before she loses consciousness al took a frightened breath his eyes fixing on mine it hurt almost and i wanted it out of me let me in he said seeing the pain in me and i closed my eyes unable to refuse i started to cry as he took my soul and lifted me out of the collective leaving only the memory of the afternoon at the petrified forest carefully he peeled back bits and pieces of the construct freeing little parts i hadnt known were attached to it the shape of a rock that id seen before on the beach the color that was akin to a sunset when i was ten the caw of a rook that sent shivers down my spineid heard it before at camp al carefully drew the associated memories back taking my soul from the construct to leave something that could be made real slowly the pain lifted as i was made whole and still he looked making sure nothing was left i think al whispered i think i got all of her ive not done this before oh god i hope i got all of her i felt him turn newt the word to fix it and then his voice cracked memoranda he croaked out and i felt a ping through me as the thought severed completely things that must be remembered i translated silently waiting for the rising crest of imbalance but nothing came and then though my eyes were shut i knew that every single demon who had been in dalliance was with us i hadnt brought them in al had moved my memory to them it was fixed it was real as one the demons cowered crying out as the cool night of mesopotamia vanished and was replaced in a blink with the hot reality of the arizona desert in june my god i heard one say but most were silent with awe dali al shouted his thickfingered hand cupping my head as he held me to him did it take did i do it right were here arent we the older demon called back and i blearily looked seeing the jukebox standing beside the memory of my mothers blue buick the trunk was open and there was a picnic basket inside i hadnt thought of the basket someone else had id made something that the demons could twist to their own reality id done it a picnic newt said snapping a redandwhitecheckered blanket out right there on the side of the road what a splendid idea dali you must remember to give rachel royalties every time someone uses this seeing that shes still alive ill be watching your books us demonesses must stick together demoness id done it i was a demon yay me my head fell onto als chest and i whimpered my hands balled up as i tried to keep my eyes open at the outskirts of my vision i could see the demons standing on the edge of the dropoff throwing rocks to see how far the illusion went fists on his hips dali stood between me and newt gazing at clouds that somehow never seemed to cover the sun newt had sat upon the blanket with a bucket of fried chicken and a wineglass al jiggled me up into a more comfortable posture shes not well im taking her home anyone still think shes not a demon im fine i slurred clearly not no kusox shouted and my pulse hiccupped it was newt newt made it my eyes opened then squinted screw you im a demon deal with it oh god im a demon dont be tiresome newt said coyly i dont remember the sun or colorslike this she had cried the tears were gone now but she had cried when wed been alone i think she did remember and it made her crazy was i going to go crazy too al i warbled feeling it all come down on me i dont feel so good immediately he held me closer his warmth doing nothing to stop my shaking take her home newt said having left her blanket to shade me with her own body her construct stretches the entire breadth of the collective its only hampered now by the size of dalliance she filled the entire collective dali breathed the whole thing you could walk for most of a day and not run into the wall id suggest we make this our new wallpaper even as bright as it is at least we could all fit in it al i whispered feeling the world start to spin shit i couldnt go back this was for real i was going to spend the rest of my life here under the ground away from the sun every day exactly the same surrounded by beings who had lived too long trapped in their own hell if i turned around fast would there be barren wall behind me i was passing out i felt it happen as if in slow motion parts of my brain turning off the horizon growing dark and noises becoming dull there were congratulations to al even as he struggled to put space enough between us and them to jump out kusox raged until someone shoved him in the trunk the last thing i remembered was someone dali i think kissing the top of my hand as i slumped in als arms welcome home rachel mariana morgan he said his goatslitted eyes holding a new dangerous light its a pleasure to finally meet you twentysix the dry hush of sliding coals woke me and i jerked clutching to me a black blanket smelling of brimstone i didnt sit up since i was warm and comfortable a hazy lassitude still heavy on me as i lay against the gently curving bench surrounding the central fire in als kitchen id fallen asleep here before but this felt different a dim light glowed on a new honeycolored slate table set before the smaller hearth al sat before it his back to me as he chanted at least i thought it was al it didnt look like him but it didnt look like pierce either al had been in my head hed made my thoughts real hed seen me down to my soul and id seen nothing of hisand heshumming the masculine figure was taller than al by quite a bit but narrower lacking the wide shoulders that i was familiar with short red hair pretty much covered him in a curly pelt where it showed past a lightweight black shirt and trousers muscles were well defined with a long strength rather than heavy bulk a shiny ebony hardness just above his ears might have been horns and by god i think he had that same prehensile tail id seen before when hed threatened treble al i croaked putting a hand to my throat when the sound came out rusty the gravelly chantlike words cut off and he spun a leyline doodad clattering until it fell off the table and he caught it with a longfingered doublejointed hand a wash of black everafter coated him falling away to reveal the more familiar vision of al though he still wore that pair of casual jammies and had a surprised look in his red goatslitted eyes the mirror hed been looking into he slammed to the table facedown covering up the pentagram and glyphs he had scribed on the new slate table youre awake he said and i cowered when his voice seemed to boom inside my head yeah i gasped hands over my ears i cracked an eyelid seeing him muttering another curse and a new wash of everafter falling from him what is he doing in here while im sleeping i dont feel so good i said as i sat up what are you doing in here trying to remember what i look like he muttered his skin turning red from embarrassment not a curse or a charm he touched the mirror and it vanished grimacing i looked over the candlelit room missing the sun already i felt like id been working out all day and gone to bed cold it had to have been from making that construct i hadnt taken the smut for it and i wondered who had al you said i reset your dna cant you justplug and play i asked plug and play al drawled his wide back to me as he put the leyline stuff in a tall cupboard and locked the door with a key not a spell that could be tampered with such a way with words you have yes my dna has been reset but not all the genes a person has are expressed i have to decide which ones to turn on like the one with curly red hair oh i said simply slumping where i sat jeez i was tired and i stretched my legs out from under the black blanket feeling everything ache i was still wearing the shortsleeved shirt and jeans newt had put me in at the edge of the desert but at least al had taken my sneakers offand only my sneakers i was silent thinking about that curly red fur he had been covered with and the tail i kinda like you the way you are right now i said feeling my muscles ache as i swung my feet to the floor and touched my toes to the cold floor wheres pierce i dont know my next words vanished in surprise he didnt know the way he said it was more like he didnt care it wasnt like al to let profit slip from him and i wondered what was up shifting my aching shoulders i mumbled i dont like you in here when im sleeping it gives me the creeps yes well it was easier for me to work quietly here than to move you to my room he stood a handful of leyline charms in his thick hands now that youre awake youll be moving in there my arms ached and i rubbed them then i stopped moving in there whoa whoa whoa i said waking up fast okay i let you in my head and everything but that doesnt translate into me moving into your bed i stood wobbling and suddenly he was there holding my elbow let go i yelled yanking out of his grip and falling back into the soft warmth of the blanket my heart pounded and i felt weak surprising me i may be a demon i exclaimed feeling my eyes start to warm as it all sank in but im not your girlfriend wife or anything anything i shouted shaking as i drew my feet up and held my shins to me im not sharing your room your bed or your life i can sleep just fine right here rachel rachel rachel he said very still and unmoving always jumping to the wrong conclusion youre like a frog you know looking nothing like himself al retreated to the smaller hearth slowly my knees dropped from my chin leaving me embarrassed sheesh id huddled up like a scared little girl wrong conclusion i said bitterly whats not to understand move into your room sounds plain enough to me al spun his chair at the table to face me his back to the smaller hearth he sat looking disheveled and rumpled until he made an effort to sit up straight you cant continue to sleep in the kitchen he said looking discomfited before you yell at me again he said as i took a breath ill sleep in the library you get the bedroom my held breath exploded out of me huh al sent his gaze over the shadowy workroom its not safe for you here too many things might get out his goatslitted eyes met mine and i shivered my skin prickling as i remembered the tapestry that seemed to move on its own and had bled and cried or the bottle of soul that had almost taken me over just sitting on a shelf waiting to fall over and break or in he added with a little shoulder lift his eyes on the ceiling and i held my blanket closer my thoughts going to the dark spot on his pantry floor that seemed to pull at me every time i went down there aloneand only alone you dont have enough smut on your soul to hide you and youre like a light attracting things like moths als eyes dropped from the ceiling chilling me no ugly things in the dark attracted to power and im not just talking about my associates it didnt matter before but al winced i knew you were special rachel and dont take this as me going soft or sentimental you didnt think i could do it my heart was pounding and i felt sick i was a demon crap on toast i was a demon and there was no going back stuff had been turned on in my head and it couldnt be turned off head lowered al looked at his bare hands folded in his lap i knew you could otherwise i wouldnt have let you get into that position but now everyone else knows it too i wasnt expecting how vulnerable you would be and word gets around it is too easy for he hesitated youre so damn helpless he tried again his words cutting off once more how am i supposed to keep them off you now that they know my stomach cramped and i felt my expression go blank other demons i had gone from a curiosity to a real demon they might want to take by stealth what they couldnt buy now that i was one of them and not just a maybe and al didnt know if he could prevent it never mind he growled seeing my fear the bedroom has safeguards that you cant get here al i questioned and he stood showing me his back as he faced the fire ill stay in the library he said and i shifted uncomfortably i would have moved you to my room immediately but i didnt want you waking up in a strange place he turned his eyebrows raised in familiar mocking amusement jumping to conclusions yelling at me breaking my things i shivered pulling my knees to my chin again and not caring if it made me look scared i was vulnerable hed called me vulnerable i had proved myself stronger and therefore somehow become weaker you were in my head i whispered remembering how it had hurtmy soul stretched over the entire collective until he lifted me from it you separated the tulpa from my thoughts thank you he was back at the table before the fireplace wiping out both the circle and the laundry list in latin beside it with a red cloth youre welcome his reponse was guarded and my tension rose you saw my thoughts more than usual yes scrubbing still scrubbing i couldnt see yours smiling he turned his eyes looking almost normal in the dim light his teeth glinted thats the nature of it yes uneasy i counted the dirty dishes scattered around making it look like a frat boys dorm it appeared as if hed been here for days maybe hed been hungry i knew i was what did you see i asked nervous the rag hed used to clean the table went into the fire behind him i saw what you are he said and i was ashamed i saw what you expect from a person and id call you a bitch except you demand it from yourself as well i saw how you see me he explained it wasnt anything i didnt already know but it made me wonder at what i lack what isnt there al i interrupted remembering that forced kiss and how it had felt but al was shaking his head looking ill i am not going to be the person who completes you he said glancing at me and turning away you are one messedup bitch gee thanks i muttered as i held my cold toes glad that he wasnt going to try to change our relationship now that i was stuck here als expression shifted became ugly angry with himself i saw what we had become soft ineffective laughable he said his hand forming a fist you still scare the hell out of me i interrupted accepting our exile and making it comfortable instead of finding a way to go home we are a joke oh that i rubbed my feet trying to warm them sorry al shook out a silver scarf that hadnt been there a moment ago and turned back to the table running it lightly over the new slate as if erasing any electronic charge left behind i dont need your pity no you need a good psychiatrist my eyes went to his feet as they scuffed slippers wheres kusox i asked wishing i could wake up again and start over having swum in my soul might have given al the feeling that he could be casual with me but it made me nervous i had no idea what he was going to do next his shoulders moving slow and steady al wiped down the table again until even the last hints of what hed written were gone dont worry about kusox you proved yourself becoming still he looked at me the candle and firelight making his eyes glow you have a place here perhaps but i didnt want it i had things to do i had to ask trent what id done wrong with that curse then i had to find kusox to give it to him so i could at least go home without being summoned home what time is it i asked depressed seeming to appreciate the change of conversation as much as me al squinted at the clock on the mantel the lights getting brighter noon great id been out for hours ivy and jenks were probably worried sick maybe come sundown they could summon me back for a couple of hours and we could strategize until the sun came up i had to get out of here for a while al was scaring me i flung the covers off then hesitated putting a hand to my middle when i wasnt sure i could stand up yet damn i was dizzy i passed out i said needlessly and al sat back down in his chair to stare at me one hand on the clean table the other in his lap rachel you made a construct large enough to land a jet in yes you passed out i licked my lips uneasy thank you for taking the smut he frowned almost growling i didnt take the smut newt did and id give a lot to know why newt had taken it was that good or bad i think it was because she wanted to be a part of it i said remembering that she had cried newt al barked shifting in his chair appearing nervous i doubt that she wanted to be part of that she doesnt like making constructs anymore she doesnt trust anyone to watch her while she recovers that and she doesnt want anyone in her head al touched his chin a nervous tic id never seen before how do you feel how do i feel i feel like crap hand to my middle i tried to stand again changing my mind and huddling under the blanket instead with my back to the large fire had that nervous tic been real when hed asked me how i felt or was that statement about not wanting me for a girlfriend bull and he was trying to seduce me he knew everything what turned me on what turned me off what lowered my defenses what made me vulnerable it was enough to make someone crazy hungry i finally said i cant believe i was out for half a day half a day al drawled try the better part of three what this time i managed to get up wobbling until al stood and steadied me his grip a shade too tight on my elbow three days i couldnt have been unconscious for three days crap on toast id missed my brothers wedding slow he said as i sat back down to get his hand off me newt said you might be dizzy for a while thats why i didnt leave can you tap a line yet yet head between my knees i concentrated on breathing i carefully reached for a line just enough to know i could then pulled back i was starting to see the sense in this females thought up the construct and a male lifted it from his friends psyche and protected her until she recoveredand i say friend because no way was i als lover but three days jenks and ivy would be sick with worry newt was here i was able to sense the mild disturbance in the energy surrounding al that she always left the demon with i heard the creak of his chair as he sat back down after you didnt wake up the first day yes i asked her a few questions can you tap a line i looked up at the worry in his voice feeling something shift yes thank you for watching me i had to force her to leave he said eyes everywhere but on mine she said i couldnt care for you bitch i made sure you ate ran a brushandwash curse on you when you crapped yourself waited kept everything out until your aura recovered my aura al i said really scared as i firmly tapped the line to find no headache no pain i was okay youre kidding right his wandering eyes settled on me youd rather i let you sit in your crap for three days no i meantuh thank you justthank you holy fairy farts i hadnt know making a construct would be so farreaching standing al pushed his chair back damn lazy of you i could tell he was relieved as he stacked the plates and cups sending them to the food kitchen all at once hed been watching me for three days al thank you i really mean it turning he took a breath to say something sneezing instead bless you i said and he held up a hand in annoyance as he reached for his scrying mirror tucked in among his books holding it out he grimaced its for you my eyebrows rose and i stifled a shiver as the heavy cold glass slipped onto my lap how do you know because you touched a line and they were waiting he said youre going to have to make a new calling glyph im not your bloody secretary what are you then al it wasnt like the coven gave me time to get my luggage before they banished me i said not wanting to put my hand on the more complex glyph that al used the lines practically glowed red and the glass was so dark i couldnt see any reflection at all so i buy you a looking glass and you make a new one he said and i smiled glad to be back on familiar ground answer it will you he prompted annoyed by my good humor still smiling i pulled my legs up to painfully sit crosslegged resettling the heavy thing on my lap couldnt make it any bigger could you the boy with the biggest toy wins love he leered and i looked down my hand was already placed and i tentatively reached for a line carefully tapping it until i was sure my head wouldnt explode the line slipped in with a gentle smoothness and i found the collective with ease at least my aura was okay i hadnt even known id damaged it hello i ventured als line rachel boomed a thought in my head and i cringed so glad i caught you and that youre feeling well love i glanced at al pretending to mess with the fire yeaaaaah i hazarded dont call me love i have a name by the way i dont know yours absolutely absolutely the demon fawned this is strontanchaark two as and an rk you may not have noticed but i was at dalliance last week red featherssilver headdress sorry dont remember you i thought wondering if he was after a date not going to happen no way no how my call name is tron he added and i sighed look tron i said aloud so al could hear some of it and maybe stop pretending to mess with the fire im kind of busy right now just woke up things to do you know completely understandable he gushed focusing hard to keep me from breaking the connection but if you could wedge in a little time for me this week i could make it worth your while do you think you could make me a replica of rynn cormels pool i blinked trying to switch gears he didnt want a date he wanted a contractor it made sense they all had the same stuff theyd had for thousands of years apart from what newt could give them and three days ago id made a brandnew desert for them to play in rynn cormel i stammered when tron poked my thoughts to see if i was still there youre kidding right he doesnt even have a pool he does its in washington tron insisted in the sun the construct has to be in the sun feeling panicked i waved for als attention and he turned to me a soft secretive smile on his face uh ive never been to the white house i stammered and what was this about the sun didnt they know id been cursed so get over there and look at it my eyes pinched i didnt like his attitude its not that easy i offered not wanting to get the reputation of being a bitch on my first conscious day but you can do it tron insisted then hesitated how much his thoughts were flat and i felt a quiver of excitement a demon was asking me what i wanted my eyes flicked to al and he shrugged what do you want he said softly his voice making me shiver home was probably out the next best thing would be a place of my own so i wasnt sleeping in als bedroom i shifted on the cushioned bench before the central fire making sure my hand didnt slip there was no way i was ever going to see the white house pool in the sun but maybe we could work something out how many extra rooms do you have rooms tron yelped and i winced putrid ash mother corn shucker you want rooms as in plural somehow his reaction emboldened me and i gathered my courage even as al blinked at me in astonishment you dont think im going to just give you the sun do you out of the goodness of my little demon heart you want a fullblown tulpa with accurate artifacts and the sun im going to have to get to reality and sneak into the white house estate in the daytime evade fib and is agents both robbery highway robbery tron was wailing into my thoughts supply and demand buddy i said preparing to break the connection come on back when youre serious no wait i heard him think how about the car the one in the desert i can give you a gently used familiar well broken in and skilled if you can duplicate that car for me you want my moms car i thought then pulled my thoughts back to myself i live with al i said glancing at him if i want a familiar i go to the professional and get one i dont take someones castoff you want an buick with leather seats and a tape player i want a place to sleep call me back when you can give me a room unfurnished if you dont mind i dont like other peoples junk wait he called again and i grinned at al stifling my excitement lest tron pick up on it if you can make it red and promise me an exclusive i can cut out a closet for you a closet i exclaimed and i felt tron wince you think my mothers car is worth a lousy closet a large walkin tron added thirty by fifteen by fifteen up i can get the toys out of it but the mess on the walls youre going to have to deal with i want an exclusive though you dont make a car for anyone else no exclusive i said aloud watching al for his opinion and seeing him shake his head and hold his hands out in a bigger gesture he didnt even know how large the offer was and he thought i could get one bigger dude if you want an exclusive i want something twice as big as a lousy thirty by fifteen by fifteen and the exclusive is only on that model tron groaned and i added and i want it attached to als rooms okay okay the demon said and i got the feeling that he was agreeing before i added anything else its a deal done i said and al sprang to his feet and almost ran down the narrow stone steps to the cellar below i can work you in before the end of the week i said loudly so al could still hear me im a little tired right now call back in about an hour al came back upstairs with a bottle and twin goblets in his hands ah make that two hours i amended you can imagine that al has me scheduled tightly with his tutorial i said and al guffawed actually why dont you arrange the time with him for us to come over and put your car exactly where you want it soon as the room shows up and al tells me its safe for storing my shoes in al tron thought sounding disappointed i thought id fix the tulpa you i said feeling a stab of alarm having forgotten that little part id wanted al there as a buffer but this was spiraling into something more complicated no als fixing it into reality er the everafter not you i felt tron sigh making me wonder if half the reason hed asked me to come over was for a chance to swim in my unconscious not happening buddy al was opening the bottle with a soft pop smiling i couldnt meet his eyes who knew what id find there ill have the room deeded to you in an hour tron thought somewhat disappointedly and i broke the connection the white house pool i said with a snort carefully setting als mirror to the side is he nuts he was going to be in my head again but it would be worth it right at least al wouldnt be sleeping in the library i was embarrassed that id lost my ability to leave unless ivy or jenks summoned me seeing as they knew my summoning name but al didnt seem upset actually he was in a grand mood as he handed me a tarnished silver goblet in the shape of a champagne flute and you doubt youre one of us he said softly pride and more than a hint of relief in his voice well done rachel we clinked and i took a swallow the unexpected honeyamber liquid flowing feeling like heaven wow i said when i came up for air i bet rynn cormel could get me the white house extended tour it wasnt wine but it was potent and warmth tingled all the way to my toes i had a room of my own and a valuable service that no other demon besides newt could provide i was going to be okay i sobered at that i was going to be okay just what did that meani was going to be okay was i going to be happy and why wasnt i trying to get out of here al grunted seeming to know why my excitement had left me i started getting the calls yesterday when they figured out your scrying mirror was in reality he said i had to put up a shes out post but you saw how long it took for the calls to resume when you tapped a line they were waiting for you seems like you have a lucrative place here after all with your help i stared at the small hearth fire visible under the new slate table and remembered waking up and finding al sitting there looking likesomething else im making a car for him i mused aloud and im getting a room out of it you wont have to sleep in the library al hesitated in his motion to top off my glass youre giving the room to me he asked as the liquid poured in and settled my eyes jerked to his at the hint of a question in his voice actually i said slowly i thought maybe i could have it so you could keep your room he took a breath holding it for a moment before slowly letting it out hand shaking slightly he set the amber bottle down between us you will be in my room the safeguards are chiseled into the stone but i would appreciate the chance to update my own décor he took a sip rocking on his feet i thought you would get that mark removed my gaze darted to my last remaining demon mark the one on my wrist that had started our association uh i forgot i stammered embarrassed somehow i sipped my drink not knowing what it was but enjoying the mild buzz that was hitting me al i said my tongue markedly looser you just tell me what you want and ill make it for you i owe you big he looked at me emotions hidden behind his silence for so long i wondered if id said something wrong the fire snapped in the center pit behind me and when i shivered al absently tossed a chunk of polished wood on it probably gleaned from a broken building at the surface somewhere um al i questioned feeling more than a little uncomfortable the honey and amber filling my head with a shiny clarity i do appreciate you saving my ass if theres something i can do to show you that youll tell me wont you he turned to me still no expression on his face im reasonably sure i had brown hair oh god i think id insulted him al finally a shimmer of emotion crossed him drink he said as he tapped my glass with his its a day to celebrate you have come home i didnt know about the home part but i lifted my glass a sneeze ripping through me as unexpectedly as a slamming door my fingers shook and a splat of liquid spotted als pretty black floor horrified i met als demonslitted red eyes his first reaction of annoyance shifting to dread as he stared at me in what might be pity i was sneezing not him and it didnt feel like an incoming call it felt like a summons and it was noon ivy jenks rachel al asked as the first gutwrenching pain blossomed and i pushed the glass back into his hand its a summons i muttered jaw clenched and the good feeling from whatever id been drinking dying but its noon the demon exclaimed gaze going to the clock to affirm it ow i hunched in on myself as the pull grew stronger maybe trent only cursed me to need a summons to be able to cross apparently i can still walkin the sun ow i looked up wincing i gotta go day or night trent had said day or night tron would be pleased i could give him the white house pool in the sun after all i gasped as al suddenly had my shirt front yanking me up who knows he snarled who knows you can be summoned in the day al youre hurting me its probably just ivy or my mom his grip loosened but he didnt let go i asked you who knows your curse allows you to be summoned during day hours he demanded and i pushed his hand off me feeling the pain of an ignored summons everyone who was in the auditorium when trent cursed me i said jeez louise i think you bruised me als eyes narrowed trenton he growled thick hands clenching if im lucky i said wondering if trent even knew my summoning name probably i need to talk to him and get the latin for sliding kusoxs curse back onto him so i can walk free again i did it wrong the last time i could almost see als understanding hit him when his expression went blank you tried to slide his original curse back onto him al said in wonder at the restaurant and i stopped you sweet mother pus bucket he exclaimed and i swear dust sifted from the ceiling rachel we have to work on this communication thing hand around my middle i bent almost double i gotta go i panted trent knows the curse i have to talk to him if im lucky its him again al touched me but this time his hand was gentle on my shoulder and if youre not its kusox he knows youre too protected here and youre a threat to him hes summoning you hes summoning you to where i cant follow hes going to try to kill you i panted feeling my muscles shake as the pull worsened god i felt like i was being split in two cant be him he doesnt know my name trent does al said his grip on me tightening into pain for an instant i told you to take that elf firmly in hand trent let kusox out theyre working together they want you dead holding my breath i managed to look up feeling a wash of betrayal it couldnt be trent id just gotten the latin wrong right i gotta go i wheezed this is shitty you know how do you live like this rachel he cried but it was too late and i let go of my hold on the world the pain subsided and the comforting gray of als kitchen vanished as i found myself yanked into the ley lines fear hope and anticipation rose high if it was kusox he was in for a nasty surprise i was a selfproclaimed demon and i should start acting like it but even as i thought it my throat closed and i felt a pang of homesickness ivy jenks what would i tell them pierce how could i explain what had happened trenthow would i kill him if he had betrayed me okay so it might not be all bad twentyseven the discordant jangle of san franciscos broken ley lines flooded my mind and i watched as they all cycled down to one foremost in my thoughts i tried to listen to it without looking past the bubble of awareness that i was cocooned in but without bis to safely bring the sound in past my bubble they all tasted the same i shivered as my lungs formed and the memory of my body rose giving my soul something to reside in with a pop of sound i found myself almost exactly where id been not three days ago in the dead center of the stage where id been cursed the lights were off and it was dark but for the hiss of a kerosene lantern making a puddle of light on the stage the circle imprisoning me took up most of it darkness made the huge room a cavern of black echoes from the drone of a generator in the distance acrid and sharp the smell of broken cement tweaked my nose something had happened the power was out you see pierce said and i spun to see him standing between oliver and vivian there was a fourth witch in coven robes huddled on the floor behind them if she was a true demon she could not be summoned in the day let your claims go oliver pierce i thought then anger slid through me theyd circled me like the demon that i was sucking on my teeth i looked at the three witches standing in a row staring at me the fourth completely out of it and shaking behind them i wished it had been ivy or jenksor even trent hi pierce i said dryly this your idea i added pinging the barrier with a finger and drawing back before it could burn me how they knew my summoning name my real summoning name not als borrowed one was a mystery until i remembered that pierce had probably been haunting me when i chose the stupid thing great im a demon for less than a week and already im fielding calls expression pained and a little lost pierce strode forward his fulllength coat coated with dust his hair was mussed and his motions were quick my flash of anger died tired i was tired for one brief moment in trents hotel i had entertained the idea that even with our differences we might make a go of it he loved me i could love him if i let myself be stupid but i couldnt even pretend anymore that circumstances might change someday he was coven and i was a demon what was wrong with me why was i attracted to the very things that could hurt me let her out oliver pierce said squinting in anger at the stoic man holding the bubble and my heart clenched in regret shes not a demon yes i am oliver crossed his arms over his chest the dim light catching the möbiusstrip pin on his lapel his circle looked well drawn and with a little effort i might have been able to break it but the reality was i just didnt care hi vivian i said in greeting not surprised that they were treating me like this id saved her life and here i was circled like an animal hearing my bitter sarcasm she dropped her gaze ashamed the last witch on the floor shivered showing a masculine arm and bloodmatted hair the coven was down two witches what had happened drop your circle before i throw you into it pierce said stridently rachel is not a demon again oliver made a grunt of negation peering at me as if i were a bug not a person hed condemned three days ago no he said his voice rough as if hed been yelling if we let her out before she agrees to do what we want she wont do it i couldnt help my snicker at that and i shifted my weight to my other foot wishing i had something on my feet other than socks it was cold in here and i wrapped my arms around my shortsleeved shirt i got news for you ollie i said im not going to do what you want anyway eyes wide pierce spun making his coattails furl we are asking for help not demanding it his eyes shifted to mine pleading for forgiveness im sorry the circle was not my idea but you went along with it you think if you ask for my help ill give it for free i said hearing my voice echo as my arms dropped to my sides after you let an elf curse me and label me a demon in front of everyone oh yeah i have to talk to trent i looked at oliver seeing not a hint of guilt after you promised me a clean slate pierce dropped his head hearing my rebuke hell i knew it had been a slip of his tongue that had put me here and him working for the coven it hadnt been intentional but here i was in a circle and there he was outside it god i was stupid tired i was putting up a hand and glancing to the empty seats when a rumble echoed through the air they all hunched as if expecting the roof to come down and the cowering witch shook curling deeper into himself if that was at all possible leon what happened where are the rest of you i asked fatigue lapping about my ankles vivian came forward into the light dressed in jeans and a sweater she looked tired as if shed seen too much in too short a time we lost them she said her expression closed kusox a pulse of adrenaline lit through me and my eye twitched when her words cut off in heartache kusox why am i not surprised he killed them pierce said bluntly ate them as they screamed for succor then he ate their souls as they watched consumed them that was yesterday it could have been averted if the rest of these lilylivered fraidycats had listened to me sooner they want me to fight kusox for them i mused seeing the power outage and the smell of cracked cement in an entirely new way a thread of adrenalinelaced hope pulled through me making me stand a little straighter they wanted something from me i wanted something from them but first i needed to talk to trent i felt my lips curve up in a notnice smile that made oliver swear and vivian swallow hard pierce alone seemed to have expected the nasty expression of confident bitter satisfaction that i knew i was now wearing id seen it on al and only now did i understand it we were all fools all of us kusox tearing apart your reality isnt my problem i said as i eyed my nails and wished i knew how to change my clothes into something suitably overbearing and sexy who wants to banish me send me home i hit the last word hard with sarcasm and pierce gave oliver a dark look that said to shut up and stop his muttering about demons rachel please he asked hes destroying everything killing people you beat him before yeah i said and pierce lowered his eyes that was when i was a witch where are ivy and jenks all bluster and overdone emotion oliver strode forward until the hissing kerosene light made harsh shadows on his face you filthy demon youre in my circle and youll do what i say i tapped the barrier between us to make his aura run from the dimple of impact it held firm even if only oliver was holding it he looked old tired not a surprise if hed been fighting kusox for three days it doesnt work that way i said lightly the thing about demons is they can say no and i dont like you smiling wickedly i leaned close the barrier humming a complaint its called lets make a deal for a reason you shunned me sent fairies to burn my church tried to kill me and my friends then you made me drag my sorry ass clear across the continent chasing a promise of forgiveness that i won from you fair and square only to have you curse me and call me a demon and now when youre in trouble you have the balls to ask for my help i shook my head not believing that trent had anticipated all of this and prepared for it what on earth might you have that i wanthmmmm i wonder i mused sarcastically glancing at each of them in turn oliver in hate vivian in disappointment and piercewell he looked too tired to be sorry but i could see his guilt i cant begin to make reparation for this pierce said his oldworld accent ringing clear and im prepared to make amends any way you see possible i wasnt of a mind that me winning the coven seat would put you in such straits this was never my intent it simplyhappened it simply happened the story of my life and i slumped the three coven witches watched me with varying degrees of hope shame and disgust and i licked my lips three days ago i would have said give me my citizenship and ill take kusox on but after having spent three days sleeping under als protection because he thought i was vulnerable i was having second third and fourth thoughts but the chance to walk away from the everafter was irresistible shifting my weight to my other foot i cocked my hip heart pounding you want me to get rid of kusox just what are you willing to giveollie or maybe i should say whom olivers eyes widened me he stammered and i almost laughed you i said derisively as vivian steeled her expression back to neutrality youre not good for anything but bussing tables what i want is all charges on me and my team dropped every hint of my shunning exonerated and i want you to publicly apologize to me and my family while standing in fountain square i said looking straight at oliver i want what you promised me last year and i want you to kiss my lily white ass never he whispered and the slump of cloth in the shadows scrambled to life give her what she wants leon shrieked launching himself at oliver you promised it would be okay as they went down leon straddled him and his hands thumped olivers head into the stage floor you said to vote with you and it would be okay and now wyatt and amanda are dead they are dead oliver he ate them leon stop vivian cried grabbing the hysterical man and pulling him away olivers foot hit the circle and it fell with a tingling wash immediately i stepped over the line back and away from them and into the shadows no one but pierce saw everyone else was focused on oliver who was getting to his feet and holding his face where leon had hit his head on the floor his eyes dark and venomous you promised leon raged huddled again and looking like a feral beast i trusted you we all trusted you and now were all dead in the distance the sound of falling rock grew and died and the earth trembled wheres my team i asked missing jenkss wiseass comments and ivys steady support but most of all i said free of the circle where is trent kalamack oliver blanched his next words choked back when he realized i was free you want him you want us to give him to you my god you are a demon pierce bowed his head but i didnt care what he thought i didnt want trent for a familiar i wanted five minutes alone with him to find out what id done wrong with that curseor punch him in the mouth it depended on what came out of it when i saw him give kusox the curse he says youre the only one who can he says stupid elf oliver started in on his overdone theatricssomething about getting me in a circle or they would all dieand vivian left leon looking at his bloodcaked fingernails and mumbling to himself to argue with oliver about morality and reality i didnt see what the big deal was if i was in a circle or not they were probably all going to die if kusox was eating witches that was just nasty shes not going to drag us into the everafter get a grip vivian shouted and oliver finally shut up and get off your holierthanthou pedestal one person for an entire civilization one person sacrificed for an entire world saved is cheap as far as im concerned she exclaimed her face red in shame hes the one who cursed her what did you expect well give the elf a medal posthumously and put his daughter through college case closed life goes back to normal and in twenty years no one cares you are as black as pierce oliver shouted his face red in the hissing kerosene light and the two of them started a loud angry argument that i decided not to listen to anymore the sad part was vivian was right that didnt make me feel any better though they were ready to give me a person because they saw me as a way out my god who did we put our trust in my anger fanned to life and i frowned you think i want trent as a familiar i said over their raised voices take him into the everafter with me and make him twist curses punish him for the curse he put on me i just wanted to talk to the man funny how you all thought i wanted to drag him back with me or kill him outright thanks a hell of a lot i appreciate that olivers pudgy cheeks quivered as his brokenvoiced harangue echoed into nothing he turned vivian too stopped yelling and i crossed my arms over my middle and frowned wondering what theyd do if i simply walked out of here would i be pulled back to the everafter when the sun went down i honestly didnt know when trent cursed me he hadnt said anything about being pulled back since i was out of the circle maybe i could stay his head down pierce edged away from them his shoes grinding the grit from the ceiling reminding me of the salt on my kitchen floor i never thought you were going to take kalamack he said softly and as his gaze darted from me to them he asked you have a plan you need trent for it i can find him i stifled a quiver at a surge of adrenaline i have an idea i admitted but ivys the planner where is she oliver and vivian looked at each other then me if you can get rid of kusox you will be reinstated as a white witch vivian said not answering my question youll be pardoned for the black magic you have done up to and including what you perform to get rid of kusox she added the coven will leave you and your family alone we dont know the magic to get the demon curse lifted from you trent does i said seeing no need to tell them that i knew how to get rid of it myself mostly the turn take it i hoped i wasnt being stupid again i didnt mind being stupid once but twice with the same person was getting old but im not a white witch i said forcing my teeth not to clench i am a demon and i want it to be official other than that we have a deal oh and i dont want to be responsible for the damage i do trying to get rid of him okay vivian looked scared but oliver gestured with a sarcastic motion that it was okay with him pierce closed his eyes as if pained the arrangement wasnt anything i could hold them to and i didnt expect them to honor it right now all i wanted was a shot at getting the curse shifted from me back to kusox so where is the little genetic designer dump of a demon i said liking the insulting moniker that al had given kusox i had no idea how i was going to do this but knowing where he was would be a start vivian looked to the closed locked double doors just follow the screaming a quick breath slipped in and out and ivy and jenks im going to need their help no one said anything my heart seemed to stop when they both looked at pierce kusox has them he said and i quivered fear sliding through me i opine hes not killed them outright but is keeping them intact to call you out twentyeight the vivid maroons and contrasting golds of the carpet had dulled to a gray smudge under the choking dust from broken concrete it didnt help that the light was almost nonexistent as i strode through the hotel lobby the ambient sun not able to reach deep enough into the large building to make a difference everywhere around me people were quietly crying whispering or staring blankly as they huddled under yellow blankets pulled from hotel rooms sitting against the walls or in informal groups in the middle of the floor it was quiet there were no more decisions to be made they were down to just existing shocked into a blank state their minds as dull as the carpet coated with the remnants of destruction it stank of cracked rock and terror that had lost its ability to motivate but as i headed for the sun past the glass doors a head lifted awareness seeping in to show their individual fears and thoughts like my feet pulling the dust from the carpet leaving a bright and shiny trail of where id been my jaw set and my arms swung a little harder demon witch clearly id been recognized and i squared my shoulders so i was a demon suck it up and deal with it i was going to save their asses dont pay them any mind pierce said as he paced beside me his dusty coat almost the same color as the carpet the sooty gray fading as it rose until it regained its original brown at his shoulders theyre scared so am i i admitted staring straight ahead i was scared and angry that kusox had been holding ivy and jenks for three days hurting them to ensure id come to him at least my mother was okay having been in jail when kusox destroyed a huge chunk of san francisco she was still there thank god but at least now she knew i was back in reality for a while al too knew what i was up to i dont know why i made them give me my scrying mirror so i could tell him i was okay except that he had seemed worried and that was a new emotion from himat least where my welfare was concerned i had sneezed for five solid minutes after i told him i wasnt waiting until dark to confront kusox and hung up on him but that had been an hour ago and hed given up my scrying mirror was now in vivians care but my magnetic chalk was tucked in my jeans pocket along with a couple of zip strips i also had one of the covens splat guns its hopper full of charms i doubted would work at the beach we were headed to but maybe kusox ducking them might buy me some time other than that i didnt have much having turned down the bits and bobs that oliver grudgingly laid out for me i didnt need his magic didnt trust it kusox could take everything oliver had and bathe in it my intent wasnt to kill kusox my intent was to hold on to him long enough to shift the curse and survive i wanted to survive too my jaw ached and i forced my teeth to unclench as i headed for the bright doors behind me vivian and oliver trailed creating a wake of whispers of their own why they were coming was obvious but they were going to be little help other than as cannon fodder i didnt care about oliver but i didnt want to be responsible for vivian pierce hustled to open the door ahead of me but i stiffarmed the panel next to it the door flung open and a blast of sunshine hit me it was like a smack and i stood there blinded almost crying the sun i could hear sirens in the distance and helicopters thumping but i turned to the sky and smiled blinding myself why had i ever wanted sunglasses to block this out it had been only three days only a few hours if you considered that most of that time id been unconscious but the warmth soaked into me as if id been in prison for years my gaze came down and i knew i was still carrying my smile when pierce stared at me standing beside a black van with an is logo on it its side door open and waiting vivian and oliver were already inside arguing over who got the two forwardfacing seats another black car with lights on it waited ahead a third vehicle behind the street was pretty much empty apart from the chunks of stray concrete and bits of paper we were to have an escort to the drop zone i looked up again seeing three gulls gliding to the bay rachel i pulled my eyes from the sky when a dark building hid the birds heart heavy i trudged to the van not a charm or spell in my possession not looking at anyone i stepped in vivian and oliver had taken the seats facing backward so i took the one across from vivian it was next to a wide square window and i sat pressed up against the cold wall of the van again searching the sky for the birds the thump of the door closing sent a shock through me and the wonderful smell of redwood grew thick as pierce sat close leaving a wide gap between him and the door lets move oliver said sourly and the van inched forward through the big front window i watched as the lights began to flash on the lead car and we pulled out quiet and peacefullike a death march i sat and stared out the window the gulls had reappeared from behind the building and i propped the window open to watch them oliver complained no one listened the birds were beautiful their stark white and black cutting across the blue as they screamed at one another their voices echoing among the silent broken buildings it was quiet the hush spoiled as the vans tires popped and crunched over the scattered debris pierce touched my hand trying to get my attention but i didnt look away from the birds kusox held my friends hostage i had nothing to fight him with except a curse i didnt know how to twist vivian and oliver werent going to be a help pierce might be but i wasnt going to count on it the birds vanished behind another building and i turned to pierce when he squeezed my hand he seemed different older tired dirty his hand atop mine was scraped from moving rocks his fingernails split and knuckles gashed his hair was gray from the dust his youthful neversay die determination was wearing thin and yet as his hand gripped mine his first words were are you okay anger flashed but his grip tightened on me when i tried to pull away my friends are bait in a trap for me ive been unconscious for three days in als kitchen the city that cursed me is asking for my help and you want to know if im okay al hurt you pierce asked his eyes flashing and i shook my head he i hesitated he kept me safe after i proved to the collective that i was a demon i said not looking as vivian gasped and oliver harrumphed as if hed known it all along i didnt like the fact that the driver was hearing this too but there it was pierce thought about that his brow wrinkling even more until he smoothed it when he turned to face me squarely and youre okay he asked again and i didnt say anything no i wasnt okay fine maybe yeah i was fine fucked in extreme as ivy would say the car swerved to avoid another stalled vehicle and i reached to steady myself so i wouldnt lean into pierce reclaiming my hand in the process the blue land rover had been abandoned when a twoton chunk of someones living room had fallen on the hood bet that had been a nasty surprise we were heading down to the bay and i caught a glimpse of it sparkling in the quiet sun my lungs filled and emptied the blank faces at the hotel nudged into my thoughts theyd called for my blood chanted to give trent the collective strength to slide kusoxs curse off on to me the collective crap i thought almost groaning as i figured it out could i be any more stupid id forgotten the collective thats why the curse hadnt stuck the latin was right the implementation was flawed id tried to shift the curse alone and something that farreaching needed a collective to make it adhere i needed a witches collective i needed the strength only a group of witches could give me my eyes narrowed and my chest tightened yeah like they would help me now but it was worth a shot rachel i started almost shocked to see pierce sitting beside me concern in the slant of his eyes from the beginnings of hope i found a smile you have dirt on your nose i said reaching to wipe it away i hadnt touched anyone in three days and at the feel of his warm skin against my fingers an unexpected welling up of tears threatened i didnt love him but i could have if things had been different it will be okay pierce said softly his hand coming up to cradle mine between us his grip on me was solid real and i felt guilty that i was reaching out for his support when i knew he loved me and i didnt love him but i felt so alone i couldnt let go tomorrow the sun will rise hes just a demon pierce said making things worse a demon who held my friends hostage sniffing i glanced out the window at the sun empty streets the boats at the docks with their see the whales signs flashed past do i stink i whispered and his grip on my hand twitched i looked away not needing his answer i figured as much with everything else that was going on i was worried about how i smelled but it mattered i pay it no mind youve been in the everafter i hardly notice it anymore why was he being so nice to me i didnt deserve it but i needed it taking a breath i softly said thank you for helping me i looked up encompassing vivian and oliver all of you oliver snorted if we could do anything we wouldnt have summoned you he said im here only to make sure you dont run away vivian frowned at him to be quiet what do you need she asked taking her cell phone out of an inner coat pocket anything at all the car turned and the new coven pin on pierces lapel caught the sun sending little gleams of light about the car like the flashes of jenkss wings i looked at vivians phone as she waited for my answer my heart clenched in pain her phone was so small all black and silver with tiny little buttons that would do everything but make you a smoothie ivy would love it i closed my eyes as i tried not to cry damn it demons didnt cry even when their friends were being held by a psychotic nutcase when my eyes opened they landed on the drivers in the rearview mirror i was sure he was some is goon theyd dug up somewhere and that hed go back to his boss with whatever i said just as well i wanted them to hear this too trent gave me a curse i started and pierce smiled i was there he said trying for a light air and failing in his eyes was his remembered anger at how they had made him helpless its of no never mind i licked my lips glancing past vivian and oliver to the driver he gave it to me to give to kusox so i can banish him to the everafter for good but i need a collective to make it stick vivians gaze became sharp on mine he planned this then why did he leave trent was gone crap maybe i was wrong kusox must be killed not banished pierce said tightly the elven bastard will simply summon him again im of a mind that the doublecrossing scoundrel is the one summoning him now were not clearing your name if the demon can come back oliver blustered i dont think i can kill kusox i said glaring at pierce and second kusox is here on his own unsummoned hes special created after the everafter and not bound to it or to the pull of the sun the demons dont want him which was why he was banished here by using the same curse trent gave me trent figured you wouldnt hold to our agreement at the fib last spring thats why he freed kusox trent thinks i can best him slide the curse onto the insane nutcase my eyes went to oliver holding his after you promised me my citizenship of course this whole thing is your fault oliver oliver took a breath kalamack freed kusox you stupidpoliticalbastard vivian exclaimed i shrugged looking out the window to see that we were down by the waterfront and the tourist traps when trent wanted something he didnt care who got hurt to get it he freed kusox because he knew oliver wouldnt keep his promise unless forced to i said not sure how i felt about it trent promised me my freedom and kusox is his leverage you cant make this my fault oliver protested and vivian rounded on him shut up you oversexed flabby warlock she shouted and the driver glanced back at us through the rearview mirror this is your doing all of it if youd just kept to what you promised her instead of trying to soothe your ego by bringing her down half the city wouldnt be destroyed leon wouldnt need therapy and wyatt and amanda would still be alive you cannot blame this on me oliver exclaimed and vivian glared at him i do she growled and if any of us survive im bringing you down count on it breathing fast she looked back at me flushed oliver gaped like a fish shocked and pierce snickered thousands of lives pierce said his voice soft and the free world left in jeopardy if you should fail trent must believe most powerfully that you can put kusox back in his place the younglooking but wise witch glanced at oliver and by that you win your freedom no matter what they call you rachel my breath slipped from me in a puff of sound it was hard not to be flattered all of this to make good on his promise to me trent was still a murdering drug lord but he had honor not to mention a huge disrespect for innocent lives if i can curse kusox and dump him in the everafter then we can all go back to being who we want to be i said then mentally added sort of id still be a daywalking demon but at least i would be in reality again vivians expression eased and i added im tired of being nice though if you ever screw me over again or piss me off im letting him out thats blackmail oliver exclaimed stiffening pierce turned to him but before he could say anything the van stopped with a tight squeal of brakes my hand went out to stop my momentum but pierce was faster holding me back from falling on vivian as one we all looked to the front the unassuminglooking driver had unbuckled his seat belt and turned to us his face was thin and his expression from under his straggly brown hair severe and his eyeshad gone vampire black i shivered feeling an ancient force take over the car vampire incense filling me to overflowing i stifled a shiver a hand against my neck shit this guy wasnt a driver this guy was is inderland security oliver the man said his voice causing ripples of sensation across my skin we at the is think youve fucked this up far enough if rachel permanently eliminates the threat of this daywalking demon no one will care if shes the queen of the damned and eats live kittens for breakfast in front of kindergarteners you will leave her alone or you will find yourself disgraced who the hell are you oliver spouted red faced but he was scared so was i vivian flicked her eyes from oliver to the driver inching away from oliver pierce too was staring with openmouthed awe i just wanted to get out of this car before the vampire toxins sunk in my neck had me throwing myself at the guy he was a living vampire seeing as the sun was still up but he was channeling a dead one a really powerful really old dead one im your downfall oliver the man said and i shivered if you push i will be on you with bodies in your pool and satanic symbols etched into your childrens foreheads but if all you put your faith in is titles then i am the acting head of the is west of the mississippi and as it stands your coven is useless his eyes went to mine and a small sound slipped out you need to replace them with people not afraid to get dirty for the greater good i didnt think he was talking about the rock dust and i smiled letting it fade when he glanced at me were as close as we dare get he said and my pulse pounded when he leaned between oliver and vivian to take my unresisting hand in his pierce bristled and amusement danced in the mans black eyes we at the is wish you luck demon letting you wallow amid mediocrity was our error he looked at oliver then back to me our grave error good hunting rachel it took me three times but i stammered ththank you oh god if i could pull this off the is would bewell theyd probably not be on my side but id probably not be on their hit list anymore theyd grant me respect maybe oh crap did i want their respect theyd probably want me to do stuff for them the vampire kissed the top of my handand a thrill of desire spiraled through me pulled into existence by a slip of teeth and the scent of incense and thenhe was gone his door thumping shut behind him and his quickly moving figure getting into the first car it drove away fast the car behind us following silence crept in my open window and fresh air coming right off the bay wed passed the chocolate factory on the way in and i thought i could smell it im not getting out of this van oliver said vivians brow furrowed got that right she said tightly and then i gasped when she hauled off and hit him square in the jaw pierce cried out but it was over and the man had slumped to the door out cold vivian was wringing her hand eyes tearing as she held her red knuckles a charm must have been involved because she hadnt hit him hard enough to knock him unconscious that hurt she gasped smiling damn im going to pay for that when the charm wears off but it felt really good hes such a prick just three of us then i thought glad of it oliver would have messed it up a quiver went through me it was time twentynine the rasp of the side door opening was loud and heart pounding i slid across the seat and followed pierce out we were at a sloping park where the streetcars turned around the grass was cut and the bushes were manicured across the street where the beach was there was a small stone building that might once have been a public bathroom but was now boarded up the wind was brisk by the water and i sniffed not bothering to tap a line it figured that kusox would be down here regular magic wouldnt work well demon magic would though and i smiled grimly feeling like a cupcake on a sparkling white plate here i am kusox come take a bite my shoes hit the pavement and i looked at them wondering how they had found me a pair so fast when the city had come to a standstill they werent new rachel you said you had something for us to do i forced the worry out of my eyes as i turned to pierce keep me alive when its over i said weakly and he took my hand it was a horribly romantic gesture and it only made me feel worse things were clearer to me than they had ever been and yet i gave his fingers a squeeze before i pulled away and turned to vivian there was a radio playing somewhere and she was squinting up into the distant buildings trying to place the sound otherwise it was silent rubble strewn about the edge of the shore on the bay it was beautiful not a car on the bridge or a boat running out to alcatraz hi mary eat your toast and kill your magic its not worth it i didnt understand this my entire life would be decided in the next five minutes the lives of ivy and jenks the safety of all good people and here i was delighting in the smell of the seaweed and how the sun shone on the tiny little bugs darting on the hardpacked shore vivian i said forcing myself to look back to her oh vivian i said softer when i saw her fear im fine she asserted her voice shaking trent isnt answering his phone im sorry ill keep trying i think he flew back to cincinnati with his little girl what else can i do i want to help the woman was terrified and my heart went out to her she had fought kusox for three days seen two of her peers eaten alive and yet she stood by me ready to fight to the last i didnt want her here i needed her in the city finding me a collective my hair lifted in the wind off the bay and i smiled at the feeling focus rachel focus will you go back to the city for me i said figuring the is driver had left the keys lleave you she stammered and i took her arm leading her back to the van i can help im counting on it i said i need you to go back stop at every church you can find there are people there right get them to ring the bells for me she stared her blue eyes going wide for a collective she said breathily realizing what i was asking a citywide collective hadnt happened since the turn it was both a warning and a gathering an act of trust i didnt know if they would help or not but if they didnt then i would fail and they would suffer ill do it she said her voice trembling rachel if i have to light a fire in the middle of san francisco i will get you a collective i promise somehow i managed a smile and i stumbled when she gave me a quick hug her eyes were brimming when she stepped back i blinked fast trying not to tear up thanks i said and her dusty shoes with the little bows scraped as she started to drift backward dont take too long nodding she turned and went back to the van the door creaked as it opened and her slight figure made the jump inside at least there wont be any traffic she said and the door thumped closed the rumble of the van echoed against the abandoned buildings as the engine turned over i felt pierces presence beside me and together we watched her pull away the sound of the van quickly vanished and we were alone sort of kusox was here somewhere nervous i rubbed my palms together and breathed in the last of the exhaust fumes you dont think they dropped us off at the wrong beach do you i asked and pierce took my shoulders and turned our backs on the bay to look up to the hills of san francisco from here everything looked normal if a shade quiet and with the air markedly clean if i had to do this with someone i could do far worse than pierce rachel pierce said the depth of the emotion in his voice stopping me cold he was going to say something overcompensating for his part in getting me cursed but i was a demon and he had devoted his life to killing them i didnt want to hear it wait i interrupted turning to find that he was too close i didnt move as he reached to steady me his hand not falling when i found my balance his dusty hair was all over making him look endearing as he squinted from the wind off the bay the slant to his eyes was determined and i knew he had the strength to back up whatever he deemed a worthy task he thought he loved me even forgiving me for having prevented him from killing al and it was breaking my heart and i will cry when i go because i could love you forever i couldnt love him it would destroy him slowly and i didnt want that i leaned toward him wishing i didnt stink of the everafter and demons he blinked as he saw my intention and his hands moved one sliding behind my neck and the other holding firmly to my fingers my head tilted and my lips opened they met his in a shock of ley line and i quivered i felt a tear slip out as pierce held me space between us as we kissed leaving me aching when our lips parted i didnt know why id done it except that i might die today at least id die in the sun pierce i said softly our kiss ended but our foreheads still touching i cant we shifted apart and he put a finger to my lips i could taste his salt and i blinked fast i know he said his eyes flicking behind me to the water for a moment as if unable to hold my gaze dont say it he asked wait until the sun sets tonight and if we are both here to see it then my heart will break knowing you are safe and yet not to be mine if you are gone then my heart will break knowing that god has taken you home because there is no way in hell that that demon kusox is going to kill you i wont allow it there was a lump in my throat and i wiped my eyes only to get the grit of sand in them no i said taking a step back until his hands fell from me pierce i dont love you his lips twitched hearing a lie that wasnt there and i took his hands i dont love you i said again my throat closing up i loved the idea of you and me together and from that maybe someday love could have come but that isnt going to happen ever i am a demon he took a breath to protest his eyes wild and his denial obvious you are not my eyes dropped to his hands holding mine seeing his calluses and strength i am i did something no witch no male demon can do and all the demons agree theres no way around it its not like i wanted this my voice had gotten squeaky and i looked up seeing panic in him its okay i whispered sniffing back a tear before it showed it doesnt mean im bad but it does mean that there is no way that i stopped it was too hard to say his grip on mine tightened but i felt dead inside im not afraid pierces hand drew me closer and i resisted until he eased his pull id never hurt you i protested remembering him standing before kusox fighting for my safety risking his life for me what person wouldnt be humbled by that grateful his gaze jumped to mine his anger lighting his eyes i meant im not afraid of love being difficult if it was easy then everyone would find it but have it your way he turned away and i reached after him saying nothing as my hand dropped it was better this way perhaps you should call him out pierce suggested angrily looking at the hills i nodded even as my stomach clenched id told him i didnt love him and he didnt seem to care id told him i was a demon and hed said so what then told me love was hard i knew that but it shouldnt be impossible shoes silent on the pavement i walked across the street to the beach stepping up onto the cement bench next to the boardedup restrooms it was covered in gang runes and my feet spread wide i cupped my hands around my mouth damn it why couldnt i have a normal life kusox i shouted up into the park my frustration giving my voice some anger you have something that belongs to me the radio i realized was playing bouncy beach music with a sudden snap it vanished my pulse hammered and i glanced at pierce he was standing with his hands clasped ready to fight for me even after id told him i didnt love him why just a minute kusox shouted back and my lips parted i did not believe this just a minute had he really told me to wait pierce shrugged and i jumped from the bench you might want to put some space between us if you want to stay alive i suggested forcing myself not to touch my splat gun pierce put his hands on his hips flicking his duster back you might want to put yourself in a bubble to do the same what was i thinking taking kusox on without al but he had ivy and jenks and i wasnt going to wait a soft scrape of boot on stone pulled my head around and i felt the blood drain from my face it was kusox his arm around ivys neck and his other hand twisting her arm painfully behind her as he forced her down the park steps let me go you freak i heard her sputter as she strained to break his grip but it was useless one of her eyes was black and she had a split lip jenks i shouted as they reached the bottom and i pulled out the splat gun my grip sweaty and the ley line i was connected to seeming to jump in me wheres jenks kusox stopped in the middle of the street his steel gray hair close to his head shining in the sun like raven wings looking as if he was enjoying himself he tugged ivy around to be his shield tell her what happened to the pixy he said softly whispering it into her ear as his eyes bored into mine and the wind played with his hair my heart almost stopped jenks hes okay ivy said kusoxs hand going whiteknuckled as he gripped her throat short dick here had to lock him in a box jenks kept slicing his ear off kusox bore down on her and she choked falling to one knee hey i shouted taking a step forward splat gun raised let her go its me you want god i felt as if i were in a western hand over the little lady there partner and well settle this like men i was so screwed kusox grinned showing his small white teeth does it bother you he asked yanking her up and dragging her through the rubble that littered the street her foot got wedged between two rocks and he yanked her free my face went blank at her muffled grunt of pain fingers shifting on the butt of my weapon i said let her go and come over here ill whisper in your ear how bothered i am confident and sure of himself kusox stopped at the curb his hand opened and ivy fell her elbow slicing open on a chunk of ragged concrete head down so her hair hid her face she pulled herself together lashing out with her good foot making kusox dance sideways i shot at him as he was distracted but he raised a bubble absorbing it ivy though was free and my heart quickened i slowly continued to draw that broken energy into me pulling it from the jagged lines and trying to organize it i only snapped every bone in her body and mended it to get you to come face me he said mocking me as he grabbed her shoulder and pinned her where she sat it took me a day before i realized you were unconscious and not simply afraid but i thought why stop now i was bored so she got a little more we had fun didnt we ivy girl i seethed my hands in fists as ivy didnt look up it was only play kusox was saying nothing permanent i in a smooth motion i pushed the energy from my chi into my hand grunting i threw it there was probably little besides eating her that kusox could do to ivy that piscary hadnt done already but something in me had snapped ivy screamed defiantly kicking his feet out from under him and rolling away before the demon could direct my energy into her kusox fell arms flailing my ball of unfocused energy arched to him celero inanio i shouted exploding it right above him he cowered a dark sheet of everafter snapping over him i knew such a common spell wouldnt hurt him but it shut him up ivy had staggered to her feet and was limping fast to pierce not me wise woman i needed room to work and i shifted my stance for better purchase oh really grow up will you kusox muttered as he got to his feet and his bubble flickered out of existence there was a tweak on my awareness as he pulled heavily on a line not trusting anything but a welldrawn circle i dove to the side landing with my back to that squat building between kusox and me i watched his black ball of nastiness thump into the sand at the edge of the sidewalk water and grit sprayed up a tiny crater hissing as it cooled to a green milky glass thats how the big boys do it he said with satisfaction but i couldnt see him crap i had to get away from this building before he simply blew it up around me ivy i called praying as i hurriedly sketched a circle around me hed simply break through it but there were no bells ringing yet i had to stall him im good came back and i crabwalked to the edge of the building and looked seeing her with pierce crouched beside a broken bench they were both inside an uninvoked circle relatively safe keep her alive i mouthed and he nodded even as ivy read my lips and grimaced the clink of sliding rubble jerked my attention back to the beach where a black oily smoke drifted from the personsize crater i can hear yourachel kusox mocked his voice coming closer as i edged back to my circle i hear you breathing i couldnt help it and i held my breath sitting with my back against the building my heart pounded and sweat made clean tracks in the dust on my arms i listened for the sound of church bells hearing nothing come on vivian how sweet of you to have come back thinking you could best me he said a rock clinking closer it took six demons to shove me under that rock they built the arch over and i killed one of them in the process almost got newt too sweet little newt more trusting than you even after i had convinced her to kill all her sisters you should have waited until dark al cant help you but at least you wouldnt die alone i dont need als help to squish a bug like you i said teeth gritted as i attempted to figure out where he was by his voice trying to be quiet i pulled away from the building an odd sort of pain drifting through me as the curse made for him felt him and started to align itself pieces of me that didnt fit chunks of kusoxs curse slowly i gathered them together in my chi praying for bells just one but there was nothing dont need als help he said and with a sideways step the demon appeared from behind the side of the old bathroom cocky and sure of himself with the sun in his hair and his lips curved up in amusement crap he was almost on top of me youre stupider than i thought he finished smiling pain exploded from nowhere inside my concentration shattered and the bits of the curse id pulled from myself sprang back into place with a twang my knees gave way and i hit the pavement beside the building burning in agony it felt like my lungs were exploding teeth clenched i lifted my head to find kusox standing beside the building a bundle of cloth in his hands great he had a focusing object he didnt have to throw charms at me he could just wish on a star oh god i moaned feeling the cramping slither across my heart and wend its way to my gut panting i tried to inch my fingers to my scribed circle but i couldnt focus long enough to even find a ley line i took a gasping breath as i realized that there was a pair of black slippers in front of me hed moved and i hadnt even noticed but in all fairness it was hard to see around the pain that was so easy it wasnt any fun at all kusox pouted i looked up squinting at the doll with red hair and leather boots and i got a clean albeit ragged breath as his fingers loosened on it wanna play dolls he asked me and pursed his lips exhaling i flung myself backward landing against the building my lungs were suddenly overflowing with air feeling as if they were going to burst even as the hot moist breath lacking any oxygen at all filled them i was suffocating though i heaved for air one hand on my throat the other on the ground scrabbling for the circle i saw a movement behind kusox a soft ghost of gray i tried not to look but kusox noticed my eyes turning in time to see pierce winding up with a black ball of hurt dripping in his hand compages kusox shouted and a shimmering protection bubble flashed into existence breathtaking in its utter sordidness this was true smut making the black shimmer on my own aura look like a drop of oil in the ocean pierces curse hit kusoxs protective bubble and bounced right back at pierce it was a beautiful bit of defensive magic but it cost kusox his concentration the pain in my chest vanished my head came up and i took in a huge gulp of air in an instant i read the strength pierces thrown curse had absorbed from kusoxs bubble knowing that the illmade greentinted circle pierce had taken refuge in wasnt going to hold against it the curse had pierces aura and would go right through my eyes narrowed and still on the ground i whispered rhombus the rusty broken west coast ley line limped into me and i wrestled with it trying to get some semblance of order but it was thin ragged my circle was huge me at its center as all theoretical undrawn circles are the edge of it just shy of pierce and ivy they were outside my circle but kusox and the deadly curse he had bounced back at pierce were inside i grunted when pierces curse hit the inside of my bubble absorbing most of the energy from his magic as it tore through my circle and hit pierce square on having passed right through his bubble as if it didnt exist no i cried out as the curse struck pierce and he fell mouth open in a silent scream god no i called again struggling to get up as the curse spread to ivy and they both collapsed under a greentinted wash of everafter mouth agape kusox spun to me his shock clear you he managed and then i saw pierce move his chest rising and falling as he lay stunned by his own magic they were alive they were out cold but they were alive thank you god they were alive clever kusox managed clearly peeved that id managed to save them and i kicked him with all the force i had yelping he fell back i sprang at him my hands reaching for that doll but he vanished an instant before i touched him and i fell right through the space hed been in landing hard against the sidewalk my curledin fingers taking much of the impact ow i huffed then rolled instinct and too many fights telling me to move i was too slow to escape everything and the toe of kusoxs boot helped me over bruising my ribs instead of breaking them mother of a dog whore kusox shouted following me with his foot swinging and i rolled the other way right into him he wasnt expecting that and he fell forward over me hitting the sidewalk with an oof of surprise immediately i reversed my motion almost crawling across him as he lay facedown on the sidewalk inside a part of me was shrieking with laughter here we were two demons in the sun down to kicking and punching youre scum kusox i breathed heavily straddling his back as i found his arm and yanked it backward almost breaking it as i smashed his face back down onto the sidewalk but he only started to laugh his cheek against the cement and unable to see me he was starting to piss me off and i gave a little pull cutting his mirth short rachel what do you hope to accomplish he said clearly feeling the pain of the position but not taking it seriously i can jump to a line from under you burn every last thought from you as i lie here maybe but he hadnt grimacing i shoved his wrist into his back and lifted his bent elbow making him yelp then why havent you i asked i let up but just a little the hills of san francisco were silent not a single bell ringing please vivian because this is sort of nice he said and i pulled up on his elbow making him laugh more even though his face started to show the strain he was getting a kick out of this the bastard nice i leaned closer to his ear you should see me when i get warmed up im like a hemi baby run all night maybe we got off on the wrong foot kusox said and i eased up a smidge i heard you almost killed al you made a damn fine construct for the collective i walked it while you languished in als tiny kitchen trying to survive its creation i can admit i was wrong youre a demon a damn fine one i dont care if you came from witches and the genetic engineering of elves i myself am born from tinkering and ill admit that my abhorrence might have originated from my own shame im not ashamed of where i come from i snarled softly my worry growing as i glanced at pierce and ivy still not moving im even impressed with how you tried to slide that curse into me he added eyes roving to find mine you forgot to include the collective though good luck finding one the demons wont help you they want me even less than your pitiful coven does no youre down to one choice and thats me vivian would find me a collective she would i had to believe it you i said as i leaned in my shadow covering his eyes and he winced his gaze finding mine at last a grimace grew on my face as i pinned him to the cement kusox was an ass he was getting turned on by this i could tell i told you i liked red hair yes he murmured sand stuck to his face i could get to like you he said and i forced myself to smile back at him we could enjoy each other enjoy the best of the everafter and this world both just you and me the hell with the rest of them keep him talking i thought feeling a weird sort of energy starting to slip from him to me damn it was he trying to do a power pull but the memory of him eating a pixy the warrior struggling to pierce kusoxs throat even as he gulped him down intruded as if what about ivy i asked breathlessly glancing at her bring her along he said variety is the spice of life i meant i said in his ear you hurt her i didnt do anything permanent his voice betrayed his bewilderment you want to know the way to keep her soul after she dies right shock quivered through me you know how to do that i warbled i couldnt help it my grip eased and kusox drew his arm to his chest laughing low as he shifted out from under me sitting up and turning to face me streaks of dirt had turned his black shirt gray and he felt his shoulder before wiping the sand from his face and arranging his hair thats better he said gaze taking in my rumpled body eyes cataloging the curves and lines of my face all the way down to my borrowed shoes this is what you really look like you can return ivys soul to her when she dies i prompted breathlessly no i just wanted you to let go my jaw dropped you son of a bitch i swung at him my wrist bursting into pain when he caught my hand inches from his face find something new to call me he said yanking me to him my hand curled into a claw and i panted through the pain i was kneeling before him and he pulled me closer almost into his lap ive been alone a long time he said his hand gripping my wrist painfully promising me even more hurt if i struggled lots of time to think of how to pleasure myself with a woman who wouldnt die at her first orgasm lots of time to imagine what it could be his groping hand reached taking the chalk from my pocket and throwing it away lots of time to lose what few inhibitions i might have had my splat gun was next and i struggled as he found it slipped in the small of my back and threw it into the nearby ocean i can shift the smallest mote of energy he said a new depravity in his eyes as if he wanted to strip me of everything else make it dance in you promises promises i said listening for the bells but still there was nothing but the shush of the water and the crying of the gulls it wasnt going to happen they were too afraid and my hope began slipping from me leaving the sour taste of burnt amber on my soul i dont want to fight you he said sounding reasonable as the wind moved the ends of his hair im not even asking you to submit simplylet me be let me be it was what i wanted let you be i said my gaze darting to the chalk well out of reach he nodded and my hand hurt when he let go and the blood flowed again you arent wanted here he said his eyes lifting from me as i leaned back the deathly silent hills watching us they hate you why are you trying to save them this is your playground play play with me he was smiling looking as beautiful as only a satisfied demon could knowing the world was his and nothing could stop him i felt my wrist looking for a way out and not finding one there was no collective to help me move the curse no white knight in the guise of a citywide outflowing of goodwill they had turned their backs on me not trusting me the hurt part of me said screw them but id been afraid before and i couldnt fault them they were scared and no one should die because they were scared not when someone else had the courage to say no this isnt my playground this is my home i said seeing my reflection in his eyes my hair mussed face flushed and a heady hatred in my eyes and if you dont leave im going to kick your ass out his head tilted and he laughed beautiful in the sun with the ocean behind him oh rachel we could have had so much fun he said when he looked back at me the last remnants of his mirth still lingering at the corners of his mouth i wish i could make you last but truly you are too close to being a threat to survive right now you are alone with absolutely no curses vulnerable but someday youll be better than me and i dont trust you vulnerable thats what al had said but i hadnt listened and now all i had was what god had given me and what trents father had enabled me to survive and as i squinted at kusox hating that he thought he had power over me simply because he was stronger my will solidified i didnt need the damn collective i was a covendamned demoness unaware of my thoughts kusox reached out and snatched my wrist again delighted as i struggled when he pulled me closer what no long monologues i taunted him and his expression became more domineering yet no he said rising to keep the weight advantage when i see a snake i cut off its head and have done with it after i suck out its poison for myself of course i twisted trying to avoid his reaching hand and he splayed his fingers they were coated in his black aura sparkling at the edges and i did not want that touching me but with a grunt of satisfaction he thrust his hand against my face and shoved his will into mine i gasped as he was suddenly in my head with me more oppressive and heavier than al had ever hinted at my heart pounded and every thought of fighting vanished power he had it he was it he had no morals his soul was empty he was content with what he was confident that none could stop him he was a daywalking demon who like me hadnt been born a slave to the everafter he could see the sun and it gave him strength and he wanted me dead except i wasnt a demon i was a demoness and that last little bit of x chromosome was going to save my ass you stupid son of a bitch i thought and then grabbed his thin soul by the short hairs yanking it completely into mine with callous disregard no kusoxs aggressive sexual heat flashed into fear his power suddenly meant nothing as my soul swallowed his cutting him off from everything but the memory of existence si peccabas poenam meres i thought holding him within me as the pinpricks of the curse lifted from me arrowing into him like flakes of iron to a magnet and as he howled in fury i screamed over him i curse you kusox to be fixed to the everafter cursed be it day or night forever bound as a demon facilis descensus tartaros ill kill you you damned succubus kusox shouted as he felt the curse lift from me and settle into him i was a demoness and i could hold another soul even if it was as disgusting as kusoxs and once there i could give him a curse collective or not fix it into his very dna so that even should he transform it would go with him forever a heavy mallet smashed into me and i fell off him the connection between us breaking the cement slammed into my back and the sun blinded me i blinked trying to figure out what had happened i was on my back looking up at the sun and my mouth hurt take it back take it back kusox demanded and i propped myself up on an elbow to see him standing before me stiff with fear i looked at the blood on my hand then back to him the sun in his face and the ocean behind him the sky full of birds you lose kusox i said panting as i started to smile i banish you get out of my reality no he screamed lunging at me my hands came up to fend him off and just as his weight fell on me i felt the line take us he was taking me with him shit i thought floundering as i reoriented myself then clenched in pain as my bubble snapped into place around us his hot anger made clouds of agony and hate rise from his mind like the choking stink of decay he gripped my consciousness dragging me with him and i felt my soul shiver in pain at the fire he poured into me take it back he demanded or ill kill you here try i thought then screamed as he began to shred my memories i caught glimpses of my life as he burned them taking them as his own a blueeyed tiger at the zoo pacing to me as if he could walk right through the glassand it was gone a birthday at the hospital him standing in the background as i blew out the candles and wished for a day without weaknessgone one by one kusox found my most happy thoughts and ate them ate my soul take it back he seethed shredding me cutting me down to the bare bones of myself take it back or well die here together gentlemans choice i thought grimly then punched a hole right through my protective bubble infinity screamed in at us and he let go of my mind pushing me away as we floundered pain like no other crippled our thoughts it was as exquisite an agony as angels singing the beginnings of the world exploding the idea of infinity into reality stripping my aura from me in sheets scouring it layer by layer i struggled to keep myself together the howling of the demons lost in the lines before us echoed their voices caught in the moment of death forever out kusoxs soul shrieked and i clutched it a point of common ground amid the absence of anything but pain he was struggling to keep his aura failing he couldnt get out of the line and was already dead for all his strength he didnt love couldnt manage to tune his aura to anothers giving all trusting and suddenly it struck me that only the demons who knew how to love had survived al i thought shocked to find it was a strong enough connection a glimmer of light pierced the black pain and kusox clawed at it gouging my soul until memories leaked from me like tears im opening the line i thought and kusox struggled striving to get through the hole failing as he ran into a barrier he couldnt see im opening the line i thought more stridently im saving your life kusox remember that ill kill you he screamed a vow to fulfill you are dead dead dead to you i agreed you will leave me and those i love alone forever i demanded bits of me drifting off motes of thought sparkling in the nothing promise or ill let you die here you are dead he sobbed the words becoming a promise not a threat capitulating as his soul began to burn you are dead to me you and yours are safe i started to shift his aura to match als hard though the soundneverheard beat at us and the colors no one had seen blinding me good i thought savagely because if you ever touch anyone i care about again ill find you and then ill dropkick you back in here to die with the rest of them a pinprick of an opening began and he slipped from me darting through it and closing it behind him like a trap he was gone alone i writhed in pain trying to scrape together enough memories to tune my own aura i had to get out before i was shredded to nothing i wasnt going to go to al who was now playing pattycake with kusox the memories of those who meant the most to me flashed through my mind memories of jenks smirking at me his hands on his hips as the sun lit his hair the soft smile ivy would allow herself when she thought no one could see trent his face showing love as he held his daughterand then his powerful grace when he sat atop a horse the hounds baying and the moon lording over it all and pierce a single wistful thought of a touch id never feel again the soft sound of anothers breathing against mine i couldnt have him and he loved me anyway one by one i fastened on them as a way out and one by one my memories were ripped away by the energy screaming through me burning until i realized that my aura was gone there was nothing left for the line to recognize i couldnt think fast enough and i was going to die here amid the screeching of unbalanced energies and the forgotten souls of demons who couldnt love in utter agony i curled my memories around what was left and tried to see past the pain to form another thought to prove that i wasnt dead yet but it was too late and terror struck me when my thoughts gave a hiccup vanishing for an instant then returning weaker than before ms morgan a panicked thought touched mine and recoiled leaving the scent of rock chips in the sun bis mindless from the pain i felt my soul start to burn the sensation of dry grit and the sharp feel of ioncharged water grew stronger i felt him wrap his soul around me and yet i still burned help me bis i managed and then with a ping the shattered remnants of my soul shifted thirty i screamed raw and pained and it was real my agony was joined by a womans startled cry and the sudden wailing of a baby my face plowed into a tile floor and my arms and legs went askew flat on my stomach i lay on cold tile and burned the saltladen air cauterizing my skin above me the drafts from biss wing beats burned across my shoulders and i moaned make it stop please help her the gargoyle cried out and i sobbed with relief when he settled beside me and it was only the salt in the air that burned my skin i was on fire and i tried to move the slippery sheen sliding under me my god rachel it was trent and i started to cry bis had found me and taken me to trent i couldnt get up every breath hurt someone was having hysterics and lucyit had to be lucywas crying at the top of her lungs frightened by the noise shes burned bis was saying and my body started to shake as i curled into a ball she was in the lines i felt her burning and it woke me up i found her got her out please pick her up she needs help i sucked in the air in giant heaves recognizing the sound of surf over the unmistakable commotion of a frightened woman being ushered out i was with trent where were we ms morgan bis babbled and a spasm shook me when his clawed hand touched me and the broken lines of san francisco exploded in me bis dont touch her trent shouted and a door shut the crying baby and the woman were gone her aura is gone bis said and i sobbed in relief when his fingers fell away oh god it hurt someone needs to hold her give her an aura thats why i brought her to you i saw your aura in the kitchen its the same as hers her mind might not know the difference she really hurts mr kalamack please i slowly began to realize that i was out of the lines bis had found me and pulled me out but i was raw my soul was leaking i had no aura to protect it i was dying but at least i was in the sun i was in the sun with bis i tried to open my eyes a crack seeing green tile and the soft movement of a white curtain bis had found me when no one else knew i was in danger he was awake in the sun and as i lay on the floor of the seaside patio my heart seemed to break hed bonded with me and now i was going to die it was so unfair the air shifted and the breath in me hissed over my teeth as the salt in it burned my sweat had gone cold and i shivered as trents black slippers scuffed to a halt and he dropped to his knees before me his hands outstretched but afraid to touch me there was a bloody stick beside me and horror trickled through me as i realized it was my arm i wasnt soaking in sweat but blood please make it stop hurting i whispered then gasped when trent turned me over and lifted me into his arms the twin sensations of fire and ice flashed like a cracked whip over my skin and i clenched my body gasping as his auratrents aura golden and hazycame between me and the world the burning eased and i looked up at him lungs heaving the air hurt but i couldnt get enough in me kusox was going to win i was going to die i felt it is she going to be okay bis said and i smelled cinnamon and wine warm from the sun trents aura wasnt enough and i felt bits of me flaking off but it gave me enough relief so that i could breathe its better right ms morgan the gargoyle asked shifting from foot to foot just inside my narrow range of vision his red eyes turned to trent can you fix her i dont know the arms under me shifted and a blissful coolness sifted over me like shaded sand i hissed at the scraping sensation my eyes closing he smelled like hot wine and all my muscles relaxed i was leaking more than blood my thoughts and memories were flaking from me every time the wind blew but you have to bis said and i heard a bird crying far away my eyes were burning and the trails of tears were like fire on my cheeks you simply have to thats why i brought her here trent shifted and i stifled a groan shes lost a lot of it he said mine cant keep her alive until she starts to make her own again it he meant my aura and i began shuddering in earnest unable to stop my muscles were seizing and everything was going cold even the fire licking what was left of my soul my body was shutting down i couldnt stop it but you made her do this bis exclaimed you made her believe she could you cant just let her die there was silence and i felt trents grip on me tighten rachel rachel it was the silence that got my attention and i managed to open an eye a bit what i breathed glad the pain had eased no one should die in pain the blessing of angels trent looked worried a smear of blood on his face i almost smiled he was worried about me he grimaced and my vision narrowed to almost nothing hold on he said his voice sounding like he was in cotton i have to set you down for a second ill be right back the beautiful haze i was in vanished and agony split between my thought and reason i gasped as he shifted me to the floor he was leaving and my heart thudded wildly eyes open i frantically looked for him seeing bis staring down at me his eyes as big as saucers his wings and ears were pinned back his tail was wrapped around his clawed feet and he was as black as midnight scared to death i smiled at him and he turned to trent fear in his eyes mr kalamack he exclaimed and then trent was back frowning as he knelt beside me i could feel his aura and i wanted to roll into it but i couldnt make anything move foolish witch trent was muttering as he kneeled by me there was a little cap on his head and he was arranging a thin ribbon to drape around his neck and down his front he was wearing an odd shirt red in front white in backvery unlike him and then i realized it wasnt redit was soaked in my blood why didnt you just give him the curse and banish him he finished i did my hand stretched out and though it burned as if a dog was chewing on it i managed to edge it into his aura bliss slipped into my fingers and i started to cry i wanted it and it was so close smelling of cinnamon and the shadows under trees he dragged me into a line with him i said the tears burning me he was eating my soul pick me up oh god just pick me up again that would account for its shredded look the soggy warmth under me was getting cold and i moaned in relief as trent gathered me back to him pulling me into his lap and setting my back to his front almost covering my entire body with his aura my eyes opened a bit and i felt my heart slowing as his aura lapped about me he was reading from something his lips moving i could feel elven magic seeping out of the earth and into me but it didnt matter it was too late what did you want to be when you grew up i asked we were innocent once how could it have gone so bad trents attention flicked to me his worried frown becoming one of shock a tailor they were the only men who could order my father around rachel listen to me i think im dying i whispered and trent shifted my weight closer to him you are he said no emotion at all in his words heavy and hot the tears slid down my face i know i said for all the agony for all the heartache i wasnt ready to go yet but i couldnt stop it there was just nothing left to hold me together trents aura wasnt enough im sorry trent was saying but i wasnt really listening i was trying to blink the tears away enough so that i could see the wind moving the fabric of the sun shelter hanging between me and the sky i cant fix you not like this your soul isnt sending out enough of an aura to convince your mind that you are still alive and mine isnt making enough of an impression your body is shutting down yeah i know i said breathily staring up at the blue and white my god it was beautiful those colors up there bis was crying i could hear him and i pulled my attention from the sky wanting to tell him it was okay my gaze found trents instead and he grimaced grabbing my chin with a hand and forcing me to look at him when my focus slid away pay attention he said and i thought it rather rude im going to put your soul in a bottle until it heals biss sobs hesitated and i blinked with that little hat and ribbon around his neck he looked vulnerable and scholarly like a priest and a rabbi all mixed up and all the better for it it was kind of cute whhaaat i slurred and then fear hit me as his words took on meaning he wanted to put my soul in a bottle like the one al had the soul had been in there so long it had gone insane elves could do that too why not they would have to be smart to survive a war with the demons even if they were almost extinct the demons were on the verge of extinction themselves trent turned away watching his hand as he dumped the milk out of a nearby baby bottle his head lifted as the door opened someone gasped and trents lips pressed into a thin line get out he shouted then wait call tell them shes gone into cardiac arrest and isnt breathing yes sir the cool masculine voice said and the door shut a baby was crying in the distance or maybe that was me at least the burning had stopped i couldnt feel a thing but im still breathing i said it was taking forever for anything to make sense i winced as trent shifted me farther up into his arms so he could see the little book he was holding in front of us you wont be in a minute he said and bis took a breath in alarm as soon as your soul leaves it your body is going to shut down i thought about that as trent started to hum the sound going deep into my psyche and setting my blood to slow elven magic stirred rising like fog in a dusky meadow tingling and heavy it didnt hurt like the ley lines did and my muscles grew slack suddenly my eyes opened wide youre going to kill me i exclaimed and the magic faltered as trents humming cut off ill keep it alive get it on life support your soul needs to regain its strength it can do that in a bottle and when it does ill put it back in he began humming again rocking me the prick of wild magic tingled across me heady and slow until a thought pinged against the muzzy softness and shredded it into pinpricks you can do that i asked and the magic broke you want to put me in a baby bottle the humming stopped youre going to have to trust me ive been practicing this but i need your consent im not good enough to do this without it i blinked up at him trying to understand my breath came in and out and trent waited impatience in his eyes how many times have you done this i asked and had it work never but ive only tried it with birds and they are rather stupid be quiet ive got to concentrate i felt like i was floating you want my permission to kill me he sighed and bis shifted his wings nervously yes trent said i was numb his magic already having taken hold it was either that or i was dying in his arms okay i said closing my eyes and he sighed again but it was differentas if he finally believed i trusted him the world got spongy and black as the humming evolved into words i couldnt understand the vowels deep in his throat and the pitch rising and falling in unexpected beauty it was the wind in the leaves given voice and the movement of the stars in the heavens and i started to cry again as i remembered the elf under the arch singing me to sleep tislan tislan ta na shay cooreen na da he sang the words circling going around and around in my head pulling energy into existence from his soul not a ley line and giving my thoughts something to hide behind from the pain his voice coated me in soothing darkness my heart slowed until it decided to stop but i didnt care i didnt hurt anymore and trents aura was warm so very warm thirtyone i looked at my hands as they pressed the cookie cutter into the dough realizing that id been making cookies for quite a whilebut not consciously aware of it it was as if id been sleepwalking maybe i still was a pleasant sense of lassitude lay heavily on me and i used a pancake turner to carefully set the cut cookie smelling like milk onto the baking tray i was making trees but it didnt feel like the solstice it was too warm setting the cutter down i shifted a second cookie to the tray then hesitated the one id just put there was gone my head came up and i calmly looked at the sink the light beyond the window was too bright to see anything the ceiling too was a hazy white as well as the floor i didnt see my feet down there but it didnt bother me how odd i said going to look out the window but it was as if the sun had washed out the world i turned unafraid as i realized that the wall against which ivy had her big farm table pushed was gone too the table was there but the wall was a hazy white mist that didnt bother me either it had been like that for a long timeid just now noticed was all even the sight of the unmarked circle of cookie dough and the empty cookie tray was okay id been making cookies forever unconcerned i went to the center counter and cut out another it didnt matter i hummed as i moved cookies to an empty tray the same tune going around and around in my head ta na shay cooreen na da it spun over and over and i moved to it feeling good with it in my head i didnt know what it meant but it didnt hurt and not hurting was good it was awfully quiet for my kitchen though so often full of pixy chatter and after setting another cookie on the empty tray i looked back at the hazy wall there was a dark spot on it about eight inches tall a few inches wide at chest height i squinted trying to decide if it was getting closer kisten i thought and it took on a masculine outline wavering like a heat mirage but the shoulders werent broad enough for him maybe it was jenks but there was no sparkle of pixy dust and besides jenks wasnt that tall the figures arms moved as it paced forward becoming my size taking on a sudden flash of color it stepped into my kitchen trent i said in surprise as he shook off the mist looking refreshed and collected in a pair of black slacks and a lightweight shortsleeved shirt clean and bright and well pressed not really he said and i wiped the flour from my hands on an apron i hadnt realized i was wearing well sort of he amended then shrugged you tell me im your subconscious my lips parted and i looked again at the floor that wasnt there and the ceiling that wasnt there either you put my soul in a bottle i said surprised i wasnt scared trent sat on ivys table and leaned forward to snatch a bit of cookie dough from the perfect circle waiting to be cut i didnt im just a figment of your imagination your mind not me is creating all of this to cushion itself frowning i focused on him so i could imagine ivy standing there instead i said thinking of her and trent chuckled licking the last of the sweetness from his fingers no trent is trying to reach you thats why im here bits of him are getting through just not enough but i already knew that seeing as he was simply a part of my subconscious voicing what i was figuring out the instant i was realizing it it was a weird way to have a conversation trent slid from the table and came around to me his hands were outstretched and i backed up when he got too close what the hell are you doing i said giving him a shove and trent rocked back his arms dropping trying to kiss you he said why i said peeved god dreams were weird trent is trying to get your soul back in your body trent said looking mildly embarrassed he cant do it unless you agree oh yeah elven magic it worked by persuasion and trickery sounded about right and a kiss is the only way to show agreement i mocked putting the center counter between us the floor had shown up looking faded and scratched my soul was starting to put things together hey how long have i been in here i asked and trent shrugged apparently my subconscious didnt know looking unconcerned trent picked up the cookie cutter you want to leave right i eyed him standing in my kitchen and i wondered if he really looked that good or if my subconscious was adding to his sex appeal yes i said coming closer he handed me the spatula we have to work together i figured he meant more than making cookies but i slid the spatula under the cut dough and moved it to the tray i want to leave isnt that enough a second cookie joined the first and my eyebrows rose the first one hadnt vanished this time now youre getting it trent said then seemed to shudder youve been in here three days he said his visage losing its clean pressed look and becoming haggard his hand working the cookie cutter was swollen and he was missing two digits on his right hand a very white bandage hiding the damage i hadnt imagined him looking like that it was something outsideimpinging on me trent i said backing up in alarm and his posture slumped his eyes were red rimmed and tired and his hair was limp and straggly he was still wearing his black slacks and black shirt but they were wrinkled as if hed been wearing them for days yes he said his gaze rising to the ceiling its me i didnt think i was talking to my subconscious anymore and i set the spatula down my alarm turned into fear whats happening his eyes landed on me and i clasped my arms around my middle im trying to get you out but ive run into an unexpected snag you said you could do this i exclaimed and he took a breath his expression a mix of irritation and embarrassment oh my god is my body dead i squeaked and he shook his head raising a hand in protest your body is fine he said looking at his hand and the missing digits its in a private room and im sitting right next to it its just my foreboding grew deeper what i said flatly he looked up grimacing as if in distaste its a very old charm he said i didnt have much choice you were dying all i had with me was one very stressed young gargoyle and the ancient texts id been playing with ive been studying them for the last six months trying to find the truth in the uh fairy tale what is the problem trent i said i could smell him now sort of a sour wine maybe vinegar scent ah i think it would help if you kissed me he said not embarrassed but irritated i dropped back a step excuse me he turned away and cut out another cookie you knowthe kiss that breaks the spell and wakes the uh girl its elven magic theres no figuring these things out whoa hold up i exclaimed as it suddenly made sense you mean like loves first kiss that isnt going to happen i dont love you he frowned seeing that the cookie he had moved onto the tray had vanished the two id placed were still there though it doesnt have to be loves first kiss he said that was someone trying to write a good story but it does have to be an honest one almost angry he spun back to me the pancake turner in his new awkward grip my god rachel am i so distasteful to you that you cant tolerate one kiss to save your life no i said taken aback but i dont love you and i couldnt fake that did i no i didnt i was really sure about that he took a breath and held it as he thought about that for all of three seconds good he said handing me the spatula good so if you just kiss me we can get you out of here i took the spatula as he held it out edging closer to move a third cookie to the tray kiss you huh i said and he sighed here in your subconscious he said no one will ever know except us his eyes met mine and a small smirk started youve been doing it in your dreams since you were ten i frowned setting a fourth cookie on the tray have not grow up he set the cookie cutter down facing me in expectation and a nervous thrill spun through me kiss trent okay maybe the thought had occurred to me once or twice but not as anything that id ever do apart from curiosity maybe because he looked good maybe more so with the stubble and the heavy weariness on him there was no wayi mean he was trent and i hated him okay not hated anymore but a kiss stop it rachel i thought wiping my hands on my apron and turning to him he was too close and i shivered when his hands slid around my waist i suppose a peck on the cheek wont do i said as he started to lean in he was just a shade taller than me and i was suddenly a hundred times more nervous he practiced wild magic and he could sing his enemies to death or my soul into a bottle he was dangerous now tantalizingly dangerous whereas before hed been simply annoying and my pulse increased i stiffened and his motion toward me hesitated sorry he said and he pulled me close i was as nervous as all hell and i didnt know what to do with my hands they felt funny at his hips but i left them therethe best of a bad situation my eyes closed when he got too close and the smell of cinnamon and wine hit me it pulled my head up and with a startled brush our lips met his touch was light on mine as if afraid or more likely reluctant a bare hint of pressure and then he leaned in his hands on me pulling me to him his lips moved against mine and i still stood there my heart pounding as i tasted himoak and leaf sun on moving water the prick of wild magic raced over my skin like a shimmer of electricity enticing warning me even as i felt it pull a response from me breath held i relaxed my grip on him finding my hands moving shaping to him becoming natural okay this wasnt so bad encouraged my head tilted pulling away from him with the unsaid language of lovers that demanded he follow and he did spinning a thrill through me from his lips to my toes my pulse jumped and i pushed against him my body molding itself to him breath catching he responded his good hand lifted to touch my face his fingers light on my jaw but hinting for more a slip of tongue touched mine and a thought rose like a bubble oh my god im kissing trent making a small noise i pulled back heart pounding as i looked at him this isnt working i said my lips cool where he had been i was tingling everywhere and wild magic was making his eyes flash in anger because im the one doing everything here he said reaching forward hey i yelped but hed grabbed my arm and pulled me back to him its like the cookies he said as his bandaged hand encircled my waist youre not helping give me something back to show your agreement what the hell do i have to do rip your clothes off i snapped then gasped as he yanked my hip right into him trent i protested but the word was muffled as he found my mouth wild magic lit through me burning not with fire but warmth it raced like flash paper flowing to my chi overflowing and tingling to my fingertips oh my god i mumbled and my hands once splayed behind me for balance reached to find his hair i wanted to touch its silky smoothness id been dying to do so for years his body was against my entire length and i pushed from the counter slamming his back into the fridge our lips parted upon impact and my eyes opened he was inches away watching me daring me hed pulled passion from me and now id have to own up to it no one will know i said and blood pounded through me when he nodded i wont tell anyone he said a smile lifting his lips why the hell not i thought and then i tilted my head and kissed him back giving in i pressed into him my hands feeling his outline his stubble rough against me as our breaths found a rhythm both slow and building memories flitted through me of him in that silly hat as he held me while i died his white face when he realized hed summoned kusox to kill the pixies and id already taken care of the problem his fear in carew towers elevator when it opened and he saw me standing there with al his terror at camp as he leaned over me and begged me to breathe after id knocked the air out of myself and he thought i was dying his tongue touched mine and this time i pushed forward pulling him closer my leg went around his and i demanded more running my hands through his hair enjoying its silky softness enjoying the feel of his hands on my body tingles arcing through me slowly i let go of the last of my reservations feeling his energy spill into my chi kindling it back to brightness he started to pull away but i wouldnt let him reaching out and pulling him back i wanted more he could have everything just give mea little more tinks pink dildo all that money and he can kiss too came a highpitched sarcastic voice and the clatter of pixy wings my breath caught and i felt myself drop into nothing my lips on trents stopped moving and i realized i could smell disinfectant my eyes flew open i was sitting upright in a hospital bed my arms wrapped around trent as he sat beside me my hands were buried in his hair and his hands were curved around me holding my backsiderather tightly you little prick i shouted smacking him trent sucked in his breath and fell back the sharp crack was startling and jenks laughed merrily dripping a bright silver dust as he flew backward to ivy sitting calmly in a nearby chair damn it she was smiling at me her eyes bright with unshed tears she was okay they both were my face flamed as i realized they had seen meenjoying myself enjoying trent but they were okay and a knot of fear loosened you said it was only in my imagination i exclaimed turning back to trent as he stood up and the bed shifted you said no one would know my eyes darted to the cold feel of metal around my wrist and what is this there was a band of charmed silver on me no wonder my head hurt i was cut off from the ley lines dont take it off jenks shrilled as i tried to push it over my wrist and i let go of it frightened by his fervor maybe my aura wasnt healed enough to tap a line looking unruffled trent tugged his shirt straight the bright imprint of my hand on his stubbled face there was a large bruise on the other side spreading up under his hairline looking ugly his right hand was bandaged and my anger dissolved when i saw that he was missing two fingers just like in my dream what had happened would you have kissed me if you had known it was real he asked and when i simply stared at him my face flaming he turned on his heel ivy jenks he said looking stiff as he reached for a cane its been a pleasure my jaw dropped when his pace was awkward and then i saw his foot in a cast trent wait i called but he kept walking his back stiff and his neck red jenks and ivy exchanged a heavy look and i tried to get up failing trent im sorry for slapping you come back please thank you for getting me out of there dont make me crawl after you im sorry damn it im sorry he stopped his arm stiffly holding open the wide hospital door the hall noise slipped in both familiar and hated and thenhe let the door shut and turned back around i exhaled falling back against the raised bed shaking in exhaustion hey rache jenks buzzed close whats it like being dead a lot like being a sixties housewife what happened trent said id been out for three days three days where was pierce and bis my attention shot to the top of the wardrobe and a new fear joined the rest when i found him there the gargoyle was sleeping an exhausted pale gray with a baby bottle in his tight grip but what scared me was that id known where he was even though i was cut off from the ley lines my eyes had gone right to him bis had saved me our fates were bound together and there was nothing i could do about it hed chosen me and now i was responsible for him for life ivy stood and i wasnt surprised when she leaned over the bed and gave me a hug shocking me from my thoughts the spicy scent of vampire soaked into me better than a calming spell i smiled up at her warmth feeling loved welcome back she whispered and then she pulled away her eyes black and tearful i have to go but ill come back when your dinner tray is here youre leaving i said not liking how my voice wobbled my gaze darted between her and bis why jenks and i have something to do she said giving the pixy a pointed look jenks hovered between us spilling a red dust his hands were on his hips in his best peter pan pose like what he shot at her weve done nothing but sit here for three days while youve moaned and pissed over rachel and now that shes awake you want to leave my gaze went to trent standing by the window his back to us yes ivy said and i jumped when she gathered my blankets and pulled them up around me hiding my arms they were pink as if i had a sunburn ivy and jenks looked okay but trent was a mess bis looked kind of gaunt too i was afraid to look in a mirror i had been bleeding from my pores and trent had saved me maybe twice maybe three times seeing my worry ivy started to drift back see you around rache jenks said humming loudly as ivy gave me a last touch on the shoulder and walked out her boots clattering confidently on the tile i remembered hearing them in my dreams their cadence frightened and hesitant the noise from the hall grew loud then soft then silent my eyes went to my band of charmed silver rising to find trent when the memory of that kiss made my face warmuntil my gaze dropped to his cast then rose to take in his hand he was missing two fingers i was missing three days thank you i whispered but what i wanted to say was what happened trents silhouette stiffened his back still to me you said that he said softly i tried to shift my weight farther up the pillow and the blanket that ivy had tucked around me fell down im sorry for slapping you i added still he didnt turn you said that too his voice was low and soft and i remembered him singing to me in words i didnt understand holding my soul together grimacing i tried again uh youre a good kisser it was nice his bandaged hand shifted behind his back as he turned to me wonder in his expression is that why you asked me to stay i managed a thin smile no but i figured youd turn around if i said it he frowned his thoughts somewhere else and i added youre supposed to say im a good kisser too at that he chuckled but his smile faded fast awkward he moved to an empty chair one not as close to me as ivys was but here nevertheless his eyes flicked to bis as he sat down and then a heavy sigh escaped him a world of hurt in the sound you want to know what happened he said flatly more of a statement than a question i fingered the band of braided silver around my wrist it was heavy more substantial than the one id had on in alcatraz a faint tingling came from it not ley line in origin wild elven magic i flushed again remembering the kiss remembering letting his magic flow through me kindling my chi back to life my gaze went to bis wishing he would wake up he looked so sad up there holding that bottle that had once held my soul i remember you singing my soul into that bottle i said i dont remember you being hurt a shudder lifted through him the sun went down al came his eyes met mine the green of them almost gray in the light he saw you braindead he wasupset guilt went through me oh upset hell id be willing to bet he was furious and looking for someone to take it out on damn trent was lucky to be alive trent leaned back his hands going to cradle his knee as he crossed his legs id go as far as to say he was very upset he said looking at his hand it was my fault naturally i was the one who freed kusox and because he couldnt take me to the everafter he decided to take me apart and move me there bit by bit my god i whispered seeing his missing fingers in a new way vivian tried to stop him worry pulled my heartbeat into a faster pace no shes in intensive care trent said and i eased back into the pillow not relieved but not as frightened shell be okay he added his eyes on the floor undoubtedly reliving it im sorry trent wiped his face in an unusual show of agitation and i remembered the feel of his bristles on me you were braindead he never noticed the bottle bis took you your soul and hid it away as far as al knows you are still dead he was looking at my sunburned arms and the band of charmed silver and i saw it in a new way al thought i was dead you bested him i said and trent gave a bark of laughter it was a bitter angry sound and it struck through me cold bested him he said uncrossing his legs we survived and that was because of pierce again fear took me trent had said al thought i was dead al was still alive where is pierce i asked already knowing the answer trent stood turning to the window i couldnt read his tells i was afraid to pierce knew you were alive in the bottle he said softly the hospital noise coming in faintly he also knew that i was the only one who could get you safely out if i died you would die trent turned his head bowed looking nothing like himself in his wrinkled clothes and with his hair unstyled pierce doesnt like me much but he took the blame said he was the one who caused your death by his failure to protect you and keep kusox from taking you into the lines al dropped me and took him instead my face lost its expression pierce had sacrificed himself to save me panicked i sat up swinging my feet to get out of bed and coming to a frustrated halt damn it i had a catheter wheres my mirror i asked knowing he wouldnt have it i started pulling at the silver around my wrist again i have to talk to al trents face was empty of emotion when he turned back to me he did it because he loves you i pity him al wont kill him i said frantically not knowing if it was true hell be okay shaking his head trent smiled sadly i dont pity him because hes a demon familiar i pity him because he loves you i took a breath to say something but couldnt exhale damn it hed sacrificed himself so that i would live he knew i didnt love him and hed done it anyway ii i stammered fingering the band of silver around my wrist it was humming with wild magic slumbering deep within it i could feel it i looked up at trent confused al saw you comatose trent said he told the demon collective perhaps you should keep it that way this is why i gave you the charmed silver it was a chance for me to he hesitated sighing as he sat back down his head was bowed over his knees and his eyes were on his handshis beautiful hands now broken and marred he might never be able to work some of the finer leyline charms again and i shivered my father made you into a tool to save the elven race he said softly his voice pained it saved your life but took it from you at the same time by making you into something that most people would deem too dangerous to live his head came up and he met my gaze squarely i dont know why but i feel responsible for everything you werent given a choice and im sorry for that you didnt do anything i said my mouth dry and your father saved my life by twisting it to his own ends without asking your permission trent exhaled i wanted to give you your choice back thats all i followed his gaze to the band of silver around my wrist thats all that was everything its not a normal zip strip trent said as he straightened up from his hunch over his knees it doesnt simply cut off your contact to the lines but to the demon collective as well otherwise they would know you were alive even if you shunned the lines for the rest of your life my lips parted in understanding if al had seen me comatose and i was cut off from the collective then i was as good as dead free you can do earth magic still and leyline magic will work on you like any human but demon magic wont if it goes through the collective trent said and i brought my wandering thoughts back to him curses wont touch me i said and he nodded his expression more earnest and open than id ever seen it it was as if he was down to his bare essence too tired and beaten to hide it i didnt do it to protect you i did it because my father made you into something and unless you choose to be that person then you are nothing but a tool you are not a tool rachel he said earnestly almost frighteningly you are a person you can stay as you are and be well not normal but as close as you can get to it seeing that the coven has denounced you as a daywalking demon or you can take the charmed silver off and be who you really are its up to you its your choice he was silent and still now and i looked at the band circling it around and around my red wrist i was a daywalking demon who couldnt do magic but i could feel wild magic in me simmering was it coming from the band of silver or had it been there all the time and i only now noticed it now that my contact with the ley lines was utterly and absolutely cut off isnt that what you wanted trent said not understanding my silence a choice i took a deep breath pulling my gaze up as i gathered my thoughts yes yes it is i said and he smiled weakly thank you it was what i wanted what i had always wanted so why did it feel so empty thirtytwo trents long black car pulled up to the curb a soft hush in the dark in an instant ivy was reaching for the handle the front passengers door opened and she was standing in the street her eyes on the churchs steeple looking back in she glanced first at quen then at trent sitting in the back with me and bis lucy in her car seat between us thanks for the ride trent quen she said her voice low but sincere and then she was gone boot heels clicking on the nightcooled pavement visibly shaking off being too far from home for too long vampires truly were the homebodies of inderland society and it had been hard on her in ways i could never imagine that trent had chartered a specially designed lowflying jet to get us home in hours not days had been a godsend tell your pilot his pressure control still sucks jenks said through the open window in parting and then darted to join ivy giving me a toothy grin bis hopped to the open sunroof and launched himself after them and into the dark i held a hand to my head to keep my hair from flying around in the draft from his wings and lucy frowned in her sleep her hand flashing out as if she was falling together jenks ivy and bis ascended the stairs in the dark pulling the heavy oak doors open to let out a flood of light and pixies i glanced at the headacheinducing cloud of silk and gossamer then settled back in the soft leather reluctant to get outeven as glad as i was to get home a flash of liquid light turned into jenks darting to the steeple as he checked in with the pixy on sentry duty i heard a sharp wing chirp and a highpitched harangue start jenks wasnt happy about something more reason to just sit for a moment with the sound of clicking metal quen undid his seat belt and got out there were kids shouting somewhere in the next street over and the revving of a car engine the trunk whined open and i shifted my new shoulder bag onto my lap i didnt know what had happened to my old one my phone was gone but at least vivian had given me my scrying mirrorfor what it was worth thanks for the ride home i said to trent softly so as not to wake lucy dont mind jenks the pressure was fine smiling trent tucked a blanket with the disney logo under lucys chin she squirmed but didnt wake it was my pleasure the honey seemed to do the trick yup ivy was yelling at jenks who had dropped back down into the church by the sound of itsomething about leaving his kids alone and that theyd done okay angels and ass seemed to figure into the conversation sighing i looked at the light spilling from the church i was tired and getting out of the car only meant more work i know ive said it before but thank you for lucy trent said i turned to trent then smiled at her pouting in her sleep my gaze flicked back to him and i studied his love for her honest and irrefutable on his face he was different less confident softer or maybe i was just seeing him that way shes beautiful i said readjusting her blanket the thumps from the trunk were obvious and i reached for the door ceri is due any day now trent said and i wondered if he was trying to get me to stay a moment longer but with lucy there first ceris baby will be the second born i slumped back curious lucy is the ranking elf of the next generation not ceris baby his new softness vanished and he eyed me steadily i meant it when i said youd have a say in it tugging my new jacket closer i tried to make light of it you mean like i have to babysit or something i was thinking more like godmother my nervous mirth changed to alarm oh jeez a demonic godmother feeling ill i glanced at him okay yes id like that thank you its an honor i said not sure this was a good idea but gratified nevertheless i had trents trust and it was apparently an allornothing affair and i guesshe had mine i jumped when my door opened quen standing ready with my two suitcases and garment bag at the curb they had canceled my brothers wedding since my mom had been stuck in jail while san francisco rocked and rolled robbie was never going to forgive me and i wasnt invited to the new wedding next month giving trent a last smile and lucy a fond touch on her toes i got out quen helped me arrange one suitcase over my shoulder and handed me my garment bag never unzipped the entire trip thanks quen i said when his pockmarked weathered face curled up in a smile tell ceri i said hi leaning in i whispered and sorry about the ranking elfbaby thing he laughed making the dark street seem comforting she doesnt care he said the two of them are to be raised as sisters though they dont share a drop of common blood hesitating he looked to the churchs open door as a stream of noise flowed out would you like some help getting this in thinking trent had to be anxious to get home i shook my head i got it thanks leaning down i grinned at trent through the window surprised hed shifted seats and was now in mine thanks for everything i raised a hand the circle of charmed silver catching the light youre uh a lifesaver oh god id said it and whats more i think i meant it trent flushed in the dim light of the cars interior thank you i appreciate that then as if hed been waiting for the apology he reached into an inner coat pocket and extended an envelope i looked at it suspiciously shifting the weight of my small carryon what is it if you dont want it he said and i snatched it sometimes trents envelopes had money in them its from the withons he said as i tore it open and saw a check a nice check six months worth of check damn it would pay for a new car to replace the one id cracked up on the bridge and then some its restitution for the trouble they put you through trent said bringing my attention up to see him smiling in a rather devious way and i tucked the money in my back pocket this would help a lot not to mention that it would be the only monetary recompense i was likely going to get for ridding san francisco of kusox course the demon had destroyed a huge chunk of the tenderloin but that area could use a little sprucing up did you make them do this i asked wincing at the shrill pixy harangue filtering out ahhhh its good to be home trents expression went from sly to gratified you did good he said fingers resting gently on lucy have you given any more thought what you still want me to work for you im pretty much useless i said feeling the charmed silver heavy on my wrist that trent said his eyes flicking to the braided bit of charmed silver i told you it was a choice just say the word and ill tell you the charm to break it we can talk at lucys birthday party you like clowns my mouth dropped open and quen edged away from me you are not subjecting that sweet little girl to clowns i exclaimed chuckling trent settled back in the car take care rachel he said as the window started to go up dont be afraid to call me we can teach lucy how to ride riding right you take care tootrent i said not knowing if it felt odder saying it or meaning it the last ten days had been educational the man was clever intelligent and utterly lacking in someone he could justtalk to he was never himself even with ceri it had to be a lonely way to live but it wasnt my problem and i gave quen a small wave and turned to the church i didnt wait for them to leave just picked up my suitcases and headed for the stairs jenks met me halfway up fairies he shrilled in the garden now i stammered heart pounding yes i mean no he shouted flying backward as i hesitated on the steps they attacked two days ago is everyone okay i asked my gaze going to the steeple seeing bis there now the glint of his red eyes and his relaxed posture telling me everything was fine trents window rolled down and leaning out he asked is there a problem concerned i said jenks says we were attacked two days ago quen paused with his hand on the door exchanging a look with trent was the coven still at it theyd pardoned me and even though they were mad at trent for having released kusox they werent going to do anything about it lest trent retaliate with something worse i was eating tinkblasted cotton candy while fairies were attacking my children jenks said dripping a red dust a faint smile touched quens face and giving me a nod he got in the car trent though was still leaning out the window perhaps quen should look over your security before we go he said then ducked back into the car quen met my startled gaze sitting behind the wheel but with the door still open sahan jenks was a bright ball of irritation my security is fine he snarled but trent was talking to quen over the seat it wouldnt hurt to look around i heard him say faintly ill come in in a minute lucy needs attention he wants to come in but quen was getting out of the car his body language not confused but perhapsindulgent and it wouldnt hurt to have quen look under my bed okay sure i dont care i said and jenks rose up appalled rache he shrilled weve been gone for almost two weeks i said as i started up the steps again what can it hurt but what i was thinking was what does trent want quens door thumped shut and i waited on the threshold for him yanking the door shut behind us and dropping the suitcase in the dark foyer ivy was casually standing at the pool table sorting almost two weeks worth of mail and i relaxed something felt like it was missing though pierce we are all fine jenks was saying as i breathed in the scent of quen seeming all the stronger for the foyer being dark we dont need your help quen flashed a bright smile mr kalamack would like me to inspect the grounds his gaze shifted to ivy as if for permission wise man is that all right with you ladies ivy didnt even look up from the mail knock yourself out stay out of my room quen turned to me next and when jenks buzzed off in annoyance i asked him what is he really looking for again he smiled but it was softer this time an excuse i think great just friggin great quen brushed past me a shredded wisp of cinnamon and wine lingering in his wake im telling you were fine came jenkss irate shout as he followed him into the hallway and then the pixy darted back dripping a bright silver dust rachel he whined at me his long hair getting in his eyes there wasnt a single pixy kid in the church not unusual if their dad was on the warpath i trudged forward with my stuff go with him if you want jenks rose up and down indecisively as if on a string but when he heard the back door open and shut he darted to me flying backward as he fumed what does he want ivy asked mildly as i passed her ive no idea i had none whatsoever but i imagined that his claim of tending to lucy was an excuse so i wouldnt see him taking the steps in his cast he could make it all right but he lacked his usual grace and i knew it bothered him what happened i asked jenks as i smacked my luggage into the wall in the hallway the kids fought them off jenks admitted his dust finally starting to dampen as he followed me to my room them and that fairy girl he had almost spat out the last and i elbowed my light switch on to see his face screwed up in a nasty expression belle i asked remembering that sidereals daughter had remained behind to watch me it smelled stale in my room and leaving my garment bag and overnight case on the bed i propped the narrow stainedglass window open night sounds the scent of marigolds and the singing of pixies seeped in hands on my hips i sighed glad to be home she has a name you knew she was here jenks yelped a burst of dust lighting my perfumes well yeah i took off my jacket and hung it on my bedpost didnt you jeez jenks shes been here for months he fumed his wings drooping and his tiny features cross as i needled him relenting i tugged my closet door open and hung up my garment bag unzipping it the smell of clean fabric spilled out everyone is okay right i prompted wondering if i should be more concerned yeah he admitted but then relax i pulled the beautiful dress from the bag and hung it at the back bis i shouted sensing him up on the steeple he probably couldnt hear me but hed come anyway you dont care jenks exclaimed twin pixies rising in my dressers mirror we were attacked and you dont care of course i care i said then shut the closet door hard enough to make his dust shake but ive been trapped in a plane with you for five solid hours no one is hurt and you need to chill he was scowling at me and i lowered my voice let me catch my breath okay i pleaded a small scraping at the lintel brought my attention to the ceiling it was bis his ears pricked and expectant he hadnt been his usual self during the few days wed spent recovering on the coast before flying home there was a hesitancy between us that hadnt been there before a feeling out of new responsibilities and expectations neither of us knew what being bonded meant but i sensed where he was most of the time and he knew where i was and since we couldnt ask al or pierce what my responsibilities were to bis and his to me wed just have to figure it out as we went along him teaching me how to line jump wasnt an issue anymore so maybe the question was moot hi bis i said as jenks fumed on my dresser you want your shirt immediately he perked up slithering into my room and dropping onto my bedside table wings flat to his back i was just going to ask you for it he said sending a sliver of concern through me can you put it on me i want to show the kids he wanted to show the kids subtle phrasing but significant he was seeing himself as less of a kid and more of an adult id seen it on the jet when he settled into a watchful mode with a magazine and how he kept an eye on the people in the airport instead of being distracted by the jets or the people staring at him growing up wasnt bad but i kind of missed the old bis and his wonder at everything he still had that inquisitive good nature but now it was tempered with the knowledge that life wasnt fair and that bad things happened even if you watched for them you bet i said opening the snaps of my overnight case still in a huff jenks landed on the open lid we had spent a day at disneyland before coming home and jenks had gone a little nuts buying out a gift shop and generally acting like a chipmunk on brimstone bis had contented himself with a tourist tshirt but ivy and i sat on a curb for almost an hour waiting for jenks to come out of the tink history exhibit since then there hadnt been a single swear word using the inderlander pioneer as he now called her i pulled biss tank top out carefully folding the brightly patterned bag with tinkerbell on it after jenks started making tiny pained noises when i crumpled it up i couldnt help but wonder if we had a little crush going finally i snapped the bright red shirt to get out the wrinkles and held it up to bis i dont think were going to have to make wing slits for you i said seeing a glimpse of his old self in his delight at the screened picture of characters in the latest gargoyle flick too cool he said holding his arms up and i settled the soft cotton tank top over his head tugging gently to get it around his ears i tried to imagine him my size but failed he was still a kidand my responsibility damn how had my mom done this belle says the battle was sunday bis said his voice muffled after i left yeah jenks barked his wings moving but not lifting him at all wings i prompted and bis lifted them high so i could work the tank top around them she said a passing clan thought that jenks had died so they attacked bis said his red eyes glowing they didnt know what to do the kids i mean jih was across the street and it was noon but belle was awake and she saw them raised the alarm they would have taken the garden and killed everyone if not for belle i dropped back thinking the shirt was perfecteven if it looked odd on him there was the faint click of the front door opening and ivys soft murmur followed by the thunking of trents cast on the old oak my tension spiked trent was in my church why she saved the garden bis said as he looked at himself in my dresser mirror my perfumes were scattered about his feet and he didnt hit one as he shifted and turned took over the fight told everyone what to do kept the lines from breaking until jih could help no one got hurt except belle she took an arrow in the leg alarmed i turned to jenks i thought you said no one was hurt a fairy he said in disbelief since when are you worried about a fairy when one saves the lives of your children i said and trent thumped to a halt at my door my eyes fell from trents and i slammed my suitcase shut jenks youre ugly when you talk like that i said then turned to bis hesitating at the sight of him in a bright red shirt wheres belle i asked imagining her broken and bleeding somewhere in the garden uh the kitchen he said glancing at jenks as if the pixy was going to protest a last hard look at jenks and i started for the hallway trent was standing in the doorway with lucy smelling of fresh baby powder and baby wipes and his injured hand gently patted her as he rocked i jerked to a stop when he didnt get out of my way fast enough my eyes dropping to the floor as i flushed come on in i said softly i dont think we have anything but water but youre welcome to it he awkwardly edged back and i breathed easier ivy i called as i strode to the kitchen belles been hurt belle came from her room is she okay i think so ill let you know in a minute jenkss wings were clattering and bis was a bright spot as he crawled along the ceiling to get there before me his expression worried jenks dusted at my shoulder not coming to rest there like he might have otherwise ivy knew too he asked and i realized his somber mood wasnt because he felt bad but because he was the last to know i flipped the bright kitchen lights on squinting bis had said hed talked to her she had to be awake jenks if a fairy can hide in your garden for three months then have the grace to help your kids survive an attack dont you think you should rethink your attitude i turned to him and his defiance faltered youre going to live to be forty years old youre going to have to grow up its a small world after all or didnt you go on that ride wings silent jenks hovered dead center in the doorway at a complete loss trent edged in around him taking in the kitchen as he stood between ivys farm table and the center counter my annoyance at jenks vanished in a flash of memory a memory of trent standing in my unreal kitchen confused irritated and attractive as all hell as he tried to save my soul with a kiss and then the kiss itself burning its way through me kindling my chi back to life id been mortified when id woken up and discovered that the kiss had been realwhich didnt negate how good it had felt but did lead me back to trent standing with lucy in his arms his eyes roving over my kitchen as if comparing it to his memory flustered i turned seeing the chrysalis trapped under the brandy snifter where my mr fish had once been my beta was still in the everafter with al and i hoped the demon would remember to feed him maybe pierce would do itif he was still alive with a surprising jolt my eyes started to swim and i spun before trent could see hiding my tears by opening the window behind me wider and letting in the night air and the sound of pixies someone was mowing his lawn at halfpast midnight they dont sell lawn tractors with headlights for nothing i didnt know if my sudden emotion was relief that i was homereally homeor that id said goodbye to everything in the everafter for good a small touch on my shoulder shocked me and i stiffened to find bis standing beside the sink his eyes wide in concern as something he had no control over had set me to shaking but even his worry did nothing to help he was touching me and i couldnt feel a thing there was nothing in my mind nothing but a faint hum of elven magic coming from my wrist and i missed the ley lines even as i relished the freedom i now had im fine i whispered to him then squared my shoulders and turned slowly on my heel belle i warbled and jenks stared at me like id gone nuts when i wiped the back of my hand over my eye trent made no comment but he gingerly sat on the edge of ivys chair his foot in the cast tucked under it a ping at the rack over the center counter drew all our attention up and jenks flushed swearing and dusting an embarrassed red when a tiny whitehaired head showed over my smallest spell pot the one with the dent in it i still didnt know how it had gotten there the dent not the pot welcome back rachel came belles curious hissing accent sounding like crickets have a good vacation my eyes darted to trent thinking of the wingless fairies he now had in his garden if he hadnt known theyd come from me he soon would ive had better i said head craning are you okay jenks said there was a fight jenks made a small sound as a thin line dropped from the bowl and belle snaked down it she looked odd in a bright pink pixy dress that was too short for her and i glanced at jenks on the spigot his arms crossed and standing almost sideways so he wouldnt have to face her im fine she said smacking her bare leg and the bandage there its going to take a few more days before i can pull my longbow with any strength but ill mend if i live or die doesnt matter we held our territory her eyes went to bis on top of the fridge and she smiled i like the shirt thanks i did a double take at the soft shyness in his voice jenks had heard it too and cleared his throat making bis blush a deep black your territory belle amended thinking thats what jenks had taken offense to i wasnt so sure wings clattering jenks landed beside her his eyes went to her bandage then her face she looked like a longarmed sinewy amazon next to him uh thank you he said grudgingly glancing nervously at trent but the man was more interested in the spell pots over the counter his hand gently patting lucy as she slept i should have said that first off belles sparse eyebrows rose and he added thanks for telling them what to do theyre good kids but he tried again you saved their lives pleasestay in my garden if you like even as hesitant and possessive as that had been i looked at bis in wonder the gargoyle was grinning accepting jenkss change of heart with a quickness only a kid could possess id be a little more hesitant but jenks wouldnt say anything unless he meant it belles long features were pale and out of place with the pixy colors on her your hair is getting long she said shortly her tone giving nothing away jenkss hand went up to touch it yeah well i dont have anyone to cut it anymore i wondered how these two warriors were going to find a way to exist together belle finally nodded her acceptance of his apology but clearly was withholding complete judgment feeling awkward i opened the fridge and cringed yep we were down to water ketchup and a tub of butter maybe i could make trent a virgin bloody mary we had some worcestershire sauce too anyone want to order pizza i said softly wondering how long it would take for quen to check out the graveyard i do bis chimed out and i ducked when jenkss kids swarmed in from the garden and hallway shouting out their toppings their highpitched voices woke up lucy and she began to wail frightened bis pinned his ears to his skull and made the jump to the top of the fridge trent frowned as he tried to calm lucy but the pixy girls were humming over her and scaring her even more clearly they had been eavesdropping and the lure of pizza had overridden their fear of their dad nasturtium blossoms jenks i exclaimed as i shut the fridge door and he shrugged belle too had sat down her bored expression clearly saying that it wasnt her problem youve had nothing but pizza for a week she complained her voice loud to be heard over the noise i would have thought youd be tired of it by now pizza jenks exclaimed what about all the good food i put aside his voice faltered never mind he finished scowling at bis and the gargoyle went three shades darker in embarrassment i want you all out he shouted and the noise was cut by about half leaving only lucy crying out and watching that elf in the garden but papa one of his younger daughters complained hes only sitting in the car that figured and i gave trent a sidelong glance check out my property huh make sure everything is safe eh what do you want trent i sighed as it struck me that this was the way id begun this mess standing in my kitchen and wondering what trent wanted go all of you jenks said pointing and they flowed from the kitchen a mix of complaints and shouted topping requests asleep when the garden was invaded youd all be dead if not for belle what have you been doing all week watching tv jenks crabbed as the last of them left lucys blanket was almost slipping from her and i wanted to go tuck it back around her trent had given her a pacifier and lucy was wideeyed in his arms quiet but sucking on it with a vengeance angry almost it brought a smile to my face the sound of ivys boots was loud as she came in having changed into lots of leather hand on her hip and posture screaming sexual domination she gave trent the onceover as he sat in her chair the angry frustrated baby on his lap seemed to grant him some immunity and she turned away with only the slightest widening of her pupils im going out you going to be okay she asked across the kitchen trents posture seemed to relax which only tightened mine he wanted to talk to me alone great we had just spent five hours in a little tin can flying through the air couldnt he have brought it up then go i wiggled my fingers for the pizza coupons stuck to the fridge and she handed them to me if youre sure she prompted and my eyes met hers sending a shock of realization through me we were home and though everything had changed we were still solid better even you really want to stay for pizza i asked and she took a backward step to the hallway smiling as well to tell me she knew it too no see you after sunup bye trent she called over her shoulder when she reached the hallway then louder jenks can i talk to you for a moment about our security a knot in me unraveled we were okay grinning at me jenks rose up coming mother he mocked her boots clunked into the sanctuary and i watched belle snake down to the floor sword ready as she braved jenkss cat to go outside im glad youre home ms rachel bis said shyly taking his shirt off and leaving it on top of the fridge before he jumped to the ceiling and crawled out after belle there was a faint scrape of nail on stone and i figured hed slithered out through the flue in the back living room instead of using the smaller cat door yes it was a weird life but it was mine and i wouldnt trade it for anything trent scuffed his foot cast against the floor and my anxiety came flowing back ignoring him i wiped the dust from the phone and scooted up onto the counter as i tried to remember what he liked on his pizza just in case he was staying the bracelet on my wrist jingled and i breathed deeply for the faint scent of burnt amber still clinging to me the band of silver around my wrist seemed to send sparkles into me and i shivered i could hear the pixies playing in the night the near and faroff sounds of life in motion exhaling i remembered the glory of the collective rolling through my mind the power at my fingertips and the knowledge that i could create something from nothing it was gone forever you could have all this too trent i said hearing the dissatisfaction in my voice all you have to do is quit your job piss off the vampires the weres a stupid human who knows black magic and let a demon loose on a major metropolitan area oh wait you did that he laughed but his smile faded fast you dont have to keep it trent said suddenly his gaze going to my wrist i gave it to you so youd have a choice not to hide from them i cringed inside not liking that id telegraphed so much i already made my choice i said but i couldnt meet his eyes he was silent buying time by tucking lucys blanket up as she willfully kicked it off it was an awful lot of power to give up he said and a flash of anger lit and died in me it was an awful lot of trouble it caused i answered uncomfortable as i looked over the coupons they were expired but the delivery guys didnt care if you tipped them enough i dont know if i could make myself that vulnerable after making so many enemies he said his gaze on the smudged counter where wed cut out cookies i looked up wondering if he was going to offer me protection and if i could get lucy away from him before i smacked him in the bahoogies enemies are nothing new i said calmly at least no one is gunning for me and i can still do earth magic he looked to the dusty bowls overhead maybe i can relax for a while rescue some familiars out of trees for a change his expression smoothed almost becoming a smile i do believe thats why you quit the is remember boring runs i snorted nodding as i scanned the coupons everything was for alfredo pizza as they tried to curry the favor of humans be careful what you wish for because you might get it trent gazed at the dark square of night past the window the memory of that kiss we shared rose up in my thoughts and i grimaced ill be fine i said softly im not so confident trent said and he raised a hand it was the one with the missing fingers and i hesitated youre not helpless he added but ive had my lawyers look into your situation and its not as clear cut as you want it to be my situation i scoffed agitated i slid from the counter to throw the coupons away pizza had the appeal of cardboard right now there arent any laws for demons i said fidgeting and if there arent any laws for demons i cant break them i dont need a license to practice magic im not shunned i can sell stuff now people can sell to me but will they he asked his brow furrowed as he gave voice to my real worry probably not the is is off my case and the vamps jeez trent for the first time there is no one gunning for me including you i protested ill give you that trent was smiling lucy drowsing on his lap but along with no legislation on the books for demons and their magic there are no laws protecting you either if rynn cormel wanted he could drive over here shove you in his trunk and drive away i leaned back against the counter and crossed my arms over my middle thats the last thing he is going to do i said not sure i believed it probably but he could trent was looking at lucy but talking to me anyone could a stray dog has more legal protection than you his eyes met mine and i stifled a shiver knowing he was right that band of silver around your wrist makes you almost helpless and anyone with enough smarts will know it there are no laws that pertain directly to demons and until there are you are vulnerable vulnerable there was that word again and it rang through me like a warning bell the stronger i got the more vulnerable i was you take favors from me he said but you are not on my payroll you claim to be protected by a master vampire but you have no ties of blood and you saw how deep cormels word went when he was confronted by the coven ivy cant protect you from everything either youre the alpha female of a were pack but you dont live with david and refuse to take a tattoo to show affiliation what if i get the tattoo i said hearing the truth in his words i didnt before because it wouldnt last through a transformation curse but i dont have to worry about that now a tattoo isnt going to fix this he said his eyes intently on mine you are a demon but you cant perform the magic to back yourself up im not telling you that you need to take that charmed silver off to survive but im asking you to stay out of trouble for a while lay low for about six months im trying to get some legislation protecting you pushed through but its going to take a while stunned i looked at him sitting in my kitchen with a baby on his lap his dress pants wrinkled and his shirt almost untucked i didnt know what to say he was helping me for nothing why i asked and he stood agitated as he began to pace with a sleeping lucy just six months he said not answering me david and i cant keep slapping bandaids on the chaos you leave behind the lawsuits alone lawsuits i asked my arms untwisting from my middle who who doesnt matter he said evasively who i said loudly i want to know who tried to sue me i said softer when lucys hand rose startled by my voice shifting lucy to his shoulder he began to rock without moving his feet a movement new to him but as old as fire and having the grace of a thousand years there was one from a woman about dog theft he said calmly and a couple from my wedding thats how i got involved someone on a bus thought you hexed them with bad luck two people sued when you crashed your car into the bridge hands clenched i turned to the window wanting to hide how disturbed i was i owed david a big thankyou i knew hed been paying my lawyer but i hadnt realized id been keeping him so busy and how did trent figure into it the one concerning the rays fish went away when i brought it up at a party trent continued answering my unasked question the harassment lawsuit from the howlers for magicking their fieldthat was harder that woman doesnt like me i shrugged they werent going to pay me i muttered trent sighed you getting your fivehundreddollar fee cost david several thousand he said still rocking his damaged hand pressing into lucy holding her close hes not begrudging it but it supports what im saying ive got my people working on getting some laws on the books for you but until they do you have all the drawbacks of being a noncitizen and none of the protection and thats not even bringing up the fact that for every person looking for monetary compensation there will be at least two looking to take you on for the notoriety my head came up what he shrugged lucy on his shoulder a demon with no magic you are irresistible and there will be idiots lining up to prove theyre stronger than the great rachel morgan demon banisher and savior of san francisco i didnt like his mocking tone but what could i say i understand i managed flatly not knowing how i was going to iron out this new wrinkle six months i could do nothing for six months trent relaxed his rocking easing good thank you i appreciate that what choice do i have i said eying my charmed silver the check from the withons i guessed and he nodded and if you ever do want to come work for me he started ruining the moment i exhaled now realizing why he had been blocking the lawsuits he still wanted me to work for him shut up trent before i smash your face i said lightly not a whisper of threat in my voice do you want to stay for pizza trent sucked in his breath and an alarmed expression filled his face good god no he said making me laugh he was tidying lucys blanket showing all the signs of getting ready to leave and all of a sudden i didnt want him to thanks i said standing forlornly next to the sink not knowing what to do with my hands for everything he looked at me from under his bangs and i made a weak gesture i suppose i could have done without you releasing kusox but thanks for picking up the pieces and putting me back together trent was drifting to the door moving slowly because of his cast youre welcome uh about that kiss he said his voice hesitant i froze wanting to ignore it forget it i said i am he hesitated a bare instant i was just going to say i was sorry for misleading you turning away he headed for the hallway lucy in his arms and his head bowed good night that was not what he was going to say and i licked my lips in a flash of understanding as i again saw his loneliness the space he kept between himself and the rest of the world i knew he would love lucy but even then he would hold himself apart id seen him afraid id seen him vulnerable and down to his last option he had risked not just my life but his to give me a choice and it bothered me that he was going to be soalone he had wanted to be a tailor when he grew up because they had been stronger than his dad to his youngboy eyes trent the word was out of my mouth before i even knew i was going to say it and he stopped in the threshold spinning quickly back to me yes it was hopeful and my heart beat strongly but fear shot through me chased by adrenaline never mind i whispered have a good night he turned but not fast enough to hide the light in his eyes dimming and it scared me even more you too he said again his voice precise and controlled again ill let myself out he walked stiffly into the hallway and i swallowed hard feeling unreal bye trent i said my fingers trembling slightly as i felt my way around the center counter to sit in my chair and stare at the table there was a new feeling trickling through me making my breath come fast and my heart thump it was more than having trent off my case the witches too and the is if that conversation in the van was any indication true i was a daywalking demon and i couldnt leave ohio or kentucky without notifying the is but the legislation would go through soon and i wasnt shunned anymore it wasnt the satisfaction of saving san francisco from kusox or having finally freed myself from al and the rest of them or even that id become a demon godmother to trents daughter and gotten my saturdays back too the mix of fear and exhilaration filling me grew from the undeniable fact that trent had liked that kiss we had shared not only liked it but had hoped that i liked it too and that was very fine information to have indeed acknowledgments id like to thank my agent
