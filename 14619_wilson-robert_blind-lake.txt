blind lake by robert charles wilson part one the new astronomy telescopes of surpassing power revealed to her the unrevealed depths of the cosmos on polished mirrors of floating mercury the dead worlds of sirius the halfformed worlds of arcturus the rich but lifeless worlds whirling around vast antares and betelgeuse these she studied without avail polton cross wings across the cosmos one it could end at any time chris carmody rolled into a zone of warmth in an unfamiliar bed a depression in the cotton sheets where someone had lately been someone her name was elusive still lost in layers of sleep but he craved the warmth of her recent presence the author of this lingering heat he pictured a face benevolent and smiling and a little bit walleyed he wondered where she had gone it had been a while since he had shared anyones bed strange how what he relished as much as anything was the heat she left behind this space he entered in her absence it could end at any time had he dreamed the words no he had written them in his notebook three weeks ago transcribing a comment from a grad student he had met in the cafeteria at crossbank half a continent away were doing amazing work and theres a kind of rush knowing it could end at any time reluctantly he opened his eyes across this small bedroom the woman with whom he had slept was wrangling herself into a pair of pantyhose she caught his glance and smiled cautiously hey baby she said not to rush you but didnt you say you had an appointment somewhere memory caught up with him her name was lacy no surname offered she was a waitress at the local dennys her hair was red and long in the current style and she was at least ten years younger than chris she had read his book or claimed to have read it or at least to have heard of it she suffered from a lazy eye which gave her a look of constant abstraction while he blinked away sleep she shrugged a sleeveless dress over freckled shoulders lacy wasnt much of a housekeeper he noted a scattering of dead flies on the sunny windowsill the makeup mirror on the side table where the night before she had razored out skinny precise lines of cocaine a fiftydollar bill lay on the carpet beside the bed rolled so tightly it resembled a budding palm leaf or some bizarre stickinsect a rust spot of dried blood on one end it was early fall still warm in constance minnesota balmy air turned gauzy curtains chris relished the sense of being in a place he had never been and to which he would in all likelihood never return youre actually going to the lake today huh he reclaimed his watch from a stack of the print edition of people on the nightstand he had an hour to make his connection actually going there he wondered how much he had said to this woman last night you want breakfast i dont think i have time she seemed relieved thats okay it was really exciting meeting you i know lots of people who work at the lake but theyre mostly support staff or retail i never met anybody who was in on the big stuff im not in on the big stuff im just a journalist dont undersell yourself i had a good time too youre sweet she said you want to shower im done in the bathroom the water pressure was feeble and he spotted a dead cockroach in the soap dish but the shower gave him time to adjust his expectations to ramp up whatever was left of his professional pride he borrowed one of her pink disposable leg razors and shaved the ghostly image of himself in the bathroom mirror he was dressed and at the door by the time she was settling down to her own breakfast eggs and juice in the apartments tiny kitchenette she worked evenings mornings and afternoons were her downtime a tiny video panel on the kitchen table played an interminable daytime drama at halfvolume lacy stood and hugged him her head came up as far as his breastbone in the gentle embrace there was an acknowledgment that they meant essentially nothing to each other nothing more than an evenings whim recklessly indulged let me know how it goes she said if youre back this way he promised politely but he wouldnt be back this way he reclaimed his luggage from the marriott where visions east had thoughtfully but needlessly booked him a room and caught up to elaine coster and sebastian vogel in the lobby youre late elaine told him he checked his watch not by much would it kill you to be punctual once in a while punctuality is the thief of time elaine who said that oscar wilde oh theres a great role model for you elaine was fortynine years old and immaculate in her safari clothes a digital imager clipped to her breast pocket and a notebook microphone dangling from the left arm of her zirconiumencrusted sunglasses like a stray hair her expression was stern elaine was a working science journalist almost twenty years chriss elder highly respected in a field where he himself was lately regarded with a certain disdain he liked elaine and her work was topnotch and so he forgave her tendency to address him the way a gradeschool teacher might address the kid who planted the whoopee cushion sebastian vogel the third member of the visions east expeditionary force stood silently a few feet away sebastian wasnt really a journalist at all he was a retired professor of theology from wesleyan university who had written one of those books that becomes an inexplicable bestseller god the quantum vacuum it was called and it was that ampersand in place of the conventional and chris suspected that had made it acceptably fashionable fashionably elliptical the magazine had wanted a spiritual take on the new astronomy to complement elaines rigorous science and chriss socalled human angle but sebastian who might be brilliant was also terminally softspoken he wore a beard that obscured his mouth which chris took as emblematic the words that found their way out were sparse and generally difficult to interpret the van elaine said has been waiting ten minutes the van from blind lake she meant with a young doe functionary at the wheel one elbow out the open window and a restless expression on his face chris nodded and tossed his luggage in back and took a seat behind elaine and sebastian it was past one in the afternoon but he felt a wave of exhaustion sweep over him something to do with the september sunlight or last nights excesses the coke although he had paid for it had been lacys idea not his he had shared a couple of lines for the sake of companionability more than enough to keep him buzzed nearly until dawn he closed his eyes briefly but refused himself the indulgence of sleep he wanted a glimpse of constance by daylight they had come in late yesterday and all he had seen of the town was the dennys and later a bar where the local band played requests and then the inside of lacys apartment the town had done its best to reinvent itself as a tourist attraction as famous as the blind lake campus had become it was closed to casual visitors the curious had to make do with this old grainsilo and railyard hamlet constance which served as a staging base for blind lakes civilian day employees and where the new marriott and the newer hilton occasionally hosted scientific congresses or press conferences the main street had played up to the blind lake theme with more gusto than taste the twostory brick commercial buildings appeared to date from the middle of the last century yellow brick pressed from local riverbottom clay and they might have been attractive if not for the wave of hucksterism that had overtaken them the lobster theme was everywhere inevitably lobster plush toys holographic lobster window displays lobster posters lobster cocktail napkins ceramic garden lobsters elaine followed his gaze and guessed his thought you should have had dinner at the mariott she said lobster fucking bisque he shrugged its only people trying to make a buck support their families cashing in on ignorance i really dont get this whole lobster thing they dont look anything at all like lobsters they dont have an exoskeleton and god knows they dont have an ocean to swim around in people have to call them something people may have to call them something but do they have to paint them onto neckties the blind lake work had been massively vulgarized undeniably so but what bothered elaine chris believed was the suspicion that somewhere among the nearer stars some reciprocal act might be taking place plastic caricatures of human beings lolling behind glazed windows under an alien sun her own face perhaps imprinted on a souvenir mug from which unimaginable creatures sipped mysterious liquids the van was a dusty blue electric vehicle that had been sent from blind lake the driver didnt seem to want to talk but might be listening chris thought trying to feel out their positions the public relations office doing a little undercover work conversation was awkward therefore they rolled out of town along the interstate and turned off onto a twolane road in silence already despite the lack of obvious markers beyond the private road us government property and department of energy signs they were in privileged territory any unregistered vehicle would have been stopped at the first hidden quartermile checkpoint the road was under constant surveillance visual and electronic he recalled something lacy had said at the lake even the prairie dogs carry passes chris turned his head to the window and watched the landscape scroll past dormant farmland gave way to open grassland and rolling meadows sprinkled with wildflowers dry country but not desert last night a storm had rumbled through town while chris sheltered with lacy in her apartment rain had swept the streets clean of oil filled the storm drains with soggy newsprint and rotting weeds provoked a late blush of color from the prairie a couple of years ago lightning had ignited a brush fire that came within a quarter mile of blind lake firefighters had been shipped in from montana idaho alberta it had all looked very photogenic on the news feeds and it emphasized the fragility of the fledgling new astronomy but the risk to the facility had never been great it was just another case the scientists at crossbank had grumbled of blind lake grabbing the headlines blind lake was crossbanks glamorous younger sister prone to fits of vanity hypnotized by the paparazzi but any evidence of the fire had been erased by two summers and two winters by wild grass and wild nettles and those little blue flowers chris couldnt name by natures enviable talent for forgetting they had started at crossbank because crossbank should have been easier the crossbank installation was focused on a biologically active world circling hr second planet from that sun depending on how you tallied up the ring of planetesimals circling half an au inward toward the star the planet was an ironcored rocky body with times the mass of the earth and an atmosphere relatively rich in oxygen and nitrogen both poles were frigid agglutinations of water ice at temperatures occasionally cold enough to freeze out co but the equatorial regions were warm shallow seas over continental plates and rich with life that life was simply not glamorous it was multicellular but purely photosynthetic evolution on hrb seemed to have neglected to invent the mitochondria necessary for animal life which is not to say that the landscape was not often spectacular particularly the huge stromatolitelike colonies of photosynthetic bacteria that rose often two or three stories tall from the green seasurface mats or the fivefold symmetry of the socalled coral stars anchored to the seabeds and floating halfimmersed in open water it was an exquisitely beautiful world and it had captured a great deal of public attention back when crossbank was the only installation of its kind the equatorial seas yielded stunning sunsets every terrestrial hours on average often with stratocumulus clouds billowing far higher than any on earth cloudcastles extracted from a victorian bicycle ad timeadjusted twentyfourhour video loops of the equatorial seascape had been popular as faux windows for a few years a beautiful world and it had yielded a host of insights into planetary and biological evolution it continued to produce extraordinarily useful data but it was static nothing much moved on the second world of hr only the wind the water and the rain eventually it had been labeled the planet where nothing happens a phrase coined by a chicago tribune columnist who considered the whole new astronomy just one more federally funded font of gaudy but useless knowledge crossbank had learned to be wary of journalists visions east had negotiated at length to get chris elaine and sebastian inside for a week there had been no guarantee of cooperation and it was probably only elaines rep as a solid science journalist that had finally sold the public relations staff or chriss reputation perhaps that had made them so difficult to convince but the crossbank visit had been generally successful both elaine and sebastian claimed to have done good work there for chris it had been a little more problematic the head of the observation and interpretation department had flatly refused to speak to him his best quote had come from the kid in the cafeteria it could end at any time and even the kid in the cafeteria had finally leaned forward to eyeball chriss name badge and said youre the guy who wrote that book chris had confessed that he was yes the guy who wrote that book and the kid had nodded once and stood up and carried his halfeaten lunch to the recycling rack without saying another word two surveillance aircraft passed overhead during the next ten minutes and the vans dashboard allpass transponder began to blinking spastically they had crossed any number of checkpoints already well before they reached the steel and accordionwire fence that snaked into the prairie in both directions the steel and cinderblock guardhouse from which a uniformed officer stepped to wave them to a stop the guard examined the drivers id and then elaines and sebastian vogels finally chriss he spoke into his personal microphone briefly then supplied the three journalists with clipon badges at last he waved them through and they were inside as simple as that barring the weeks of negotiation between the magazine and the department of energy so far it was just one stretch of rolling wild grass separated from another by chainlink fence and barbed wire but the entry was more than figurative it carried at least for chris a genuine sense of ceremony this was blind lake this was practically another planet he looked back as the van gathered speed and saw the gate glide shut with what he would remember much later as a terrible finality two there really was a lake in blind lake tessa hauser had learned she thought about that as she walked home from school following her own long shadow down the sparkling white sidewalk blind lake the lake not the town was a muddy swamp between two low hills full of cattails and wild frogs and snapping turtles herons and canada geese and stagnant green water mr fleischer had told the class about it it was called a lake but it was actually a wetland ancient water trapped in the stony porous land so blind lake the lake wasnt really a lake tess thought that made a certain kind of sense because blindlakethetown wasnt really a town either it was a national laboratory built here in its entirety like a movie set by the department of energy thats why the houses and shops and office buildings were so sparse and so new and why they began and ended so abruptly in a vast and empty land tess walked by herself she was eleven years old and she hadnt made any friends at school yet though edie jerundt whom the other children called edie grunt at least spoke to her once in a while but edie walked the other way home toward the mallway and the administrative buildings the tall cooling towers of eyeball alley far away to the west were tessas landmark tess when she was with her father at least which was one week out of four lived in one of a row of pastelcolored town houses pressed up one against the next like soldiers at attention her mothers house though even farther west was almost identical she had stayed twenty minutes late at school helping mr fleischer clean the boards mr fleischer a man with a whitebrown beard and a bald head had asked her a lot of questions about herself what she did when she was home how she got along with her parents whether she liked school tess had answered dutifully but unenthusiastically and after a while mr fleischer had frowned and stopped asking which was perfectly okay with her did she like school it was too early to tell school had hardly started the weather wasnt even cool yet though the wind that brushed the sidewalk and flapped her skirt had a touch of autumn in it you couldnt tell about school tess thought until at least halloween and halloween was still a couple of weeks away by then you knew how it would be for better or worse she didnt even know if she liked blind lake the townnotatown near the lakenotalake crossbank had been better in some ways more trees autumn colors snow on the hills in winter her mother had said there would be snow here too and plenty of it and maybe this time she would make friends to go sledding with but the hills seemed too low and gentle for proper sledding trees were sparse here mostly saplings planted around the science buildings and the shopping concourse like trees imperfectly wishedfor tess thought she passed some of these on the lawns of the town houses trees so new they were still staked to the earth still trying to take root she came to her fathers small house and saw that his car wasnt in the driveway he wasnt home yet that was unusual but not unheardof tess used her own key to let herself inside the house was ruthlessly tidy and the furniture still smelled new welcoming but somehow unfamiliar she went to the narrow gleaming kitchen and poured herself a glass of orange juice from the refrigerator some of the juice spilled over the lip of the glass tess thought about her father then took a paper towel and wiped the tiled counter clean she deposited the balledup evidence in the bin under the sink she carried her drink and a napkin into the living room stretched out on the sofa and whispered video to turn on the entertainment panel but there was nothing except static on any of the cartoon channels the house had saved a couple of programs for her from yesterday but they were dull ones king koala the unbelievable baxters and she wasnt in the mood she guessed there must be something wrong with the satellite because there was nothing else to see either only the closedcircuit feed from the downloads lobster city nighttime the subject motionless and probably asleep under a naked electric light her phone buzzed deep in her schoolbag on the floor at her feet and tess sat up abruptly a mouthful of orange juice went down the wrong way she fumbled the phone out and answered hoarsely tessa is that you her father she nodded which was useless then said yes everything okay she assured him she was fine daddy always wanted to know whether she was okay some days he asked more than once to tess it always sounded like whats the matter with you is something wrong she never had an answer for that im working late tonight he said i cant take you to moms youll have to phone her and have her pick you up tonight was the night she changed over to her mothers house tess had a room in each house a small neat one at daddys a big messy one at her mothers she would have to pack her school stuff for the change cant you call her its better if you do it sweetie she nodded again then said all right love you you too keep your chin up what ill call you every day tess okay tess said dont forget to call your mother i wont dutiful and undistracted by the blank video panel tess said goodbye then whispered mom at the phone there was an interlude of insect sounds then her mother picked up daddy says you have to come get me he does huh well are you at his place tess liked the sound of her mothers voice even over the phone if her fathers voice was distant thunder her mothers was summer rain soothing even when it was sad hes working late tess explained according to the agreement hes supposed to bring you i have work of my own to finish up i guess i can walk tess said though she made no effort to conceal her disappointment it would take her a good half hour to walk to her moms place past the coffee shop and the teenagers who gathered there and who had taken to calling her spaz because of the way she jerked her head to avoid their eyes no her mother said its getting late just have your stuff together ill be there in oh i guess twenty minutes or so kay okay maybe well get takeout on the way home great after she deposited the phone back in her schoolbag tess made sure she had all the things she needed to bring to moms her notebooks and texts of course but also her favorite shirts and blouses her plush monkey her plugin library her personal nightlight that didnt take long then restless she put her stuff in the foyer and went out back to watch the sunset the nice thing about her dads place was the view from the yard it wasnt a spectacular view no mountains or valleys or anything as dramatic as that but it looked out over a long stretch of undeveloped meadowland sloping toward the road into constance the sky seemed immensely large from here free of any borders except the fence that encircled blind lake birds lived in the high grass beyond the neatly trimmed lawn and sometimes they rose up into the huge clean sky in flocks tess didnt know what kind of birds they were she didnt have a name for them they were many and small and brown and when they folded their wings they flew like darts the only manmade things tess could see from her fathers backyard as long as she faced away from the mechanical line of the adjoining town houses were the fence the road that led across the rolling hills to constance and the guardhouse at the gate she watched a bus driving away from blind lake one of the buses that carried day workers home to their houses far away in the fading dusk the windows of the bus were warm with yellow light tess stood silently watching if her father were here he would have called her inside by now tess knew that she sometimes stared at things too long at clouds or hills or when she was in school out the spotless window to the soccer field where white goalposts clocked the hours with their shadows until someone called her back to the world wake up tessa pay attention as if she had been asleep as if she had not been paying attention times like this with the wind moving the grass and curling around her like a huge cool hand tess felt the world as a second presence as another person as if the wind and the grass had voices of their own and she could hear them talking the yellowwindowed bus stopped at the distant guardhouse a second bus pulled up behind it tess waited for the guard to wave the buses through almost a thousand people worked days at blind lake clerks and support staff and the people who ran the stores and the guard always waved the buses through tonight however the buses stopped and stayed stopped tess the wind said which made tess think about mirror girl and all the trouble that had caused her back at crossbank tess she jumped involuntarily the voice had been real her mothers sorry if i scared you its okay tess turned and was pleased and reassured by the sight of her mother coming across the broad neat lawn tessas mother was a tall woman her long brown hair somewhat askew around her face her anklelength skirt flirting with the wind the setting sun turned everything faintly red the sky the town houses her mothers face you have your stuff at the front door tess saw her mother glance away toward the distant road another bus had come up behind the first two and now all three were motionless at the gate tess said is something wrong with the fence i dont know im sure its nothing but she frowned and stood a moment watching then she took tessas hand lets go home shall we tess nodded suddenly eager for the warmth of her mothers house for the smell of fresh laundry and takeout food for the reassurance of small enclosed spaces three the campus of the blind lake national laboratory its scientific and administrative offices and supply and retail outlets had been constructed on the almost imperceptibly gentle slope of an ancient glacial moraine from the air it resembled any newly built suburban community peculiar only in its isolation served by a single twolane road at its center adjacent to a partially enclosed retail strip called the mallway was an oshaped ring of tenstory concrete buildings hubble plaza this was where the interpretive work of the blind lake facility was done the plaza with its narrow escutcheon windows and its grassy enclosed park was the brain of the installation the beating heart was a mile east of the inhabited town in an underground structure from which two massive cooling towers rose into the brittle autumn air this building was officially the blind lake computational array but it was commonly called eyeball alley or the alley or simply the eye charlie grogan had been chief engineer at the alley since it had been powered up five years ago tonight he was working late if you could call it working late when it was his regular custom to stick around well after the day shift had gone home there was of course a night shift and a supervising engineer to go with it anne costigan whose abilities he had come to respect but it was precisely this relaxation of his official vigilance that made the afterhours shift rewarding he could catch up on paperwork without risk of interruption better he could go down into the hardware rooms or the obec gallery and hang out with the handson guys in a nonofficial capacity he enjoyed spending time in the works tonight he finished filling out a requisition form and told his server to transmit it in the morning he checked his watch ten to nine the guys in the stacks were due for a break just a walkthrough charlie promised himself then home to feed boomer his elderly hound and maybe catch some downloads before bed the eternal cycle he left his office and rode an elevator two levels deeper into the underground the alley was quiet at night he passed no one in the seagreen lowerlevel hallways there was only the sound of his footsteps and the chime of the transponder in his id tag as he crossed into restricted areas mirrored doors offered him unwelcome reminders of his age he had turned fortyeight last january the creeping curvature of his spine the paunch that ballooned over his belt buckle a fringe of gray hair stood out against his dark skin his father had been a lightskinned englishman taken by cancer twenty years ago his mother a sudanese immigrant and sufi scholar had survived him by less than a year charlie resembled his father more than ever these days he detoured through the obec gallery though like staying late it was probably wrong to call it a detour this was one of the stations of his habitual nightly walk the gallery was constructed like a surgical theater without the student seating a ringshaped tiled hallway fitted with sealed glass windows on its inner perimeter the windows overlooked a circular chamber forty feet deep at the bottom of the chamber serviced by columns of supercooled gases and bundles of light pipes and monitoring devices were the three huge obec platens inside each tubular platen were rank upon rank of microscopically thin gallium arsenide wafers bathed in helium at a temperature of fahrenheit charlie was an engineer not a physicist he could maintain the machines that maintained the platens but his understanding of the fundamental process at work was partial at best a boseeinstein condensate was a highly ordered state of matter and the becs created linked electron particles called excitons and excitons functioned as quantum gates to form an absurdly fast and subtle computing device anything beyond that readers digest sketch he left to the intense and socially awkward young theorists and graduate students who cycled through eyeball alley as if it were a summer resort charlies job was more practical he kept it all working kept it cool kept the io smooth fixed little problems before they became big problems tonight there were four maintenance guys in sterile suits down in the plumbing probably stitch and chavez and the new hands cycling through from berkeley lab more people than usual he wondered if anne costigan had ordered some unscheduled work he walked the circumference of the gallery once then followed another corridor past the solidstate physics labs to the data control room charlie knew as soon as he stepped inside that something was up nobody was on break the five night engineers were all at their posts feverishly scrolling systems reports only chip mccullough looked up as charlie came through door and all he got from chip was a glum nod all this in the few hours since his shift had officially ended anne costigan was here too she glanced up from her handheld monitor and saw him standing by the door she held up a finger to the junior supervisor one second and strode over charlie liked this about anne her economy of motion every gesture purposeful christ charlie she said dont you ever sleep just on my way out through the stacks came for coffee actually but you guys are busy we had a big spike through the ios an hour ago power spike no an activity spike the switchboard lit up if you know what i mean like somebody fed the eye a dose of amphetamine it happens charlie said you remember last winter this ones a little unusual it settled down but were doing a systems check still making data oh yeah nothing bad just a blip but you know he understood the eye and all its interrelated systems hovered perpetually on the brink of chaos like a harnessed wild animal what the eye needed was not maintenance so much as grooming and reassurance in its complexity and unpredictability it was very nearly a living thing those who understood that and anne was one of them had learned to pay attention to the small things you want to stick around lend a hand yes he did but anne didnt need him he would only get underfoot he said i have a dog to feed tell boomer hello for me she was clearly anxious to get back to work will do anything i can get you not unless you have a spare phone abes out on the coast again abe was annes husband a financial consultant he made it to blind lake maybe one month out of three the marriage was troubled local calls are okay but i cant get through to la for some reason you want to borrow mine no not really i tried tommy guptas his didnt work either something wrong with the satellites i guess strange charlie thought how everything seemed to have gone just slightly askew tonight for the fifth time in the last hour sue sampel told her boss she hadnt been able to put his call through to the department of energy in washington each time ray looked at her as if she had personally fucked up the system she was working way late and so it seemed was everybody else in hubble plaza something was up sue couldnt figure out what she was ray scutters executive assistant but ray typically hadnt shared any information with her all she knew was that he wanted to talk to dc and the telecoms werent cooperating obviously it wasnt sues fault she knew how to punch a number for gods sake but that didnt prevent ray from glaring at her every time he asked and ray scutter packed a killer glare big eyes with pinpoint pupils bushy eyebrows flecks of gray in his goatee she had once thought he might be handsome if not for his receding chin and slightly pouchy cheeks but she didnt entertain that thought anymore what was the expression handsome is as handsome does ray didnt do handsome he turned away from her desk and stalked back to his inner office naturally he growled over his shoulder ill be blamed for this somehow y sue thought wearily it had become her mantra in the months shed been working for ray scutter y yeah yeah yeah ray was surrounded by incompetents ray was being ignored by the research staff ray was thwarted at every turn yeah yeah yeah once more for good measure she attempted the washington connection the phone popped up an error message server unavailable same message came up for any phone video or net connection outside the local blind lake loop the only call that had gone through was to rays own house here in town letting his daughter know hed be late everything else had been incoming security personnel and the military liaison sue might have been worried if shed been a little less tired but it was probably nothing all she wanted to do right now was get back to her apartment and peel off her shoes microwave her dinner smoke a joint the terminal buzzed again according to the screen announcement a call from ari weingart over at publicity and public relations she picked up ari she said what can i do for you your boss around present but not keen to be disturbed is this urgent well yeah kind of ive got three journalists here and nowhere to put them so book a motel very funny theyre on a threeweek pass nobody penciled this into your calendar dont be obtuse sue obviously they ought to be sleeping in the guest quarters in the visitor center but personnel filled those beds with day workers day workers duh because the buses cant get out to constance the buses cant get out have you been in an isolation booth the last couple of hours the roads closed at the gatehouse no traffic in or out were in total lockdown since when roughly sunset how come who knows either a plausible security threat or another drill everybodys guessing itll be sorted out by morning but in the meantime i have to billet these folks somewhere ray scutters reaction to the problem would be more indignant fuming certainly nothing helpful sue thought about it maybe you could call site management and see if theyll open up the gym in the rec center put in some cots for the night hows that sound fucking brilliant ari said should have thought of it myself if you need authority cite mine youre a gem wish i could hire you away from ray so do i sue thought sue stood and stretched she walked to the window and parted the vertical blinds beyond the roofs of the worker housing and the darkness of the undeveloped grassland she could just make out the road to constance the lights of emergency vehicles pulsing eerily by the south gate marguerite hauser thanked whatever benevolent fate it was that had put her into a town house even if it was one of the smaller older units on the northeastern side of the blind lake campus as far as possible from her exhusband ray there was something reassuring about that tenminute drive as she took tess home closing space behind her like a drawbridge over a moat tess as usual was quiet during the ride maybe a little quieter than usual when they picked up chicken sandwiches at the drivethrough outlet in the commercial strip tess was indifferent to the menu back home marguerite carried the food and tess hauled her tote bag inside is the video working tess asked listlessly why wouldnt it be wasnt working at daddys house check and see ill put the food on plates eating in front of the video panel was still a novelty for tess it was a habit ray had not permitted ray had insisted on eating at the table family time inevitably dominated by rays daily catalogue of complaints frankly marguerite thought the downloads were better company the old movies especially tess liked the blackandwhite ones best she was fascinated by the antique automobiles and peculiar clothing shes a xenophile marguerite thought takes after me but marguerites video panel proved as useless as rays had presumably been and they had to make do with whatever was in the houses resident memory they settled on a hundredyearold bob hope comedy my favorite brunette tess who would ordinarily have been full of questions about the twentieth century and why everything looked like that simply picked at her food and gazed at the screen marguerite put a hand on her daughters forehead how do you feel kiddo im not sick just not hungry i guess tess scooted closer and marguerite put an arm around her after dinner marguerite cleaned up put fresh linen on the beds helped tess sort out her schoolbooks tess flicked through the bluescreen entertainment bands in a moment of misplaced optimism then watched the bob hope movie a second time finally announced she was ready for bed marguerite supervised her toothbrushing and tucked her in marguerite liked her daughters room with its small westfacing window the bed dressed in a pink fringed comforter the watchful ranks of stuffed animals on the dresser it reminded her of her own room back in ohio many years ago minus the wellmeaning volumes of bible stories for children her father had installed in the vain hope that they might provoke in her a piety she had conspicuously lacked tessas books were selfselected and tended toward popular fantasy and easy science you want to read a while guess not tess said i hope you feel better in the morning im okay really marguerite looked back as she switched the light off tessas eyes were already closed tess was eleven but looked younger she still had that babyfat cushion under her chin the full cheeks her hair was darkening but still a dirty blond marguerite supposed a young woman was emerging from this childhood cocoon but her features were still indistinct difficult to predict sleep well marguerite whispered tess curled into her comforter and arched her head against the pillow marguerite closed the door she crossed the hall to her office a converted third bedroom determined to get a little more work done before midnight each of her department heads had flagged video segments for her to review from the last twentyfour hours with the subject marguerite dimmed the lights and queued the reports to her wall screen physiology and signalling was still obsessed with the subjects lung louvers possible louver gesturing in social interaction the subhead proclaimed there was a clip of the subject in a food well conclave subject stood in the dim green light of the food well in apparent interaction with another individual the subjects ventral louvers pale whitish slits on each side of his thoracic chamber quavered with each inhalation that was standard and marguerite wasnt sure what the physiology people wanted her to notice until new text scrolled up the louver frills palpate in a distinct vertical pattern of some complexity during social behavior ah yes there it was in an enlarged subscreen the louver frills were tiny pink hairs barely visible but yes they were moving like a wheat field in the wind for comparison there was an inset of subject breathing in a nonsocial environment the louver frills flexed inward with each breath but the vertical quaver was absent potentially very interesting marguerite thought she flagged the report with a priority notice which meant physiology and signalling could send it up to the compilers for further analysis she added some notes and queries of her own consistency other contexts and bumped it back to hubble plaza from the culture and technology group screen shots of subjects latest addition to his chamber walls here was the subject stretched to full height his squat lifting legs erect as he used a manipulating arm and something that looked like a crayon to add a fresh symbol if it was a symbol to the symbolstring that adorned the walls of the room this one was part of a string of sixteen progressively larger snailshell whorls the new one terminated with a flourish to marguerite it looked like something a restless child might doodle in the margin of a notebook the obvious inference was that the subject was writing something but it had been established early on that the strokes lines circles crosses dots etc never repeated if they were pictographs the subject had never written the same word twice if they were letters he had yet to exhaust his alphabet did that mean they were art perhaps decoration possibly but culture and technology thought this latest string suggested at least some linguistic content marguerite doubted it and she flagged the report with a priority that would stack it up on the peerreview desk with a dozen similar documents the rest of the backlog consisted of progress reports from the active committees and a couple of brief segments the landmarks survey team thought she might like to see balcony views the city stretching away beyond the subject in a pastel afternoon sandstonered layer on layer like an empire of rusty wedding cakes she stored these images to look at later she was finished by midnight she switched off her office wall and walked through the house turning off other lights until the soft dark was complete tomorrow was saturday no school for tess marguerite hoped the satellite interface would be back up by morning she didnt want tess to be bored her first day back home it was a clear night autumn was coming fast this year marguerite went to bed with the curtains parted when she moved in last summer she had pushed her big futile double bed close to the window she liked to look at the stars before she fell asleep but ray had always insisted on keeping the blinds shut now she could indulge herself the light of the crescent moon fell across a reef of blankets she closed her eyes and felt weightless sighed once and was asleep four ari weingart blind lakes pr guy carried a big digital clipboard chris carmody worried a little bit about that hed seldom had good experiences with people who carried clipboards clearly things werent going too well for weingart he had met vogel elaine and chris outside hubble plaza and escorted them to his small office overlooking the central plaza they had been halfway through a tentative firstweek itinerary when weingart took a call chris and company retired to a vacant conference room where they sat until well after sunset when weingart returned he was still toting the dreaded clipboard theres been a complication he said elaine coster had been simmering behind a monthsold print edition of current events she put the magazine down and gave weingart a level stare if theres a problem with the schedule we can work it out tomorrow all we need right now is a place to unpack and a reliable server i havent been able to get a link through to new york since this afternoon well thats the problem the facility is in lockdown we have some nine hundred day workers with homes offsite but they cant get out and im afraid they have a prior claim on the guest quarters the good news is hang on elaine said lockdown what are you talking about i guess you didnt run into this problem at crossbank but its part of the security regs if theres any kind of threat against the facility no traffic is allowed in or out until its cleared up theres been a threat im assuming so they dont tell me these things but im sure its nothing he was probably right chris thought both crossbank and blind lake were designated national laboratories operated under security protocols that dated back to the terror wars even idle threats were taken terribly seriously one of the drawbacks of blind lakes high media profile was that it had attracted the attention of a broad spectrum of lunatics and ideologues can you tell us the nature of the threat honestly i dont know myself but this isnt the first time this has happened if experience is any guide it will all be cleared up by morning sebastian vogel stirred from the chair where he had been sitting in sphinxlike repose for the last hour and in the meantime he said where do we sleep well weve set up cots cots in the gymnasium at the recreation facility i know im terribly sorry its the best we can do on short notice as i said im sure well have it all sorted out by morning weingart frowned into his clipboard as if it might contain a lastminute reprieve elaine looked primed to explode but chris preempted her were journalists im sure weve all slept rough one time or another well maybe not vogel right elaine weingart looked at her hopefully she bit back whatever she had been about to say ive slept in a tent on the gobi plateau i suppose i can sleep in a fucking gym there were ranks of cots in the gym some already occupied by displaced day workers overflowing from guest housing chris elaine and vogel staked out three cots under the basketball hoop and claimed them with their luggage the pillows on the beds looked like deflated marshmallows the blankets were red cross surplus vogel said to elaine the gobi plateau when i was writing my biography of roy chapman andrews in the footsteps of time paleobiology then and now admittedly i was twentyfive you ever sleep in a tent sebastian vogel was sixty years old he was pale except for the hectic red of his cheeks and he wore shapeless sweaters to disguise the awkward generosity of his stomach and hips elaine disliked him he was a parvenu she had whispered to chris a fraud practically a fucking spiritualist and vogel had compounded the sin with his unfailing politeness algonquin park he said canada a camping trip decades ago of course looking for god it was a coed trip as i recall i was looking to get laid you were what a divinity student we didnt take vows of chastity elaine doesnt god frown on things like that things like what like sexual intercourse not so far as i have been able to discern no you should read my book ah but i did she turned to chris have you not yet sebastian is an oldfashioned mystic god in all things in some things more than others sebastian said which struck chris as both cryptic and typically sebastian fascinating as this is chris said im thinking we should get some dinner the pr guy said theres a place in the concourse thats open till midnight im game elaine said as long as you promise not to pick up the waitress im not hungry vogel said go on without me ill guard the luggage fast st francis elaine said shrugging her jacket on chris knew about elaines roy chapman andrews biography he had read it as a freshman back then she had been an upandcoming science journalist shortlisted for an aaas westinghouse award charting a career path he hoped one day to follow chriss one and only book to date had also been a biography of a sort the nice thing about elaine was that she had not made an issue of the books stormy history and seemed to have no objection to working with him amazing he thought what you learn to settle for the restaurant ari weingart had recommended was tucked between an interface store and an officesupply shop in the openair wing of the mallway most of these stores were closed for the evening and the concourse had a vaguely derelict aspect in the cooling autumn air but the diner a franchise sawyers steak seafood was doing a brisk business big crowd lots of talk in the air they grabbed a vinyl booth by the wide concourse window the decor was chrome and pastel and potted plants very latetwentiethcentury the fake reassurance of a fake antiquity the menus were shaped like tbones chris felt blissfully anonymous good god elaine said darkest suburbia what are you ordering well lets see the allday breakfast the moms comfort meat loaf a waiter approached in time to hear her name these offerings in a tone of high irony the atlantic salmon is good he said good for what exactly no never mind the salmon will do chris he ordered the same embarrassed the waiter shrugged and walked away you can be an incredible snob elaine think about where we are at the cutting edge of human knowledge standing on the shoulders of copernicus and galileo so where do we eat a truck stop with a salad bar chris had never figured out how elaine reconciled her close attention to food with her carefully suppressed middleage spread rewarding herself with quality he guessed sacrificing quantity balancing act she was a wallenda of the waistline i mean come on she said who exactly is being snobbish here im fifty years old i know what i like i can endure a fastfood joint or a frozen dinner but do i really have to pretend the applebrownbetty is crème brulée i spent my youth drinking sour coffee from paper cups i graduated from that she added you will too thanks for the vote of confidence confess crossbank was a washout for you i picked up some useful material or at least one totemic quote it could end at any time almost a baptist piety i have a theory about you elaine said maybe we should just eat no no you dont escape the obnoxious old harridan quite as easily as that i didnt mean just be quiet have a breadstick or something i told you i read sebastians book i read yours too maybe this sounds childish but id really prefer not to talk about it all i want to say is its a good book you chris carmody wrote a good book you did the legwork and you drew the necessary conclusions now you want to blame yourself for not flinching elaine you want to flush your career away pretending to work and not working and blowing deadlines and screwing waitresses with big tits and drinking yourself to sleep because you can totally do that you wouldnt be the first not by a country mile selfpity is such an absorbing hobby a man died elaine you didnt kill him thats debatable no chris its not debatable galliano went over that hill either accidentally or as a willed act of selfdestruction maybe he regretted his sins or maybe not but they were his sins not yours i exposed him to ridicule you exposed work that was dangerously shoddy and selfserving and a threat to innocent people it happened to be gallianos work and galliano happened to drive his motorcycle into the monongahela river but thats his choice not yours you wrote a good book jesus elaine how badly does the world need one more fucking good book and a true book and you wrote it out of a sense of indignity that was not misplaced i appreciate you saying this but and the thing is you obviously got nothing useful from crossbank and what worries me is that youll get nothing here and blame yourself for it and youll blow off the deadline in order to conduct more efficiently this project of selfpunishment youve embarked on and thats so goddamn unprofessional i mean vogel is a crackpot but at least hell produce copy for a moment chris entertained the idea of getting up and walking out of the restaurant he could go back to the gym and interview some of the stranded day workers they would talk to him at least all he was getting from elaine was more guilt and hed had enough thank you the salmon arrived congealing in drizzled butter what you have to do she paused the waiter dangled an enormous wooden pepper mill over the table take that away thank you the waiter fled what you have to do chris is stop acting like you have something to be ashamed of the book you wrote use it if someones hostile about it confront them if theyre afraid of you because of it use their fear if youre stonewalled you can at least write the story of how you were stonewalled and how it felt to walk around blind lake as a pariah but dont blow this opportunity she leaned forward her sleeves dangling perilously close to the butter sauce because the thing is chris this is blind lake maybe the great unwashed public has only a vague notion of what goes on here but we know better right this is where all the textbooks get rewritten this is where the human species begins to define its place in the universe this is the fulcrum of who we are and what well become you sound like a brochure she drew back why you think im too wrinkled and cynical to recognize something genuinely awesome when i see it i didnt mean that i for what its worth you caught me in a moment of sincerity elaine im just not in the mood for a lecture well i didnt really think you were in the mood for it okay chris do what you think is best she waved at his plate eat that poor assaulted fish a tent he said the gobi plateau well sort of a tent an inflatable habitat airdropped from beijing rechargeable fuel cells heat at night all the satellite channels just like roy chapman andrews hey she said im a journalist not a martyr five to marguerites dismay and tessas grave disappointment video and download reception did not improve over the weekend nor was it possible to put a call or net connection through beyond the fenced perimeter of blind lake marguerite assumed this was some new incarnation of blind lakes elaborate security protocols there had been several such shutdowns back at crossbank during the time marguerite had worked there most had lasted only a few hours though one such occasion an unauthorized overflight that turned out to be nothing more than a private pilot whod burned out both his nav chips and his transponders had created a minor scandal and sealed the security perimeter for nearly a week here at blind lake the shutdown was at least for marguerite not much of an inconvenience at least so far she hadnt planned to go anywhere and there was nobody on the outside to whom she urgently needed to speak her father lived in ohio and called her every saturday but he was savvy about security issues and wouldnt worry unduly when he couldnt get hold of her it was a problem for tessa however not that tess was one of those kids who lived in front of the video panel tess liked to play outside though she mostly played alone and blind lake was one of the few places on earth where a child could wander unaccompanied with negligible fear of drugs or crime this weekend though the weather wasnt cooperating a crisp sunlit saturday morning gave way by noon to rolling asphaltcolored clouds and brief violent squalls of rain october sounding the horn of winter the temperature dropped to a chilly ten degrees centigrade and although tess ventured out once to the garage to root through a box of dolls not yet unpacked from the move she was quickly back inside shivering under her flannel jacket sunday was the same with wind gusting around the eaves troughs and piping through the bathroom ceiling vent marguerite asked tess if there was anyone from school shed like to play with tess was dubious at first but finally named a girl called edie jerundt she wasnt certain about the spelling but there were thank goodness only a few js in the blind lake intramural access directory connie jerundt edies mother turned out to be a sequence analyst from imaging who promptly volunteered to bring edie over for a play date without even asking edie who was marguerite had to assume just as bored as tess they arrived within the hour mother and daughter looked so much alike they might have been russian dolls one nesting comfortably inside the other distinct only in their dimensions both were mousy and wideeyed and touslehaired features softened by connies adulthood but concentrated grotesquely in edies small face edie jerundt had brought along a handful of recent downloads and the two girls settled down immediately in front of the video panel connie stayed a quarter of an hour making nervous conversation about the lengthy security shutdown and how inconvenient it was proving she had hoped to make a trip into constance for some early christmas shopping then excused herself and promised to stop by and pick up edie before five marguerite watched the two girls as they sat in the living room staring at the video panel the downloads were a bit babyish for tess panda girl adventures and edie had brought along those imagesynched glasses that were supposed to be bad for your eyes if you wore for them for more than a few hours both girls flinched from the enhanced d action sequences apart from that they might have been alone they sat at opposite ends of the sofa inclined at contrasting angles against plump pillows marguerite felt immediately and obscurely sorry for edie jerundt one of those girls designed by nature to be picked on and ostracized arms and legs awkward as stilts her grasp approximate her words halting her embarrassment perpetual and profound it was nice marguerite reflected that tess had befriended a girl like edie jerundt unless unless it was edie who had befriended tess after the downloads the girls played with the dolls tess had liberated from the garage the dolls were a motley bunch most collected by tess at outdoor flea markets back when ray used to make weekend drives from crossbank into the new hampshire countryside sunpaled fashion dolls with strangely twisted joints and mismatched clothes oversized baby dolls a majority of them naked a scattering of action figures from forgotten movies arms and legs frozen akimbo tess tried to enlist edie in a scenario this is the mother this is the father the baby is hungry but they have to go to work so this is the babysitter but edie quickly grew bored and was reduced to parading the dolls across the coffee table and giving them nonsense monologues im a girl i have a dog im pretty i hate you tess as if gently nudged aside retired to the sofa and watched she began to bump her head rhythmically against the sofa cushion about one beat per second until marguerite passing steadied her head with her hand this ryhthmic bumping plus a worrisome speechdelay had been marguerites first clue that there was something different about tessa not something wrong marguerite would not accede to that judgmental word but yes tess was different tess had some problems problems none of the wellintentioned therapists marguerite had consulted were ever quite able to define most often they talked about idiosyncratic thresholdlevel autism or aspergers syndrome which meant we have a labelled bin in which to toss your daughters symptoms but no real treatment marguerite had taken tess for physiotherapy aimed at correcting her clumsiness and poor proprioception had tried her on courses of drugs designed to modify her supply of serotonin or dopamine or factor q none of which had made any perceptible change in tesss condition which implied perhaps only that tess had an unusual personality that her skewed aloofness her social isolation were problems she would have to carry indefinitely or overcome as an act of personal will fooling with her neurochemical architecture was counterproductive marguerite had come to believe tess was a child her personality was still a workinprogress she should not be drugged or bullied into someone elses notion of maturity and that had seemed like a plausible compromise at least until marguerite left ray until the trouble back at crossbank there had not even been a newspaper this weekend usually it was possible to eprint sections of the new york times or most any other urban paper but even that meager connection to the outside world had been clipped and if marguerite missed the papers how the news junkies must be suffering cut off from the great global soap opera left to simmer in ignorance about the belgian accords or the latest continental court appointment the silence of the video panel and the periodic sputtering of the rain gave the afternoon a yawning lassitude made marguerite content to sit in the kitchen and leaf through old issues of astrobiology and exozoology her attention fluttering mothlike over the dense text until connie jerundt returned for edie marguerite rooted the girls out of tesss room edie was sprawled on the bed her feet against the wall picking through tesss shoebox of faux jewelery ornamental combs and tortoiseshell barrettes tess sat at her dresser in front of the mirror your moms here edie marguerite said edie blinked her froggishly large eyes then scurried downstairs to hunt for her shoes tess remained at the mirror twining her hair around her right forefinger tess the hair made a glossy curl from fingernail to knuckle then fell away tess did you have a good time with edie i guess maybe you should tell her so tess shrugged maybe you should tell her now shes downstairs getting ready to go but by the time tess had loped down to the front door both edie and her mother were already gone by monday what had begun as a tedious inconvenience began to feel more like a crisis marguerite dropped tess off at school on her way to hubble plaza the crowd of parents in the parking lot including connie jerundt who waved at marguerite from her car window boiled with rumors since there was no local emergency to account for the shutdown something must have happened outside something big enough to create a security crisis but what and why hadnt anyone been told marguerite refused to take part in the speculation obviously or at least it seemed obvious to marguerite the logical thing to do was to get on with the work at hand it might not be possible to talk to the outside world but the outside world was still providing blind lakes power and presumably still expected blind lakes people to go about their business she kissed tess goodbye watched her daughter walk a long stochastic loop through the playground and drove off when the bell sounded the rain had stopped but october had taken charge of the weather a cold wind blowing out of a gemblue sky she was glad she had insisted on a sweater for tess for herself she had selected a vinyl windbreaker which proved inadequate on the long hike from the hubble plaza parking facility to the lobby of the east wing snow before long marguerite thought and christmas coming if you looked past the looming headland of thanksgiving the change in the weather made the quarantine that much more unsettling as if isolation and anxiety had rolled in with the thin canadian air as she waited for the elevator marguerite caught a glimpse of ray her exhusband ducking into the lobby convenience shop probably for his morning fix of dingdongs ray was a man of fiercely regular habits one of them being dingdongs for breakfast ray used to go to amazing lengths to guarantee his supply even during business trips or on vacation he packed dingdongs in tupperware in his carryon luggage a day without dingdongs brought out the worst in him his petulance his neartantrums at the slightest frustration she kept her eye on the shop entrance while the elevator inched down from the tenth floor just as the bell chimed ray emerged with a small bag in his hand the dingdongs for sure which he would devour no doubt behind the closed door of his office ray didnt like to be seen eating sweets marguerite pictured him with a dingdong in each fist nibbling at them like a mad squirrel dribbling crumbs over his starched white shirt and funereal tie she stepped into the elevator with three other people and punched her floor promptly making sure the door closed before ray could run for it marguerites own work though she loved it and had fought hard to get it sometimes made her feel like a voyeur a paid dispassionate voyeur but a voyeur nonetheless she hadnt felt that way at crossbank but her talents had been wasted at crossbank where she had spent five years distilling botanical details from archival surveys the kind of scutwork any bright postgraduate student could have done she could still recite the tentative latin binomials for eighteen varieties of bacterial mats after a year there she had grown so accustomed to the sight of the ocean on hrb that she had imagined she could smell it smell the neartoxic levels of chlorine and ozone the photochromatic assays had detected a sour and vaguely oily smell like drain cleaner she had been at crossbank only because ray had taken her there ray had worked administration at crossbank and she had turned down several offers to transfer to blind lake mostly because ray wouldnt countenance the move then she had sucked up her courage and initiated the divorce after which she had accepted this obs position only to discover that ray had also had himself seconded to blind lake not only that but he moved west a month before marguerite was scheduled to do so establishing himself as a fixture at the lake and probably sabotaging marguerites reputation among the senior administrators still she was doing the work she had trained for longed for the closest thing to field astrozoology the world had ever seen she picked her way through the maze of supportstaff desks said hello to the clerks and secretaries and programmers stopped by the staff kitchen to fill her souvenir blind lake lobstermotif cup with overcooked coffee and halfandhalf then closed herself into her office paper covered her desk epaper littered her virtual desktop this was work pending most of it the kind of procedural checkmarking that was necessary but frustratingly tedious and timeconsuming but she could clean up some of that later at home today she wanted to spend time with the subject raw time realtime she closed the blinds over the window dimmed the sulfurdot ceiling lights and illuminated the monitor that comprised the entire west wall of the office good timing umaes seventeenhour day had just begun morning and the subject stirred from his pallet on the warrens stone floor as usual dozens of smaller creatures parasites symbiotes or offspring scuttled away from his body where they had been nursing at the sleeping subjects exposed bloodnipples these small animals no larger than mice manylegged and sinuously articulated disappeared into gaps where the sandstone walls met the floor subject sat up then stood to his full height estimates put the subjects height at roughly seven feet certainly he was an impressive specimen marguerite used the masculine pronoun privately she would never dare commit an assumption of gender in her official writing the gender and reproductive strategies of the aliens were still wholly unresolved subject was bipedal and bilaterally symmetrical and from a great distance in silhouette he might have been mistaken for a human being but there the resemblance ended his skin not an exoskeleton as the ridiculous lobster nickname implied was a tough redbrown pebbletextured integument because of this dense moistureconserving skin and because of the lung louvers exposed on his ventral surface and such details as the multiple jointing of his legs and arms and the tiny foodmanipulating limbs that grew from the sides of his mandibles some had speculated that subject and his kindred might have evolved from an insectlike form one scenario pictured a strain of invertebrates attaining the size and mobility of mammals by burying their notochord in a chitinous spinal column while losing their hard carapace in favor of a thick but lighter and more flexible skin but little evidence had emerged for this or any other hypothesis exozoology was difficult enough exopaleobiology was a daydream of a science subject was clearly visible in the light cast by the string of incandescent bulbs suspended across the ceiling the bulbs were small more like christmas lights than household lamps but otherwise they seemed ridiculously familiar were familiar the filaments were of ordinary tungsten spectroscopy had revealed dumb rugged technology at intervals other aboriginals would arrive to replace exhausted bulbs and check the insulated copper wire for gaps or irregularities the city boasted an elaborate reliable maintenance infrastructure subject did not dress nor did he eat he had never been observed to eat in his sleeping quarters he did pause to evacuate liquid waste over an open drain in the floor the thick greenish liquid cascaded from a cloacal gap in his lower abdomen there was of course no sound to accompany the image but marguerites imagination supplied the splash and gurgle she reminded herself that these events had happened half a century ago it lessened her sense of invasion she would never speak to this creature never interact with him in any way this image however mysteriously it had traveled was in all likelihood limited to the speed of light the parent star ursa majoris was fiftyone light years from earth and by the same token if anyone elsewhere in the galaxy were watching her she would be safely in her grave long before her observers could attempt to interpret her bathroom functions subject left his warren without preamble his twolegged gait looked awkward by human standards but it covered ground efficiently this part of the day could be interesting subject did essentially the same thing every morning walked to the factory where he assembled machine parts but he seldom took the same route to work enough evidence had accumulated to suggest that this was a cultural or biological imperative ie most others did the same thing perhaps out of an atavistic instinct to avoid predation too bad marguerite would have preferred to think of it as subjects idiosyncrasy an individual preference a discernible choice in any case the observation program tracked him precisely and predictably when subject moved the apparent point of view the virtual camera folks in image acquisition called it followed him at a constant distance subject was centered in the screen but his world was visible around him as he traveled he strode with others of his kind through the incandescently lit corridors of his warren everyone moving in the same direction as if the passages were oneway streets though their wayness varied day by day in a crowd she had learned to identify subject not just by the centrality of his image he was sometimes briefly obscured from view but by the vivid orangeyellow of his dorsalcranial crest and the rounded contour of his shoulders she glimpsed daylight as he passed balconies and rotundas that opened to the air the sky today was powdery blue lobsterville got most of its rain during the mild winter season and it was high summer now the very middle of the southern latitudes long dalliance with the sun the planet possessed a gentle axial tilt but a very lengthy orbit around its star it would be summer in the subjects city for another two terrestrial years in summer it was more often dust than rain clouds that darkened the sky umae was drier than the earth like mars it could generate vast electrically charged dust storms there was always fine dust suspended in the atmosphere and the skies were never as clear as a terrestrial sky but today was calm marguerite surmised warm judging by the flourish of the subjects cooling cilia the coloredchalk blue of the sky was as good as it got marguerite blinked and imagined arizona or new mexico cliffside pueblos in a still noon at last the subject emerged onto one of the broad exterior ways that wound down to the floor of the city the original highaltitude survey had identified no less than forty of these large stone cities and twice as many significantly smaller ones scattered across the surface of umae marguerite kept a globe of subjects planet on her desk the cities marked and named only by their latitude and longitude no one wanted to give them proper names for fear of seeming arrogant or anthropocentric lobsterville was only a nickname and you learned not to use it in front of administrators or the press maybe it was even an error of attribution to call this community a city but it looked like a city to marguerite and she loved the sight of it there were over a thousand sandstone ziggurats in the city and each one was enormous as the subject wound his way downward his sleeping chamber was high up this particular structure marguerites view was panoramic the towers were all very similar nautilusshell spires coiling upward from red tiled plazas the industrial structures distinguished by the smokestacks erupting from their peaks and the streams of light or dark smoke dispersing in the still air all over the city freshly wakened natives filled the external ways and crowded the open spaces the sun rapidly rising sent fingers of yellow light down the eastfacing canyons beyond the city marguerite glimpsed irrigated agricultural lands beyond that brown scrubland and a horizon jagged with distant mountains and if she closed her eyes she could see the afterimage lingering in contrary colors as if unmediated by a billion dollars worth of incomprehensible technology as if she were actually there breathing the thin atmosphere fine dust burning her nostrils subject reached ground level walked on through parallel bands of light and shadow to the industrial tower where he spent his days marguerite watched ignoring her desk work she was not a primary viewer nor was it likely she would notice anything pertinent that the five focal committees had missed her job was to integrate their observations not to make her own but that could wait at least until after lunch the security shutdown meant that exterior agencies couldnt read her reports in any case she was free to watch free if she wanted to dream she grabbed lunch at the plazas westwing staff cafeteria ray wasnt there but she caught a glimpse of his assistant sue sampel picking up coffee at the checkout marguerite had met sue only once or twice but felt genuinely sorry for her she knew how ray treated his employees even back at crossbank rays staff had cycled pretty quickly sue had probably already applied for a transfer or soon would marguerite waved sue absently nodded back after lunch marguerite buckled down to her paperwork she vetted a particularly interesting report from a physiology team leader who had put a thousand hours of video through a graphics processor marking the motile parts of subjects body and correlating its changes with time of day and situation this approach had yielded surprising amounts of hard data which would need to go out to all the other divisions in a highpriority fyi bulletin shed have to compose it herself with input from bob corso and felice kawakami of physiology whenever they got back from the cancun conference a bulletpoint summary she supposed with hints for followup keeping it as succinct as possible so the various team bosses wouldnt bitch about the added infoload she kept subject on the wall panel so she could look up from her work and see the subject doing his subject worked in what was almost certainly a factory he stood at a pedestal in a vast enclosed space under a spotlight that illuminated his station similar beams of light demarked similar aboriginals hundreds of them arrayed behind him like phosphorescent pillars in a gloomy cavern subject took modular parts cylindrical devices as yet unidentified from a bin at the side of the pillar and inserted them into prepunched disks the disks rose from a chamber in his pedestal on an elevated platform and subsided again once he had completed them the cycle repeated every ten minutes or so to call it monotonous marguerite thought was pushing the limits of understatement but something had caught her attention because the subject was more or less stationary the virtual camera had rotated to image him headon she could see subjects face stark in the overhead light if you could call it a face people had called it horrifying but it wasnt of course only intensely unfamiliar shocking at first because one recognized some of the component parts the eyes for instance which sat in cups of bone like human eyes though they were white through and through while other features the feeding arms the mandibles were insectile or otherwise unfamiliar but you learned to transcend those distressing first impressions more disturbing was the inability to see past them to see meaning humans were wired to recognize human emotion reflected in human faces and with some skill a researcher could learn to understand the expressions of apes or wolves but subjects face defied interpretation his hands though they were hands disturbingly humanlike the long flexible fingers numbered three and the thumb was a fixed bony protruberance erupting from the wrist but all the parts made instant sense you could imagine grasping something with those hands they moved in a fast familiar fashion marguerite watched them work were they trembling it seemed to marguerite that the subjects hands were trembling she forwarded a quick note to the physiology team tremor in subjects hands looked like it this pm on direct feeds let me know m then she went back to her own work it was pleasant somehow tapping at her keyboard with the image of the subject over her shoulder as if they were working together as if she had company as if she had a friend she picked up tess on the way home it was a gym day and on gym days tess inevitably left school with her blouse buttoned offkilter or her shoes untied today was no exception but tess was subdued huddling against the autumn chill in the passenger seat and marguerite said nothing about her clothes everything okay i guess tess said from what i hear the data pipes are still shut down no video tonight we watch sunshine city on mondays yeah but not tonight sweetie i have a book to read tess volunteered thats good what are you reading a thing about astronomy home marguerite fixed dinner while tess played in her room dinner was a frozen chicken entree from the blind lake grocery store dull but expedient and within the range of marguerites limited culinary skills the chicken was rotating in the microsteamer when her phone buzzed marguerite dug the talkpiece out of her shirt pocket yes ms hauser speaking sorry to bother you so close to dinnertime this is bernie fleischer tessas homeroom teacher right marguerite disguised the sudden queasiness she felt we met in september i was wondering whether you might be able to stop by and have a talk sometime this week is there a problem with tess not a problem as such i just thought we should touch base we can talk about it in more detail when we get together marguerite set a date and replaced the phone in her pocket please she thought please dont let it be happening again six school ended early on wednesday the final bell rang at so that the teachers could hold some kind of meeting it had been homeroom all morning mr fleischer talking about wetlands and geography and the different kinds of birds and animals that lived around here and tess although she had stared out the window most of the time had been listening closely blind lake the lake not the town sounded fascinating at least the way mr fleischer described it he had talked about the sheet of ice that had covered this part of the world thousands upon thousands of years ago that in itself had been intriguing tess had heard of the ice age of course but she had not quite grasped that it had happened here that the land right under the schools foundations had once been buried in an unbearable weight of ice that the glaciers advancing had pushed rocks and soil before them like vast plows and retreating had filled the lands declivities and depressions with ancient water today was cloudy and cool but not rainy or unpleasant tess with the afternoon before her like an unopened gift decided to visit the wetlands the original blind lake she came across edie jerundt in the playground and asked whether shed like to go too edie punching a tetherball frowned and said unhuh the tetherball chimed dully against its metal post tess shrugged and walked away the ice had been here ten thousand years ago mr fleischer had said ten thousand summers growing cooler if you imagined travelling backward toward the glaciers ten thousand winters merging into winter uninterrupted she wondered what it had been like when the world had just begun to warm glaciers retreating to reveal the land underneath ground moraine mr fleischer had said washboard moraine whatever that meant farcarried soil dropped from the ice to block bedrock valleys and muddy the new rivers and make fresh sod for the grasslands maybe everything had smelled like spring back then tess thought maybe it had smelled that way for years at a time smelled like muck and rot and new things growing and long before that before the ice age had there been a global autumn there must have been tess was sure of it a whole world made like right now she thought with patches of frost in the morning and being able to see your breath when you walked to school she knew the wetlands lay beyond the paved spaces of town and at least a mile east past the cooling towers of eyeball alley and farther on beyond the low hill where edie jerundt had told her there was sledding in winter but the older kids were mean and would crash into you unless you came with an adult it was a long walk she followed the sidewalkless access road that led east from the town houses toward the alley turning aside when she reached the perimeter of that cluster of buildings tess had never been inside eyeball alley though she had been on a school tour of the similar building back at crossbank to be honest she was a little scared of the alley her mother said it was just like the one at crossbank a duplicate of it in fact and tess had not liked those deep enclosed corridors or the huge racks of obec platens or the loud cryopumps that kept them cold all these things frightened her more so because her thenteacher mrs flewelling kept saying that these machines and processes were not well understood she understood at least that images of the ocean planet at crossbank and lobsterville here at the lake were generated at these places at eyeball alley or what they had called at crossbank the big eye from these structures arose great mysteries tess had never been much impressed with the images themselves the subjects static life or the even more static ocean views they made boring video but when she was in the mood she could stare at them the way she might stare out a window feeling the exquisite strangeness of daylight on another planet the cooling towers at eyeball alley emitted faint trails of steam into the afternoon air clouds moved above them like nervous herd animals tess skirted the building keeping well clear of its perimeter fences she cut west along a trail through the wild grass one of the innumerable trails that had been scythed into the prairie by blind lakes children she buttoned the collar of her jacket against a rising wind by the time she reached the top of the sledding hill she was already footsore and ready to turn back but her first view of the wetlands fascinated her beyond the hill and past a grassy perimeter lay blind lake a semipermanent wetland mr fleischer had said a square mile of watery meadow and shallow marshes the land was overgrown with humps of grass and broad stands of cattails and in the patches of open water she could see resting canada geese like the ones that had passed overhead in noisy vformation all this autumn beyond that was another fence or rather the same fence that surrounded all of the blind lake national laboratory and the wetlands too this land was enclosed but it was also wild it lay within the socalled perimeter of security tess if she wandered into these marshes would be safe from terrorist attack or espionage agents though perhaps not from snapping turtles or muskrats she didnt know what a muskrat looked like but mr fleischer had said they lived here and tess disliked the sound of the name she walked downhill a little way farther until the ground oozed under the pressure of her feet and the cattails loomed before her like brown sentinels with woolly heads in a pool of still water to the left of her she could see her own reflection unless it was mirror girl looking back at her tess was barely willing to entertain that possibility even in the privacy of her own mind there had been so much trouble back at crossbank counselors psychiatrists all those endless and maddeningly patient questions she had been asked the way people had looked at her the way even her father and mother had looked at her as if she had done something shameful without being aware of it no not that not again mirror girl had only been a game the problem was the game had seemed real not real real the way a rock or a tree was real and substantial but more real than a dream more real than a wish mirror girl looked just like tess and had inhabited not only mirrors where she had first appeared but also empty air mirror girl whispered questions tess would never have thought to ask questions she couldnt always answer mirror girl the therapist had said was tessas own invention but tess didnt believe she could invent a personality as persistent and frequently annoying as mirror girl had been she risked another glance at the reflective water at her feet water full of clouds and sky water where her own face looked back at an oblique angle and seemed to smile in recognition tess said the wind and her reflection vanished in a corrugation of ripples she thought of the astronomy book she had been reading of the deepness of time and space in which even an ice age was only a moment tess the cattails and the rushes whispered go away tess said angrily i dont want any more trouble with you the wind gusted and died though the sense of unwanted presence remained tess turned away from the suddenly forbidding wetlands when she faced west she found the sun peeking out from a rack of cloud almost level with the hilltop she glanced at her watch four oclock the house key she kept on a chain around her neck felt like a ticket to paradise she didnt want to be out in this lonely wetness anymore she wanted to be home with this leaden knapsack off her back curled into the sofa with something good on the video panel or a book in her hands she felt suddenly doubtful and guilty as if she had done something wrong just by coming here though there were no rules against it only mr fleischers passing remark that it was possible to get lost in the marshes and that the shallow water wasnt always as shallow as it looked a huge blue heron rose into the air from the rushes only a few yards away cracking the air with its wings it carried something green and wiggling in the vise of its beak tess turned and ran to the top of the ridge anxious for the reassuring sight of blind lake the town wind whistled in her ears and the shushshush noise of her trouser legs brushing together sounded like urgent conversation she was comforted by the towers of the alley as she hurried past them comforted by the smooth blackness of the asphalt road as it wound into the town houses comforted by the nearness of the tall buildings of hubble plaza but she didnt care for the sound of policecar sirens down by the south gate sirens always sounded to tess like wailing babies hungry and lonely they meant something bad was happening she shivered and ran the rest of the way home seven wednesday morning sebastian vogel joined chris at one of the tiny makeshift tables in the community center cafeteria breakfast consisted of croissants watery scrambled eggs orange juice and coffee free of charge to involuntary guests chris started with the coffee he wanted a little neurochemical fortification before he even glanced at the steam table sebastian ambled up and dropped a copy of god the quantum vacuum on the tabletop elaine said you were curious i inscribed it for you chris tried to look grateful the book was a premium edition printed on real paper and bound in boards sturdy as a brick and about as heavy he imagined elaine suppressing a smile when she told sebastian how anxious chris was to read it sebastian must have carried a suitcase full of these into blind lake as if he were on a promotional tour thanks chris said i owe you one of mine no need i downloaded a copy of weighted answers before the links were cut elaine recommends it highly chris wondered how he could repay elaine for this strychnine in her breakfast cereal perhaps she seems to think sebastian went on this security crisis may work to our advantage chris leafed through vogels book scanning the chapter heads borrowing god he read why genes make minds where they find them the pernicious ampersand to our advantage how we see the institution in crisis especially if the lockdown goes on much longer she says we can get past ari weingarts publicity machine and talk to some real people see a side of blind lake thats never been explored in the press elaine was right of course and for once chris was ahead of her for a couple of days now he had been interviewing the stranded day workers getting their take on the security shutdown he hadnt needed elaines pep talk the other night he knew this was in all likelihood his last chance to salvage his career as a journalist the only question was whether he wanted to take it as elaine had also pointed out there were other options chronic alcoholism or drug abuse for instance and he had come close enough to both of those to understand the attraction or he could take some inconspicuous job writing ad copy or tech manuals and slide into a sedate respectable middle age he wasnt the first adult to face diminished expectations and he didnt feel entitled to sympathy for it the assignment to crossbank and blind lake had come like a childhood dream too long deferred a dream gone stale he had grown up in love with space had relished the images from the early nasa and eurostar optical interferometers tentative crude pictures that had included the two gas giants of umas system each with enormous complex ring systems and the tantalizing smudge that was a rocky planet inside the habitable zone of the star his parents had indulged his enthusiasm but never really understood it only his younger sister portia had been willing to listen to him talk about it and she treated these discussions as bedtime stories everything was a story as far as portia was concerned she liked to hear him talk about these distant and freshly envisioned worlds but always wanted him to go beyond the established facts were there people on these planets what did they look like we dont know he used to tell her they havent discovered that yet portia would pout in disappointment couldnt he have made something up but chris had acquired what he would later think of as a journalistic respect for the truth if you understood the facts they needed no embroidery all the wonder was already there the more spellbinding because it was true then the nasa interferometer had begun to lose signal strength and the newly designed obec devices quantum computers running adaptive neural nets in an openended organic architecture were enlisted to strain the final dregs of signal from noise they had done more than that of course out of their increasingly deep and recursive fourier analysis they had somehow derived an optical image even after the interferometers themselves ceased to function the analytic device had replaced the telescope it was meant to augment chris was spending his last year at home when the first images of hrb were released to the media his family hadnt paid much attention portia by that time was a bright teenager who had discovered politics and was frustrated that she hadnt been allowed to go to chicago to protest the inauguration of the continental commonwealth his parents had withdrawn from one another into their own pocket universes his father into woodworking and the presbyterian church his mother into a lateblooming bohemianism marked by mensa meetings and madras blouses psychic fairs and afghan scarves and although they had marveled at the images of hrb they hadnt truly understood them like most people they couldnt say how far away the planet was what it meant that it orbited another star why its seascapes were more than abstractly pretty or why there was so much fuss over a place no one could actually visit chris had wanted desperately to explain another nascent journalistic impulse the beauty and significance of these images were transcendent ten thousand years of humanitys struggle with ignorance had culminated in this achievement it redeemed galileo from his inquisitors and giordano bruno from the flames it was a pearl salvaged from the rubble of slavery and war it was also a ninedaywonder a media bubble a briefly lucrative source of income for the novelty industry ten years had passed the obec effect had proven difficult to understand or reproduce portia was gone and chriss first attempt at booklength journalism had been a disaster truth was a hard commodity to market even at crossbank even at blind lake internecine squabbling over target images and interpretation had almost engulfed the scientific discourse and yet here he was disillusioned disoriented fuckedover and fuckedup but with a last chance to dig out that pearl and share it a chance to relocate the beauty and significance that had once moved him nearly to tears he looked at sebastian vogel over the breakfaststained plastic tabletop what does this place mean to you sebastian shrugged amiably i came here the same way you did i got the call from visions east i talked to my agent i signed the contract yeah but is that all it is a publishing opportunity i wouldnt say that i may not be as sentimental about it as elaine but i recognize the significance of the work that goes on here every astronomical advance since copernicus has changed mankinds view of itself and its place in the universe its not just the results though its the process galileo could have explained the principle behind the telescope to almost anyone given a little patience but even the people who run the obecs cant tell you how they do what they do youre asking which is the bigger story sebastian said what we see or how we see it its an interesting angle maybe you should talk to the engineers at the alley theyre probably more approachable than the theorists because they dont care what i told the world about galliano chris thought because they dont consider me a judas still it was a good idea after breakfast he called ari weingart and asked him for a contact at the alley chief engineer out there is charlie grogan if you like ill get ahold of him and try to set up a meet id appreciate it chris said any new word on the lockdown sorry no no explanation its unusual obviously but no and you dont have to tell me how pissedoff people are weve got a guy in personnel whose wife went into labor just before the gates closed friday you can imagine how happy he is about all this his situation wasnt unique that afternoon chris interviewed three more day workers at the blind lake gym but they were reluctant to talk about anything except the shutdown families they couldnt reach pets abandoned appointments missed the least they could do is give us a fucking audio line out an electrician told him i mean what could happen somebodys going to bomb us by phone plus there are rumors starting to go around which is natural when you cant get any real news there could be a war on for all we know he could only agree a temporary security block was one thing going most of a week without information exchange in either direction bordered on lunacy much longer and it would look like something truly radical must have happened outside and maybe it had but that wasnt an explanation even in times of war what threat could a web or video connection pose why quarantine not only the population of blind lake but all their data conduits who was hiding what and from whom he intended to spend the hour before dinner putting his notes in some kind of order he was beginning to imagine the possibility of a finished article maybe not the twenty thousand words ve had asked for but not far short of it he even had a thesis miracles buried under the human capacity for indifference the somnolent culture of umae as a distant mirror a project like this would be good for him maybe restore some of his faith in himself or he could wake up tomorrow in the usual emasculating fog of selfrevulsion the knowledge that he was kidding absolutely nobody with his handful of halftranscribed interviews and fragile ambitions that was possible too maybe even likely he looked up from the screen of his pocket server in time to see elaine bearing down on him chris im busy theres something happening at the south gate thought you might want to see what is it do i know something big coming down the road at slow speed looks like an unmanned vehicle you can see it from the hill past the plaza can that little gizmo of yours capture video sure but so bring it come on it was a short walk from the community center to the crest of the hill whatever was happening was unusual enough that a small group of people had gathered to watch and chris could see more faces leaning into the windows of the south tower of hubble plaza did you tell sebastian about this elaine rolled her eyes i dont keep track of him and i doubt hes interested unless thats the holy ghost rolling down the road chris squinted into the distance the sinuous road away from blind lake was easily visible under a ceiling of close tumbling clouds and yes something was approaching the locked gate from outside chris thought elaine was probably right it looked like a big eighteenwheel driverless freight truck the kind of drone vehicle the military had used in the turkish crisis five years ago it was painted flat black and was unmarked at least as far as chris could tell from here it moved at a speed that couldnt have been more than fifteen miles per hour still ten minutes or so away from the gate chris shot a few seconds of video elaine said you in good shape because i mean to jog down there see what happens when that thing arrives could be dangerous chris said not to mention cold the temperature had dropped a good few degrees in the last hour he didnt have a jacket grow some balls elaine scolded him the truck doesnt look armed it may not be armed but its armored somebodys anticipating trouble all the more reason listen the sound of sirens two blind lake security vans sped past headed south elaine was spry for a woman of her age chris found himself hurrying to keep up eight marguerite left work early wednesday and drove to the school for her interview with mr fleischer tessas homeroom teacher blind lakes single school building was a long low twostory structure not far from the plaza surrounded by playgrounds an athletic field and a generous parking lot like all of the buildings in blind lake the school was cleanly designed but essentially anonymous it might have been any school anywhere it looked much like the school at crossbank and the smell that greeted marguerite when she stepped through the big front door was the smell of every school she had ever been inside a combination of sour milk wood shavings disinfectant adolescent musk and warm electronics she followed the corridor into the west wing tess had entered grade eight this year a step away from the hopscotch and barbie crowd tottering on the brink of adolescence marguerite had suffered through her own high school years and still felt a conditioned wave of apprehension amidst these rows of salmoncolored lockers though the school was largely empty the students had been sent home early to allow for this round of parentteacher interviews she imagined tess already at the house maybe reading and listening to the hum of the floorboard heaters home safe marguerite thought a little enviously she knocked at the halfopen door of room mr fleischers room he waved her in and rose to shake her hand she didnt doubt mr fleischer was an excellent teacher blind lake was a flagship federal institution and a key part of its employment package was the availability of a firstclass school system marguerite was sure mr fleischers credentials were impeccable he even looked like a good teacher or at least the kind of teacher you could safely confide in tall somewhat doeeyed well but not intimidatingly dressed with a trim beard and a generous smile his grip was firm but gentle welcome he said the room was equipped with childsized desks but he had imported a pair of parentfriendly chairs have a seat funny marguerite thought how awkward all this made her feel fleischer glanced at a sheet of notes good to meet you meet you again i should say since we were introduced at tessas orientation you work in observation and interpretation actually im the department head fleischers eyebrows levitated briefly here since august tess and i moved here in august yes tessas father was here a little earlier though wasnt he thats right youre separated divorced marguerite said promptly was it paranoia or had ray already discussed this with fleischer ray always said separated as if the divorce were a temporary misunderstanding and it would be just like ray to describe marguerite as working in interpretation rather than admit she was heading the department we have joint legal custody but tess is in my care the majority of time i see maybe ray had failed to mentioned that too fleischer paused and added a note to his files im sorry if this is intrusive i just want to get a sense of tessas situation at home shes been having some trouble here at school as im sure youre aware nothing serious but her marks arent where wed like them to be and she seems a little i dont know how to say it a little vague in class the move marguerite began no doubt thats a factor its like an army base here families move in and out all the time and its hard on the kids the kids can be hard on newcomers too ive seen it far too often but my concerns about tess go a little bit beyond that i had a look at her records from crossbank ah marguerite thought well that was inevitable raking these old coals again tess had some problems last spring but thats all over now this was during the process of the divorce yes she was seeing a therapist at that time right dr leinster at crossbank yes is she seeing anyone now here at blind lake marguerite shook her head decisively no have you thought about it weve got people on staff who can provide absolutely firstrate counseling im sure you do i dont feel its necessary fleischer paused he tapped a pencil against his desk back at crossbank tess had some kind of hallucinatory episode is that correct no mr fleischer thats not correct tess was lonely and she talked to herself she had a madeup friend she called mirror girl and there were times when it was a little hard for her to distinguish between reality and imagination thats a problem but its not a hallucination she was tested for temporallobe epilepsy and a dozen other neurological conditions the tests were uniformly negative according to her file she was diagnosed with aspergers syndrome yes but thats not a terribly uncommon condition she has a few tics she was languagedelayed and shes not very good at making friends but weve known that for some years now shes lonely yes and i believe her loneliness contributed to the problem at crossbank i think shes lonely here too im sure youre right yes shes lonely and disoriented wouldnt you be parents divorced a new place to live plus all the usual cruelties a child her age endures you dont have to tell me about it i see it every day in her body language in her eyes and you dont think therapy would help her deal with that i dont mean to be dismissive but therapy hasnt been a huge success tessas been on and off ritalin and a host of other drugs and none of them has done her any good quite the opposite that should be in the file too therapy neednt involve medication sometimes just the talking helps but it didnt help tess if anything it made her feel more unique more alone more oppressed did she tell you that she didnt have to marguerite discovered her palms were sweating her voice had tightened up too that defensive whine of yours ray used to call it whats the point mr fleischer again im sorry if this seems intrusive i like to have some background on my students especially if theyre having trouble i think it makes me a better teacher i guess it also makes me sound like an interrogator i apologize i know tess has been slow with her written work but she comes to class but there are days when shes i dont know how to describe it emotionally absent she stares out the window sometimes i call her name and she doesnt respond she whispers to herself that doesnt make her unique much less disturbed but it does make her difficult to teach all im saying is maybe we can help rays been here hasnt he mr fleischer blinked ive talked to your husband your exhusband on a couple of occasions but thats not unusual what did he tell you that im neglecting her that she complains about being lonely when shes with me fleischer didnt respond but his wideeyed look gave him away direct hit fucking ray look marguerite said i appreciate your concern and i share it but you should also know that ray isnt happy with the custody arrangements and this isnt the first time hes tried to set me up make me look like a bad parent so let me guess he came in here and told you how reluctant he was to raise the issue but he was worried about tess what with all the problems back at crossbank and maybe she wasnt getting the kind of parental attention she deserves in fact shed said a thing or two to him is that the gist fleischer held up his hands i cant get involved in this kind of discussion i told tessas father the same things im telling you ray has an agenda of his own mr fleischer my concern is with tess well i marguerite restrained an urge to bite her lip how had this gone so badly wrong fleischer was looking at her now with patient concern patronizing concern but he was a grade eight teacher after all and maybe that bigeyed frown was just a defensive reflex a mask that slid into place whenever he was confronted with an hysterical child or parent you know i obviously im willing to do whatever will help tess help her focus on her schoolwork basically fleischer said i think were on the same wavelength here tess missed a good deal of school at crossbank we dont want to repeat that no we dont honestly i dont think it will happen again she added hoping it didnt sound too obviously desperate i can sit down with her talk to her about being more thorough with her work if you think that would be a good idea it might help fleischer hesitated then all im saying marguerite is that we both need to keep our eyes open where tess is concerned stop trouble before it happens my eyes are all the way open mr fleischer well thats good thats the important thing if i think we need to touch base again can i call you anytime marguerite said ridiculously grateful that the interview seemed to be drawing to a close fleischer stood up thank you for your time and i hope i didnt alarm you not at all an outrageous lie my door is always open if you have any concerns of your own thank you i appreciate that she hurried down the corridor to the school door as if she were leaving the scene of a crime mistake to mention ray she thought but his fingerprints were all over this encounter and what a slick setup it had been and how like ray to use tessas problems as a weapon unless marguerite thought im kidding myself unless tessas problems went deeper than a mild personality disorder unless the whole crossbank circus was about to repeat itself she would do anything to help tess through this difficult passage if only she knew how to help but tessas own refractory indifference was almost impossible to breach especially with ray running interference playing mind games trying to position himself for some hypothetical custody battle ray seeing every conflict as a war and driven by his own dread of losing marguerite pushed through the doors into autumn air the afternoon had cooled dramatically and the clouds overhead were closer or seemed so in the long light of the sun the breeze was frigid but welcome after the claustrophobic warmth of the schoolroom as she let herself into her car she heard the wail of sirens she drove cautiously to the exit and stopped long enough to let a blind lake security vehicle roar past it looked like it was heading for the south gate nine sue sampel ray scutters executive assistant tapped on his door and reminded him that ari weingart was scheduled for a meeting in twenty minutes ray looked up from a stack of printed papers and pursed his lips thank you im aware of that plus the guy from civilian security at four oclock i can read my own day planner thanks okay then sue said screw you too ray was in a dark mood this wednesday not that he was ever sweetnessandlight she supposed he was chafing under the lockdown like everybody else she understood the need for security and she could even imagine that it might be necessary though god knows why to make it impossible to place so much as a phone call outside the perimeter but if this went on much longer people were going to get seriously pod many already were the day workers for sure who had lives spouses children outside the blind lake campus but the permanent residents too sue herself for example she lived in the lake but she dated offcampus and she had been anxious to get that allimportant second phone call from a man shed met at a secular singles group in constance a man her age midforties a veterinarian with thinning hair and gentle eyes she imagined him with a phone in his hand gazing sadly at all those no signal or server unavailable tags and eventually giving up on her another lost opportunity at least this time it wouldnt be her fault ari weingart popped into the office at the appointed hour good old ari polite funny even prompt a saint the boss is in ari asked as luck would have it ill let him know youre here ray scutters window looked south from the sixth floor of hubble plaza and he was often distracted by the view usually there was a constant stream of traffic in and out of the lake lately there had been none and the lockdown had made his window view static rendered the land beyond the perimeter fence as blank as brown paper no motion but gliding cloudshadows and the occasional darting flock of birds if you stared long enough it began to look as inhuman as the landscape of umae just another imported image it was all surface wasnt it all twodimensional the lockdown had created a number of irritating problems not the least of which was that he appeared to be the senior civilian authority on campus his status in the administration hierarchy was relatively junior but the annual nsi conference on astrobiology and exocultural science had been held in cancun this weekend past a huge delegation of academic staff and senior administrators had packed their swimsuits and left blind lake a day before the lockdown pull those names out of the flow chart and what remained was ray scutter floating over the various department heads like a loose balloon it meant that people were coming to him with problems he wasnt empowered to resolve demanding things he couldnt give them like a coherent explanation of the lockdown or a special exemption from it he had to tell them he was in the dark too all he could do was carry on under the standing protocols and wait for instructions from outside wait in other words for the whole shitting mess to reach a conclusion but it had already gone on for an uncomfortably long time he looked away from the window as ari weingart knocked and entered ray disliked weingarts cheery optimism he suspected it disguised a secret contempt suspected that under his halefellow exterior weingart was peddling influence as enthusiastically as every other department head but at least weingart understood rays position and seemed more interested in coping than complaining if he could only suppress that smile the smile bore down on ray like a klieg light teeth so white and regular they looked like luminous mahjong tiles sit ray said weingart pulled up a chair and opened his pocket desktop down to business ray liked that you wanted a list of situations well have to address if the quarantine goes on much longer i drew up some notes quarantine ray said is that what people are calling it as opposed to a standard sixhour lockdown yeah why would we be quarantined no ones sick talk to dimi dimitry shulgin was the civilian security chief due here at four the lockdown follows an obscure set of regs in the military manual he says its what they call a data quarantine but nobody ever really expected it to come into effect he hasnt mentioned this to me i swear to god hes like some fucking slavic clam what exactly is a data quarantine meant to accomplish the regs were written back when crossbank was just beginning to pull images its one of those paranoid scenarios from the congressional hearings the idea was that crossbank or blind lake might download something dangerous obviously nothing physical but a virus or a worm of some kind you know what steganography is data encrypted into photographs or images he didnt remind weingart that he ray had testified at those hearings information warfare had been a hot topic at the time the luddite lobby had feared that blind lake might import some pernicious alien selfreplicating digital program or for gods sake a deadly meme which would then spread through terrestrial data routes wreaking unknowable havoc wary as he often was of blind lakes groping into the unknown the idea was preposterous the aboriginals of umae could hardly know they were being spied on and even if they did images processed at the lake had traveled however mysteriously at the conventional speed of light it would need both an impossible perceptivity and a ridiculously patient desire for revenge for them to react in any hostile way still he had been forced to admit dangerous steganography was not an absolute impossibility at least in the abstract so a series of contingency plans had been written into the already immense web of security plans surrounding the lake even though in rays opinion it was the biggest crock of astronomical shit since girolamo fracastoros theory that syphilis was caused by the conjunction of saturn jupiter and mars had those bullshit edicts actually been called into effect one problem with that idea he told weingart no provocation we havent downloaded anything suspicious not yet anyway weingart said you know something i dont hardly but lets say if there was a problem at crossbank come on crossbank is looking at oceans and bacteria i know but if and were imaging completely different targets in any case their work doesnt reflect on ours no but if there was a problem with the process somehow something endemic to the eye you mean if there was some kind of problem with the obecs at crossbank doe or the military might have decided to put us under a precautionary quarantine they could at least have warned us information jamming is twoway no in no out we have to assume they dont want so much as a carrier wave getting through that doesnt preclude a warning unless they were in a hurry this is ridiculously speculative and i hope you and shulgin havent been spreading it around rumors can cause panic weingart looked like he wanted to say something but bit it back anyway ray said its out of our hands the pressing question is what we can do for ourselves until somebody unbuttons the fence weingart nodded and began to read from his list supplies we pipe in our drinking water and that hasnt been interrupted but without intervention well run short of some foodstuffs before the end of the week and face a starvationlevel crisis by the end of november im assuming well be resupplied but it might be a good idea to segregate our surplus and maybe even post guards over it in the meantime i cant imagine this siege going on until thanksgiving well but were talking whatif here all right all right what else medical supplies same deal and the oncampus clinic isnt set up to deal with serious or widespread illness or injuries if we had a fire wed have to ship burn victims to a major hospital or suffer needless fatalities not much we can do about that either except ask the medical staff to make contingency plans plus if the quarantine is prolonged people are going to need emotional counselling we already have some folks with urgent family matters on the outside theyll live lodging there are a couple hundred day workers sleeping in the gym not to mention visiting journalists a handful of contractors and anybody who happened to be here on a day pass longterm if this is a longterm quarantine it might be better to see if we can billet those people out there are people living oncampus who have spare rooms or guest quarters available and it wouldnt be hard to round up volunteers with a little luck we could have everybody sleeping on a bed or at least a pullout sofa sharing bathrooms instead of fighting over the showers at the community center and lining up for the jakes look into it ray said after a moments thought he added put together a list of volunteers but bring it to me before you talk to them and well have to compile an inventory of day workers and guests to go with it there was more of this minutiae that could be easily delegated for the most part all predicated on a prolonged lockdown ray couldnt seriously envision a month of this three months it was unimaginable his certainty was tempered only by the nagging fact that the lockdown had already gone on an unreasonably long time sue sampel tapped at the door while weingart was summing up were not finished ray called out she leaned into the room i know but if shulgin is here he can wait a few minutes hes not here but he called to cancel hes headed down to the south gate the south gate whats so fucking important about the south gate she smiled infuriatingly he said youd understand if you took a look out your window the huge eighteenwheeled vehicle powderblack and heavily armored crawled along the road toward blind lake like an immense pill bug timid for all its layered defenses where the drivers cab should have been there was only a blunt cone fitted with sensors the truck was reading the road gauging its location according to buried transponders and gps numbers there was no human driver the truck was driving itself by the time chris and elaine neared the south gate the road was already mobbed with offduty day workers and office staff and a gaggle of high school kids a pair of civilian security vans pulled up and discharged a dozen men in gray uniforms who began waving the crowd back to what they deemed a safe distance the fence surrounding blind lakes innermost perimeter was a stateoftheart containment device elaine had told chris its posts were reinforced alloy cores sunk deep into the earth its chains and links were carbon composites stronger than steel their exposed surfaces slicker than teflon and studded with sensors atop all this was a double concertina of razor wire inclined at ninety degrees the whole thing could be electrified to a lethal voltage the gate that barred the road was hinged to swing open on a signal from the guardhouse or from a coded transponder the guardhouse itself was a concrete bunker with slit windows sturdy as bedrock but currently vacant the resident guard had been pulled out when the lockdown went into effect chris wormed his way to the front of the crowd elaine following with her hands on his shoulders at last they came up against the highway barriers the security men were muscling into place elaine pointed out a car just arriving isnt that ari weingart and i think the guy with him is raymond scutter chris took note of the face ray scutter was an interesting story fifteen years ago he had been a prominent critic of astrobiology the science of wishful thinking the martian disappointment had lent rays point of view a great deal of credibility at least until the terrestrial planet finders began to yield interesting results the crossbankblind lake breakthroughs had made his pessimism look shortsighted and meanspirited but ray scutter had survived through a combination of graceful backpedalling and a converts enthusiasm the genuinely solid contributions he made to the first wave of geological and atmospheric surveys had not only rescued his career but allowed him to move up through the bureaucracy to important administrative positions at crossbank and now the lake ray scutter would have made an interesting subject chris thought but he was supposed to be hard to approach and his public pronouncements were so predictably banal that better journalists than chris had written him off as a lost cause right now he was scowling butting heads with the security chief chris couldnt hear the conversation but he zoomed in his pocket recorder and archived a few seconds of video just a few though he was saving the bulk of the memory for the apparently inevitable collision of the robotic truck with the gate the truck had crept to within a hundred yards of the guardhouse it looked unstoppably massive elaine shaded her eyes and stared intently along the line of the fence the setting sun had come under a rack of cloud and spilled a raking light across the prairie she put her mouth against chriss ear am i seeing things or are there pocket drones out there startled chris followed her line of sight bob krafft a contractor who had come into blind lake with a team of engineers to survey the high ground east of the alley for the construction of new housing had spotted the truck shortly after noon when it was still a peasized dot on the wide southern horizon he had done some time in the turkish wars and he recognized it as the kind of driverless resupply vehicle more commonly found in a combat zone but the truck didnt alarm him quite the opposite incongruous as it might be the truck was still inbound traffic which meant the south gate would have to swing open to admit it and that was a golden opportunity he knew immediately what he had to do he found his wife courtney among the cots set up in the blind lake gymnasium where they had languished for most of a week he told her to wait right here but be ready to travel she looked at him nervously courtney was nervous at the best of times but kept her mouth shut and gave him a terse nod bob walked two blocks quickly but not quickly enough to attract attention to his car in the visitors lot under hubble plaza he got in doublechecked the charge gauge sparked the motor and drove at a deliberate speed back to the rec center his pulse was up but his palms were dry courtney wandering through the big front doors even though he had told her stay put spotted him and climbed into the passenger seat are we going somewheres she asked he had always hated this about her her missouri trailerpark grammar there were days when he loved courtney more than anything in the world but there were also days when he wondered what had possessed him to marry a woman with no more culture than the raccoons who used to raid her trash i dont think we have a choice court well i dont see what the hurry is with any luck she never would bob was quarterowner of a respectably successful landscaping and foundation business operating out of constance thursday morning tomorrow morning he was supposed to meet ella raeburn a nineteenyearold high school dropout who worked in reception and drive her to the womens clinic in bixby for a d c although it was not bobs fault that the vacuous ella had neglected to use any form of birthcontrol or morningafter pill unless you considered his predilection for brickstupid women a fault he did have to own up to responsibility for the condition she was in so thursday morning he would drive her to bixby buy her a few days in a motel to recuperate write her a check for five thousand dollars and that would be the end of it if he refused or if this governmentinspired blind lake fuckup kept him confined here another day ella raeburn would fedex a certain video recording to bobs wife courtney he doubted courtney would divorce him over it the marriage wasnt a bad deal for her all in all but she would hold it over his head for the rest of his life the fact that shed been treated to the sight of her own husband with his face buried between ella raeburns generous young thighs the video had been his own halfbaked idea he hadnt realized ella would burn a copy for herself and that wasnt the worst of it not by half if bob failed to arrange for an abortion ella would be forced to throw herself on the mercy of her father her father was toby raeburn a hardware salesman a deacon at the lutheran church and a parttime basketball coach his nickname was teeth because he had once knocked out the left bicuspid of a wouldbe car thief and then had the souvenir embedded in lucite so he could carry it around as a goodluck charm toby teeth raeburn might be willing to extend christian forgiveness to his daughter but surely not to a middleaged contractor who as ella would mention had introduced her to the barbiturates that always put her in a cooperative mood he didnt bear ella raeburn any particular grudge over the matter he was more than willing to pay for her d c she was dumb as a bag of hammers but she knew how to look out for herself he kind of admired that courtney had been one of those before he married her she had dulled down into a perpetual sullen snit though and that wasnt the same did they call off the siege or something courtney asked not exactly he headed toward the south gate reminding himself to maintain an inconspicuous speed certainly the black transport was in no hurry it hadnt crept more than a quarter of a mile since hed first spotted it judging by the view from the rise past the plaza well what then we cant just leave technically no but technically you want to let me finish a thought they shut down places like this for security reasons court they dont want the bad guys getting in people arent allowed to just come and go because that would make it hard to enforce but basically they dont care about us all we want to do is go home right if we break the rules we get what a lecture more likely a fine and probably an expensive one but he couldnt tell courtney why it was worth taking that risk they dont care about us he repeated the gates locked dummy wont be in a little while who says i say how do you know im psychic i have psychic powers of prediction there was already a crowd gathering bob drove off the road onto the trimmed grass of the verge and parked as close as possible to the right side of the gate he turned the motor off suddenly he could hear the wind whistling through gaps in the bodywork the wind was getting colder winter cold and courtney shivered pointedly she hadnt brought winter clothes to blind lake bob had and he was punished for that foresight he had to lend his jacket to whining courtney and sit behind the wheel in a shortsleeve cotton shirt the sun dropped down below a big raft of turbulent gray clouds casting a sickly light over everything a couple of months and all this prairie would be ballsdeep in snow it was melancholy weather this kind of weather always made him feel sad and somehow bereft as if something he loved had been carried away by the wind are we just going to sit here till the gate opens he said what makes you think theyll let us through youll see see what youll see huh courtney said she had dozed off warm he guessed with her arms lost in his oversized leather jacket and her chin tucked down into the collar when the immense black truck paused in its crawl not more than ten yard from the gate it was past dusk now and the trucks headlights pivoted to sweep the ground ahead of it in restless arcs the crowd had grown considerably just before courtney fell asleep a couple of oncampus security vehicles had come from town with their sirens howling now guys in what looked like rentacop uniforms were waving the crowd back courtney was motionless and bob hunkered down in the drivers seat and in all the commotion and darkness the car passed for an empty vehicle someone had parked and left within moments bob was delighted to see the bulk of the crowd was actually behind him and the gate began to open on some command from the truck he guessed but it was a beautiful sight that ninefoottall reinforced barrier began to swing outward with an oiled ease so smooth it looked digitally rendered jackpot bob thought buckle your seat belt he told courtney her eyes blinked open what he made a mental estimate of the clearance ahead of him nothing he sparked the engine and stepped hard on the accelerator pocket drones elaine explained were selfguided flying weapons about the size of a florida grapefruit she had seen them in use during the turkish crisis where they had patrolled nogo lines and contested borders but she had never heard of them being deployed outside of a war zone theyre simple and pretty dumb she told chris but theyre cheap and you can use lots of them and they dont sit in the ground forever like land mines blowing legs off kids what do they do mostly they just lie there conserving energy theyre motionsensitive and they have a few logic templates to identify likely targets walk into a nogo zone and theyll fly up like locusts target you spit out small but lethal explosives chris looked where elaine had pointed but in the gathering dusk he could see nothing suspicious you had to be quick to catch them elaine said they were camouflaged and if they hopped up without finding an allowed target disturbed say by the rumbling of that huge automated truck on the pavement they went dormant again very quickly chris thought about that as the truck approached and the increasingly nervous security men shooed gawkers farther back from the road made no sense he decided the innermost fence around blind lake was only one of dozens of security measures already in place what threat was so formidable that it would require wartime ordnance to keep it out unless the idea was to keep people in but that made no sense either which didnt mean the pocket drones hadnt been deployed only that he couldnt figure out why the crowd grew quieter as darkness fell and the truck crawled up within range of the gate and idled for a moment some few began to drift away apparently feeling more vulnerable or cold than curious but a number remained pressed against the rope restraints the security people had thrown up they seemed not to mind the increasingly cutting wind or the unseasonable snowflakes that began to swirl into the trucks high beams but they gasped and withdrew a few feet when the gate itself began to swing silently open chris looked behind him at elaine and caught a passing glimpse of blind lake beginning to light up in a mist of flurries the concentric slabs of hubble plaza the blinking navigation lights on the towers of eyeball alley the warmer light of resident housing in neat logical rows he turned back at the sudden sound of an electric motor much closer than the rumble of the idling truck video elaine barked chris he fumbled with the little personalserver accessory his fingers were cold and the controls were the size of flyspecks and fleabites he had only ever really used the thing for dictation at last he managed to trigger the record vid function and point the device approximately toward the gate a car sprang forward onto the tarmac from somewhere down by the guardhouse its lights were out its occupants invisible but the intention was clear the vehicle was making a run for the halfopened gate somebody wants to go home and feed the dog elaine said and then her eyes went wide oh jesus this is bad the drones chris thought it seemed that the vehicle might not make it past the guardhouse but the driver had estimated the widening gap pretty well the car it looked to chris like a latemodel ford or tesla squeezed through the space with millimeters of clearance and swerved hard left to avoid the grille of the robotic truck the cars headlights came on as it bounced onto the margin of the road and began to pick up serious speed are you getting this elaine demanded yes at least he hoped so it was too late to check too late to look away home free bob krafft yelled as his rear bumper swung past the bulk of the black truck it wasnt true of course probably theyd be intercepted by a military vehicle maybe even spend the night getting lectured and threatened and charged with violating smallprint regulations but he wasnt an enlisted man and hed never signed an agreement to spend a fucking eternity in blind lake anyway the open land rolling out beyond his headlights was a welcome sight home free he said again mostly to drown out the sound of courtneys breathless screeches of fear she sucked in enough air to call him an asshole he said were out of there arent we jesus yeah but something out the side window caught her eye bob caught a glimpse of it too some small thing leaping out of the tall grass probably a bird he thought but suddenly the car was full of cold air and hard little flakes of snow and his ears hurt and there was window glass everywhere and it seemed like courtney was bleeding he saw blood on the dashboard blood all over his good leather jacket court he said his own voice sounded strange and underwatery his foot stabbed the brake but the road was slippery and the tesla began to swerve despite the best efforts of its overworked servos something caused the engine to explode in a gout of blue fire the body of the car rose from the road bob was pressed against his seat watching the tarmac and the tall grass and the dark sky revolve around him and for a fraction of a second he thought why were flying then the car came down on its right front fender and he was thrown into courtney into the sticky ruin of her at least into courtney gone all red and licked with flames the fuck ray scutter asked when he saw the fireball dimitry shulgin the civilian security chief could only mumble something about ordnance ordnance ray tried to grasp the significance of that a car had run the fence the car had caught fire and rolled over it came to a stop topdown then everything was still even the crowd at the gate was momentarily silent it was like a photograph a frozen image halted time he blinked pellet snow blew into his face stinging drones shulgin pronounced it was as if he had broken the crust of the silence several people in the crowd began to scream drones those objects hovering over the burning automobile winged softballs what does that mean ray asked he had to shout the question twice spectators began to dash for their cars headlights sprang on raking the prairie suddenly everybody wanted to go home heedless as a bad dream the gate continued gliding open until it was parallel to the road the black robotic truck inched forward again past the barrier and into the lake nothing good shulgin replied ray by this time had forgotten the question the security chief edged away from the tarmac seeming to fight his own urge to run look out beyond the gate in the hostile emptiness the driversside door of the burning car groaned open now that the car had come to rest bob registered little more than the need to escape from it to escape the flames and the bloody blackened object courtney had somehow become at the back of his mind was the need to get help but there was also dwelling in the same place the unwelcome knowledge that court was beyond all human help he loved courtney or at least he liked to tell himself so and he often felt a genuine affection for her but what he needed now more than anything else in the world was to put some distance between himself and her ravaged body between himself and the burning car there was no gasoline in the motor but there were other flammable fluids and something had ignited all of them at once he scrambled away from courtney to the driversside door the door was crumpled and didnt want to open the latchhandle came off in his hand he braced himself against the steering wheel and the seatback and kicked outward and though it hurt his feet hellishly the door did at last creak and groan a little way open on its damaged hinges bob forced it wider and then tumbled out gasping at the cold air he rose to his knees then shaking he stood upright this time he saw quite clearly the device that popped out of the tall grass at the verge of the road he happened to be looking in the right direction happened to catch sight of it in a moment of frozen hyperclarity this small incongruous object that was in all likelihood the last thing he would ever see it was round and camouflagebrown and it flew on buzzing pinwheel wings it hovered at a height of about six feet level with bobs head he looked at it eyeball to eyeball assuming some of those small dents or divots were equivalent to eyes he recognized it as a piece of military equipment though it was like nothing he had ever encountered in his weekends with the reserves he didnt even think about running from it one doesnt run from such things he stiffened his spine and began but had no time to finish the act of closing his eyes he felt the sting of snow against his skin then a brief fiery weight on his chest then nothing at all this final act of bloody interdiction was more than enough for the crowd they watched the dead man if you could call that headless bundle of exposed body parts a man crumple to the ground there was an absolute silence then screams then sobs then car doors slamming and kids wheeling their bikes around for a panicked trip back through the snowy dusk toward the lights of blind lake once the spectators had cleared out it was easier for shulgin to organize his security people they werent trained for anything like this they were bonded nightwatchmen mostly hired to keep drunks and juveniles out of delicate places some were retired veterans most had no military experience and to be honest ray thought there was nothing much for them to do here only establish a mobile cordon around the slowlymoving truck and prevent the few remaining civilians from getting in the way but they did a presentable job of it within fifteen minutes of the events beyond the gate the black transport truck came to a stop inside the perimeter of blind lake its a delivery vehicle elaine said to chris it was designed to drop cargo and go home see the cabs disengaging from the flat chris watched almost indifferently it was as if the attack on the fleeing automobile had been burned into his eyes out in the darkness the fire had already been reduced to smoldering embers in the wet snow a couple of people had died here and they had died it seemed to chris in order to communicate a message to blind lake in the bluntest possible way you may not pass your community has become a cage the truck cab reversed direction pulling itself and its sheath of armor away from the conventional aluminum cargo container shielded within the cab kept moving more quickly than it had arrived back through the open gate along the road to constance when it reached the smoldering ruins of the automobile it pushed them out of its way shoveled them onto the verge of the road like idle garbage the gate began to swing closed smooth as silk chris thought except for the deaths the cargo container remained behind the overworked security detail hurried to surround it not that anyone seemed anxious to get close chris and elaine circled back for a better view the rear of the container was held closed by a simple lever there was some dialogue between ray scutter and the man elaine had identified as the lakes security chief at last the security man stepped through the cordon and pulled down the lever decisively the containers door swung open a halfdozen of his men played flashlight over the contents the container was stacked high with cardboard boxes chris was able to read some of the printing on the boxes kelloggs seabury farm lombardi produce groceries elaine said were going to be here awhile chris thought part two polished mirrors of floating mercury having an intelligence of a vastly different order than that of man the decapods were unable to conceive the fact that an earthman was a thinking entity possibly to them man was no more than a new type of animal his buildings and industry having impressed them no more than the community life of an ant impresses the average man aside from his wonder at the analogy of that life to his own leslie frances stone the human pets of mars ten chris carmody whatd you do walk here brush off that snow and come in im charlie grogan charlie grogan chief engineer at eyeball alley was a big man more robust than fat and he put out a beefy hand for chris to shake full head of hair gone white at the temples confident but not aggressive actually chris said yeah i did walk here no car no car and he had arrived in blind lake without winter clothes even this unlined jacket was borrowed the snow tended to get down the collar when you work in a building without windows grogan said you learn to pick up clues about the weather outside are we still this side of a blizzard its coming down pretty good uhhuh well you know december you have to expect a little snow this part of the country we were lucky to get through thanksgiving with only a couple of inches hang your coat over there take off those shoes too we got these little rubber slippers grab a pair off the shelf that thing youre wearing is that a voice recorder yes it is so the interviews already started unless you tell me to turn it off no i guess thats what were here for i was afraid you wanted to talk about the quarantine i dont know any more about it than anyone else but ari weingart tells me youre working on a book a long magazine article maybe a book depending depending on whether were ever allowed outside again that and whether theres still an audience to read it its like playing letspretend isnt it pretend we still live in a sane world pretend we have useful jobs to do call it an act of faith chris said what im prepared to do my act of faith i guess is show you around the alley and talk about its history thats what you want thats what i want mr grogan call me charlie you already wrote a book didnt you yes i did yeah i heard about that book about ted galliano that biologist some people say it was character assassination have you read it no and no offense but i dont want to i was introduced to galliano at a conference on bioquantum computing maybe he was a genius with antivirals but he was an asshole too sometimes when people get famous they also get a little celebrityhappy he wasnt content unless he was talking to media or big investors i think he needed to feel like a hero whether he deserved it or not but i didnt come here to talk about galliano just wanted to clear the air i dont hold your book against you if galliano decided to drive his motorcycle over that cliff it surely wasnt your fault thank you how about that tour eyeball alley was a replica of the installation at crossbank which chris had also visited structurally identical at least the differences were all in the details names on doors the color of the walls some halfhearted seasonal decor had lately been installed a festoon of green and red crepe over the cafeteria entrance a paper wreath and menorah in the staff library charlie grogan wore a pair of glasses that showed him things chris couldnt see little local datafeeds telling him who was in which office and as they passed a door marked endostatics charlie had a brief conversation by throat microphone with the person inside hey there ellie keeping busy nah boomers fine thanks for asking boomer chris asked my hound charlie said boomers getting on in years they took an elevator several stories down deep into the controlled environment of the alleys core well get you suited up and into the stacks charlie said but when they approached a wide door marked sterile gear there was a flashing red light above it unscheduled maintenance charlie explained no tourists are you prepared to wait an hour or so if we can talk chris followed the chief engineer back to the cafeteria charlie had not had lunch nor for that matter had chris the food on the steam tables was the same food they served back at the community center the same prefabricated rice pilaf and chicken curry and wrapped sandwiches delivered by the same weekly black truck the engineer grabbed a wedge of hamonrye chris still a little chilled by his walk to the alley went for the hot food the air in the cafeteria was pleasantly steamy and the smell from the kitchen rich and reassuring i go a fairly long way back in this business charlie said not that there are any novices at the lake apart from the grad students we cycle through did ari tell you i was at berkeley lab with dr gupta tommy gupta had done pioneering work on selfevolving neuralnet architectures and quantum interfaces you must have been an undergraduate yourself yup and thank you for noticing this was back when we were using butov chips for logic elements interesting times though nobody knew exactly how interesting it was going to get the astronomical application chris said you were in on that too a little bit but it was all unexpected obviously in truth chris didnt need this playback the story was familiar and every general astronomy and popscience journalist of the last several years had recounted some version of it really he thought it was only the latest chapter of mankinds long ambition to see the unseeable embellished with twentyfirstcentury technology it had begun when nasas first generation of spaceborne planetspotting observatories the socalled terrestrial planet finders identified three arguably earthlike planets orbiting nearby sunlike stars the tpfs begat the high definition interferometers which begat the greatest of all the optical interferometer projects the galileo array six small but complex automated spacecraft all operating beyond the orbit of jupiter linked to create one virtual telescope of immense resolving power the galileo array it was said at the time could map the shapes of continents on worlds hundreds of light years away and it had worked for a while then the telemetry from the array began to deteriorate the signal faded slowly but relentlessly over a period of months after an intensive review nasa pinpointed the source of the failure as a few lines of bad code so deeply embedded in the onboard galileo architecture that they couldnt be overwritten this was a risk nasa had assumed from the beginning the array was both complex and radically inaccessible it couldnt be repaired in place a technological triumph was on the way to becoming an insanely expensive joke nasa didnt have an obec processor back then charlie said but gencorp offered them time on their unit you worked at gencorp i babysat their hardware yeah gencorp was getting good results doing proteinomics you could do the same stuff with a standard quantum array of course engineers used to think of the obecs as unnecessarily complicated and unpredictable a fancy kludge like a vacuum cleaner with an appendix people used to say but you cant argue with results gencorp got faster results with a obec machine than mit could coax out of a standard bec device spooky ones too spooky unexpected counterintuitive anybody who works with adaptive selfprogramming will tell you its not like running raw becs and becs can be pretty strange all by themselves what i cant really say because im supposed to be a levelheaded and factually oriented kind of guy is that an obec just plain thinks strange but thats as good an explanation as any because nobody really knows why a bec processor with an openended organic architecture can outthink a bec processor alone its the fucking ghost in the machine pardon my french and what we do in the pit it isnt just amps and volts were tending something thats very nearly alive it has its good days and its bad days charlie trailed off as if he realized hed overstepped the bounds of engineering propriety he doesnt want me quoting this chris thought so you went to nasa with the obec processor nasa ended up buying a few platens from gencorp i was part of the package but thats another story see basically the problem was this as the galileo arrays output got fainter it was increasingly harder to separate the signal from the noise our job was to extract that signal hunt it down subtract it from all the rest of the random radio garbage the universe belches out people ask me so howd you do it and i have to tell them we didnt do it nobody did it we just posed the problem to the obecs and let them generate tentative answers and bred them for success hundreds of thousands of generations per second like this big invisible darwinian evolutionary race survival of the fittest where the definition of fittest is success at extracting a signal from a noisy input code writing code writing code and code withering and dying more generations than all the people who ever lived on the earth almost more generations than life on the earth numbers complexifying themselves like dna the beauty is the unpredictability of it you understand i think so chris said he liked charlies eloquence he always liked it when an interviewee showed signs of passion i mean we made something that was beautiful and mysterious very beautiful very mysterious and it worked chris said signals out of noise whole world knows it worked of course we werent sure of that ourselves not while it was happening we had a few what we called threshold events wed almost lose everything wed have a good clean image then wed start to lose it almost pixel by pixel that was the noise winning out loss of intelligibility but each time the obecs pulled it back without our intervention you understand it drove the math guys nuts because theres obviously a level where you just cant extract a meaningful signal when theres just too much lost but the machines kept on pulling it out rabbit out of a hat presto until one day until one day until one day a man in a suit came into the lab and said boys we got confirmation from upstairs the array just stopped broadcasting altogether shut down entirely you can get ready to close up shop and go home and my boss at the time that was kelly fletcher shes at crossbank now she turned away from her monitor and said well that may be but the fact is were still making data charlie finished his sandwich wiped his mouth pushed his chair away from the table we can probably get into the stacks now back at crossbank chris had toured the obecs from the gallery level he hadnt been invited into the works the sterile suit was comfortable as such things went cool air piped in a wide and transparent visor but chris still felt a little claustrophobic inside it charlie led him through an access door into the eerily quiet obec chamber the platens were white enameled cylinders each the size of a small truck they were suspended on isolation platforms that would filter out any groundborne vibration short of a major earthquake strange delicate machines it could end at any time chris murmured whats that something an engineer at crossbank told me he said he liked the rush working with a process that could end at any time thats part of it for sure these are technologies of a whole new order he stepped over a bundle of tefloninsulated wires these machines are looking at planets but ten years after that first nasa connection we still dont know how theyre doing it or if theyre doing it chris thought there was a fringe of hardcore skeptics who believed there was no real data behind the images that the obecs were simply well dreaming so charlie said we really have two research projects going on at once guys at the plaza trying to sort out the data and people here trying to figure out how we get the data but we cant look too closely we cant take the obecs apart or dose them with xrays or anything invasive like that you measure it you break it blind lake didnt just duplicate the crossbank installation we had to walk our machines through the same development process except we used the old highdef interferometers instead of the galileo array deliberately stepping down the signal strength until the machines learned the trick whatever that trick is there are only two installations like this in the world and efforts to create a third have been consistently unsuccessful were balanced on the head of a pin thats what your guy at crossbank was talking about something absolutely strange and wonderful is happening here and we dont understand it all we can do is nurse it along and hope it doesnt get tired and turn itself off it could end at any time sure it could and for any reason he led chris past the last of the obec platens through a series of chambers to a room where they stripped off their sterile suits what you have to remember charlie said is that we didnt design these machines to do what they do theres no linear process no a then b then c we just set them in motion we defined the goals and we set them in motion and what happened after that was an act of god he folded the sterile suit crisply and left it on a rack for cleaning charlie walked him through the busiest sector of the alley two huge chambers wallpapered with video surfaces rooms full of attentive men and women hovering over mutable desktops chris was reminded of the old nasa facilities at houston looks like mission control for good reason charlie said nasa used to control the galileo array with interfaces like these when the problems got unmanageably bad they routed this stuff through the obecs this is where we talk to the platens about alignment depth of field magnification factors things like that down to the finest detail a monitor on the far wall showed raw video lobsterville except elaine was right it was a ridiculous misnomer the aboriginals didnt look remotely like lobsters except perhaps for their roughly textured skin in fact chris had often thought there was something bovine about them something about their slowmoving indifference those big blank cueball eyes subject was in a food conclave deep inside a dimly lit food well mossy growth and vegetable husks everywhere and grublike things crawled through the moist refuse watching these guys eat chris thought was a great appetite killer he turned back to charlie grogan yeah charlie said it could end at any time thats the truth youre staying at the community center ari tells me for now anyway you want a ride back im basically done here for the day chris checked his watch almost five oclock sounds better than walking assuming they plowed the road a good couple of inches of fresh snow had come down while chris was inside the alley and the wind had picked up chris flinched from it as soon as he stepped outside he had been born and raised in southern california and despite all the time hed spent in the east these harsh winter days still shocked him it wasnt just bad weather it was weather that could kill you walk the wrong way get lost die of hypothermia before dawn its bad this year charlie admitted people say its the shrinking ice cap all that cold water flowing into the pacific we get these supercharged canadian fronts rolling through you get used to it after a while maybe so chris thought the way you get used to living under siege charlie grogans car was parked in the roofed lot plugged into a charge socket chris slipped into the passenger seat gratefully it was a bachelors car the backseat was full of old qces journals and dog toys as soon as charlie pulled out of the parking compound the tires slipped on compressed snow and the car fishtailed before it finally gripped the asphalt harsh sulfurdot light columns marked the way to the main road sentinals cloaked in vortices of falling snow it could end at any time chris said kind of like the quarantine it could end but it doesnt have you turned off that little recorder yet yes you mean is this for the record no its conversation coming from a journalist i dont work for the tabloids honest im just mumbling we can go on talking about the weather if you like no insult intended none taken you got a little burned on that galliano thing right now whos pushing but he felt he owed this man an honest response i dont know if you can say that or not i guess if you say unflattering things about a national hero youre taking a certain risk i didnt set out to tarnish his reputation much of it is deserved ted galliano had made national news twenty years ago by patenting a new family of broadspectrum antiviral drugs he had also made a fortune founding a nextgeneration pharmaceutical trust to exploit those patents galliano was the prototype of the twentyfirst century scientistentrepreneur like edison or marconi in the nineteenth also products of the commercial environment of their day also brilliant like edison or marconi he had become a public hero he had attracted the best genomic and proteinomic people to him a child born today in the continental commonwealth could expect a lifetime of one hundred years or more and no small part of that was due to gallianos antiviral and antigeriatric drugs what chris had discovered was that galliano was a ruthless and sometimes unscrupulous businessman as edison had been he had lobbied washington for extended patent protection he had driven competitors out of the market or absorbed them through dubious mergers and leverage schemes worse chris had uncovered several sources who were convinced galliano had engaged in blatantly illegal stock manipulation his last big commercial effort had been a genomic vaccine against artheriosclerotic plaque never perfected but much discussed and the prospect of it however inflated had driven galtech stocks to dizzying heights ultimately the bubble had burst but not before galliano and friends cashed out could you prove any of this ultimately no anyhow i didnt think of it as a muckraking biography he was a brilliant scientist when the book came out it got a good initial reaction some of it just schadenfreude rich people have enemies but some of it balanced then galliano had his accident or committed suicide depending on who you listen to and his family made an issue of the book yellow journalism drives benefactor to his death that makes a nice story too you were in court right i testified at a congressional inquiry thought i read something about that they threatened to jail me for contempt for not revealing my sources which wouldnt have helped anyway my sources were all wellknown public figures and by the time of the inquiry they had all issued statements siding with gallianos estate by that time in the public mind galliano was a dead saint nobody wants to conduct an autopsy on a dead saint bad luck charlie said or bad timing chris watched the curtains of snow beyond the passengerside window snow trapped on the cars exposed surfaces snow piling up behind the mirrors or bad judgment i took a tilt at one of the biggest windmills on the planet i was naive about how things worked uhhuh charlie drove in silence for a while you got a good one this time though the story of the blind lake quarantine told from the inside out assuming any of us ever get to tell it you want me to drop you in front of the community center if its not too far out of your way im in no hurry though boomers probably getting hungry i thought they were getting all you stray daytimers billeted with locals im on the waiting list actually ive got a meeting tomorrow whod they set you up with a dr hauser marguerite hauser charlie smiled inscrutably they must be putting all the pariahs in one place pariahs nah forget it i shouldnt talk about plaza politics hey chris you know the nice thing about boomer my hound whats that he doesnt have a clue about the quarantine he doesnt know and he doesnt care as long as he gets fed on a regular schedule lucky boomer chris thought eleven tess woke at seven her usual weekday morning time but she knew even before she opened her eyes that there wouldnt be school today it had snowed all day yesterday and it had been snowing when she went to bed and now this morning even without pulling back the lacy blinds that covered her bedroom window she could hear the snow she heard it sifting against the glass a sound as gentle and faint as mouse whispers and she heard the silence that surrounded it no shovels scraping driveways no cars grinding their wheels just a blanketing white nothing which meant a big snow she heard her mother bustling in the kitchen downstairs humming to herself no urgency there either if tess went back to sleep her mother would probably let her stay in bed it was like a weekend morning tess thought no jolting awake but letting the world seep in slowly slowly willfully she opened her eyes the daylight in her room was dim and almost liquid she sat up yawned adjusted her nightgown the carpet was cold against her bare feet she scooted down the bed closer to the window and drew back the curtain the windowpane was all white opaque with whiteness snow had mounded impressively on the outside sill and inside moisture had condensed into traceries of frost tess immediately put out her hand not to touch the icy window but to hover her palm above it and feel the chill against her skin it was almost as if the window were breathing coolness into the room she was careful not to disturb the delicate lines of ice the twodimensional snowflake patterns like maps of elfin cities the ice was on the inside of the window not the outside winter had put its hand right through the glass tess thought winter had reached inside her bedroom she stared at the frost patterns for a long time they were like written words that wouldnt reveal their meanings in class last week mr fleischer had talked about symmetry he had talked about mirrors and snowflakes he had showed the class how to fold a piece of paper and cut patterns into the fold with safety scissors and when you opened the paper up the random slashes became beautiful became enigmatic masks and butterflies you could do the same thing with paint blot the paper then fold it down the middle while the paint was still wet unfold it and the blots would be eyes or moths or arches or rainbow rays the frost patterns on the window were more like snowflakes as if you had folded the paper not once but two times three times four but no one had folded the glass how did the ice know what shapes to make did the ice have mirrors built into it tess her mother at the door tess its after nine theres no school today but dont you want to get up after nine tess looked at her bedside clock to confirm it nine oh eight but hadnt it been seven oclock just moments ago she reached out impulsively and put a melting palm print on the window im coming her hand was instantly cold cereal for breakfast cornflakes she almost said snowflakes at breakfast tessas mother reminded her that there was a boarder coming by today assuming they clear the roads by noon this interested tess immensely tessas mother was working from home today which made it even more like a weekend except for the possibility of this new person coming to the house her mother had explained that some of the day workers and visitors were still sleeping in the community center gym which wasnt very comfortable and that people with room to spare in their homes had been asked to volunteer it tessas mother had moved her exercise equipment a treadmill and a stationary bike out of the small carpeted room in the basement next to the water heater there was a folding bed in there now tess wondered what it would be like to have a stranger in the basement a stranger sharing meals after breakfast tessas mother went upstairs to work in her office come and get me if you need me she said but in fact tess had seen less of her mother than usual the last few days something was happening with her work something about the subject the subject was behaving strangely some people thought the subject might be sick these concerns had absorbed her mothers attention tess still in her nightgown read for a while in the living room the book was called out of the starry sky it was a childrens book about stars how they first formed how old stars made new stars how planets and people condensed out of the dust of them when her eyes got tired she put down the book and watched snow pile up against the plateglass sliding door noon inched by and the sky was still dark and obscure she could have fixed herself a sandwich for lunch but she decided she wasnt hungry she went upstairs and dressed herself and knocked at her mothers door to tell her she was going outside for a while your shirts buttoned crooked her mother said and came into the hallway to fuss it into place she ruffled tessas hair dont go too far from the house i wont and shake off your boots before you come back in yes snow pants not just the jacket tess nodded she was excited about going out even though it meant struggling into her snowsuit in the warm sweaty hallway the snow was so deep so prodigious that she felt the need to see and feel it up close overnight tess thought the world beyond the door had become a different and much stranger place she finished lacing her boots and stepped out the air itself wasnt as cold as she had expected it felt good when she drew it deep into her lungs and let it out again in smoky puffs but the falling snow was small and hard this afternoon not gentle at all it bit against the skin of her face rows of town houses stretched off to the right and left of her next door mrs colangelo was shoveling her driveway tess pretended not to see her worried that mrs colangelo would ask her to help but mrs colangelo paid no attention to tess and seemed lost in her work redfaced and squintyeyed as if the snow were her own personal enemy white clouds leapt from the shovel blade and dispersed in the wind the undisturbed snow on the front lawn came up almost to tessas shoulders im small she thought her head rose above the mounded dunes only a few feet making her feel no taller than a dog a dogseye view she restrained an urge to leap and bury herself in whiteness she knew the snow would get down the collar of her jacket and she would have to go back inside that much sooner instead she walked in big labored moonsteps to the sidewalk the main road had been plowed though fresh snow had already deposited a thin new blanket over the asphalt the plows had pushed up windrows too tall to see over the tree in the front yard was so freighted with snow that its limbs had drooped into cathedral arches tess pushed her way underneath and was delighted to find herself in a sort of perforated cavern of snow it would have been a perfect hideout except for the cold air that wormed its way under her snowsuit and made her shiver she was under the tree when she saw a man walking up the street the sidewalks were impassable toward the house tess guessed at once that this was the boarder he wasnt dressed very warmly he paused to check the snowencrusted semilegible numbers of the town houses he walked until he was in front of tessas house then he took his hands out of his pockets wallowed through the windrows and made his way to the door tess shrank back in the tree shadow so he wouldnt notice her by the time he rang the bell there was snow up past the knees of his denim pants tessas mother answered the door she shook hands with the stranger the man brushed off the snow and went inside tessas mother lingered on the doorstep a moment tracing out tessas footprints then she spotted tess under the tree and aimed her finger at her pistolstyle gotcha cowgirl tessas mother always said at times like this this time she mouthed the words tess stayed under the sheltering tree for a while she watched mrs colangelo finish shoveling her driveway she watched a couple of cars come down the street at a careful tentative speed she decided she liked snowy winter days every surface even the big front window of the house was opaque and textured not at all reflective and in this dearth of mirror surfaces she was not afraid of suddenly seeing mirror girl mirror girl often posed as a reflection of tess tess caught unawares would find mirror girl gazing back at her from the bathroom or bedroom mirror indistinguishable from tessas own reflection except in the eyes which were questioning and urgent and intrusive mirror girl asked questions no one else could hear idiotic questions sometimes sometimes adult questions tess couldnt answer sometimes questions which left her feeling troubled and uneasy just yesterday mirror girl had asked her why the plants inside the house were green and alive while the ones outside were all brown and leafless because its winter tess had said exasperated go away i dont believe in you thinking about mirror girl made tess uneasy she began to make her way back to the house the front lawn was still full of unspoiled white expanses of snow tess paused and pulled off her gloves her hands were already cold but since she was going inside it didnt matter she pushed both hands into the paperwhite unbroken snow the snow took the imprints impeccably mirror images of her hands symmetrical tess thought when she got to the door she heard voices from inside raised voices her mothers angry voice tess eased inside she shut the door gently behind her her boots dropped clots of icy snow on the carpet runner her woolen cap was suddenly itchy and uncomfortable she pulled it off and dropped it on the floor her mother and the boarder were in the kitchen invisible tess listened carefully the boarder was saying look if its a problem for you it creates a problem for me tessas mother sounded both outraged and defensive fucking ray ray im sorry whos ray my ex what does he have to do with this ray scutter the name is familiar obviously but you think it was ari weingart who sent you here he gave me your name and address ari means well but hes rays puppet oh fuck excuse me no i know you dont understand whats going on you could explain the boarder said tess understood that her mother was talking about her father usually when that happened tess didnt pay attention like when they used to fight she put it out of her mind but this was interesting this involved the boarder who had taken on a new and intriguing status simply by being the object of her mothers anger its not you tessas mother said i mean look im sorry i dont know you from adam its just that your name gets thrown around a lot maybe i should leave because of your book thats why ray sent you here i dont have a lot of credibility in blind lake right now mr carmody and ray is doing his best to undermine what support i do have if word gets around that youre rooming here it just confirms a lot of misperceptions putting all the pariahs in one place kind of well this is awkward you understand im not mad at you its just tess imagined her mother waving her hands in her wellwhatcanido gesture dr hauser please call me marguerite marguerite all im really looking for are accommodations ill talk to ari and see if he can set up something else there was the kind of long pause tess also associated with her mothers periodic unhappiness then she asked youre still sleeping in the gym yes uhhuh well sit down at least get warm im making coffee if you like the boarder hesitated if it isnt too much trouble kitchen chairs scraped across the floor quietly tess stepped out of her boots and hung her snowsuit in the closet do you have a lot of luggage tessas mother asked i travel pretty light im sorry if i sounded hostile im used to it i didnt read your book but you hear things you hear a lot of things youre head of observation and interpretation right the interdepartmental committee so what does ray have against you long story sometimes things arent what they look like at first im not judging you mr carmody really and im not here to put you in a difficult position there was another silence spoons clicking in cups then tessas mother said its a basement room nothing fancy better than the gym though i guess maybe you can stay there while ari makes other arrangements is that a real offer or a pity offer tessas mother no longer angry gave a little laugh a guilt offer maybe but sincere another silence then i accept the stranger said thank you tess went into the kitchen to be introduced secretly she was excited a boarder and one who had written a book it was more than she had hoped for tess shook hands with the boarder a very tall man who had curly dark hair and was gravely courteous the boarder stayed drinking coffee and chatting with tessas mother until almost sunset when he left to get his things i guess we have company at least for a little while tessas mother told her i dont think mr carmody will bother us much he might not be here for too long anyway tess said that was all right she played in her room until dinner dinner was spaghetti with canned tomato sauce the black truck delivered food every week and the food was distributed according to ration points through the supermarket where people used to shop before the quarantine that meant you couldnt pick and choose your favorites everybody got the same weekly allotment of fruits and vegetables and canned and frozen food but tess didnt mind spaghetti and there was buttered bread and cheese to go with it and pears for dessert after dinner tessas father called since the quarantine it was impossible to phone or email outside the fence but there was still basic communication through blind lakes central server tess took the call on her own phone a pink plastic mattel phone without a screen or much memory her fathers voice over the toy phone sounded small and far away the first thing he said was are you all right he asked the same thing every time he called tess answered as she always did yes are you sure tessa yes what did you do today played she said in the snow yes were you careful yes tess said though she wasnt sure what she was supposed to be careful about i hear you had a visitor today the boarder tess said she wondered how her father had heard about it so quickly thats right how do you feel about having a visitor its okay i dont know is your mother looking after you all right another familiar question yes i hope so you know if theres ever a problem over there you just have to call me i can come pick you up i know anyway next week youre back home again with me can you wait another week yes tess said be a good girl till then i will call me if theres any problem with your mother i will love you tessa i know tess put the pink phone back in her pocket the boarder came back that evening with a duffel bag he said hed already had dinner he went to the basement to do some work tess went to her room the embroidery of ice had melted from the windowpane during the day but had reformed after sunset new and different symmetries growing like a private garden tess imagined crystal roads and crystal houses and crystalline creatures inhabiting them ice cities ice worlds outside the snow had stopped falling and the temperature had dropped the sky was very clear and when she rubbed away the ice tess could see a great many winter stars beyond the snowbent tree limbs and the towers of hubble plaza twelve chris met elaine for dinner at the sawyers restaurant in the mallway despite the rationing ari weingart had lobbied to keep the local restaurants open as meeting places and for the sake of the towns morale hot meals strictly at lunch just sandwiches after pm no alcoholic drinks no seconds but no bill either since no one was getting paid it would have been futile to try to keep the local economy running on a cash basis staff had been told their wages would be totalled and paid at the end of the quarantine and customers with pocket change were encouraged to tip whatever they deemed appropriate this evening chris and elaine were the only customers yesterdays snowfall was keeping people at home the single waitress who had shown up was a teenage parttimer laurel brank who spent most of her time in the far corner of the room reading bleak house from a pocket display and picking at a bowl of fritos heard you got billetted elaine said a cold front had followed the storm the air was clear and bitter and the wind had picked up rearranging yesterdays snowfall and rattling the restaurant windows im in the middle of something i dont entirely understand weingart signed me up with a woman named marguerite hauser who lives with her daughter in the housing west of town i know the name shes a recent arrival from crossbank heads up observation and interpretation elaine had been interviewing all the important blind lake committee people the kind of interviews chris tended not to get given his reputation i havent talked to her directly but she doesnt seem to have many friends enemies not enemies exactly shes just a newbie still kind of an outsider the big deal with her is her exhusband right ray scutter i gather it was an acrimonious divorce scutters been talking her down he doesnt think shes qualified to head a committee you think hes right i wouldnt know but her career records impeccable she was never a big hitter like ray and she doesnt have the same academic credentials but she hasnt been as spectacularly wrong as rays been either you know the debate over cultural inteligibility some people think well eventually understand the lobsters some dont if the lobsters were looking at us how much of what we do could they figure out pessimists say nothing or very little they might work out our system of economic exchange and some of our biology and technology but how could they possibly interpret picasso or christianity or the boer war or the brothers karamazov or even the emotional content of a smile we aim all our signalling at each other and our signals are predicated on all kinds of human idiosyncracies from our external physiology down to our brain structure thats why the research people talk about the lobsters in weird behavioral categories foodsharing economic exchanges symbolmaking its like a nineteenthcentury european trying to work out kwakiutl kinship systems without learning the language or being able to communicate except that the european shares fundamental needs and urges with the indian and we share nothing at all with the lobsters so its futile to try a pessimist would say yes would say lets collect and collate our information and learn from it but forget the idea of ultimate comprehension ray scutter is one of those guys in a lecture he once called the idea of exocultural understanding a romantic delusion comparable to the victorian fad for tablerapping and spirit chambers sees himself as a hardcore materialist not everybody in blind lake takes that point of view chris said obviously not theres another school of thought of which rays ex happens to be a charter member optimists you could say they argue that while the lobsters have unique physiological constraints on their behavior those are observable and can be understood and culture is simply learned behavior modified by physiology and environment learnable hence comprehensible they think if we know enough about the daily life of the lobsters understanding will inevitably follow they say all living things share certain common goals like the need to reproduce the need to feed and excrete and so forth and thats enough commonality to make the lobsters more like distant cousins than ultimate aliens interesting what do you think what do i think elaine seemed startled by the question im an agnostic she canted her head lets say its lets say some et is examining the earth and lets suppose he happens to drop in on an extermination camp in poland hes watching nazis extract the gold from the teeth of dead jews and hes asking himself is this economic behavior or is it part of the food chain or what hes trying to make sense of it but he never will never because some things just dont make sense some things make no fucking sense at all this is whats between ray and marguerite this philosophical debate its far from just philosophical at least as far as blind lake politics go careers are made and broken the big thing about uma was the discovery of a living sentient culture and thats where most of the time and attention gets lavished but if lobster culture is static and ultimately incomprehensible maybe thats wrong there are planetologists whod rather be studying the geology and the climate there are even exozoologists whod like to get a closer look at some of the other local fauna were ignoring a lot in order to stare at these bugs the five other planets in the system for instance none of them is habitable but theyre all novel astronomers and cosmologists have been demanding diversification for years youre saying marguerites in a minority no the plurality of opinion has been on the side of studying lobsterville at least so far but support isnt nearly as strong as it used to be what ray scutters been doing is trying to swing support for diversification he doesnt like being locked onto a single subject which has been marguerites pet policy all thats beside the point isnt it since the siege i mean it just takes a different form some people are starting to argue for shutting down the eye altogether you shut it down theres no guarantee itll ever function again even ray must know that so far these are just whispers but the logic is were under siege because of the eye because of what somebody is afraid well see shut down the eye and the problem disappears if the people outside wanted us shut down they could turn off the power supply a word to minnesota edison is all it would take maybe theyre willing to keep us up and running just to see what happens we dont know the logic of it the argument goes maybe were guinea pigs maybe we should pull the plug on the eye and see if that makes them open the cage it would be an incredible loss to science but the day workers and the civil staff dont necessarily care about that they just want to see their kids or their dying parents or their fiancées even among the research staff people are starting to talk about options including ray ray keeps his opinions to himself but he was a late convert to the cause of astrobiology ray used to believe in an uninhabited sterile universe he jumped on the bandwagon when it made career sense but i suspect some part of him still dislikes all this messy organic stuff according to my sources he hasnt breathed a word of support for switching off the eye but he hasnt said anything against it either hes a consummate politician hes probably waiting to see which way the wind blows wind rattled the window elaine smiled from the north chris said briskly id better get back which reminds me i got you something she reached into the bag at her feet i raided the community center lostandfound she pulled out a brown knit scarf chris accepted it gratefully to keep the wind out of your collar elaine said i hear you trekked out to the alley and talked to charlie grogan yes so youre working again after a fashion good youre too talented to hang it up elaine no dont worry im finished stay warm chris he tipped for both of them and stepped out into the night marguerite hadnt given him a key he rang the bell at the door of the town house after his walk from sawyers he appreciated the scarf elaine had given him but the wind was almost surgical knifing from a dozen angles stars rippled in the brutally clear night sky he had to ring twice and it wasnt marguerite who finally answered it was tessa the girl looked up at him solemnly he said can i come in i guess so she held the inner door ajar he shut it hastily behind him his fingers burned in the warm air he stripped off his jacket his snowencrusted shoes too bad elaine hadnt scavenged a pair of boots for him too your moms not home shes upstairs tess said working the girl was cute but uncommunicative a little chubby and owleyed she reminded chris of his younger sister portia except that portia had been a nonstop talker she watched closely as chris hung his jacket in the closet its cold out she said that it is you should get warmer clothes good idea you think it would be all right with your mom if i made coffee tess shrugged and followed chris to the kitchen he counted teaspoons into the filter basket then sat at the small table while the coffee brewed warmth seeping back into his extremities tess pulled up a chair opposite him did they open the school today chris asked only in the afternoon the girl put her elbows on the table hands under her chin are you a writer yes chris said probably maybe did you write a book the question was guileless mostly i write for magazines but i wrote a book once can i see it i didnt bring a copy with me tess was clearly disappointed she rocked in the chair and nodded her head rhythmically chris said maybe you should tell your mom im here she doesnt like to be bothered when shes working does she always work this late no maybe i should say hello she doesnt like to be bothered tess repeated ill just tap at the door see if she wants coffee tess shrugged and stayed in the kitchen marguerite had given him a tour of the house yesterday the door to her home office was ajar and chris cleared his throat to announce himself marguerite sat at a cluttered desk she was scribbling notes on a handpad but her attention was focused on the screen on the far wall didnt hear you come in she said without looking up sorry to interrupt your work im not working not officially anyhow im just trying to figure out whats going on she turned to face him take a look on the screen the socalled subject was climbing an upwardsloping ramp by the light of a few tungsten bulbs the virtual viewpoint floated behind him keeping his upper halftorso centered from behind chris thought the subject looked like a wrestler in a red leather burka wheres he going i have no idea i thought he had pretty regular habits were not supposed to use gendered pronouns but just between us yes hes a creature of very regular habits by his clock he ought to be sleeping if sleeping is what theyre doing when they lie motionless in the dark this was the kind of carefully hedged clinical talk chris had come to expect from blind lake staff weve been following him for more than a year marguerite said and he hasnt varied from his schedule by more than a few minutes until lately a few days ago he spent two hours in a food conclave that should have lasted half that time his diet has changed his social interactions are declining and tonight he seems to have a case of insomnia sit down and watch if youre interested mr carmody chris he said he cleared a stack of astrobiological review off a chair marguerite went to the door and shouted tess from below yeah time for your bath footsteps pattered up the stairs i dont think i need a bath you do though can you run it yourself im still kind of busy i guess so call me when its ready moments later the distant rush of running water chris watched the subject climb another spiral walkway the subject was entirely alone which was unusual in itself the aboriginals tended to do things in crowds though they never shared sleeping chambers these guys are pretty regularly diurnal too marguerite said another anomaly as for where hes going hey look subject reached an open archway and stepped out into the starry alien night hes never been here before here where a balcony platform way up on top of his home tower my god the view subject walked to the low barricade at the edge of the balcony the virtual viewpoint drifted behind him and chris could see the lobster city spread out beyond the subjects grainy torso the elongated pyramidal towers were illuminated at their portals and balconies by lights in the public walkways anthills and cowrie shells chris thought threaded with gold when chris was little his parents used to cruise up along mulholland drive one or two evenings a year to see the lights of los angeles spread out below it had looked kind of like this almost this vast almost this lonely the planets small quick moon was full and he could make out something of the dry lands beyond the limits of the city the low mountains far to the west and a reef of high cloud rolling on a quick wind spirals of electrostatically charged dust rolled across the irrigated fields quickly formed and quickly dissipated like immense ghosts he saw marguerite give a little shiver watching subject approached the balconys eroded barricade he stood as if hesitating chris said is he suicidal i hope not she was tense weve never seen selfdestructive behavior but were new here god i hope not but the subject stood motionless as if intent hes looking at the view chris said could be what else we dont know thats why we dont attribute motivation if i were there id be looking at the view but maybe hes enjoying the air pressure or maybe he was hoping to meet somebody or maybe hes lost or confused these are complex sentient creatures with life histories and biological imperatives no one even pretends to understand we dont even know for sure how good their vision is he may not see what were seeing still chris said if i had to lay a bet id say hes admiring the view that won him a brief smile we may think such things marguerite admitted but we must not say them mom from the bathroom ill be there in a second dry yourself off she stood time to put tess to bed im afraid you mind if i watch this a little longer i guess not call me if it gets exciting all this is being recorded of course but theres nothing like a live feed but he may not do anything at all when they stand still they often stay that way for hours at a time not a great party planet chris said it would be nice if we could take advantage of his static time and look around the city but training the eye to follow a single individual was a minor miracle in itself if we looked away we might lose him just dont expect much she was right about the subject he stood absolutely motionless before the long vista of the night chris watched distant dustdevils immense and immaterial ride the moonlit plains he wondered if they made a sound in the relatively thin atmosphere of that world he wondered if the air was warm or cool whether the subject was sensitive to the temperature all this anomalous behavior and no way to divine the thoughts circulating in that perfectly imaged but perfectly inscrutable head what did loneliness mean to creatures who were never alone except at night he heard the pleasant sound of marguerite and tessa talking in low voices marguerite tucking her daughter into bed a flurry of laughter eventually marguerite appeared in the doorway once more has he moved the moon had moved the stars had moved not the subject no im making tea if you feel like a cup thanks chris said id like that i but then there was the unmistakable sound of breaking glass followed by tessas high shrill scream chris came into the girls bedroom behind marguerite tess was still shrieking a high sustained sob she sat at the edge of her bed her right hand pressed into the waist of her flannel nightgown there were spatters of blood on the bedspread the bottom pane of the bedroom window was broken shards of glass stood jagged in the frame and bitterly cold air gusted inside marguerite knelt on the bed lifting tessa away from the litter of glass show me your hand she said no yes itll be all right show me tess turned her head away squeezed her eyes shut and extended her clenched fist blood seeped between her fingers and ran down her knuckles her nightgown was stained with fresh red blood marguerites eyes went wide but she resolutely peeled back tessas fingers from the wound tess what happened tess sucked in enough breath to answer i leaned on the window you leaned on it yes chris understood that this was a lie and that marguerite acquiesced to it as if they both understood what had really happened which was more than he understood he balled up a blanket and stuffed it into the gap in the window more blood welled from the exposed palm of tessas right hand a small lake of it this time marguerite couldnt conceal a gasp chris said is there glass in the wound i cant tell no i dont think so we need to put pressure on it shell need to be stitched too tess wailed in fresh alarm its okay chris told her this happened to my little sister once she fell down with a glass in her hand and cut herself up worse than you did she bragged about it later said she was the only one who wasnt scared the doctor fixed it up for her how old was she thirteen im eleven tess said gauging her courage against this new standard theres gauze in the bathroom cupboard marguerite said will you get it chris he fetched the gauze and a brown elastic bandage marguerites hands were shaking so chris pressed the gauze into tessas palm and told her to clench her fist over it the gauze immediately turned bright red we have to drive her to the clinic he said why dont you give me your keys ill start the car while you bundle her up all right keys are in my purse in the kitchen tess can you walk with me watch out for the glass on the floor she left blood spots on the carpet all the way down the stairs the blind lake medical center a suite of offices just east of hubble plaza kept its walkin clinic open at all hours the nurse on desk duty looked briefly at tess then hustled her and marguerite off to a treatment room chris sat in reception leafing through sixmonthold print editions of travel magazines while gentle pop songs whispered from the ceiling from what he had seen tessas injury was minor and the clinic was equipped to handle it better not to think what might have happened if she had been more seriously hurt the clinic was wellequipped but it wasnt a hospital she had leaned on the window but you dont break a window like that by leaning on it tess had lied and marguerite had recognized the lie for what it was something she hadnt wanted to talk about in front of a stranger some ongoing problem with her daughter chris supposed anger depression postdivorce trauma but the girl hadnt seemed angry or depressed when he spoke to her in the kitchen and he remembered the sound of her easy laughter from the bedroom just moments before the accident its none of my business he told himself tess reminded him a little of his sister portia there was some of the same guileless amiability about her but that didnt make it any concern of his he had given up comforting the afflicted and afflicting the comfortable he wasnt good at it all his crusades had ended badly marguerite came out of the treatment room shaken and spotted with her daughters blood but obviously reassured theyve got her cleaned up and sutured she told chris she was actually very brave once we saw the doctor that story about your sister helped i think im glad thank you for your help i could have driven her myself but it would have been much trickier scarier for tess too youre welcome they gave her a painkiller the doctor said we can go home when it takes effect shell have to keep the hand immobilized for a few days though have you called her father marguerite was instantly downcast no but i guess i ought to i just hope he doesnt go ballistic ray is she stopped you dont want to know my problems frankly no he didnt she said excuse me and took her phone to a distant corner of the waiting room despite his best intentions chris overheard a little of the conversation the way she talked to her exhusband was instructive carefully casual at first explaining the accident gently understating it then cringing from his response at the clinic she said finally i a pause no no pause it isnt necessary ray no youre blowing this way out of proportion long pause that isnt true you know that isnt true she clipped off without saying goodbye and took a moment to steady herself then she came across the waiting room between the rows of generic hospital furniture her lips compressed her hair askew her clothing bloodstained there was a stiff dignity in the way she carried herself an implicit rejection of whatever it was ray scutter had said to her im sorry she said but would you please go out and start the car ill fetch tess i think shell be better off at home another polite lie but with an unspoken urgency under it he nodded the walkway between the clinic and the parking lot was cold and windswept he was glad enough to climb inside marguerites little car and start the motor heat wafted up from the floor ducts the street was empty swept with sinuous lines of blowing snow he looked at the lights of the plaza the shopping concourse the stars were still bright and on the southern horizon he could see the running lights of a distant jet somewhere planes were still flying somewhere the world was still conducting its business marguerite came out of the clinic with tess some ten minutes later but she had not reached the car when another vehicle roared into the lot and screeched to a stop ray scutters car marguerite watched with obvious apprehension as her exhusband left the vehicle and came toward her with a rapid aggressive stride chris made sure the passenger door was unlocked better to avoid a confrontation ray had that madbull look about him but marguerite didnt make it to the car before ray got a hand on her shoulder marguerite kept her eyes on her exhusband but pushed tess behind her protecting her tess cradled her injured hand under her snow jacket chris couldnt make out what ray was saying all he could hear over the whine of the motor was a few barked consonants time to be brave he hated being brave that was what people used to say about his book at least before gallianos suicide how brave of you to write it bravery had never gotten him anywhere he stepped out of the car and opened the rear door for tess to climb in ray gave him a startled look who the fuck are you chris carmody he helped drive tess here marguerite said hurriedly right now she needs to get back home chris said tess had already scooted into the backseat quick despite the clumsiness of her bandaged hand clearly scutter said his eyes narrow and fixed on chris shes not safe there ray marguerite said we have an agreement we have an agreement written before the siege by a divorce counselor i cant contact ray had mastered the vocal tones of bullmale impatience equal parts whining and imperious theres no way i can trust you with my daughter when you permit things like this to happen it was an accident accidents happen accidents happen when children arent supervised what were you doing staring at the fucking subject marguerite stumbled over an answer chris said it happened after tess went to bed he motioned discreetly for marguerite to get into the car youre that tabloid journalist what do you know about it i was there marguerite took the hint and climbed in ray looked frustrated and doubly angry when he heard the door slam im taking my daughter with me he said no sir chris said not tonight im afraid he maintained eye contact with ray as he slid behind the wheel tess began quietly crying in the backseat ray leaned against the car door but whatever he was shouting was inaudible chris put the vehicle in drive and pulled away not before scutter aimed a kick at the rear bumper marguerite soothed her daughter chris drove cautiously out of the clinic lot wary of ice ray could have jumped in his own car and followed but apparently chose not to last he saw of him in the rearview mirror he was still standing in impotent rage he hates for anyone to see him like that marguerite said im sorry im afraid you made an enemy tonight no doubt chris understood the alchemy by which a man might be charming in public and brutal behind closed doors cruelty as the intimacy of last resort men generally didnt like to be witnessed in the act she added i have to thank you again im truly sorry about all this not your fault if you want to find a new place to room i understand the basements still warmer than the gym if thats okay with you tess snorted and coughed marguerite helped her blow her nose i keep thinking marguerite said what if it had been worse what if wed needed a real hospital im so tired of this lockdown chris pulled into the driveway of the town house i expect well survive he said clearly marguerite was a survivor tess exhausted went to sleep on marguerites bed the house was cold icy air rivering in through the broken window in tessas room the furnace struggling to keep up chris rummaged in the basement until he found a heavy plastic drop cloth and a wide piece of maplewood veneer he ducttaped the plastic over the empty window frame in tessas bedroom then tacked up the veneer for good measure marguerite was in the kitchen when he went downstairs nightcap she said sure she poured him fresh coffee laced with brandy chris checked his watch after midnight he didnt feel remotely like sleeping i guess youre tired of hearing me apologize i grew up with a younger sister chris said things happen with kids i know that your sister you mentioned portia we all call her porry do you still see her before the siege i mean porry died a while back oh im sorry now you do have to stop apologizing im oh how much trouble do you expect ray to make over this she shrugged thats a question and a half as much as he can its none of my business id just like some warning if you expect him to show up at the door with a shotgun its not like that ray is just well what can i say about ray he likes to be right he hates to be contradicted hes eager to pick fights but he hates to lose them and hes been losing them most of his life he doesnt like sharing custody with me he wouldnt have signed the agreement except his lawyer told him it was the best deal he was going to get and hes always threatening some new legal action to take tess away hell see tonight as more evidence that im an unfit parent more ammunition tonight wasnt your fault it doesnt matter to ray what really happened hell convince himself i was either responsible for it or at least grossly negligent how long were you married nine years was he abusive not physically not quite hed shake his fist but he never threw it that wasnt rays style but he made it clear he didnt trust me and he sure as hell didnt approve of me i used to get calls from him every fifteen minutes where was i and what was i doing and when would i be home and id better not be late he didnt like me but he didnt want my attention focused on anyone but him at first i told myself it was just a quirk a character flaw something hed get over you had friends family my parents are charitable people they accommodated ray until it became obvious he didnt want to be accommodated he didnt like me seeing them didnt like me seeing friends either it was supposed to be just the two of us no countervailing forces good marriage to get out of chris said im not sure he believes its over people can get hurt in situations like that i know marguerite said ive heard the stories but ray would never get physical chris let that pass how was tess doing when you said good night she looked pretty sleepy worn out poor thing how do you suppose she happened to break that window marguerite took a long sip of her coffee and seemed to inspect the tabletop i honestly dont know but tess has had some problems in the past she has a thing about shiny surfaces mirrors and things like that she must have seen something she didnt like and put her hand through the glass chris didnt understand but marguerite was obviously uncomfortable talking about it and he didnt want to press her shed been through enough tonight he said i wonder how the subject is doing sleepless in lobsterville i left everything running didnt i she stood up want to have a look he followed her upstairs to her office they tiptoed past the room where tess was sleeping marguerites office was exactly as they had left it lights burning interfaces lit the big wall screen still dutifully following the subject but marguerite gasped when she saw the image it was morning again on subjects patch of umae subject had left the high balcony and made his way to a surfacelevel street last nights winds had given every exposed surface a coating of fine white grit fresh texture under the raking light of the sun subject approached a stone arch five times his height walking into the sunrise chris said wheres he going i dont know marguerite said but unless he turns around hes leaving the city thirteen charlie grogan called sue sampel said as ray passed through the outer office also dajit gill julie sook and two other department heads oh and you have ari weingart at ten and shulgin at eleven plus forward the agenda to my desktop ray said and any urgent messages hold calls he disappeared into his sanctum sanctorum and closed the door bless silence sue thought it beat the sound of ray scutters voice sue had left a cup of hot coffee on his desk a tribute to his punctuality very good ray thought but he was facing a difficult day since the subject had set out on his pilgrimage last week the interpretive committees had been in a state of hysteria even the astrozoologists were divided some of them wanted to keep the focus in lobsterville and tag a new and more representative subject others and marguerite was one of these were convinced the subjects behavior was significant and ought to be followed to its conclusion the technology and artifacts people dreaded losing their urban context but the astrogeologists and climatologists welcomed the prospect of a long detour into the deserts and mountains the committees were squabbling like fishwives and absent blind lakes senior scientists or a line to washington there was no obvious way to resolve the conflict ultimately these people would look to ray for guidance but he didnt want to assume that responsibility without a great deal of consultation whatever decision he made sooner or later hed be forced to defend it he wanted that defense to be airtight he needed to be able to cite names and documents and if some of the more hotheaded committee partisans thought he was dodging the issue and he had heard those words bandied about too bad he had asked them all to prepare position papers best to start the day in a positive mood ray unfolded a paper napkin and used his key to open the bottom drawer of the desk since the lockdown began ray had been keeping a stash of dingdongs locked in his desk drawer it was embarrassing to acknowledge but he happened to like baked goods and he especially liked dingdongs with his breakfast coffee and he could live without the inevitable smartass commentary about polysorbate and empty calories thank you very much he liked peeling back the brittle wrapper he liked the sugarandcornstarch smell that came wafting out he liked the glutinous texture of the pastry and the way hot coffee flensed the slightly chemical aftertaste from his palate but dingdongs werent included in the weekly black truck deliveries ray had been canny enough to buy up the remaining inventory from the local grocer and the convenience shop in the plaza lobby he had started with a couple of cartons but theyd be gone before long the last six dingdongs in the entire quarantined community of blind lake as far as ray could determine were currently residing in his desk drawer after that nothing cold turkey obviously it wouldnt kill him to do without but he resented being forced into it by this ongoing bureaucratic fuckup this endless mute lockdown he pulled a dingdong out of the drawer take one away that left five a businessweeksworth but all he could see were four packages lingering in the shadows four he counted again four he searched the drawer with his hand four there should have been five had he miscalculated impossible he had recorded the count in his nightly journal he sat immobile for a moment processing this unwelcome information working up a solid righteous anger then he buzzed sue sampel and asked her to step inside sue he said when she appeared in the doorway do you happen to have a key to my desk to your desk she was either surprised by the question or faking it very plausibly no i dont because when i came here the support people told me id have the only key did you lose it they must have a master somewhere or they can replace the locks i guess no i didnt lose it she flinched from his voice i have the key right here somethings been stolen stolen what was stolen it doesnt matter what was stolen as it happens it was nothing very important what matters is that somebody gained access to my desk without my knowledge surely even you can grasp the significance of that she glanced at the desktop ray realized too late that he had left this mornings dingdong lying unopened next to his coffee cup she looked at it then at ray with a youmustbekidding expression on her face he felt blood rush to his cheeks maybe you could talk to the cleaning staff sue said now all he wanted was for her to disappear well all right i suppose it doesnt matter i shouldnt have mentioned it or security you have shulgin coming in later was she concealing a smile was she actually laughing at him thank you he said tightly anything else no get the fuck out please close the door she closed it gently ray imagined he could hear her laughter floating behind her like a bright red ribbon ray considered himself a realist he knew some of his behavior could be labeled misogynistic by anyone who wanted to smear him and his enemies were legion but he didnt hate women quite the opposite he gave them every opportunity to redeem themselves the problem was not that he hated women but that he was so consistently disappointed by them for instance marguerite always marguerite forever marguerite ari weingart came in at ten with a series of moraleenhancing proposals cayti lane from the pr department wanted to put together a local video ring for news and social updates blind lake tv in effect which she would host i think its a good idea ari said caytis bright and photogenic what i also want to do is pool the individual downloads people have residing in their house servers so we can rebroadcast them nochoice scheduled television very twentieth century but it might help hold things together or at least give people something to talk about at the water cooler fine all this was fine ari went on to propose a series of live debates and lectures saturday nights at the community center also fine ari was trying to reconfigure the siege as a church social let him ray thought let him distract the whining inmates with dogandpony shows but all this boosterism was ultimately tiresome and it was a relief when ari finally packed up his grin and left the room ray counted his dingdongs again of course it could have been sue who had broken into his desk there was no sign that the mechanism had been tampered with maybe hed been careless about locking the drawer and she had taken advantage of his lapse of attention sue often worked later than ray especially when tess was in his care unlike marguerite he didnt like leaving his daughter alone in the house after school sue was the prime suspect ray decided though the cleaning staff werent entirely above suspicion men were easier to deal with than women with men it was a matter of barking loud enough to command attention women were slyer ray thought overtly yielding but easily subverted their loyalties were tentative and too quickly revoked marguerite for instance at least tess wouldnt grow up to be one of those kind of women dimi shulgin showed up at eleven crisp in a gray tailored suit a welcome distraction even though he was full of ominous news shulgin had mastered the art of baltic inscrutability his doughy face impassive as he described the mood prevailing among the day workers and salaried staff theyve endured the siege this long shulgin said with minimal problems probably because of what happened to unfortunate mr krafft when he tried to run the fence that was a blessing in disguise i think it frightened people into acceptance but discontent is growing casual and support staff outnumber the scientific and management people by five to one you know many of them are demanding a voice in decisionmaking and not a few of them would like to shut down the eye and see what happens its all talk ray said so far its all talk in the long run if this lockdown continues who knows we should be seen to be doing something positive the appearance of action shulgin said any irony safely buried under his turgid accent would be helpful you know ray said my desk was broken into recently your desk shulgins caterpillar eyebrows rose broken into this was vandalism theft ray waved his hand in what he imagined was a magnanimous gesture it was trivial office vandalism at most but it got me thinking what if we launched an investigation into the vandalism of your desk no for christs sake into the siege an investigation how could we all the evidence is on the other side of the fence not necessarily please explain theres a theory were under lockdown because something happened at crossbank something dangerous something connected with their obecs something that might as easily happen here yes which is why theres a growing movement to switch off our own processors but forget about the obecs for a minute think about crossbank if crossbank had a problem wouldnt we have heard about it shulgin considered he rubbed a finger against his nose possibly possibly not all the senior administrators were in cancun when the gates closed they would have been the first to know yes ray said gently urging the idea to its conclusion but messages might have stacked up on their personal servers before the quarantine went into effect anything urgent would have been forwarded but copies would still reside in the blind lake servers wouldnt they well presumably unless someone took the trouble to erase them but we cant break into the personal servers of senior staff cant we shulgin shrugged i would have thought not in ordinary circumstances the question wouldnt even arise but circumstances are a long way from ordinary crack the servers read their mail yes its interesting and if we find anything useful we should announce the results at a general meeting if there are any results apart from voicemail from wives and mistresses shall i talk to my people find out how difficult it would be to break into our servers yes dimi ray said you do that he liked this better the more he thought about it he went to lunch a happier man rays moods were mercurial however and by the time he left the plaza at the end of the day he was feeling sour again the dingdong thing sue had probably shared the story with her friends in the staff cafeteria every day some fresh humiliation he liked dingdongs for breakfast was that so fucking funny so laughably aberrant people were assholes ray thought he drove carefully through flurries of hard snow trying unsuccessfully to time the stoplights on the main street people were assholes and that was what the exocultural theorists always missed people like marguerite blind little featherweight optimists one world full of assholes wasnt enough for them they wanted more a whole living universe of assholery a shiny pink organic cosmos a magic mirror with a happy face beaming out of it dusk closed around the car like a curtain how much cleaner the world would be ray thought if it contained nothing but gas and dust and the occasional flaring star cold but pristine like the snow enshrouding the few high towers of blind lake the real lesson of lobsterville was the politically incorrect one the unspeakable but obvious fact that sentience socalled was nothing but a focused irrationality a suite of behaviors designed by dna to make more dna empty of any logic but the runaway mathematics of selfreproduction chaos with feedback z z c blindly repeated until the universe had eaten and excreted itself including me ray thought better not to shy from that caustic truth everything he loved his daughter or thought he had loved marguerite represented nothing more than his participation in that equation was no more or less sane than the nocturnal bleeding of the aboriginals of umae marguerite for instance acting out flawed genetic scripts the possessive if unfit mother a walking womb claiming equality under the law how quickly she still came to mind every insolence ray suffered was a mirror of her hatred the garage door rolled open as it sensed the approach of the car he parked under the glare of the overhead light he wondered what it would be like to break free of all these biological imperatives and see the world as it truly was to our eyes horrible ray thought bleak and unforgiving but our eyes are liars equally as enslaved to dna as our hearts and our minds maybe that was what the obecs had become an inhuman eye revealing truths no one was prepared to accept tess had come back to him this week he called hello as he entered the house she sat in the living room in the chair next to the artificial christmas tree hunched over her homework like a studious gnome hi she said listlessly ray stood a moment surprised by his love for her admiring the way her dark hair curled tightly to her skull she wrote on the screen of a lap pad which translated her babyish scrawls into something legible he shed his coat and overshoes and drew the blinds against the snowy dark have you called your birth mother yet it was in the agreement he had signed with marguerite after arbitration that tess would phone the absent parent daily tess looked at him curiously my birth mother had he said that aloud i mean your mother i called already did she say anything disturbing you know you can tell me if your mother causes problems for you tess shrugged uncomfortably was the stranger with her when you called the man who lives in the basement tess shrugged again show me your hand ray said it didnt take a genius to know that tessas problems back at crossbank had been marguerites fault even if the divorce mediator had failed to figure it out marguerite had consistently ignored tess had focused exclusively on her beloved extraterrestrial seascapes that tess had made several desperate bids for attention transparent in their motivation the frightening stranger in the mirror might as well have been marguerites subject oblique demanding and omnipresent glumly head lowered in embarrassment tess held out her right hand the sutures had been removed last week the scars would disappear with time the clinic doctor had said but now they looked ghastly pink new skin between angry divots where the stitches had been ray had already taken a few photographs in case the issue ever arose in court he held her small hand in his making sure there was no sign of infection no small life eating the life from his daughters flesh whats for dinner tess asked chicken ray said leaving her to her books frozen chicken in the freezer subject removed from cold storage the butchered flesh of a grounddwelling bird and began to sear it in a pan of extracted vegetable oil plus garlic and basil salt and pepper the smell of it flooded his mouth with saliva tess drawn by the odor wandered into the kitchen to watch him cook are you worried about going back to your mother tomorrow your birth mother half your genetic bag of tricks the lesser half ray thought no tess said then almost defiantly why do you always keep asking me that do i yes sometimes sometimes isnt always though is it no but i just want everything to be okay for you tess i know defeated she turned away youre happy here arent you its okay here because you never know with mom isnt that right you might have to come live here all the time tess if anything happens to her tess narrowed her eyes what would happen to her you never know ray said fourteen before he left the city subjects life had been a repetitive cycle of work sleep and food conclaves it had reminded marguerite dismayingly of the hindu idea of the kalpas the sacred circle eternal return but that had changed that had changed and the circle had become something different it had become a narrative a story marguerite thought with a beginning and an end that was why it was so important to keep the eye focused on the subject despite what the more cynical people in interpretation thought the subject is no longer representative they said but that was what made this so interesting subject had become an individual something more than the sum of his functions in aboriginal society this was clearly some kind of crisis in subjects life and marguerite couldnt bear the idea of not seeing it through to its conclusion even to the subjects death if it came to that and it might early on she conceived the idea of writing the subjects odyssey not analytically but as what it had become a story not for publication of course shed be violating the protocols of objectivity indulging all kinds of conscious and unconscious anthropocentrism anyway she wasnt a writer or at least not that kind of writer this was purely for her own satisfaction and because she believed the subject deserved it after all this was a real life they had invaded in the privacy of her writing she could give him back his stolen dignity she began the project in a spiralbound blue school notebook tess was asleep she had come back from her fathers two days ago after a disappointing christmas and chris was downstairs messing up the kitchen or raiding her library it was a precious moment hallowed in silence a time when she could practice the black art of empathy when she could freely admit that she cared about the fate of this creature so unknowable and so intimately known subjects last days in the city marguerite wrote were disturbed and episodic he manned his workstation at the usual time but his food conclaves became briefer and more perfunctory he descended the stairs into the food well slowly and in the dim light of the evening conclaves he took less than the customary amount of cultivated crops he spent more time scraping moldlike growths from the damp well walls sucking the residue from his food claws normally this was a time of intense social interaction the wells were crowded but the subject kept his face to the stone wall and his visible signaling motions ciliawaving head gestures were minimal his sleep was disturbed too which in turn seemed to disturb the small creatures that fed on his blood nipples at night the place of these walldwelling animals in subjects culture or ecology is not well understood they might have been parasites but since they were universally tolerated they were more likely symbionts or even a stage in the reproductive cycle perhaps their feeding stimulated desirable immune responses at least that was one theory shortly before his departure however the feeders seemed repelled by the sleeping subject they tasted him skittered away then came back to try again with the same result meanwhile subject was restless and moved several times during the night in an uncharacteristic manner he spent his last night in the city in a sleepless vigil on a high exterior balcony of the communal tower in which he lived it was tempting to read both loneliness and resolve into these behaviors forbidden but tempting marguerite thought subjects life had clearly changed and perhaps not for the better then he left the city it looked like a spontaneous decision he left his warren left his home tower and walked directly through the eastern gate of the aboriginal city into a clear blue morning in the sunlight his thick skin glittered like polished leather subject was a dusky shade of red over most of his body a dark red merging into black at the major body joints and his yellow dorsal crest stood up like a crown of flame as he walked the city was surrounded by an enormous acreage of agricultural land canals and aqueducts carried irrigation water from the snowy mountains in the north to these fields the system lost enormous amounts of moisture to evaporation in the dry thin air but the trickle that remained was enough to nourish mileslong avenues of succulent plants the plants were thickskinned olivegreen and consisted of a few basic and similar types their stems were sturdy the leaves as broad as dinner plates and as thick as pancakes taller than the subject they cast variegated shadows over him as he walked subject followed the dirtpack road a wide avenue lapped with drainage ditches and verdant midsummer crops he displayed no social interaction with either the sapstained laborers in the fields or the foot traffic along the way shortly after he left the city he detoured into a cultivated plot of ground where he was ignored by farm laborers as he pulled several large leaves from a mature plant wrapped them in a broader flatter fan leaf and tucked them into a pouch in his lower abdomen a picnic lunch or provisions for a longer journey for much of the morning he was forced to walk along the lessbusy margin of the road out of the way of traffic according to planetary maps prepared before the obecs focused on a single subject this road ran east into the drylands for almost a hundred kilometers veered north through a line of low mountains foothills of a taller range and east again until after a few hundred kilometers of sparsely vegetated high plains it reached another aboriginal city the asyetunnamed latitude longitude urban cluster was a smaller city than subjects own but an established trading partner big trucks passed in both directions huge platforms equipped with simple but refined and effective motors riding on immense solid rollers rather than wheels this might have been an example of aboriginal efficiency the trucks maintain the pressedearth roads simply by driving on them and there was plenty of foot traffic pairs and triads and larger clusters of waddling individuals but no other solitaries did a unique journey imply a unique destination by midday subject reached the end of the agricultural land the road widened as the walls of succulent plants dropped behind the horizon was flat dead ahead and mountainous to the north the mountains shimmered in waves of rising heat when the sun reached its apex subject stopped for a meal he left the road and walked a few hundred yards to a shady formation of tall basaltic stones where he urinated copiously into the sandy soil then climbed one of the rocky pedestals and stood facing north the atmosphere between subject and the mountains was white with suspended dust and the snowy peaks seemed to hover over the desert basin he might have been resting or he might have been sensing the air or planning the next stage of his journey he was motionless for almost an hour then he walked back to the road and resumed his journey pausing to drink from a roadside ditch he walked at a steady pace through the afternoon by nightfall he had passed the last evidence of cultivation old fields gone fallow irrigation canals filled and obscured with windblown sand and entered the desert basin between the northern mountains and the far southern sea traffic on the road moved in diurnal surges and he had fallen behind the last of the days vehicular traffic he was alone and his pace slowed with the approach of night it was an unusually clear evening a fast small moon slid up from the eastern horizon and subject looked for a place to sleep he scouted for some minutes until he found a sandy depression sheltered in the lee of a rocky outcrop he curled into an almost fetal posture there his ventral surfaces protected from the cooling air his body slowed to its usual nightly catatonia when the moon had crossed threequarters of the sky a number of small insectile creatures emerged from a nest hidden in the sand they were immediately attracted by the subject by his smell perhaps or the rhythm of his breathing they were smaller than the nocturnal symbionts of his native city they carried distinct thoracic bulges and they moved on two extra sets of legs but they fed in the same fashion and without hesitation from the subjects bloodnipples they were still there sated perhaps when subject woke to the first light of morning some of them still clung to his body as he stood up carefully fastidiously subject picked them off and tossed them away the discarded creatures lay motionless but uninjured until the sun warmed their bodies then they burrowed back into the sand pink fantails vanishing with a flourish subject continued to follow the road when she looked at her first entry marguerite was unhappy with what she had written not because it was incorrect though of course it was it was outrageously deliciously incorrect errors of attribution everywhere the social scientists would be appalled but she was tired of objectivity her own project her private project was to put herself in the subjects place how else did human beings understand one another look at it from my point of view people said or if i were in your place it was an imaginative act so commonplace as to be invisible people who couldnt do it or refused to do it were called psychotics or sociopaths but when we look at the aboriginals marguerite thought were supposed to pretend to indifference to an aloofness almost puritanical in its austerity am i tainted if i admit i care whether the subject lives or dies most of her colleagues would say yes marguerite entertained the heretical idea that they might be wrong still the narrative was missing something it was hard to know what to say or especially how to say it who was she writing for herself alone or did she have an audience in mind a couple of weeks had passed since the subject left the city the time when tess had cut her hand so badly if she carried on with this there would be a great deal more to write marguerite was alone in her study bent over her notebook but at the thought of tess she raised her head sampling the night sounds in the town house chris was still awake downstairs chris had made his own space in the house he slept in the basement was gone most of the day took his evening meals at sawyers and used the kitchen and the living room mainly after tessas bedtime his presence was unobtrusive sometimes even comforting there the sound of the refrigerator door closing the rattle of a dish chris always looked distressed when he worked like a man struggling desperately to recapture a lost train of thought but he would often work unceasingly long into the night and he had been a help with tess more than a help chris wasnt one of those adults who condescend to children or try to impress them he seemed comfortable with tess spoke freely to her wasnt offended by her occasional silences or sulks he hadnt made a big deal of tessas problems even tess had seemed a little happier with chris in the house but the accident with her hand had been troubling at first tess would only say that she had leaned too hard on the window but marguerite knew better a window at night in a lighted room was as good as a mirror and it wasnt the first mirror tess had broken she had broken three back at crossbank the therapist had talked about unexpressed rage but tess never described mirror girl as hostile or frightening she broke the mirrors she said because she was tired of mirror girl showing up unannounced i like to see myself when i look in the mirror mirror girl was intrusive often unwelcome frequently annoying but something less than an outright nightmare it was the blood that had made this time seem so much scarier marguerite had asked her about it the day after they came back from the clinic the painkiller had left tess a little sleepy and she spent all that afternoon in bed occasionally glancing at a book but too scattered to read for long marguerite sat at her bedside i thought we were all done with that she said breaking things not accusatory just curious i leaned on the window tess repeated but she must have sensed marguerites skepticism because she sighed and said in a smaller voice she just took me by surprise mirror girl nod has she been back lately no tess said then not very much thats why she took me by surprise have you thought about what dr leinster said back at crossbank mirror girls not real shes like some part of me i dont want to see you think thats right tess shrugged well what do you really think i think if i dont want to see her why does she keep coming back good question marguerite thought does she still look like you exactly like so how do you know its her tess shrugged her eyes what about her eyes too big what does she want tess hoping her daughter didnt hear the edge of anxiety in her voice the catch in her throat something is wrong with my girl my baby i think she just wants me to pay attention to what tess to her no not just to her to everything everything all the time you remember what dr leinster taught you calm down and wait for her to go away does that still work i guess sometimes i forget dr leinster had told marguerite that tessas symptoms were unusual but stopped well short of the kind of systematic delusion that might point to schizophrenia no drastic mood swings no aggressive behavior good orientation to time and place emotional affect a little muted but not off the scale reasonable insight into her problem no obvious neurochemical imbalance all that psychiatric bullshit which boiled down to dr leinsters last banal verdict most likely shell grow out of it but dr leinster hadnt had to wash tessas bloodsoaked pajamas marguerite looked back at her journal her act of illicit storytelling still not up to date there was nothing about the east road ruins for instance but enough for tonight downstairs she found the lights still burning chris was in the kitchen eating rye toast and leafing through last septembers copy of astrogeological review leaning back in one chair and resting his feet on another im just down for a nightcap marguerite said dont mind me orange juice and a dab of vodka which she resorted to when she felt too restless to sleep like tonight she pulled out a third chair from the kitchen table and put her slippered feet up next to chriss long day she asked i had another meeting with charlie grogan out at the eye chris said so hows charlie taking all this the siege he doesnt care too much about that though he says hes feeding boomer ground beef these days no dog food coming in on the trucks mostly hes worried about the eye what about the eye they had another little cascade of technical glitches while i was out there really i didnt get a memo about it charlie says its just the usual blinks and nods but its been happening more often lately power surges and some ragged io i think whats really bothering him is the possibility somebody might pull the plug hes nursed those obecs so long theyre like children to him its just bs marguerite said all this talk about shutting down the eye but she didnt sound convincing even to herself she made an awkward attempt to change the subject you dont usually talk about your work much she had already finished half the drink and she felt the alcohol working through her body ridiculously quickly making her sleepy making her reckless i try to keep it away from you and tess chris said im grateful to be here at all i dont want to spread my troubles around its all right weve known each other what more than a month now but im pretty sure whatever people say about your book isnt true you dont strike me as dishonest or vicious dishonest and vicious is that what people say margaret blushed but chris was smiling ive heard it all before marguerite id like to read the book sometime nobody can download it since the lockup maybe that works to my advantage his smile became less convincing i can give you a copy id appreciate that and i appreciate the vote of confidence marguerite what how would you feel about giving me an interview about blind lake the siege how you fit in oh god it wasnt what she had expected him to say but what had she expected him to say well not tonight no not tonight the last time anyone interviewed me it was the high school paper about my science project good project blue ribbon scholarship prize all about mitochondrial dna back when i thought i wanted to be a geneticist pretty heavy stuff for a clergymans daughter she yawned i really do have to sleep impulsively or maybe drunkenly marguerite put her hand on the table palm up it was a gesture he could reasonably ignore and no harm done if he did ignore it chris looked at her hand maybe a few seconds too long then he covered it with his own willingly grudgingly she liked the way his palm felt on hers no adult male had held her hand since she left ray not that ray had been much of a handholder she discovered she couldnt look chris in the eye she let the moment linger then she pulled back grinning sheepishly gotta go she said sleep well chris carmody said you too she told him wondering what she was getting herself into before she turned in she gave the direct feed from the eye a last look nothing much was doing subject continued his twoweekold odyssey he was far along the eastern road walking steadily into another morning his skin looked increasingly dull as the days passed but that was probably just ambient dust there had been no rain for months now but that was typical of a summer in these latitudes even the sun seemed dimmer until margaret realized that the haze was unusually thick today and particularly thick to the northeast almost like an approaching squall line she could ask meteorology about it she guessed tomorrow finally before she took herself to bed marguerite peeked into tessas room tess was soundly asleep the empty pane in the window beside her bed was still protected by chriss plasticandveneer lashup and the room was cozily warm darkness outside and in mirrors happily vacant no sound but tessas easy breathing and in the quiet of the house marguerite realized who she was writing her narrative for not for herself certainly not for other scientists and not for the general public she was writing it for tess the realization was energizing it chased away the possibility of sleep she went back to her office turned on the desk lamp and brought out the notebook again she opened it and wrote more than fifty years ago on a planet so far away that no living human being can ever hope to travel there there was a city of rock and sandstone it was a city as large as any of our own great cities and its towers rose high into that worlds thin dry air the city was built on a dusty plain overlooked by tall mountains whose peaks were snowy even during the long summer someone lived there someone who was not quite a human being but who was a person in his own way very different from us but in some ways much alike the name we gave him was subject fifteen sue sampel was beginning to enjoy her weekends again despite the continuing lockdown for a while it had been a tossup weekdays busy but tarnished by the tantrums and weirdness of her boss saturday and sunday slow and melancholy because she couldnt hop in the car and drive into constance for some r r at first she had spent her weekends restlessly stoned until her personal stash began to run low another item the black trucks werent delivering then she borrowed a handful of tiffany arias novels from another supportstaffer at the plaza five fat books about a wartime nurse in shiugang torn between her love for an air force surveillance pilot and her secret affair with a harddrinking gunrunner sue liked the books okay but thought they were a poor substitute for green girl canadian label cannabis regularly but illegally imported from the northern economic protectorate a quarterounce of which she was conserving in a cookie tin in her sock drawer then sebastian vogel showed up on her doorstep with a billet note from ari weingart and a battered brown suitcase at first sight he didnt look promising cute maybe in a christmaself kind of way pushing sixty a little overweight fringe of gray hair framing his shiny bald head a bushy redgray beard he was obviously shy he stuttered when he introduced himself and worse sue got the impression he was some kind of clergyman or retired priest he promised to be no trouble at all and she feared that was probably true she had asked ari about him the next day ari said sebastian was a retired academic not a priest one of the threepack of journalists who were stranded in blind lake sebastian had written a book called god the quantum vacuum ari lent her a copy the book was a lot drier than a tiffany arias novel but considerably more substantial still sebastian vogel wasnt much more than a silent partner in the household until the night he caught her rolling a joint on the kitchen table oh my sebastian said from the doorway it was too late to hide the cookie tin or the papers guiltily sue tried to make a joke of it um she said care to join me oh no i cant no i completely understand i cant impose on your hospitality but i have a halfounce in my luggage if you dont mind sharing it with me it got better after that he was fifteen years older than sue and his birthday was january ninth by the time that rolled around she was sharing her bed with him sue liked him enormously and he was a lot more fun than she ever would have guessed but she also knew this was probably just a lockdown romance a term shed picked up in the staff cafeteria lockdown romances had sprung up all over town the combination of cabin fever and constant anxiety turned out to be a real aphrodisiac his birthday fell on a saturday and sue had been planning for it for weeks now she had wanted to get him a birthday cake but there were no boxed mixes in the store and she wasnt about to attempt a cake from scratch so she had done the next best thing she had exercised her ingenuity she brought the cake into the dining room a single candle planted in it happy birthday she said it wasnt really much of a cake but it had symbolic value sebastians small mouth curled into a smile only partially obscured by his mustache this is too kind sue thank you its nothing she said no its fine he admired the cake i havent seen luxury food in weeks where did you get this it wasnt really a cake it was a dingdong with a birthday candle stuck in it you dont want to know sue said saturday sebastian had agreed to meet his friends for lunch at sawyers he asked sue to come along she agreed but not without doubts sue had earned a bsc some twenty years ago but all it had gotten her was a glorified clerical job at blind lake she had been frozen out of too many technical discussions to relish an afternoon of sciencejournalist peertalk sebastian assured her it wouldnt be like that his friends were writers not scientists outspoken but not snobbish maybe so maybe not sue drove sebastian who had no car of his own to sawyers where they parked in a flurry of light snow the wind was brisk the sun peeking out now and again between canyons of cloud the air inside the restaurant was sleepily warm and moist sebastian introduced her to elaine coster a skinny sourlooking woman not much older than sue herself and chris carmody considerably younger tall and slightly grim but handsome in a ruffled way chris was friendly but elaine after a limp handshake said well sebastian theres more to you than we suspected sue was surprised by the animosity in the womans voice almost a sneer and by sebastians obvious indifference to it lunch was soup and sandwiches the postlockdown inevitable sue made gracious noises but mostly listened to the others talk they talked blind lake politics including some speculation about ray scutter and they worried over the perennial question of the siege they reminisced about people shed never heard of until sue began to feel ignored though sebastian kept a hand on her thigh under the table and gave her a reassuring squeeze from time to time finally there was a piece of gossip to which she felt connected turned out chris was rooming with ray scutters ex and ray had done some macho grandstanding outside the blind lake clinic a couple of weeks back it was typical ray scutter assholery and sue said so elaine gave her a long unnerving glare what do you know about ray scutter i run his office for him her eyes widened youre his secretary executive assistant well yeah secretary basically pretty and talented elaine said to sebastian who merely smiled his inscrutable smile she refocused on sue who resisted the urge to shrink away from the womans laser stare how much do you actually know about ray scutter his private life nothing his work pretty much everything he talks to you about it god no ray plays his cards close to his chest mainly because hes holding the ace of incompetency you know how people who are out of their depth like to do all kinds of busywork make themselves at least look useful thats ray he doesnt tell me anything but half the time i have to explain his job to him you know elaine said there are rumors about ray or maybe sue thought im out of my depth what kind of rumors that ray wants to break into the executive servers and read peoples mail oh well thats there was a buzzing chris carmody took his phone out of his pocket turned away and whispered into it elaine gave him a poisonous look when he turned back to the table he said sorry people marguerite needs me to look after her daughter jesus elaine said is everybody setting up housekeeping in this fucking place what are you now a babysitter some kind of emergency marguerite says he stood up go go she rolled her eyes sebastian nodded amiably pleasure meeting you chris said to sue you too he seemed nice enough if a little distracted he was certainly better company than elaine with the xray vision which elaine focused on her as soon as chris walked away from the table so its true rays doing some illicit hacking i dont know about illicit hes planning to make it public the idea is prelockdown messages on the senior servers might give us a clue to what caused all this if some kind of message went out before the lockdown how come ray didnt get one he was low man on the management totem pole before everybody left for the cancun conference plus hes new here he had contacts at crossbank but not what youd call friends ray doesnt make friends this gives him the right to break into secure servers he thinks so he thinks so but has he actually done anything about it sue considered her position talking to the press would be a great way to get herself fired no doubt elaine would promise total anonymity or money if she asked for it or the moon but promises were like bad checks easy to write and hard to cash i may be stupid sue thought but im not nearly as stupid as this woman seems to think she considered sebastian did sebastian want her to talk about this she gave him a questioning look sebastian sat back in his chair with his hands clasped over his stomach a spot of mustard adorning his beard enigmatic as a stuffed owl but he nodded at her okay okay shed do it for him not this elaine she licked her lips shulgin was in the building yesterday with a computer guy cracking servers what do you think but its not like i caught them in the act what kind of results did they get none as far as i know they were still there after i went home friday they might still be there sue thought sifting silicon for gold if they find something interesting will that information pass over your desk no she smiled but itll pass over rays sebastian looked suddenly troubled this is all very interesting he said but dont let elaine talk you into anything dangerous his hand was on her thigh again communicating some message she couldnt decipher elaine has her own best interests at heart fuck off sebastian elaine said sue was mildly scandalized more so because sebastian just nodded and put that buddhalike smile back on his face i might see something like that sue said or i might not if you do elaine elaine sebastian said dont push your luck ill think about it sue said okay good enough can we talk about something else now they had drained their carafe of coffee and the waitress hadnt come around with more elaine began shrugging her shoulders into her jacket sebastian said by the way i was asked to give a little presentation at the community center for one of aris social nights hawking your book elaine asked in a way aris having a hard time filling up those saturday slots hell probably ask you next sue enjoyed seeing elaine flinch from this proposition thanks but i have better things to do ill let you tell ari that yourself ill put it in writing if he likes sebastian excused himself and wandered off to the mens room after an awkward silence sue still miffed said maybe you dont like sebastians writing but he deserves a little respect have you read his book yes have you really whats it about sue found herself blushing its about the quantum vacuum the quantum vacuum as a medium for uh a kind of intelligence and how what we call human consciousness is actually our ability to tap a little tiny bit of that universal mind but she couldnt begin to say that to elaine she already felt painfully foolish no elaine said sorry wrong its about telling people something simplistic and reassuring dressed up in pseudoscientific bullshit its about a semiretired academic making pots of money and doing it in the most cynical way possible oh sebastian had crept up behind her and judging by his expression he had heard every word honestly elaine thats too much dont get all huffy sebastian have your publishers tapped you for a sequel yet what are you calling it the quantum vacuum twelvestep program financial security the quantum vacuum way sebastian opened his mouth but didnt say anything he didnt look angry sue thought he looked hurt honestly he repeated elaine stood up buttoning her jacket you kids have fun she hesitated then turned back and put a hand on sues shoulder okay i know im an awful bitch im sorry thank you for putting up with me i do appreciate what you said about ray sue shrugged she couldnt think of an answer sebastian was quiet during the drive back almost sulking she couldnt wait to get home and roll him a joint sixteen chris found marguerite in her upstairs office shouting into her pocket phone the direct feed from the eye filled the wall monitor the image looked bad to chris it looked degraded streaked with spurious lines and fleeting white pinpricks worse the subject was struggling through some intensely bad weather ribbons of ochre and rust a dust storm so fierce it threatened to obscure him altogether no marguerite was saying i dont care what theyre saying at the plaza come on charlie you know what this means no ill be there soon she saw chris and added fifteen minutes the original highaltitude mapping of umae had shown seasonal dust storms of almost martian intensity primarily in the southern hemisphere this one must be anomalous chris thought since subject had not journeyed more than a hundred miles from lobsterville and lobsterville was well north of the equator or maybe it was perfectly natural part of some longterm cycle early surveillance had missed subject pushed into the opaque air torso bent forward his image faded clarified faded again charlies afraid theyll lose him altogether marguerite said im going out to the eye chris followed her downstairs tess was in the living room watching blind lake tvs saturday matinee an animated feature rabbits with huge eyeglasses growing carrots in medieval beakers and alembics her head bounced gently and rhythmically against the sofa you said we could go sledding tess called out honey its a work emergency i told you chris will look after you kay i suppose i could take her sledding chris said its a long walk though really tess asked can we marguerite pursed her lips i guess but i dont want you hiking there and back mrs colangelo said we could borrow her car if we needed it chris can look into that he promised hed ask tess was mollified and marguerite shrugged into her winter jacket if im not back by dinner theres food in the freezer be creative how serious is the problem it took a lot of delicate work training the obecs to fix on a single individual if we lose him in the storm we might not get him back worse theres a lot of signal degradation happening and charlie doesnt know whats causing it you think you can help not with the engineering but there are people in the plaza whod love to use this as an opportunity to pull back from the subject i dont want that to happen im running interference good luck thank you and thanks for keeping tess company one way or another ill be back before her bedtime she hurried out the door in the interest of journalistic brotherhood chris called elaine and told her about the developing crisis at the eye she said shed find out what she could things are getting strange she said im getting that battendownthehatches feeling he had to admit he was a little skittish himself almost four months of quarantine now and no matter how you tried to ignore it or rationalize it that meant something monumentally bad was happening maybe outside maybe inside something bad something dangerous something hidden that would eventually come screaming into the light mrs colangelo managed the clothing store in the blind lake retail mall and she had been effectively retired since the lockdown she let him borrow her little limegreen marconi roadster and tess loaded her oldfashioned wooden sled into the back most kids used inner tubes or plastic skids tess explained but shed spotted this sled actually a toboggan she insisted in a thrift shop and begged her mother to buy it this was back at crossbank which was hillier than blind lake but heavily wooded at least out here she wouldnt run into any trees tess was still something of a cipher to chris she reminded him of his sister portia in many maybe too many ways her willfulness her unpredictability her spiky moods but porry had been a great talker especially when she picked up some new enthusiasm tess spoke only sporadically tess was silent for the first five minutes of the ride but apparently she had also been thinking of portia did your sister ever go sledding she asked since the window episode tess had come to him several times for porry stories tess an only child seemed fascinated by the idea of chris as an older brother something less than a parent more than a friend she seemed to think portia had led an enchanted existence not true portia was buried in a rainy seattle cemetery victim of the fatal disease of adulthood in its most acute form he would not of course say that to tess it didnt snow much where we grew up the closest thing to sledding we did was snowtubing at a little resort up in the mountains did portia like that not at first at first she was pretty scared but after a couple of runs she decided it was fun i think she liked it tess said except that she got cold thats right she didnt like the cold very much elaine had accused him of setting up housekeeping at marguerites he wondered if that was true over the last several weeks he had become very much a part of marguerite and tessa hausers universe almost in spite of himself no that was wrong not in spite of himself he had taken every step willingly but the steps had added up to an unplanned journey he had yet to go to bed with marguerite but according to every signal he could read that was where this trip was taking him and it wasnt a neat little temporary bargain a onenight stand or even an explicit lockdown romance the exchange of warmth for warmth and no promises made or implied the stakes were much much higher did he want that he liked marguerite he liked everything about marguerite every latenight conversation and lately there had been many had drawn him closer to her she was a generous storyteller she talked freely about her childhood she had lived with her father in a presbyterian rectory in a little railstop bedroom suburb outside of cincinnati a seventyyearold house with a wooden porch about her work about tess less often and more reluctantly about her marriage nothing in her somewhat sheltered life had prepared her for ray who had professed to love her but had only wanted to furnish his life with a woman in the conventional manner and for whom cruelty was the fuck of last resort such men were abundant on the earth but marguerite had never run into one what followed had been a nineyear nightmare of enlightenment and what did she see in chris not exactly the antiray but maybe a more benevolent vision of masculinity someone she could confide in someone she could lean against without fear of retribution and he was flattered by that but it was an uninformed opinion not that he was incapable of love he had loved his work he had loved his family he had loved his sister portia but the things he loved tended to come to pieces in his hands torn apart by his clumsy desire to protect them he would never hurt her the way ray had hurt her but in the long term he might prove just as dangerous tess had told him where the best sledding was along the low hills a quarter mile past eyeball alley where the access road ended in a paved culdesac the alleys cooling towers came up on the left side of the road dark sentinels in a white landscape tess broke the silence again did portia have problems at school sure she did everybody does now and then i hate physical education i could never climb that rope chris said we dont do ropes yet but we have to wear stupid gym clothes did portia ever have nightmares sometimes what were her nightmares like well she didnt like to talk about them tess and i promised not to tell tess looked at him appraisingly she was deciding whether to trust him chris thought tess dispensed her trust cautiously life had taught her that not every grownup was trustworthy a hard lesson but worth learning but if he was still keeping portias secrets he might keep tessas did my mom tell you about mirror girl nope whos mirror girl thats whats wrong with me another sidelong look you knew something was wrong with me right i did wonder a little that night we had to go to the clinic i see her in mirrors thats why i call her mirror girl she paused i saw her in the window that night she took me by surprise i guess i got angry chris sensed the gravity of the confession he was flattered tess had raised the subject with him he eased up on the accelerator eking out a little more talk time she looks like me but she isnt me thats what nobody understands so what do you think am i crazy you dont strike me as crazy i dont talk about it because people think im nuts maybe i am stuff happens we dont understand that doesnt make you nuts how come nobody else can see her i dont know what does she want tess shrugged her shoulders irritably it was a question she must have been asked too often she doesnt say does she talk not in words i think she just wants me to pay attention to things i think she cant pay attention unless im paying attention does that make any sense but thats just what i think its only a theory portia talked to her toys sometimes its not like that thats a kid thing she rolled her eyes edie jerundt talks to her toys better not to press it was enough that tess had opened up to him he drove in silence to the end of the road to the turnaround where a half dozen other cars were parked the steepest slope of the snowwhite hill was speckled with sledders and boarders and indulgent parents lot of airplanes around today tess said climbing out of the car chris glanced at the sky but saw nothing more than a silver speck on the far horizon another cryptic tess remark will you help me pull the sled up she asked sure thing ride down with me if you want but i have to warn you i havent been on a sled for years you said you didnt have a sled you said you just snowtubed i mean i havent slid down a hill for years since portia was little right well come on then tess said tess was aware all this time of the growing and insistent presence of mirror girl mirror girl slid through every reflective surface like a slippery ghost mirror girl wavered across the windows and the shiny blue hood and side panels of the car tess was even aware of the sparse few snowflakes falling from a high gray sky she had studied snowflakes in science class they were an example of symmetry ice she thought like glass folded in mirror angles she imagined mirror girl in every invisible facet of the falling snow in fact tess felt a little ill mirror girl pressed in on her like a heavy airless fog until she could hardly think of anything else maybe shed said too much to chris saying the name mirror girl was probably a bad idea maybe mirror girl didnt like to be talked about but tess had been looking forward to this sledding expedition all week and she wasnt about to let mirror girl screw it up she allowed chris to pull the sled to the top of the hill there was a gentle path up the long part of the hill and then a steep slope for riding back down tess was a little breathless at the top but she liked the view funny how such a little hill let you see so much more than you could from down below here were the dark towers of eyeball alley there the white squares of hubble plaza and the stores and houses clustered around it the roads looked like roads in a roadmap sharp and precise the road to constance cut through the south gate and into the snowflecked distance like a line etched in white metal wind plucked at tessas hair and she took her snow hat out of her jacket pocket and pulled it over her head almost down to her eyes she closed her eyes and saw airplanes why airplanes mirror girl was very concerned about airplanes right now about a little plane with propellors and a bigger jet dropping down toward it like a hunting bird where the sky was too cloudy to reveal much though the clouds themselves were thin and high the buzz in her ears might be an airplane tess thought or it might just be the wind fluttering the collar of her jacket or her own blood pulsing in her ears her fingers tingled but her body was warm under her clothes im hot im cold she thought tess chris said you okay usually when people asked her that question it meant she was doing something peculiar standing too still or staring too hard but why did people care what was so strange about just standing here thinking maybe this was what mirror girl was seeing or wanted tess to see the big plane and the little one the little one was bright yellow and had numbers on its wings but no military markings it was bigger than the kind of airplane that dusted crops but not by much it was very clear to her when she closed her eyes but confusing too as if she were looking at the airplane from too many angles at once it was a faceted airplane a kaleidoscope airplane an airplane in a mirror of many angles chris handed her the rope of the sled tess grasped the rope in her hand and tried to focus on the task of sledding it suddenly seemed more like a chore than fun snow crunched and complained under the weight of the wooden runners somewhere down the slope people laughed then the airplanes distracted her again not just the little airplane but the bigger one too the jet which was still far away but stalked the small plane doggedly and then tess dropped the rope the sled skittered away down the hill vacant before chris could catch it chris knelt in front of her tess what is it whats wrong she saw his big worried eyes but couldnt answer the jet had come miles closer in just a few seconds and now something flew away from the jet it was a missile tess supposed and it flashed between the two aircraft like a reflection in a fractured crystal why couldnt anyone else see it why were the people on the hill still laughing and sliding were they confused by the snow by its millionsuponmillions of mirrors maybe wed better get you home chris said obviously not seeing it either tess wanted to point she raised her arm she extended her finger her finger followed the invisible arc of the missile a line like an infinitely thin pencil stroke drawn across the white paper of the sky she said there but then everybody heard the explosion charlie grogan met marguerite outside his office at the alley come on down to control he said tersely its only getting freakier charlie was obviously tense as they rode the elevator the eye was deep in the earth an irony marguerite had once appreciated the jewel is in the lotus the eye is in the earth the better to see you with my dear it didnt seem particularly funny right now i can handle any call from the plaza she said unless its ray himself if ray calls and pulls rank all i can do is pretend the phone is broken frankly the plazas not our biggest problem right now we had to call in both tech shifts they yanked and replaced a couple of the interface units worse charlie said and i know you dont want to hear this were having big trouble with the obecs the obecs even charlie had been known to call them a keepyourfingerscrossed technology marguerite had very little background in quantum computing she didnt pretend to understand the intricacies of the obec platens hooking up a collection of obecs in a selfevolving organic array was an experiment that should never have worked in her opinion the results were unpredictable and spooky and she remembered what chris had said or quoted it could end at any time it could yes it could and maybe this was the time but god no she thought not now not when they were on the brink of a profounder knowledge not when the subject was in mortal danger the controlandinterface room was more crowded than marguerite had ever seen it tech people clustered around the system monitors a few of them arguing heatedly she was dismayed to see that the big main screen the live feed was utterly blank charlie what happened he shrugged loss of intelligibility temporary we think its an io hangup not a complete system failure we lost the subject no like i said its an interface thing the eye is still watching him but were having trouble talking to the eye and he gave a halfshrug that meant at least thats what we think has this happened before not like this no but you can fix it he hesitated probably he said at last there was still an image twenty minutes ago what was he doing when you lost him the subject he was hunkered down behind some kind of obstruction when everything grayed out you think the storm is causing this marguerite nobody knows we dont understand a fraction of what the obecs do they can look through stone walls a sandstorm shouldnt be a problem but visibility is severely compromised so maybe the eye has to work harder to keep a fix on a moving target maybe thats what were dealing with here all we can do is treat the peripheral problems as they come up keep the temperature in spec keep the quantum wells stable he closed his eyes and ran a hand over his stubbled scalp this is what we dont like to acknowledge marguerite thought that were using a technology we dont understand a dissipative structure capable of growing its own complexity capable of growing well beyond our intellectual grasp of it not really a machine but a process inside a machine evolution in miniature in its way a new form of life all we ever did was trigger it trigger it and bend it to our purposes made ourselves the only species with an eye more complex than our own brains the overhead lights flickered and dimmed voltagebus monitors bleated shrill alarms please charlie marguerite said dont let him slip away chris was following tessas abrupt gesture when he heard the explosion it wasnt an especially loud sound not much louder than the sound of a slammed tailgate but weightier full of rolling undertones like thunder he straightened up and searched the sky so did the other sledders anyone who wasnt already skimming down the slope at first he saw an expanding ring of smoke faint against a background of high cloud and patchwork blue sky then the airplane itself distant and falling in a skewed curve toward the earth falling but not helplessly the pilot seemed to be struggling for control it was a small plane a private plane canary yellow nothing military chris saw it in silhouette as it flew briefly level parallel to the road from blind lake and maybe a couple hundred feet off the ground coming closer he realized maybe trying to use the road as a landing strip then the aircraft faltered again veering wildly and ejecting a gout of black smoke coming in badly and coming in close get down he told tess down on the ground now the girl remained rigid motionless staring chris pushed her back into the snow and covered her with his body some of the sledders began to scream apart from that the silence of the afternoon had become eerie the planes engines had cut out it should make more noise chris thought all that falling metal it touched ground at the north end of the parking circle nosing up at the last minute before it collided with a bright red ford van translating all that kinetic energy into a fan of red and yellow debris that cut trails and craters into the fallen snow tessas body trembled at the sound the shrapnel traveled east and away from the sledding hill and it was still coming down in a patter of snowmuted thunks when the wreckage burst into flame chris pulled tess into a sitting position she sat up as if catatonic arms rigid at her sides she stared but didnt blink tess he said listen to me i have to help but i want you to stay here button up if you get cold look for another adult if you need help otherwise wait for me okay i guess wait for me wait for you she said dully he didnt like the way she looked or sounded but she wasnt physically injured and there might be survivors in the burning wreckage chris gave her what he hoped was a reassuring hug and then bounded down the slope his feet gouging imperfections into snow compressed and made slick by the sledders he reached the burning airplane along with three other adults two men and a woman presumably all parents who had come sledding with their children he advanced as close to the fire as he dared the heat of it prickling the skin of his face and boiling snow into the air the paved lot showed through the snow in watery black patches he could see enough of the van its roof had been sheared off to know there was no one inside the small plane was another matter behind its furiously cooking engine a human shape struggled against the clouded glass of the cabin door chris peeled off his cloth jacket and wrapped it around his right hand later marguerite would tell him he acted heroically maybe so it didnt feel that way what it felt like was the obvious next thing to do he might not have attempted it if the fire had not been relatively contained if the plane had been heavier with fuel but he didnt recall doing any riskbenefit calculation there was only the job at hand he felt the heat on his face prickling his skin gusts of cold air behind him angling toward the flames the figure faintly visible in the crumpled cabin twitched then stopped moving altogether the door was hot even through the folds of his jacket it was slightly ajar but stuck in its frame chris fumbled at it futilely backed away to catch a breath of cooler air then kicked hard at the accordioned aluminum once twice three times until it bent far enough that he was able to brace himself grasp the door in the folds of his nowsmoldering jacket and apply some leverage the pilot spilled onto the damp ground like a bag of meat his face was hairless and blackened where it wasnt a shocking charred red he wore a pair of aviator glasses one lens missing and the other lens crazed but he was breathing his chest lifted and fell in cresting waves the men behind him dashed close enough to pull the pilot away from the wreckage chris found himself hesitating pointlessly was there something more he was supposed to do the heat had made him dizzy he felt a hand on his shoulder felt himself tugged away from the flames just a few feet away the air seemed dramatically colder far colder than it had been on the hillside with tess he staggered away then sat on the hood of an undamaged automobile and let his head droop someone brought him a bottle of water he drained it almost at once though that made him feel sicker he heard an ambulance screaming down the road from blind lake tess he thought tess on the hillside how much time had passed he looked for her on the slope everyone had come down they had all gathered in the parking lot a safe distance from the burning plane everyone but tess hed told her to stay put and she had taken him literally he called to her but she was too far away to hear wearily he hiked back up the slope tess was standing immobile staring at the wreckage she didnt acknowledge him when he called to her not good she was in some kind of shock chris supposed he knelt in front of her put his face in her line of vision and his hands on her small shoulders tess he said tess are you all right at first she didnt react then she trembled her body shook she blinked and opened her mouth soundlessly we need to get you someplace warm he said she leaned into him and started to cry marguerite lost track of charlie in the noisy chaos of the control room for a fraction of a second there was utter blackness complete electrical failure then the lights flickered back and the room was full of voices marguerite found an unoccupied corner and stayed out of the way there was nothing she could do to help and she knew better than to interfere something bad had happened something she didnt understand something that had driven the engineers into a frenzy of activity she focused on the big wall screen the direct feed from the eye still alarmingly blank it could end at any time her phone buzzed she ignored it she caught sight of charlie and watched him orbit the room coordinating activity since she was helpless or at least unable to help she began to feel a presentiment of loss loss of intelligibility loss of orientation loss of vision loss of the subject with whom she had struggled across a desert to the heart of a sandstorm periodically the wall screen erupted into stochastic cascades of color marguerite stared trying but failing to extract an image no signal just noise only noise a few more green lights she heard someone say was that good apparently so here came charlie and he wasnt smiling but the expression on his face wasnt as grave as it had been how long ago an hour were getting a little something back he said an image maybe were still fixed on the subject just watch marguerite she focused again on the screen which had begun to fill with new light tiny digital mosaics assembled in the unfathomable depths of the obec platens white faded to tawny brown the desert were back marguerite thought and a tingle of relief flowed up her spine but where was the subject and what was this blank emptiness sand she murmured fine silicate grains undisturbed by wind the storm must have passed but the sand wasnt still the sand mounded and slid this way and that subject lifted himself out of a cloak of sand he had been buried by the wind but he was alive he pulled himself up by his manipulating arms then stood unsteadily in the startling sunlight the virtual camera rose with him behind him marguerite saw the sand squall where it had retreated to the horizon trailing black vortices like mares tails all around the subject were lines and angles of stone old stone columns and pyramidal structures and sandscoured foundations the ruins of a city part three the ascent of the invisible man on earth could go no further toward conquering the limitations of atmosphere metals and optics through this gigantic mirror underlying a telescope in whose construction the efforts of dozens of great minds had been united for years to produce an instrument of unrivaled accuracy intricacy and range equipped with every device desired by and known to astronomers study of the universe had reached a climax donald wandrei colossus seventeen coming into february now and it was obvious to marguerite as she drove home from her saturday ration trip what a different place the lake had become superficially nothing had changed the snowplows still emerged from the back bays of the retail mall whenever it snowed and they kept the streets passably clear lights still burned in windows at night everybody was warm and no one was hungry but there was a shabbiness about the town too an unwashed quality there were no outside contractors to repair winter potholes or replace the shingles that had been torn from so many roofs in the postchristmas storms garbage was collected on the regular schedule but it couldnt be trucked offsite the sanitation people had set up a temporary dump at the western extremity of the lake near the perimeter fence and as far as possible from the town and the preserved wetlands still the stench drifted with the wind like an augur of decay and on especially breezy days she had seen crumpled papers and food wrappers wheeling along the mallway like tumbleweeds the question was so commonplace no one bothered to ask it anymore when will it end because it could end at any time tess had come back from the site of the airplane crash weak and dazed marguerite had wrapped her up and fed her hot soup and put her to bed for the night marguerite herself hadnt slept but tess had and in the morning she had seemed herself again seemed was the key word between christmas and new years tess had not so much as mentioned mirror girl there had been no provocative episodes but marguerite had recognized the worry creases on tessas face and had sensed in her daughters silences something weightier than her customary shyness she had been extremely reluctant to send tess for her weeklong visit with ray but there was no way around it had she objected ray would almost certainly have sent one of his rentacop security guys around to collect tess by force so with deep unease marguerite had helped her daughter pack her rucksack of treasured possessions and ushered her out the door as soon as ray pulled up at the curb in his little scarabcolored automobile ray had remained a silhouette in the shaded cab of the car unwilling to show her his face he looked indistinct marguerite thought like a fading memory she watched tess greet him with a cheeriness that struck her as either false or heartbreakingly naive the only upside of this was that during the next week she would have more free time for chris she pulled into the driveway thinking of him chris he had made a powerful impression on her with his wounded eyes and his obvious courage not to mention the way he touched her like a man stepping into a spring of warm water testing the heat before he gave himself up to it good chris scary chris scary because having a man in the house being intimate with a man provoked unwelcome memories of ray if only by contrast the smell of aftershave in the bathroom a mans pants abandoned on the bedroom floor male warmth lingering in the crevices of the bed with ray all these things had come to seem loathsome as objectionable as a bruise but with chris it was just the opposite yesterday she had found herself not only volunteering to wash his clothes but furtively inhaling the smell of him from an undershirt before she committed it to the washing machine how ridiculously schoolgirlish marguerite thought how very dangerously infatuated she was with this man she supposed it was at least therapeutic like draining venom from a snakebite people talked about lockdown romances was this a lockdown romance marguerites experience was limited ray had been not only her first husband but her first lover marguerite had been like tess one of those awkward girls at school bright but gawky not especially pretty intimidated into silence in any social setting when boys were like that they were called geeks but at least they seemed able to take solace in the company of others like themselves marguerite had never made real friends of either sex at least not until she was in graduate school there at least she had found colleagues people who respected her talent people who liked her for her ideas some of whom had progressed to the status of friends maybe that was why she had been so impressed with ray when ray began to take an explicit interest in her ray had been ten years her senior doing cuttingedge astrophysical work back when she was still struggling to find a way into crossbank he had been blunt in his opinions but flattering toward marguerite and he had obviously been sizing her up for marriage from the beginning what marguerite had not learned was that for some men marriage is a license to drop their masks and show their true and terrible faces nor was this merely a figure of speech it seemed to marguerite that his face had actually changed that he had shed the gentle and indulgent ray of their engagement as efficiently as a snake sheds its skin clearly she had been a lousy judge of character so what did that make chris a lockdown romance a potential second father for tess or something in between and how could she even begin to construct an idea of the future when even the possibility of a future could end at any time chris had been working in his basement study but he came up the stairs when he heard her puttering around the kitchen and said are you busy well that was an interesting question it was saturday she wasnt obliged to work but what was work what wasnt work for months she had divided her attention between tess and the subject and now chris today shed planned to catch up on her notes and keep an eye on the direct feed the subjects odyssey continued though the sandstorm crisis had passed and the ruined city was now far behind him he had left the road he was traveling through empty desert his physical condition had changed in troublesome ways but nothing absolutely critical was happening at least not at the moment what did you have in mind the pilot i pulled out of the wreck is stabilized over at the clinic i thought id pay him a visit is he awake marguerite had heard the man was in a coma not yet so whats the point of visiting sometimes you just want to touch base back in the car then back on the road with chris at the wheel back through the bright cold february afternoon and the tumbling windblown trash how could you possibly owe him anything you saved his life for better or worse how could it be worse hes severely burned when he wakes up hes going to be in a world of pain not only that im sure ray and his buddies would love to interrogate him that was true nobody knew why the small plane had been flying over blind lake or what the pilot had hoped to accomplish by violating an enforced nofly zone but the incident had turned up the anxiety level in town more than a notch in the past couple of weeks there had been three more attempts to breach the perimeter fence from inside all by individuals a day worker a student and a junior analyst all three had been killed by pocket drones though the analyst had made it a good fifty or sixty yards wearing a rigged thermal jacket to disguise his infrared signature none of the bodies had been recovered they would still be there marguerite thought when the snow melted in the spring like something left over from a war burned frozen and thawed biological residue vulture bait were there vultures in minnesota everyone was frightened and everyone was desperate to know why the lake had been quarantined and when the quarantine would end or unspeakable thought whether it would end so yes the pilot would be interrogated perhaps vigorously and yes he would certainly be in pain despite the clinics reserve of neural analgesics but that didnt invalidate the act of courage chris had performed she felt this in him more than once his doubts about the consequences of a good act maybe his book about galliano had been a good act at least from his point of view a wrong righted and he had been punished for it once burned twice shy but it seemed to go deeper than that marguerite didnt understand how a man as apparently decent as chris carmody could be so unsure of himself when certified bastards like ray walked around in the glow of their own grim righteousness a line from a poem she had studied in high school came back to her the best lack all conviction while the worstare full of passionate intensity chris parked in the nearly vacant clinic parking lot the solstice was past and the days were getting longer again but it was still only february and already the watery sun was close to the horizon he took her hand as they walked to the clinic door there was no one at reception but chris rang the finger bell and a nurse appeared a moment later i know this woman marguerite thought this bustling chubby woman in nursing whites was amanda bleilers mother a familiar face from the weekdaymorning gradeschool dropoff someone she knew well enough to wave at what was her first name roberta rosetta marguerite the woman said recognizing her and you must be chris carmody chris had phoned ahead rosalie she said the name popping into her head a moment before she pronounced it hows amanda doing well enough considering considering the lockdown she meant considering that there were dead bodies buried under the snow outside the perimeter fence rosalie turned to chris if you want to look in on mr sandoval thats okay i cleared it with dr goldhar but dont expect much okay and itll have to be a quick visit couple of minutes tops all right rosalie led them up a flight of stairs to the clinics second floor where three small rooms equipped with rudimentary lifesupport gear punctuated a row of offices and boardrooms not very many years ago the pilot wouldnt have survived his injuries rosalie explained that he had suffered thirddegree burns over a large part of his body and that he had inhaled enough smoke and hot air to seriously damage his lungs the clinic had fitted him with an alveolar bypass and packed his pulmonary sacs with gel to hasten the healing as for his skin well marguerite thought he looked ghastly lying in a white bed in a white room with ebonywhite artificial skin stretched over his face like so much damp kleenex but this was very nearly stateoftheart treatment in less than a month rosalie said he would look almost normal almost the way he had looked before the crash the most serious injury had been a blow to the head that had not quite cracked his skull but had caused intracranial bleeding that was hard to treat or correct we did everything we could rosalie said dr goldhar is a really exceptional doctor considering we dont have a fully equipped hospital to work with but the prognosis is iffy mr sandoval may wake up he may not mr sandoval marguerite thought trying to take the measure of the man under all this medical apparatus probably not a young man big paunch pushing up under the blankets saltandpepper hair where it hadnt been charred from his skull you called him mr sandoval chris said thats his name adam sandoval hes been unconscious since he got here how do you know his name well she looked distressed dr goldhar said not to be too free with this information but you saved his life right that was really brave the story had been broadcast on blind lake tv much to chriss horror he had declined an interview but his reputation had been massively enhanced not a bad thing surely marguerite would have thought but maybe chris a journalist felt uncomfortable at the center of a media event however smallscale what information chris asked he had a wallet and part of a backpack on him mostly burned but we saved enough to read his id chris said and marguerite thought she heard a concealed edge in his voice would it be possible to look at his things well i dont think so i mean i should probably talk to dr goldhar first wont this all eventually be police evidence or something i wont disturb anything just a glance ill vouch for chris marguerite added hes a good guy well just a peek maybe i mean its not like youre terrorists or anything she gave chris a somber look dont get me in trouble thats all i ask chris sat with the pilot a while longer he whispered something marguerite couldnt hear a question an apology a prayer then they left adam sandoval whose chest rose and fell with the exhalations of his breathing apparatus in a queerly peaceful rhythm and rosalie took them to a small room at the end of the corridor she unlocked the door with a key attached to a ring on her belt stored inside were medical sundries boxes of suture thread in various gauges saline bags bandages and gauze antiseptics in brown bottles and on a foldout desktop a plastic bag containing sandovals effects rosalie opened the bag cautiously and made chris put on a pair of throwaway surgical gloves before he touched the contents in case of fingerprints or i dont know what she seemed to be having second thoughts chris pulled out sandovals wallet charred and the items that had been salvaged from it his cash card melted beyond utility an id disc with his digital bona fides also charred but bearing the legible name adam w sandoval his pilots license a photograph of a middleaged woman with a wide pleasant smile the photo threequarters intact a receipt from a pottery barn in flint creek colorado and coupon for a tendollar discount at home and garden six months past its expiration date if mr sandoval was a terrorist marguerite thought he was definitely the domestic variety please be careful rosalie said her cheeks flushed the items gleaned from his burned backpack were even more sparse chris handled them quickly a fragment of a smartbook a blackened plastic pen and a handful of loose partial pages from a print magazine chris said has anyone else seen this material only dr goldhar i thought maybe we should call ray scutter or someone in administration and tell them about it dr goldhar said not to he said it wasnt worth worrying ray about all this dr goldhar is a wise man chris said rosalie checked the corridor again looking guiltier by the minute chris kept his back to her she didnt see but marguerite did when chris picked up one of the magazine pages and slipped it under his jacket she wasnt sure chris knew she had seen him take the page and she didnt mention it during the drive back what he had done was probably some sort of crime did that make her an accomplice he didnt say much in the car but she was sure his intent had been journalistic not criminal all he had taken after all was a scrap of singed paper several times she got up enough nerve to ask him about it several times she refrained the sun had set and it was almost dinnertime when they reached the house chris had promised to cook tonight he was an enthusiastic if not especially talented cook his stirfries were a mixed blessing and he complained that the siege rations didnt include lemongrass or coriander but theres a car in the driveway chris said she recognized it instantly the car was obscure in the wintery dusk black against the asphalt and the shadow of the willow but she knew at once it was rays eighteen stay in the car she told chris let me talk him out im not sure thats a good idea i lived with him for five years i know the drill marguerite he crossed a line he came to your house unless you gave him a key he broke in he must have used tessas key maybe shes with him the point is when people go this far beyond the boundaries it starts to get serious you could get hurt you dont know him just give me a few minutes all right if i need you ill scream not funny she told herself chris obviously didnt find it funny either she put her hand on his knee five minutes okay youre telling me to sit in the car sit in the car walk around the block anything you want but itll be easier to get rid of him if youre not there putting his back up she didnt wait for him to answer she climbed out of the car and walked resolutely to the front door of her home more angry than frightened fucking ray chris didnt understand how ray operated ray wasnt there to beat her up ray had always aimed at humiliation by other means inside the living room lights were blazing she called out tessas name if ray had brought tess there might be some excuse for this but tess didnt answer neither did ray fuming she checked the kitchen the dining room empty he must be upstairs then lights were burning in every room in the house she found him in her office in the spare bedroom ray sat in her swivel chair shoes on her desk watching the subject cross a waterless graben under a noonday sun he looked up casually when she cleared her throat ah he said here you are in the diffuse light of the wall screen ray looked like a chinless napoleon ridiculously imperial ray she said levelly is tess in the house certainly not thats what we need to talk about tessas been telling me about some of the things that go on here dont start i really really dont want to hear it just leave ray this isnt your house and you have no right to be here before we start talking about rights are you aware that your daughter was left in the snow for almost an hour while your boyfriend played hero last week shes lucky she doesnt have frostbite we can talk about this some other time go raymond come on marguerite just drop the bullshit about my house my rights we both know youve been systematically ignoring tess we both know shes having serious psychological problems as a result of that i wont discuss this im not here to fucking discuss it im here to tell you how its going to be i cant in good conscience continue to allow my daughter to visit with you if youre not willing to provide her with appropriate care ray we have an agreement we have a tentative agreement written under radically different circumstances if i could take it to court believe me i would thats not possible because of the lockdown so i have to do what i think is right you cant just keep her marguerite said but what if he tried what if he refused to let tess come home there was no family court in blind lake no real police she could call on for help dont dictate to me tess is in my care and i have to make the decisions i think are best for her it was his smug oily certainty that infuriated her ray had mastered the art of speaking as if he were the only adult on the planet and everyone else was weak stupid or insolent under that brittle exterior of course was the narcissistic infant determined to have his own way neither aspect of his personality was particularly appealing look she said this is ridiculous whatevers wrong with tess you cant make it better by coming here and insulting me i have no interest in your opinion on the subject without thinking marguerite took two steps forward and slapped him she had never done that before her open palm hurt immediately and even this brief physical contact the coarseness of a days growth of beard his flabby jowls made her want to wash her aching hand bad move she thought very bad move but she couldnt help taking a certain pride in rays astonishment when she was little marguerite used to hang out with a neighborhood boy whose family owned a gentle and longsuffering springer spaniel the boy his name had also been raymond coincidentally had once spent an hour trying to ride that dog like a horse laughing at the poor animals yelps until the dog had finally turned on him and taken a bite out of his righthand thumb the boy had looked the way ray did now astonished and tearful for a second she wondered whether ray would start to cry but his face reformed on its familiar lines he stood up oh shit marguerite thought oh shit oh shit she backed into the hallway ray put his hands on her shoulders and shoved her against the wall now it was her turn to be surprised you really dont get it do you in the words of the song marguerite youre not in kansas anymore a movie not a song one of tessas favorites ray of course didnt know that he pinched her chin between his thumb and forefinger i shouldnt have to tell you how far we all are from that pedestrian little world of divorce counselors and social workers you imagine youre still living in why do you think the lake is under a quarantine you quarantine a place because of sickness marguerite its that simple a contagious deadly sickness were alive on sufferance and how much longer is that sufferance going to last it could end at any time ray put his face close to hers his breath smelled like acetone she tried to turn away but he wouldnt let her we could all be dead in a month we could be dead tomorrow given that why should i let you ignore tess in favor of that freakish thing on the screen or worse your new boyfriend what are you talking about moving her jaw against the pressure of his fingers because he sounded like he knew something like he had a secret ray had always enjoyed knowing something marguerite didnt almost as much as he hated being wrong he gave her a last almost perfunctory shove her shoulders connected again with the plaster wall then stepped back you are so fucking naive he said what ray didnt see was the large form of chris carmody lumbering down the hallway from the stairs marguerite caught sight of him but glanced away quickly so as not to let ray catch on let it happen for a big man chris made very little noise chris put himself between her and ray and pushed a very startled ray back against the opposite wall not gently marguerite was terrified there was real male violence in the air an actual smell a lockerroom funk but she was secretly pleased to see rays venomous expression morph back to an incredulous oh she had wanted to see that look on him for many dry years it was intoxicating did you ray stammered when he had sized up the situation did you just put your fucking hands on me i dont know chris said did you just commit a breakandenter now theyll fight marguerite thought or one of them will back down ray made a good show of it he puffed up like a bantam rooster mind your own fucking business but he was talking not fighting i dont have to go through you to deal with my wife do you know who i am come on ray chris said calmly take it outside all right here was something she hadnt seen from chris before anger real anger not rays pissandvinegar facemaking he looked like a man preparing to perform some unpleasant task with his fists she reached out and put a hand on his arm chris ray seized the opportunity as she had suspected he might he stepped back held up his hands and began a very raylike backdown oh please i dont want to play macho games i said what i came to say he turned his back and walked away a little shaky in the knees she thought when he was gone after she had watched from tessas bedroom window to make sure he drove away in his ugly little black car what marguerite felt was not anger or fear but embarrassment as if chris had been witness to some shameful part of her life i didnt mean for you to see that i got tired of waiting i mean thank you but you dont have to thank me and you dont have to apologize she nodded her pulse was still racing come on down to the kitchen she said because it was going to be one of those long sleepless adrenalinecharged nights maybe this was a habit she had picked up from her father but where do you a spend a night like that except in the kitchen making tea and toast and trying to put your life back in some sort of order ray had said some disturbing things there was a lot here to think about and she didnt want to further embarrass herself by breaking down in front of chris so she led chris to the kitchen and sat him down while she put on the kettle chris himself was subdued in fact he looked a little mournful he said was it always like that you and ray not so bad not always and especially not at first how to explain that what she had mistaken for love had turned so quickly into loathing her hand still ached where she had slapped him rays a pretty good actor he can be charming when he wants to i imagine the strain wears on him she smiled apparently did you hear much of what he said upstairs chris shook his head he said he wont give tess back think he means it ordinarily id say no but ordinarily he wouldnt even make the threat ordinarily he wouldnt have come here back in the real world ray was pretty good about respecting legal limits if only because he didnt want to leave himself vulnerable upstairs he was talking like somebody with nothing to lose he was talking about the quarantine he said we could all be dead in a week you think he knows something either he knows something or he wants me to believe he does all i can say is he wouldnt be dicking around with our custodial arrangements if he thought id have legal recourse i mean ever chris was silent for a while mulling that one over the kettle whistled marguerite focused on making the tea this calming ritual two tea bags a dollop of milk for her cup none for chris i guess i never really let myself think about that she said i want to believe that one day soon theyll open the gates and restore the data links and somebody in a uniform will apologize to us all and thank us for our patience and beg us not to sue but i guess it could end another way another deadly way and of course at any time why would they do that to us chris theres nothing dangerous here nothings changed since the day before the lockdown what are they afraid of he smiled humorlessly the joke what joke theres an old comedy routine i forget where i saw it its world war two and the brits come up with the ultimate weapon a joke so funny you die laughing if you hear it the joke is translated wordbyword into phonetic german guys on the front lines are yelling it through bullhorns and the nazi troops drop dead in the trenches okay so its the original information virus an idea or an image capable of driving someone mad maybe thats what the world is afraid of thats a dumb idea and it was retired during the congressional hearings a decade ago but suppose it happened at crossbank or something happened there that looked like it crossbank isnt looking at the same planet even if they found something potentially dangerous how would it affect us it wouldnt unless the problem arose in the obecs thats all we really have in common with crossbank the hardware okay but thats still ridiculously conjectural theres no evidence anything bad happened at crossbank marguerite had forgotten about the partial magazine page chris had stolen from the clinic he took it out of his jacket pocket and put it on the kitchen table there is now he said nineteen tess watched television while her father was out blind lake tv was still running through its store of previously downloaded entertainment mostly old movies and network serials tonight they showed an anglohindi musical with lots of dancing and colorful costumes but tess had a hard time paying attention she knew her father was acting strangely he had asked her all kinds of questions about the plane crash and chris the only surprising thing was that he had not once mentioned mirror girl nor had tess mentioned her tess knew better than to raise that subject with him back at crossbank when her parents were together they had fought over mirror girl more than once her father blamed her mother for mirror girls appearances tess couldnt see how that was supposed to work her mother and mirror girl had nothing in common but she had learned not to say anything intervening in those fights did no good and usually just made her or her mother cry her father didnt like hearing about mirror girl lately he didnt like hearing about her mother or chris either he spent most evenings in the kitchen talking to himself tess ran her own bath those nights she put herself to bed and read a book until she could sleep tonight she was alone in the house tess had made popcorn in the kitchen cleaned up carefully afterward and tried to watch the movie bombay destination it was called the dancing was good but she felt the pressure of mirror girls curiosity behind her eyes its only dancing she said scornfully but it was unsettling to hear herself talk out loud when there was nobody home the sound echoed off the walls her fathers house seemed too large in his absence too unnaturally neat like a model of a house put together for showingoff not living in tess walked restlessly from room to room turning on lights the light made her feel better even though she was certain her father would bawl her out for wasting energy he didnt though when he got home he hardly spoke to her just told her to get ready for bed and then went to the kitchen and made some calls upstairs after her bath she could still hear his voice down there talking talking talking talking to the phone talking to the air tess put on her nightgown and took her book to bed but the words on the page evaded her attention eventually she just turned off the light and lay there looking out the window her bedroom window at her fathers house looked south across the main gate and the prairie but when she was lying down all she could see was the sky she had closed her door to make sure no light reflected from the windowpane turning it into a mirror the sky was clear tonight and there was no moon she could see the stars her mother talked often about the stars it seemed to tess that her mother was someone who had fallen in love with the stars tess understood that the stars she saw at night were simply other suns very far away and that those other suns often had planets around them some stars had strange evocative names like rigel or sirius but more often had numbers and letters like uma like something you might order from a catalog you couldnt give a special name to every star because there were more stars than you could see with the naked eye billions more not every star had planets and only a few had planets anything like earth even so there might be lots of earthlike planets these thoughts interested mirror girl intensely but tess ignored her wordless presence mirror girl was with her so often now that she threatened to become what dr leinster had always claimed she was a part of tessa herself maybe mirror girl was the wrong name for her mirror girl had indeed first appeared in mirrors but tess thought that was because mirror girl simply liked to see tessas reflection there liked to look and see the looker looking back reflections symmetry that was mirror girls turf things that were reflected or folded or even just very complicated mirror girl felt a kinship with these things a kind of recognition now mirror girl looked through tessas eyes and saw stars in the cold dark night outside the house tess thought should we really call it starlight wasnt it really sunlight someone elses sunlight she fell asleep listening to the distant murmur of her fathers voice her father was subdued in the morning not that he was ever talkative before morning coffee he fixed breakfast for tess hot oatmeal there was no brown sugar to put on it only regular white sugar she waited to see if he would eat something too he didnt although he twice rummaged through the kitchen cupboards as if he were looking for something he had lost he dropped her off early at school the doors werent open yet and the morning air was frigidly cold tess spotted edie jerundt hanging out by the tetherball pole edie jerundt greeted her neutrally and said i have two sweaters on under my winter jacket tess nodded politely though she didnt care how many sweaters edie jerundt happened to be wearing edie looked cold despite her multiple sweaters her nose was red and her eyes were shiny from the sting of the wind a couple of older boys passed and made some remarks about edie grunt and tess the mess tess ignored them but edie didnt know any better than to gape like a fish and they laughed at her as they walked away mirror girl was intensely curious about this behavior she couldnt tell one person from another and didnt understand why anyone would make fun of tess or edie but tess couldnt explain the cruelty of boys was a fact to be accepted and dealt with not analyzed tess was sure she wouldnt have behaved the same way in their place though she was sometimes tempted to join in when the other girls made fun of edie if only to exempt herself from their attention she gave in to this temptation only rarely and was always ashamed of herself afterward did you see the movie last night edie asked one thing that made the lockdown so strange was that there was only one video channel now and everybody had to watch the same shows some of it tess allowed i really liked it i want to download the songs sometime edie put her hands at her sides and wagged her body in what she imagined was a hindi dance style tess could hear the boys snickering from yards away i wish i had ankle bracelets edie confided tess thought edie jerundt in ankle bracelets would look like a frog in a wedding dress but that was a mean thought and she didnt say it mirror girl was bothering her again mirror girl wanted her to look at the distant cooling towers of eyeball alley but what was so interesting about that tess edie said are you even listening to me sorry tess said automatically god youre so weird edie said all that morning tessas attention was drawn to the towers she could see them from the window of the classroom off across the snowbound empty fields crows swirled through the sky they lived here even in winter lately they had multiplied or so it seemed to tess perhaps because they were fattening on the garbage tip west of town but they didnt perch on the tall tapered cooling towers the cooling towers were there to conduct away excess heat from the eye down below parts of the eye needed to be kept very cold almost as cold as it was possible to be what mr fleischer had once called near absolute zero tess rolled that phrase around in her mind absolute zero it made her think of a bitter windless night one of those nights so still and cold your boots squeaked against the snow absolute zero made it easier to see the stars mirror girl found these thoughts intensely interesting mr fleischer called on her a couple of times tess was able to answer his science question it was isaac newton who had discovered the laws of motion but later during english she heard nothing of the question itself only her name as mr fleischer called it out anyone tessa they had been reading david copperfield tess had finished reading the book last week she tried to imagine what mr fleischer might have asked but her mind was a blank she stared at the top of her desk hoping hed call on someone else the seconds ticked by uneasily and tess felt the weight of mr fleischers disappointment she wrapped a curl of hair around her forefinger annoyingly edie jerundt was waving her hand in the air edie mr fleischer said at last the industrial revolution edie said triumphantly right it was called the industrial revolution tess returned her attention to the window at the end of the morning she told mr fleischer she was going home for lunch he looked surprised thats a bit of a hike isnt it tess yes but she had hoped mr fleischer didnt know that my dad is picking me up a complete and total lie she was surprised at how easily it came out of her mouth special occasion tess shrugged once she was outside wrapped in her winter jacket but lacking edies two sweaters she realized she wasnt going home and that she wouldnt be back for the afterlunch session of school mirror girl had brought her here and mirror girl had her own plans for the afternoon since the end of the sandstorm crisis the eye had performed smoothly and without the slightest glitch it was almost unnerving charlie grogan thought he had walked through control once this morning and everyone had been relaxed as much as anyone could relax since the beginning of the lockdown people actually smiled volts and amps were in the safe zone temperature was stable all the data was squeaky clean and even the landscape through which the subject continued to trudge seemed sunlit and more or less amicable charlie feeling useless in his office watched his monitor for a while subject was visibly worn his integument was dull and pitted his yellow coxcomb drooped like a tattered flag but he walked steadily and with apparent determination through the roadless wilderness the land was flat and desolate but there was an irregularity on the forward horizon mountain peaks a glint of highaltitude snow the subject made slow progress sort of like a snail on an empty sidewalk bored and without any maintenance duties for once charlie skipped lunch and wandered down to the glasswalled gallery above the obec platens the gallery was mainly for show it was a place you could bring a visiting congressman or european head of state back before the siege the gallery overlooked the platens from a secure height absent tourists the gallery was usually empty charlie often came here to be alone he leaned into the inchthick inner glass wall and gazed down three stories to the obec platens those humbling objects thinking themselves into interstellar space you werent supposed to say so but they did think that was undeniable even if like the theorists you insisted they merely explored a finite but immense quantum phasespace of exponentially increasing complexity yeah merely that the obecs pulled images out of the stars and dreamed them onto a grid of pixels by exploring quantum phasespace word salad charlie thought show me the wires what was it actually grabbing and how nobody could say what is an angel that which dances on the head of a pin what dances on the head of a pin an angel of course these obecs were only the most central part of the vast machine that supported them all told the eye occupied an immense amount of square footage standing here in the middle of it charlie imagined he could feel the cold ferocity of its thoughts he closed his eyes dream me an explanation but the only thing he could see behind his eyelids was a memory of the subject the subject lost in the hinterlands of his dry old planet funny how clear the daydream seemed invested with a clarity at least as vivid as the direct feed on his office monitor as if he were walking in the subjects footsteps the sunlight was warm and a shade or two bluer than earthly sunlight but the sky itself was white charged with dust a gentle wind kicked up miniature whirlwinds that traveled yards across these alkalistained flats before they sighed out of existence strange charlie leaned into the glass wall and imagined himself reaching out to the subject surely even the obecs had never translated an image as distilled as supernaturally pure as this he could if he chose count every bump on the subjects pebbled skin he could hear the metronomic steps of the subjects dusty elephantine feet and he could see the trail the subject left behind him two punctuated parallel lines scribed into the granular material of the desert floor he could smell the air it smelled like hot rock like micaladen granite exposed to the noonday sun he imagined putting his hand on the subjects shoulder or at least that sloping bit of gristle behind the subjects head that passed for a shoulder how would it feel not leathery but hard charlie thought each gooseflesh bump like a buried knuckle some of them prickly with stiff white hairs subjects coxcomb flush with blood most likely served to adjust his core temperature to the heat and if i touched it charlie thought it would feel moist and flexible like cactus flesh subject stopped abruptly and turned as if startled charlie found himself gazing into the subjects blank white billiardball eyes and thought oh shit he opened his own eyes wide and reeled back from the glass here in the obec gallery home safe he blinked away what could only have been a dream are you all right startled a second time charlie turned and saw a young girl standing behind him she wore a winter jacket haphazardly buttoned one side of the collar poking up past her chin she twirled a strand of her curly dark hair around her finger she looked familiar he said arent you marguerite hausers daughter the girl frowned then nodded charlies first impulse was to call security but the girl tess he recalled was her name seemed timid and he was reluctant to frighten her instead he asked is your mom or dad here she shook her head no no who let you in nobody do you have a pass card no didnt the guards stop you i came in when no one was looking thats some trick in fact it should have been impossible but here she was goggleeyed and obviously unsure of herself are you looking for someone not really what brings you here then tess i wanted to see it she gestured at the obec array for a long moment he was afraid she would ask him how it worked you know charlie said youre really not supposed to be wandering around all by yourself how about you come to my office and ill give your mom a call my mom yeah your mom the girl appeared to think it over okay she said tess sat in his office looking at some glossy brochures he scared up for her while he buzzed marguerites pocket server she was obviously surprised to hear from him and her first question was about the subject had something interesting happened depends how you look at it charlie thought he couldnt shake that dream of the subject from his mind eyeball to eyeball it had seemed ridiculously real but he didnt tell her about that i dont want to worry you marguerite but your daughters here tess here here where at the eye shes supposed to be in school whats she doing out there shes not actually doing much of anything but she did manage to sneak past the guards and wander down to the obec gallery youre kidding me wish i was how is that possible good question so is she in big trouble charlie shes here in my office and i dont see the need to make a big deal out of this but you might want to drive out and pick her up give me ten minutes marguerite said tess was unresponsive while charlie walked her out to the parking lot she didnt seem to want to talk and she certainly didnt seem to want to talk about how she had gotten into the complex before long her mom zoomed into the visitor lot and tess climbed gratefully into the rear seat of the car do we need to talk about this marguerite asked maybe later charlie said on his way back to his office he took a highpriority call from tabby menkowitz in security hey charlie she said hows boomer these days an old hound but healthy whats up tab well i got a big alert on my nonrecognition software when i checked the cameras there you were escorting a little kid out of the building shes a team leaders kid playing hooky and curious about the alley whatd you do smuggle her in in a rucksack because we caught her when she was leaving but not when she arrived yeah well i wondered about that myself she said she just sneaked in when nobody was looking we have full coverage on our security cameras charlie theyre always looking i guess its a mystery then we dont have to panic over it do we its not like anybodys leaving town but id really really like to know where she found a back door thats absolutely important information tabby were under siege surely this can wait until the big problems get solved this is a big problem are you asking me to just let it ride im advising you that shes an elevenyearold kid look into it by all means but lets not drag her into an official investigation you just found her down in the gallery she snuck up on me thats pretty deep charlie thats a big hole yeah i know tabby was silent for a moment charlie let the silence play out left it to her to make the next move she said you know this girl i know her mom want another datum her dad is ray scutter is there anything else you know i ask because youre the one who took her out of the building without notifying me yeah im sorry about that but it kind of took me by surprise really i dont know any more about it than you do uhhuh honest uhhuh you understand i do have to look into this yeah of course but i guess i dont have to process the paperwork right away thanks tabby you have absolutely nothing to thank me for honest ill say hi to boomer for you give him a breath mint for me that barbecue last summer he was grossing everybody out she hung up without saying goodbye alone charlie finally allowed himself to think about what had happened this afternoon to mull it over in his mind except well what the fuck had happened hed been daydreaming in the obec gallery and then the girl wandered in was he supposed to be able to tease some meaning out of that maybe hed give marguerite a call after work in the meantime he had another question he wasnt sure he wanted it answered but it would plague him like a headache if he didnt ask so he took a breath and called his friend murtaza in image acquisition the call went through at once must be quiet down there yup murtaza said smooth like silk you got time to do me a little favor maybe im on break at three wont take that long i just need you to look at the clocked image for the last hour or so especially around he estimated say between twelve fortyfive and one look at it for what any unusual behavior youre out of luck hes just walking over the landscape its like watching paint dry something small something gestural could you be more specific sorry no okay well easy enough charlie waited while murtaza defined the time segment and ran a lookfind app zipping through the afternoons stored imagery the scan took less than a minute nothing murtaza said told you so that was a relief youre sure today my friend the subject is as predictable as clockwork he didnt even stop to take a leak thanks charlie said feeling a little idiotic absolutely nothing just a little blip at ten to one he kind of paused and looked over his shoulder at nothing thats it oh what is that what you were looking for just a passing notion sorry to have bothered you no problem maybe this weekend we can go for a beer yes sure get some sleep charlie you sound worried yeah he thought i am twenty chris had spent most of the night consoling marguerite the fragmentary magazine page confirmed nothing but hinted at great danger and marguerite anxious cycled back repeatedly to the subject of tess tess threatened by ray tess threatened by the world he had run out of things to say to her she had fallen asleep toward dawn chris paced through the house aimlessly he knew this feeling altogether too well the doublebarreled blast of dread and wakefulness that came with the morning sunlight like a bad amphetamine rush he settled down at last in the kitchen blinds open to the cobaltblue sky suburbanstyle row houses lit up in the efflorescence of dawn like tattered candy boxes he wished he had something to take the edge off one of those anodynes that had once passed so easily into his hands some soothing and euphoriant chemical or even a homely little joint was he afraid what was he afraid of not ray not the obecs maybe not even his own death he was afraid of what marguerite had given him her trust there are men chris thought who shouldnt be asked to handle fragile things we drop them he called elaine coster as soon as the sun was decently up he told her about the clinic the comatose pilot the charred page she suggested a meeting at sawyers at ten chris said ill call sebastian you really want to get that charlatan involved hes been helpful so far suit yourself elaine said he woke marguerite before he left the house he told her where he was going and he put on a pot of coffee for her she sat in the kitchen in her nightgown looking desolate i cant stop thinking about tess do you think ray really means to keep her i dont know what ray might or might not do the most immediate question is whether shes endangered by him whether he might hurt her you mean no i dont think so at least not directly not physically ray is a complicated man and hes a naturalborn sonofabitch but hes not a monster he loves tess in his own way shes supposed to come back friday it might be better to wait till then see what he does when hes had a chance to cool off if he insists on keeping her we can take steps then if something bad happens to the lake i want her with me it hasnt come to that yet but marguerite even if tess isnt in danger it doesnt mean youre safe when ray came to the house that made him a stalker hes on a downhill slope how smart are your locks she shrugged not very i guess i can generate a new key but then tess wont be able to get in without me generate a new key and get tessas card updated even if you have to go to her school to do it and dont get careless keep the door locked when youre alone and dont answer the door without checking make sure you have your pocket server handy in an emergency call me or elaine or even the security guy whatshisname shulgin dont try to handle it yourself you sound like youve been through this before he left without answering chris staked out an isolated booth at sawyers away from the window the restaurant wasnt crowded the shortorder cook and a couple of waitresses were showing up chris had surmised largely out of habit menu selections were down to sandwiches ham cheese or hamandcheese elaine arrived simultaneously with sebastian vogel and sue sampel all three of them looked at chris apprehensively as they sat down as soon as the waitress had taken their orders chris put the charred plasticcovered magazine page on the tabletop wow sue said you actually stole this we dont use that word elaine told her chris has an unnamed highlevel source look at it chris said take your time draw conclusions only about a quarter of the printed page was legible the rest of it was charred beyond interpretation and even the legible extreme right quadrant was discolored and brown still decipherable was a fraction of a headline ossbank still unknown secdef says and under it the righthand fragments of a column of type elaine said whats on the other side a car ad and a date she flipped the page over jesus this is nearly two months old yeah the pilot was carrying this with him yeah and hes still unconscious i called the clinic this morning no change who else knows about this marguerite you guys okay so lets keep it at that for now people the waitress brought coffee chris covered the page with a dessert menu elaine said youve had a while to think about this what do you make of it obviously theres some kind of ongoing crisis at crossbank not much clue as to what it might be something big enough to involve the infantry and maybe close down highways what did it say east of the mississippi we have the word plague in quotes and what looks like a denial from the centers for disease control which could mean anything elaine said either way we have deaths reported or possibly no deaths reported we have some cryptic stuff about coral starfish a pilgrim a statement apparently attributed to ed baum the presidents science advisor the event was big enough to warrant major news coverage and policy statements from federal agencies but not big enough to drive advertisers out of the magazine that ad could have been bought and paid for six months earlier proves nothing sebastian chris said sue any thoughts they both looked solemn sebastian said im intrigued by the use of the word spiritual elaine rolled her eyes you would be go on chris prompted sebastian frowned his pursed mouth almost disappearing under his enormous beard the siege had left him looking more gnomelike than ever chris thought he had somehow contrived to gain weight his cheeks were berryred spiritual redemption what kind of disaster generates even the illusion of redemption or attracts a pilgrim bullshit elaine said you can attract pilgrims by announcing you saw a portrait of the virgin mary in a dirty bedsheet people are credulous sebastian they must be or you wouldnt have written a bestseller oh i dont think what we have here is the second coming though perhaps some people have mistaken it for that it does imply something strange though dont you think something ambiguous strange and ambiguous wow great insight chris put the magazine page back in his jacket pocket he let them talk it through for a few minutes elaine was obviously frustrated to have only half an explanation in front of her sebastian seemed more intrigued than frightened and sue clung to his left arm in chastened silence so maybe the critics are right elaine said something happened to the obecs at crossbank so we need to think about shutting down the eye maybe chris said he had run through this scenario with marguerite last night but if the folks on the outside wanted us shut down they could have cut the power months ago maybe they did that at crossbank and it only made things worse maybe maybe maybe fucking maybe what we need is more information she directed a meaningful look at sue sue picked at her sandwich as if she hadnt heard good girl sebastian told her never volunteer sue sampel with what chris thought was a remarkable display of dignity swallowed the last bite of ham and cheese and took a sip of coffee then she cleared her throat you want to know what ray found when he raided the executive servers im sorry but i havent been able to find out rays paranoia has ramped up lately all the support staff have to carry clocked keys now we cant come in early or stay late without a security waiver most of the offices have video surveillance and its not just casual so what do you know elaine asked only what i happen to see now and then dimi shulgin showed up with a package of printouts probably hard copies of whatever mail from crossbank happened to be sitting in the caches before the shutdown rays been extremely nervous since he saw that as for the contents i havent been able to get anywhere near them and if ray ever really meant to make all this stuff public apparently hes changed his mind rays not just nervous chris thought hes scared his veneer of reasonability is flaking away like paint on a barn door so were fucked elaine said not necessarily i might be able to get something for you but ill need help sue could do a pretty convincing impersonation of an airhead but the fact was chris thought she wasnt stupid stupid people didnt land jobs at blind lake even as support staff if the printouts were still in rays office sue said she could just maybe and with a little luck find them and scan them into her personal server she could let herself into rays office on a pretext and use her passkey to get into his desk but she needed at least half an hour uninterrupted what about the surveillance thats where we benefit from rays paranoia cameras are optional in executive suites rays had his turned off since last summer i guess he didnt want anyone to see him eating his dingdongs dingdongs sue waved off the question security will see me go in and out of his office but if i keep away from the connecting door thats all theyll see and im in and out of there all the time anyhow ray knows somebody has a key to his desk but he doesnt know its me and if this works he wont even know i scanned the documents youre absolutely sure he keeps hard copies in his office not absolutely no but id bet on it the question is how to get ray and his buddies out of the way while i do this im guessing you have a plan elaine said sue looked pleased weekdays are impossible i can get in there on weekends during daylight hours without arousing suspicion but ray often drops in on weekends too and shulgin has been hanging around lately so i looked at rays calendar this saturday hes doing the community center lecturehall thing ari weingart organized one of his big events hes got two or three speakers besides ray knowing ray hell want shulgin in the audience with him along with anybody else who might make a casual appearance ari say or any of the department heads apart from marguerite hes taking this thing seriously if i had to guess id say he wants to drum up support for shutting down the eye chris knew about the saturday debate marguerite was supposed to be one of the speakers shed written something for it though shed been extremely reluctant to appear on stage with ray ari weingart had convinced her it would be a good idea increase her visibility and maybe shore up her support with the other departments how do we come into this chris asked you dont really i just want you guys in the auditorium keeping an eye on the stage that way if ray takes off in a hurry you can give me a call sebastian shook his head this is still far too dangerous you could get in trouble she smiled indulgently i appreciate you saying that but i think im already in trouble i think we all are dont you nobody bothered to argue elaine stayed on a few minutes after sue and sebastian left business at sawyers picked up a little around lunchtime but only a little the afternoon sky outside the window was blue the air still and cold so elaine said are you up for this chris i dont know what you mean were in deeper shit than anyone wants to admit getting out of this alive might be the hardest thing any of us has ever done are you up to it he shrugged youre thinking of your girlfriend and her daughter we dont need to make it personal elaine come on chris i have eyes youre not as deep and inscrutable as you like to think when you wrote that galliano book you put on your white hat and set out to right some wrongs and you got burned for it you found out that the good guy isnt universally loved even when hes right quite the opposite very disappointing for a nice suburban boy so you wallowed in some justifiable selfpity and youre entitled why not but here comes all this lockdown bullshit plus whatever happened at crossbank not to mention marguerite and that little girl of hers i think you feel the urge to put that white hat back on your head what im saying is good nows the time dont resist it chris folded his napkin and stood up you dont know the first fucking thing about me he said twentyone after chris had left the house and before the call came from charlie grogan asking her to pick up her daughter marguerite had spent the morning with the subject despite the implied danger to blind lake and rays explicit threats there was nothing useful she could do at least not right now much would be asked of her marguerite suspected and probably very soon but not yet now she was stuck in a limbo of dread and ignorance no real work to do and no way to calm the churn of her emotions she hadnt slept but sleep was out of the question so she made herself a pot of tea and watched the subject scribbling notes for queries she would probably never submit the entire enterprise was doomed marguerite thought and so probably was the subject himself he appeared visibly weaker as the sun rose into a pale sky flecked with high clouds he had been hiking for weeks far from any traveled road with scant supplies of food and water his morning cloacal evacuations were thin and faintly green when he walked his body periodically contorted in angles that suggested pain but this morning he found both food and water he had entered the foothills of a tall range of mountains and though the land was still terribly dry he discovered an oasis where a stream of glacial water cascaded down a terrace of rocks the water pooled in a cup of granite deep and transparent as glass fanleafed succulents splayed their foliage around it subject bathed before he ate he advanced gingerly into the pool then stood under the falling stream he had accumulated a coat of dust during his journey and it discolored the water around him when he emerged from the pool his dermal integument was gleaming changed from nearwhite to a somber burntumber he swiveled his head as if scanning for predators were there predatory species in this part of his world it seemed unlikely where was the game to support a large predator but was not marguerite supposed impossible then reassured he plucked peeled and washed several of the fleshy leaves and began to devour them moist flecks fell from his mandibles and collected at his feet after he had eaten the leaves he found mossy patches on the granite near the waterfall and he licked these clean with his broad bluegray tongue then he sat patiently digesting his meal and marguerite called up the file she had been writing for tess her childrensbook story of the subjects odyssey the act of writing soothed her although the narrative was far from uptodate she had just finished a description of the sandstorm crisis and subjects awakening in the ruined city of the desert she wrote all around him in the still and windless morning were the pillars and mounds of buildings long abandoned and eroded by the seasons these structures were not like the tall conical buildings of his home city whoever had made these buildings perhaps his own ancestors had made them differently they had erected pillars like the greeks and the pillars might once have supported much greater houses or temples or places of business the pillars were hewn from black stone the gritty desert wind had polished them to a fine smoothness some stood tall but most had been worn to fractions of their original size and where they had not fallen the wind had left them listing toward the east there were the remains of other kinds of buildings too some square foundations and even a few low pyramids all of them as rounded as the rocks you find at the bottom of a stream the storm had scoured the desert floor to a level surface and now the sun cast stark shadows among the ruins subject stood in contemplation the sundial shadows grew shorter as the morning wore on then perhaps thinking of his destination subject began to walk westward once again by noon he had left the ruined city entirely and it vanished below the horizon as if utterly lost and nothing remained ahead of him but glittering sand and the ghostly blue silhouettes of distant mountains she had just keyed the period when she took charlie grogans call tess was quiet in the car as they left the alley marguerite drove slowly struggling to assemble her thoughts she had an important choice to make but first she wanted to know what had happened tess had left school and wandered over to the eye to bother charlie that much was obvious but why im sorry tess said shooting apprehensive glances at her from the passenger seat am i marguerite wondered as frightening as that judge and jury is that how she sees me you dont have to apologize marguerite said tell you what ill call mr fleischer and tell him you had an appointment but you forgot to give him the note hows that sound okay tess said cautiously waiting for the hook but im sure hes worried about you so am i how come you didnt go back for class this afternoon i dont know i just wanted to go to the eye how come i thought you didnt like it there you hated the tour back at crossbank just felt like it badly enough to skip school i guess howd you get inside mr grogan seemed a little upset over that i walked in nobody was looking that at least was probably true tess was too guileless to have bluffed her way in or found a hidden entrance in all likelihood she had just walked up to the front door and opened it charlies investigation would discover a sleepy security guard or some employee whod wandered out to smoke a joint did you find what you were looking for i wasnt really looking for anything learn anything tess shrugged because you know thats pretty unusual behavior for you you never skipped school before it was important important how tess no answer only a teary frown was it because of mirror girl tessas unhappy expression condensed into misery yes she told you to go there she never tells me anything she just wanted to go so i went well what was mirror girl looking for i dont know i think she just wanted to see if she could see her reflection her reflection her reflection where in the eye tess said a mirror at the eye it isnt that kind of telescope theres no real mirror not in a mirror in the eye marguerite didnt know how to proceed how to ask the next question she was afraid of tessas answers they sounded crazy crazy the forbidden word the unspeakable thought she hated all this talk of mirror girl because it sounded crazy and marguerite didnt think she could bear that almost anything else an injury a disease she could imagine tess in leg braces or with her arm in a sling she knew how to console her when she was hurt that was well within the range of her mothering skills but please she thought not craziness not the kind of refractory madness that excludes all comfort or communication marguerite had worked nights at a psychiatric hospital during college she had seen incurable schizophrenics crazy people lived in their own nightmarish vr more alone than physical isolation could ever make them she refused to imagine tess as one of those people she pulled into the school parking lot but asked tess to sit for a minute with her death and madness could she really protect her daughter from either of those things i cant even protect her from ray ray had threatened to keep tess with him to take physical custody of her in effect to kidnap her but shes with me now marguerite thought and if i had a choice id take her away from here drive her down the road to constance and from there away away anywhere away from the quarantine and the distressing rumors chris had brought home away from eyeball alley and away from mirror girl but she couldnt do that she had to send tess back to school and from school tess would go home to ray and the increasingly fragile illusion of normality if i keep her with me marguerite thought then ill be the one violating the letter of our agreement and ray will send his security people to get her but if i let her go back to him and something happens can i get out now tess asked marguerite took a deep calming breath i guess so she said back to school with you no more expeditions during class though all right all right promise me promise she put her hand on the door handle one more thing marguerite said listen to me listen this is important tess if anything strange happens at dads you call me doesnt matter what time of day or night you dont even have to think about it just call me because im looking out for you even when youre not with me is chris looking out for me too surprised marguerite said sure he is chris too okay tess said and she opened the door and scooted out of the car marguerite watched her daughter cross the desolate parking lot scuffling through whirls of old snow her jacket still crossbuttoned and her winter hat clasped in her small gloved hands ill see her again marguerite told herself i will i must then tess vanished through the front door of the school and the afternoon was still and empty twentytwo sue sampel woke up nervous it was saturday morning and today she was supposed to perform the small act of information theft she had so rashly promised earlier in the week her hand shook when she brushed her teeth and her reflection in the mirror was the perfect image of a terrified middleaged woman she let sebastian sleep another hour while she made herself coffee and toast sebastian was one of those people who could sleep through storms or earthquakes while a noisy sparrow was enough to bring sue to groggy unwelcome consciousness sebastians book was on the kitchen table and sue leafed through it for distraction she had read it all the way through weeks ago and had lately taken a second run at it trying to absorb ideas that had slipped past her the first time god the quantum vacuum a weighty title like a couple of sumo wrestlers balanced on an ampersand but the book had not been sappy or superficial in fact it had taxed her to the limits of her bachelor of science degree fortunately sebastian was pretty good at explaining difficult concepts and she had been privileged to have the author handy when she got stuck on something the book was not overtly religious nor was it a work of rigorous science sebastian himself called it speculative philosophy once he had described it as a bull session writ large very large that sue supposed was modesty speaking the book was full of arcane scientific history and evolutionary lore and quantum physics heady material for a college religion prof whose previous published works had included such torrid bodicerippers as errors of attribution in firstcentury pauline texts basically his argument was that human beings had achieved their current state of consciousness by appropriating a small piece of a universal intelligence tapping into god in other words this definition of god he argued could be stretched to fit definitions of deity across a spectrum of cultures and beliefs was god omnipresent and omniscient yes because he permeated all of creation was he singular or multiple both he was omnipresent because he was inherent in the physical processes of the universe but his mind was knowable by human beings only in discrete and often dissimilar fragments was there life after death or perhaps reincarnation in the most literal sense no but because our sentience was borrowed it lived on without our bodies albeit as a tiny piece of something almost infinitely larger sue understood what he was getting at he wanted to give people the consolation of religion without the baggage of dogmatism he was pretty casual about his science and that pissed off people like elaine coster but his heart was in the right place he wanted a religion that could plausibly comfort widows and orphans without committing them to patriarchy intolerance fundamentalism or weird dietary laws he wanted a religion that wasnt in a perpetual fistfight with modern cosmology not such a bad thing to want sue thought but wheres my consolation consolation for the petty thief the larcenous officeworker forgive me for i know exactly what i do and im of two minds about it assuming any of that mattered assuming they werent all doomed she had read the magazine fragment at sawyers and she had drawn her own conclusions sebastian came downstairs freshly showered and dressed in his casual finest blue jeans and a green knit sweater that looked like something an english vicar might have thrown away todays the heist sue said how do you feel scared you know you dont have to do this it was good of you to volunteer but nobody will say anything if you change your mind nobody except elaine well maybe elaine but seriously seriously its okay just promise me one thing what when youre at that town hall meeting i mean i know the others are looking out for me theyll call if ray takes off for the plaza but the only one i really trust is you he nodded owleyed and ridiculously solemn i need at least five minutes warning if ray is on his way youll have it sebastian said promise promise the morning crept past too quickly the town hall meeting started at one and she asked sebastian to drive so he could drop her off inconspicuously outside hubble plaza they didnt talk much in the car she gave him a quick kiss when he stopped then she stepped out into the cold air carded herself into the plazas main entrance waved hello to the lobby guard and walked without obviously hurrying to the elevators her footsteps resounded in the tiled lobby like the tick of a metronome allegro in time with the beat of her heart marguerite arrived at the community center auditorium at and when she spotted ari weingart looking for her in the lobby crowd she turned to chris and said oh god this is a mistake the lecture not the lecture going on stage with ray having to look at him having to listen to him i wish i could oh hi ari ari took a firm grip on her arm this way marguerite youre up first did i mention that then ray then lisa shapiro from geology and climatology then we throw it open for audience questions she took a last look back at chris who shrugged and gave her what she guessed was a supportive smile really she thought trailing ari through a staffonly door into the backstage dimness this is crazy not just because she would be forced to appear with ray but because it would be a charade for both of them both pretending they hadnt seen clues about the crossbank disaster whatever it was both pretending there had never been a confrontation over tess pretending they didnt despise each other pretending not to civility but at least to indifference knowing it could end at any time this is a prescription for disaster marguerite thought not only that but her lecture was a series of notes she had made for herself and never really planned to reveal speculation about the uma project that verged on the heretical but if the crisis was as bad as potentially deadly as it seemed why waste time on insincerity why not for once in her life stop calculating career goals and simply say what she thought it had seemed like a good idea at least until she found herself onstage behind a closed curtain with lisa shapiro sitting between her and her exhusband she avoided his eyes but couldnt shake a claustrophobic awareness of his presence he was impeccably dressed she had noticed on the way in suit and tie creases razorsharp a little pursed smile on his face accentuated by his jowls and his receding chin like a man who smelled something unpleasant but was trying to be polite about it a sheaf of paper in his hands to the left of her there was a podium and ari stood there now signaling for someone to raise the curtain already marguerite checked her watch one on the dot her mouth was dry the auditorium accommodated an audience of two thousand ari had told her they had admitted roughly half that number a mixture of working scientists support staff and casual labor ari had arranged four of these events since the beginning of the quarantine and they had all been wellattended and wellreceived there was even a guy with a camera doing live video for blind lake tv how civilized we are in our cage marguerite thought how easily we distract ourselves from the knowledge of the bodies outside the gates now the curtain was drawn the stage illuminated the audience a shadowy void more sensed than seen now ari was introducing her now in the strange truncation of time that always happened when she addressed an audience marguerite herself was at the podium thanking ari thanking the crowd fumbling with the cue display on her pocket server the question her voice cracked into falsetto she cleared her throat the question i want to pose today is have we been deceived by our own rigorously deconstructive approach to the observed peoples of umae that was dry enough to make the laypeople in the audience feel sleepy but she saw a couple of familiar faces from interpretation coagulate into frowns this is deliberately provocative language the observed peoples from the beginning the crossbank and blind lake projects have sought to purge themselves of anthropocentrism the tendency to invest other species with human characteristics this is the fallacy that tempts us to describe a panther cub as cute or an eagle as noble and we have been doing it ever since we learned to stand on two legs we live in an enlightened age however an age that has learned to see and to value other living things as they are not as we wish them to be and the long and creditable history of science has taught us if nothing else to look carefully before we judge to judge if we must based on what we see not what we would prefer to believe and so we tell ourselves the subjects of our study at ursa majoris should be called creatures or organisms not peoples we must presume nothing about them we must not bring to the analytical table our fears or our desires our hopes or our dreams our linquistic prejudices our bourgeois metanarratives or our cultural baggage of imagined aliens check mr spock at the door please and leave hg wells in the library if we see a city we must not call it a city or call it that only provisionally because the word city implies carthage and rome and berlin and los angeles products of human biology human ingenuity and thousands of years of accumulated human expertise we remind ourselves that the observed city may not be a city at all it may be more analogous to an anthill a termite tower or a coral reef when she paused she could hear the echo of her voice a basso resonance returning from the back of the hall in other words we try very hard not to deceive ourselves and by and large we do a good job of it the barrier between ourselves and the peoples of umae is painfully obvious anthropologists have long told us that culture is a collection of shared symbols and we share none with the subjects of our study omnis cultura ex cultura and the two cultures are as imiscible we presume as oil and water our epigenetic behaviors and theirs have no point of intersection the downside is that were forced to begin from first principles we cant talk about a chthonic architecture say since we would have to strip from that seemingly innocent word all its buttresses and beams of human intent and human esthetics without which the word architecture becomes insupportable an unstable structure nor dare we speak of chthonic art or work leisure or science the list is endless and what we are left with is simply raw behavior behavior to be scrutinized and catalogued in all its minutiae we say the subject travels here performs this or that action is relatively slow or relatively fast turns left or right eats suchandsuch at least if we dont balk at the word eats as creeping anthropocentrism maybe ingests is better it means the same thing but it looks better in the written report subject ingested a bolus of vegetable material actually he ate a plant you know it and i know it but a peer reviewer a nature would never let it pass there was some cautious laughter behind her ray snorted derisively and audibly we patrol the connotation of every word we speak with the censorious instinct of a bowdler all in the name of science and often for very good reasons but i wonder if we arent blinding ourselves at the same time what is missing from our discourse about the peoples of umae i would suggest is narrative the natives of umae are not human but we are and human beings interpret the world by constructing narratives to explain it the fact that some of our narratives are naive or wishful or simply wrong hardly invalidates the process science after all is at heart a narrative an anthropologist or an army of anthropologists may pore over fragments of bone and catalog them according to a dozen or a hundred apparently trivial features but the unspoken object of all this work is a narrative a story about how human beings emerged from the other fauna on this planet a story about our origins and our ancestors or consider the periodic table the periodic table is a catalog a list of the known and possible elements arranged according to an organizing principle it looks like static knowledge exactly the kind of knowledge were accumulating about the subject and his kindred but even the periodic table implies a narrative the periodic table is a defining statement in the story of the universe the end point of a long narrative about the creation of hydrogen and helium in the big bang the forging of heavy elements in stars the relationship of electrons to atomic nuclei the nucleus and its process of decay and the quantum behavior of subatomic particles we have our place in that narrative too we are in part the result of carbon chemistry in water another narrative hidden in the periodic table and so i might add are the observed peoples of umae she paused there was a glass of ice water on the flattopped podium thank god marguerite took a sip judging by the background noise she had already ignited a few whispered arguments in the audience narratives intersect and diverge combine and recombine understanding one narrative may require the creation of another most fundamentally narrative is how we understand narrative is how we understand the universe and it is most obviously how we understand ourselves a stranger may seem inscrutable or even frightening until he offers us his story until he tells us his name tells us where he comes from and where hes going this may be true of the chthonic inhabitants of umae as well it would not surprise me if they are in their way also exchanging and creating narratives perhaps they are not perhaps they have a different way of organizing and disseminating knowledge but i promise you we will not understand them until we begin to tell ourselves stories about them she could see more faces in the audience now there was chris on the center aisle nodding encouragingly elaine coster beside him sebastian vogel next to her she assumed they had their servers in hand in case ray bolted for the plaza and down in the front row was tess listening attentively ray must have brought her marguerite aimed a smile at her daughter of course were scientists we have our own name for a tentative narrative we call it a hypothesis and we test it against observation and experimentation and of course any hypothesis we venture about the native peoples must be very very tentative it will be a first approximation an educated guess even a shot in the dark nevertheless i believe we have been far too shy about making such guesses i think this is because the questions we have to ask in order to create that narrative are extremely unsettling any sentient species we encounter and for the first time in history we have another example to compare against our own will be grounded in its biology some of its behavior in other words will be specific to its genetic history if it is truly a sentient species however some of its behavior will also be discretionary will be flexible will be innovative which is not to say it will be unfailingly rational quite the opposite perhaps and here i think is the fundamental issue we have been reluctant to confront we harbor closelyheld beliefs about ourselves a theologian might say we are a godseeking species a biologist might say we are an assembly of interrelated physiological functions capable of highly complex activity a marxist might say were players in a dialogue between history and economics a philosopher might say were the result of the appropriation by dna of the mathematics of emergent properties in semistable chaotic systems we treat these beliefs as mutually exclusive and we cleave to them according to our preferences religiously but i suspect that in the native peoples of umae we will find all of these descriptors both useful and insufficient we will have to arrive at a new definition of a sentient species and that definition must include ourselves and the natives and that i would suggest is what we have been avoiding another sip of water was she too close to the microphone from the back rows it probably sounded like she was gargling anything we say about the native peoples implies a new perspective on us we will find them comparatively more or less brave than ourselves more or less gentle more or less warlike more or less affectionate perhaps ultimately more or less sane in other words we may be forced to draw conclusions about them and consequently about ourselves which we do not like but were scientists and we arent supposed to shy away from these matters as a scientist it is my cherished belief im tempted to say my faith that understanding is better than ignorance ignorance unlike life unlike narrative is static understanding implies a forward motion thus the possibility of change this is why its so important to maintain focus on the subject as long as we can she added to herself a few months ago one might plausibly have argued that the subjects life was a rigidly repetitive routine and that we had gleaned from it all we could recent events have proven that argument wrong the subjects life which we had mistaken for a cycle has become very much a narrative a narrative we may be able to follow to its conclusion and from which we will surely learn a great deal weve already learned much weve seen for instance the ruins at an abandoned city if i may use that word apparently older than the subjects home and very different in architectural style and this too implies a narrative it implies that the architectural behavior of the native peoples is flexible that they have accumulated knowledge and put that knowledge to diverse and adaptive uses it implies in short and if any doubt remains that the native peoples are a people intellectually proximate and morally equivalent to human beings and that the best way to construct their narrative is by reference to our own even if that comparison is not always flattering to us that was her big finish her defiant thesis problem was nobody seemed sure she had finished she cleared her throat again and said thats all thank you and walked back to her chair applause welled up behind her it sounded polite if not enthusiastic ari went to the podium thanked her and introduced ray sue sampel spent twenty minutes at her desk in the anteroom of rays office looking busy for the sake of the video monitors embedded in the wall she had set aside some work to make her presence here seem plausible not that there was much in the way of real work it was a fucking joke these reports ray insisted on putting together documenting the daily trivia of blind lake site management the reports went nowhere except into a file marked pending pending what the end of the world but they would serve as an alibi if it came down to the question of what ray had been up to during the lockdown it seemed to her that ray spent a lot of time preparing to be questioned about things she kept an eye on her desktop clock at she made a show of shuffling through papers and digital files as if she had lost something and therefore would go into rays office to get it this felt ludicrously unrealistic like a high school play or a bad movie and in the movie sue thought this would be the moment somebody walked in on her probably shulgin or even ray ray with a pistol in his hand sue she bit her tongue then managed an ow that might have passed as hello it wasnt ray it was only gretchen krueger from down in archives didnt expect youd be in today gretchen said i was just on my way to pick up some backissue jaes and i saw your door open is ray here too no im just finishing up some work except i keep losing things establishing her alibi yet again when im done here im getting together at sawyers with jamal and karen want to join us youd be more than welcome thanks but all i want this afternoon is a shower and a nap i know the feeling you have a good time though gretch i will take it easy sue you look tired gretchen ambled off down the corridor and sue began to steel herself once more for the assault on rays inner office but first she pulled the door to the hallway all the way closed her hand was shaking she discovered then into rays sanctuary and out of range of the security cameras first she pulled a sheaf of files out of the cabinet against the wall any files it didnt matter as long as she had something innocuouslooking to carry out again then she went to his desk put her key in the master lock and opened all five drawers one after the other the bundle of printouts was in the bottomleft drawer where he used to keep his dingdongs before the supply ran out he had probably vacuumed the drawer for crumbs knowing ray ray must be seriously jonesing she thought he must be in acute dingdong withdrawal she picked up the first sheet ex bo xiang crossbank national laboratory to avery fishbinder blind lake national laboratory text hi ave as promised heres some headsup on the material well be presenting at this years conference sorry i cant be more explicit i know you dont want to be blindsided but weve been warned to keep this quiet until its all official the long and short is that weve found evidence of a vanished sentient culture on hrb screen shots to follow but there is a region of basaltic uplift in the northern hemisphere very shallow water and some exposed islands superficially no different from hundreds of other such swampy regions but with the remains of obviously very highly engineered structures including a specific link or at least an architectural reference to the coral floaters dotting the equator still unsure how to reconcile this with the absence of motile animals gossard suggests an ancient mass extinction for gods sake sue scolded herself dont read it she cast a furtive glance at the doorway she was alone but that could change she took her server from her pocket dialed her home node and activated the scan function the server was a pencilstyle model exactly as wide as a standard sheet of paper sue ran the photosensitive side down the document until it blipped a complete transfer then the next sheet then the next but there were lots of sheets she checked her watch it was almost two oclock she might be another twenty minutes here more calm down she told herself and scanned another printout from his aisle seat in the hall chris carmody watched ray stand up and walk to the podium chris felt it was important to get some measure of this guy there were a thousand ways he could walk into another confrontation with ray scutter if that happened he didnt want to screw it up there were a thousand ways to screw it up ray looked pretty slick today he smiled at the audience and took the podium with an ease marguerite hadnt been able to muster this was the charm she had talked about it and maybe this was what she had seen in him when they first met a plausible grin and some goodsounding words ray began im going to depart from my prepared text here and i know you asked us to keep it short ari and i promise ill do my best to address some of the remarks of the previous speaker marguerite squirmed visibly in her chair though she must have expected this as scientists ray said one of the things we must keep in mind is that appearances can be deceptive weve been talking about the obec installation as if it were a superior optical telescope i would remind you that it isnt at its most fundamental level the eye is a quantum computer functioning as an image generator we assume the images it generates accurately represent past events on a distant planet that may be true it may not if it is deriving real information we dont know how its doing so the images it creates are consonant with our real knowledge of umaes size atmosphere and distance from its parent star beyond that however we have no way of confirming what the eye purports to see until we can more efficiently duplicate and understand the effect our assumption that were seeing real events has to be provisional and if were tentative about the conclusions we draw its not because were timid its because we dont want to be deceived for this reason and many others i believe our tight focus on the subject and his culture has been misguided and disastrously premature in contrast to the previous speaker i would remind the audience that we have been making up stories pardon me constructing narratives about extraterrestrial life for much of human history whether this constitutes genius or folly is an interesting question in the name of science we were once asked by percival lowell to believe in a mars equipped with canals and civilization that misconception was dispelled by twentiethcentury science only to be replaced by the wishful and ultimately falsified discovery of fossil bacteria in a martian meteorite examined more closely mars has proven to be sterile of life the widely imagined microbes inhabiting europas subsurface ocean of lukewarm sludge have likewise turned out to be illusory our imagination outpaces us it seems it is intuitive it leaps ahead and it sees what it wishes for a manifesto for imagination is hardly what we need especially at this point in time he sighed theatrically having said that and i think it needed to be said let me move on to a more pressing issue one with particular relevance for all of us here at the lake it goes without saying that the lockdown what some people have called the quarantine is an unprecedented event and one we have all struggled to understand quarantine i think is an apt word i think its become obvious that we have all been confined here not for our own good but for the protection of people on the outside and yet it sounds absurd ridiculous what is there about us about blind lake that could possibly be considered threatening indeed what some have suggested that the very images weve been studying might be dangerous that they might contain a steganographic code or some other hidden message destructive to the human mind but we have seen little evidence of that unless you want to cite the previous speakers panegyric as an example ray grinned lopsidedly as if he had said something a little wicked but very clever and there was uneasy laughter from the audience he took a sip of water and carried on no i think we ought to focus our suspicion on the process itself on the obec mechanism could there be something dangerous about the obec platens we hardly know enough to answer that question what we do know is that the obec processors are very powerful quantum computers of a novel kind and were using them to run selfevolving selfreplicating code those words by themselves ought to raise an alarm in every other case in which we have attempted to exploit selfreplicating evolutionary systems weve been forced to proceed with utmost caution im thinking of the neardisaster last year at the mit nanotech lab we all know how much worse that might have been or the novel rice cultivars that caused so many histaminereaction deaths in asia in the early twentytwenties elaine scribbled furiously on a notepad sebastian vogel sat in a state of calm attentiveness a bearded buddha the obvious objection is that those events involved real selfreplicating systems in the real world not code in a machine but this is shortsighted the obec virtual ecosystem may be contained but it is also effectively enormous literally billions of generations of algorithms are iterated and harvested for utility in a single day periodically we select them for the results we desire but they are breeding always we assume that because we write the limiting conditions we have godlike power over our creations maybe that isnt the case now obviously weve never lost a researcher because he was ambushed by an algorithm more laughter the lay audience seemed to like this though the observation and interpretation people remained warily silent and thats not what im suggesting but there is some evidence which im not yet at liberty to discuss that the crossbank installation was shut down hours before the quarantine was placed on blind lake and that something dangerous did happen there possibly involving their obec machines this was news all around the auditorium people literally sat up in their chairs chris glanced at elaine who shrugged she hadnt expected ray to broach that subject maybe ray hadnt intended to he shuffled his papers and looked nonplussed for a long moment this is of course still under investigation he set the written speech aside but i want to return to the previous speakers claims for a moment hes adlibbing elaine whispered marguerite must have scored a point somewhere or else he had a couple of drinks before he showed up if i recall correctly i believe it was goethe who wrote that nature loves illusion nature loves illusion and those who will not partake of her illusions she punishes as a tyrant would punish we talk glibly about a sentient species as if sentience were a simple easily quantifiable attribute of course it is not our perception of our own sentience is skewed and idiosyncratic we contrast ourselves with the other primates as if we were rational and they were driven by purely animalistic impulses but the ape for instance is almost wholly rational he searches for food he eats when hes hungry he sleeps when hes weary he mates when the urge and opportunity are both present a philosophical ape might well ask which species is genuinely driven by reason he might ask when are we most alike men and apes not when we eat or sleep or defecate because every animal does those things men exhibit their uniqueness when they make elaborate tools compose operas wage war for ideological reasons or send robots to mars only human beings do that we imagine our future and contemplate our past personal or collective but when does an ape review the events of his day or imagine an utterly different future the obvious answer is when he dreams chris looked at marguerite onstage she seemed as startled as everyone else ray was rattled now but he had launched into a scenario that had some weighty internal momentum of its own when he dreams when the ape dreams asleep he does not reason but he dreams the dreams that enable reason dreaming the ape imagines he is chased or chasing fed or hungry frightened or safe in reality he is none of those things hes running or starving in a fragmentary model world wholly of his own projection how human how completely human you this philosophical ape might say are the hominids who dream by daylight you dont live in the world you live in your dream of the world dreaming infuses our existence our earliest ancestors learned to throw a spear not at a running animal but at the place where the running animal would be when the spear had traveled through the air at a certain speed our ancestors did this not by calculation but by imagination by dreaming in other words we dream the animals future and throw the spear at the dream we dream images out of the past and use them to project and revise our own future action and as an evolutionary stratagem our dreaming has been wildly successful as a species we have dreamed ourselves out of the culdesac of instinct into a whole new universe of unexplored behaviors we did it so effectively i would suggest that we have forgotten the fundamental truth that we are dreaming we confuse the dream with reason but the ape reasons too what the ape will not do is dream ideologies dream terrorism dream vengeful gods dream slavery dream gas chambers dream lethal remedies for dreamlike problems dreams are commonly nightmares the audience was lost ray seemed no longer to care he was talking to himself now chasing an idea down some labyrinth only he could see but they are dreams from which as a species we cannot wake our dreams are the dreams nature loves our dreams are epigenetic and they have served our genome remarkably well in a few hundreds of thousands of years we have increased from a localized hominid subspecies to a planetdominating population of eight or ten billion if we reason within the boundaries of our daylight dreams nature rewards us if we reasoned as simply and straightforwardly as the apes we would be no more populous than the apes but now weve done something new weve built machines that dream the pictures the obec device generates are dreams they are based we tell ourselves on the real world but they arent telescopic images in any traditional sense when we look through a telescope we see with the human eye and interpret with the human mind when we look at an obec image we see what a dreaming machine has learned to dream which is not to say that the images are valueless only that we cannot accept them at face value and we have to ask ourselves another question if our machine can dream more effectively than a human being what else might it be able to do what other dreams might it entertain with or without our knowledge the organisms were studying may not be the inhabitants of a rocky inner world circling the star ursa majoris the alien species may be the obec devices themselves and the worst thing the worst thing he stopped picked up his water glass and drained it his face was flushed i mean how do you wake from a dream that enables your consciousness by dying only by dying and if the obec entity lets call it that has become a danger to us maybe we need to kill it near the front a small voice shouted you cant do that a childs voice chris recognized tess standing now near the foot of the stage ray looked down in obvious bewilderment he seemed not to recognize her when he did he motioned her to sit down and said im sorry im sorry i apologize for the interruption but we cant afford to be sentimental our lives are at stake we may be as a species we may be he wiped his forehead with his hand the real ray had punched through chris thought and the real ray was not a pleasant thing to behold we may be ungoverned dreammachines capable of wreaking immense havoc but we owe our loyalty to our genome our genome is what makes a tolerable dream out of the valueless the rigorously precise mathematics of the universe we inhabit what would we see if we were truly awake a universe that loves death far more than it loves life it would be foolish truly foolish to yield our primacy to yet another set of numbers another nonlinear dissipative system alien to our way of life a man may smile and smile and be a villain shakespeare had said chris understood that it was a lesson he should have learned a long time ago if he had learned it soon enough his sister portia might still be alive stop talking like that tess screeched at that moment ray seemed to wake seemed to realize he had done something peculiar embarassed himself in public his face was brickred what i mean to say the silence dragged on the audience murmured what i mean ari weingart took a halfstep out from stage left im sorry ray said i apologize if i said something if i misspoke this meeting he waved his hand knocking the empty water glass onto the floor of the stage it broke spectacularly this meeting is over ray growled into the barrel of the microphone you can all go home he stalked into the wings sebastian vogel began whispering frantically into his pocket server marguerite clambered down from the stage and ran to comfort her daughter sue sampel had just shuffled the printouts back into their original order when her server chimed the small noise seemed very large in the silence of rays inner office she jumped and half the sheaf of papers fell out of her hand and scattered across the floor shit she said then fumbled the phone wand out of her pocket yes it was sebastian ray had left the stage he said looking pissed could be headed anywhere thanks sue said meet me out front five minutes she gathered the papers from the floor they had scattered into a broad circle and some had slipped under the desk and shuffled them back into a crude semblance of order no time to be more precise even if ray didnt come roaring through the door her nerves were stretched to the breaking point she locked the papers into rays desk drawer left his office packed up the stuff she had left on her own desk then hurried into the corridor and shut the door behind her the elevator ride took approximately forever but the lobby was empty when she got there and sebastian had already pulled up at to the front she ducked into the car and said go go go the wind had kicked up since morning out in the wide meadows between the town of blind lake and the cooling towers of eyeball alley fresh snow began to fall twentythree ray scutter left the auditorium without a destination in mind sucking in gusts of bitterly cold air as the doors closed behind him trading pain for clarity hed made a mistake onstage no worse than that hed lost track of himself that ridiculous digression about apes and men not that the ideas werent sound but his delivery had been selfabsorbed almost manic some of this was marguerites fault that pious little speech of hers had demanded rebuttal but he shouldnt have risen to the bait ray had always been able to command an audience and it troubled him that he had let this one get so completely out of hand put it down to stress he thought stress frustration a contagious madness ray had read the crossbank printouts closely and that was his diagnosis insanity as a transmissible disease here at blind lake of course it could start at any time perhaps had already started he hadnt been kidding when he called marguerites speech a symptom grains of snow snaked across the mallway writhing in the wind ray had left his jacket backstage at the community center but going back for it was out of the question ray decided to shelter in his office half a block away make a couple of calls do some damage assessment find out how badly he had fucked himself with that outburst on stage errant thoughts still circled in his head daylight dreams he crossed the lobby of the plaza and rode an empty elevator up to the seventh floor snow melting to dew in his hair he felt dizzy nauseated his ears vibrated with some buzzing interminable noise he had embarrassed himself he thought okay but in the long term even in the short term did that really matter if no one was leaving blind lake alive and he considered that a real possibility of what significance was his outburst made him look bad to the senior researchers big fucking deal he wasnt playing career games anymore he was still wellplaced to survive he could even come through this crisis looking relatively good if he did the right thing what was the right thing killing the obecs ray thought too late to generate popular support but he had laid the groundwork and might even have made a few converts if marguerite hadnt provoked him if he hadnt lost himself in a maze of ancillary ideas if tess hadnt interrupted him he came to a dead halt at the door to his office tess he had forgotten his daughter he had left her in the audience he took his server out of his shirt pocket and pronounced tessas name she answered promptly dad tess where are you she hesitated ray tried but failed to read significance into the pause then she said im in the car the car whose car uh moms you dont go back to your mother until monday i know but she shouldnt have taken you with her that was wrong that was absolutely dead wrong for her to do that but did she force you tess did your mother make you get in the car with her you can tell me if shes listening just give me a hint ill understand plaintively no it wasnt like that you left only for a few minutes tess i didnt know that you should have waited for me plus you said all those things about killing her i dont know what youre talking about i would never hurt your mother what i mean when you were up onstage you talked about killing mirror girl i didnt he stopped forced himself to calm down tess was sensitive and by the sound of her voice already frightened i didnt mention mirror girl you must have misunderstood you said we have to kill her i was talking about the processor at the eye tess please put your mother on another pause she doesnt want to talk to you she has to bring you to me thats in the agreement we signed i need to tell her about that were going home tess sounded near tears im sorry going to your mothers house yes shes not allowed i dont care i dont care what shes not allowed at least she doesnt want to kill anyone tess i told you i dont the server clicked tess had broken the connection when he tried her again there was no answer only her standard voice message he tried marguerite likewise fucking bitch ray whispered meaning marguerite maybe even tess who had betrayed him but no no back up that wasnt fair tess had been misled misled by her mothers pampering and indulgence which was exactly what all this mirror girl bullshit was about marguerite was using it against him daddy wants to kill mirror girl indoctrinating her ray was furious picturing it he could only imagine what lies tess had been asked to believe about him so was tess lost to him too no no impossible not yet he locked himself into his office turned his chair to the window and thought about calling dimi shulgin shulgin might have some ideas the view from the window was lifeless and hostile blind lake had learned to live without weather reports but you didnt have to be a meteorologist to see the clouds roll in low clouds weighty with snow moving on a galeforce wind from the northwest one more installment in this endless winter the falling snow gave the town an illusory vagueness like a tintype photograph or a stage set painted in shades of gray the windowpane flexed in a gust of wind lensing the image slightly subject stared for an indeterminate period of time at the approaching storm when he turned away the chairs castor caught on something hidden under the desk the cleaning staff had gotten sloppy but that was hardly news a sheet of paper scowling he bent down to retrieve it ex bo xiang crossbank national laboratory to avery fishbinder blind lake national laboratory text in answer to your question the possibility that the dryland structures are natural is very slim although this kind of symmetry is often enough seen in nature the size of the structure and the degree of precision are remarkable and suggest engineering rather than evolution not that this is a clinching argument but ray stopped reading and placed the paper faceup on his desk slowly taking his time now resisting hasty judgment he keyed open his desk and removed from the bottom drawer the thick sheaf of printouts shulgin had delivered to him he leafed through it quickly the pages were out of order someone had been in his desk again ray stood up he saw his reflection in the window an image pasted on a mural of clouds a man frozen in a layer of glass twentyfour the weather was conspicuously worse by the time chris marguerite and tess reached the house maybe that was a good thing chris thought it put another barrier between marguerite and ray if ray came looking for his daughter tess or looking for revenge the snow might at least slow him down tess had cried after the phone call now her tears had subsided into a flurry of hiccups and marguerite walked her into the house with an arm around her shoulder tess shrugged out of her jacket and boots and ran for the living room sofa as if it were a life raft marguerite carded the door better throw the dead bolt too chris said you think thats necessary i think its wise arent you being a little paranoid ray wouldnt we dont know what ray might do we shouldnt take chances she threw the bolt and joined her daughter on the sofa chris borrowed her office to print the docs sue had transferred to his server the office was windowless but he could hear the wind kicking up outside prying at the eavestroughs like a man with a blunt knife he thought about ray onstage at the auditorium rays first order of business had been to deride and humiliate marguerite and he had done that fairly cleverly disguising his anger controlling it for a guy like ray it was all about control but the world was full of unmanageable insolence expectations were confounded wives disobeyed and then abandoned him his theories were proven false his desk was rifled the important thing about rays little meltdown chris thought was that it evidenced a deeper unraveling guys like ray were emotionally brittle which was what made them such effective bullies they lived just this side of the breaking point and sometimes passed it pages snapped briskly out of the printer all of the thirtyodd documents sue had filched rays treasure for what it was worth chris sat down and began to read marguerite spent the gray end of the afternoon with her daughter tess had calmed down considerably once she was inside the house but her distress was still obvious she had curled up on the sofa with a quilted comforter around her like a prayer shawl and fixed her attention on the video screen blind lake tv was showing old downloads of the fosters a childrens show tess hadnt watched since she was six she had turned up the volume to drown out the sound of the wind and the sound of hard snow rattling against the windows marguerite sat with her much of this time she was curious about the documents chris was printing and reading but perhaps strangely none of that seemed urgent now for a few hours the world was suspended between darkness and true night cosseted in the worsening storm and all she needed or wanted to do was hunker down with tess she went to the kitchen a little after five to assemble some dinner the window over the sink was clotted with snow opaque as a porthole in a sunken ship nothing outside but vague shapes moving under an immense pressure of gloom was it really possible ray would come to the house and try to hurt her in this weather but she guessed if you were on the brink of some awful act you didnt postpone it on account of snow tess came into the kitchen and pulled up a chair watching marguerite chop yellow peppers for the salad is chris okay tess asked sure he is hes just upstairs doing some work conferring by phone with elaine coster last time shed checked but hes still in the house yup still here thats good tess said she sounded genuinely relieved its better when hes here i think so too how long will he stay interesting question well at least until all this trouble at the lake is finished and maybe longer than that maybe she had not discussed this with chris if she asked him about his longterm plans would that seem needy or presumptuous would she like the answer and under the circumstances how could anyone have longterm plans the relationship felt reasonably solid to marguerite had she fallen in love with chris carmody yes she thought so but she was afraid of the word afraid of saying it and almost as frightened of hearing it love was a natural phenomenon often false or fleeting like a warm spell in october it could end at any time tess can i ask you something tess shrugged rocking gently against the back of the chair back at the auditorium you said you cant kill her who were you talking about you know you mean mirror girl i guess i dont think dad was talking about mirror girl he was talking about the processors out at the eye same thing tess said obviously uncomfortable same thing what do you mean i dont know how to explain it but thats where she really lives its all the same thing when marguerite pressed for details tess became unresponsive finally marguerite let her retreat to the sofa still it was a new twist this idea that mirror girl lived at the eye perhaps meaningful but marguerite couldnt decipher it was that why tess had snuck off to the alley last week tracking mirror girl to her lair when all this craziness ends marguerite promised herself ill take her somewhere away from here somewhere different somewhere dry and warm marguerite had often thought of visiting the desert southwest utah arizona canyonlands four corners and ray had always vetoed the idea maybe she would take tess to the desert for a vacation dry country though perhaps disconcertingly like the subjects umae looking for salvation in empty places chris put a call through to elaine marguerites office server picked up the audio and relayed it through the transducers in the walls a connection so clean chris could hear the sound of the storm in back of elaines voice are you next to a window he asked her sounds like dogs howling elaine bunked in a tworoom utility apartment left vacant by a maintenance man who had gone to fargo for lithotripsy the day before the lockdown it was a groundfloor unit with a view of the dumpsters in back of sawyers steak seafood not a lot of room to move around in here is that better a little thats all we need right now another northeaster or whatever they call these fucking storms out here in cow country so did you read the docs what do you make of them chris considered his answer the documents were exactly what sue sampel had suspected text messages that had languished in the servers of the senior scientists who had gone to cancun for the annual conference they contained news that had been tightly held but would have been made public at the conference the discovery of an artificial structure on the surface of hrb the structure resembled a spiky hemisphere with radial arms one note compared the shape to a giant adenovirus or a molecule of c ray summarized what hed read apparently it expresses a mathematical principle called an energy function that can be written as an expression of volume in a higherdimensional space but so does any icosahedron so that proves nothing if it really is an artifact the builders seem to have vanished one of the messages claims the interior of the structure is uniquely difficult to image whatever that means and so on and so forth elaine said lots of really intriguing science but tell me something do you see anything here that looks like a threat anything that would explain the stuff in that magazine clipping there must be a connection sure but think about what ray was saying at the town hall meeting he claimed he had evidence the obec processors at crossbank had become physically dangerous you could draw that inference fuck inference do you see any actual evidence of it not in these papers no you think ray has evidence we dont know about its possible but sue has been pretty close to ray and she doesnt think so right you know what chris i dont think ray has any real evidence at all i think he has a hypothesis and a giantsized bug up his ass youre saying he wants to shut down the eye and he wants to use this as an excuse exactly but the eye could still be a threat the fact that hes biased doesnt mean hes wrong if he isnt wrong hes at least irresponsible theres nothing in these docs he couldnt have shared with the rest of us ray doesnt like to share they probably wrote that on his kindergarten report card what do you propose to do about it go public and how do we do that we forward these documents to every domestic server in blind lake plus id like to write a little summary like a covering letter saying we got the docs from a protected source and that the contents are important but inconclusive so ray cant act unilaterally hell have to explain all this and maybe get some input from the rest of us before he pulls the plug that might cause trouble for sue shes a goodhearted lady chris but id say shes already in trouble way deep maybe ray cant prove anything but hes not stupid might get us in trouble how do you define trouble locked up indefinitely in a federal installation run by a lunatic that sounds like trouble no matter what else we do but ill leave your name off the forward if you like no use my name chris said keep marguerite out of it though no problem but if youre thinking of rays reaction i have to repeat hes not stupid keep your doors locked they are locked chris said securely good now get ready for a shitstorm thatll make this blizzard look like summer rain at dinner tess ate sparingly and spoke little though she seemed to find the ritual reassuring or maybe marguerite thought she just liked having chris nearby chris was both a big man and a gentle one an intoxicating combination for a nervous little girl or even a nervous fullgrown woman after the meal tess took a book to her room marguerite brewed coffee while chris briefed her on the contents of the stolen documents many of them had been written by bo xiang she had worked with bo back at crossbank and he wasnt the type to get excited without good reason there had never been even the slightest hint of a technological civilization on hrb the structure must be immensely old she thought hrb had oscillated through a number of severe planetwide glaciations the structure must predate at least one of them the resemblance to the equatorial coral floaters was suggestive but what did it mean but these were unanswerable questions at least for now and chris and elaine were right none of it constituted evidence of a threat the storm rattled the kitchen window as they talked we can image worlds circling other stars marguerite thought cant we make a window that doesnt rattle in bad weather the darkness outside was deep and intimidating the streetlights had become veiled beacons distant torches it was the kind of weather that would have made the news in the old days winter storm blocks highways in the west airports closed travelers stranded tessas usual bedtime was ten oclock eleven on weekends but she came into the kitchen at nine and said im tired been a long day marguerite said shall i run a bath for you ill shower in the morning im just tired go on up and change then ill tuck you in tess hesitated what is it honey i thought maybe chris would tell me a story she hung her head as if to say its a baby thing to ask for but i dont care happy to chris volunteered it would be hard not to love this man marguerite thought what kind of story would you like chris asked perched on the edge of tessas bed he supposed he already knew the answer a porry story the girl said honest tess i think ive told all the porry stories there are to tell it doesnt have to be a new one you have a favorite the tadpole story she said promptly tessas bedroom window was still crudely boarded cold air came through the cracks and snaked down under the electric panel heaters and across the floor seeking the houses deepest places tess wore her blankets up to her chin that was back in california chris said where we grew up we lived in a little house with an avocado tree in the backyard and at the end of the street there was a storm drain like a big concrete riverbed with a wire fence to keep the local kids from getting in but you went there anyway whos telling this story sorry she pulled the blanket up over her mouth we went there anyway all the kids in the neighborhood there was a place you could duck under the fence the storm drain had steep concrete walls but if you were careful you could climb down and in spring if the water was low you could find tadpoles in the shallow pools tadpoles are baby frogs right right but they dont look like frogs at all more like little black fish with long skinny tails and no fins on a good day you could catch hundreds of them just by dipping a bucket all the adults told us not to play around the storm drain because it was dangerous and it was and we really shouldnt have gone there but we did it anyway all of us except porry porry wanted to go but i wouldnt let her because you were her older brother and she was too young we were all too young porry must have been about six or seven which would make me eleven or twelve but i was old enough to know she could get in trouble i always made her wait by the fence even though she hated that one day i was down at the storm drain with a couple of friends and we took maybe a little too long poking around in the mud and by the time i got back porry was tired and frustrated and practically crying she wouldnt speak to me on the way home this was springtime and southern california gets big spring rainstorms some years well it started to rain later that day not just a little rain either raindrops big as dinner plates my mom used to say after dinner i did my homework and porry went to play in her bedroom or at least thats what she said after an hour or so my mom called her and porry didnt answer and we couldnt find her anywhere in the house couldnt you just ask the house server houses werent as smart in those days so you went to look for her yup i probably shouldnt have done that either but my dad was ready to call the police and i had a feeling i knew where shed gone you should have told your parents first i should have but i didnt want to let on i knew how to get down to the storm drain myself but youre right it would have been braver to tell them you were only eleven i was only eleven and i didnt always do the bravest thing so i snuck out of the house and ran through the rain to the gap in the fence and i pushed under it and started to look for porry i think that was brave did you find her you know how this comes out im pretending i dont porry had taken a bucket and gone down to the culvert to collect her own tadpoles she was halfway back up that steep embankment when she got scared it was the kind of scared where you cant go forward and you cant back up so you dont do anything at all she was crouched there crying and the water in the culvert was running hard and rising fast a few more minutes and she might have been carried away by it but you saved her well i climbed down and took her arm and helped her up the embankment was pretty slippery in the rain we were almost at the fence when she said my tadpoles so i had to go back and get her bucket then we went home and you didnt tell on her i said id found her playing in the neighbors yard we hid the bucket in the garage and forgot about it and forgot about it but those tadpoles did what tadpoles do they started to turn into frogs my dad opened up the garage a couple of days later and the floor was covered with little green frogs frogs jumping up his legs frogs all over the car an avalanche of frogs he yelled and we all came running out of the house and porry started to laugh but she wouldnt say why she wouldnt say why and you never told anyone until now tess smiled contentedly yeah were the frogs okay mostly they headed into the hedges and gardens all up and down our street it was a noisy summer that year all that croaking yes tess closed her eyes thank you chris you dont have to thank me think you can sleep yeah i hope the sound of the wind doesnt keep you up could be worse tess said smiling for the first time today could be frogs marguerite listened from the doorway to the first part of the story then retreated to her office and switched on the wall screen not to work just to watch it was near dusk on the subjects small patch of umae subject traversed a low canyon parallel to the setting sun maybe it was the long light but he looked especially unwell marguerite thought he had been scavenging for food for a long time now subsisting on the mossy substance that grew wherever there was water and shade marguerite suspected the moss was not terribly nutritious perhaps not even enough to sustain him his skin was creased and shrunken you didnt have to be a physicist to parse that equation too many calories spent too few ingested as the sky darkened a few stars emerged the brightest was not a star at all but a planet one of the systems two gas giants umaa almost three times the size of jupiter and big enough to show a perceptible disc at its nearest approach subject stopped and swiveled his head from side to side taking his bearings perhaps or even performing some kind of celestial navigation she heard chris closing tessas bedroom door he leaned into the office and said mind if i join you pull up a chair im not really working getting dark he said gesturing at the wall screen hell sleep soon i know it sounds dumb chris but im worried about him hes a long way from well anywhere nothing seems to live in this place not even the parasites that feed on him at night isnt that a good thing but technically theyre probably not parasites at all there must be a benevolent symbiosis or the cities wouldnt be full of them new york is full of rats that doesnt mean theyre desirable its an open question but hes clearly not well he might not make it to damascus damascus i keep thinking hes st paul on the road to damascus waiting for a vision i suppose wed never know if he found it i was hoping for something more tangible well im no expert who is she turned away from the display thanks for helping tess settle down i hope youre not sick of telling her stories not at all she likes your what does she call them porry stories actually im a little jealous you dont talk much about your family tessas an easy audience and im not he smiled youre not eleven did tess ever ask you what happened to portia as a grownup thankfully no how did she die marguerite asked then im sorry chris im sure you dont want to talk about it really its none of my business he was silent a moment god she thought ive offended him then he said portia was always a little more headstrong than she was bright she never had an easy time at school she dropped out of college and got in with a bunch of people parttime dopers drugs marguerite said it wasnt just the drugs she could always handle the drugs i guess because they didnt appeal to her all that much but she had bad judgment about people she moved into a guys trailer outside of seattle and we didnt hear from her for a while she claimed she loved him but she wouldnt even put him on the phone not a good sign this happened when my book about galliano had just been published i was passing through seattle on a tour so i called porry up and arranged to meet her not where she lived she insisted on that it had to be somewhere downtown just her not her boyfriend she was a little reluctant about the whole thing but she named a restaurant and we got together there she showed up in lowrent drag and a big pair of sunglasses the kind you wear to hide a bruise or a black eye oh no eventually she admitted things werent going too well between her and her friend shed just landed a job she was saving money to get a place of her own she said not to worry about her she was sorting things out the guy was beating her obviously she begged me not to get involved not to pull any big brother shit as she put it but i was busy saving the world from corruption if i could expose ted galliano to public scrutiny why should i put up with this kind of thing from some trailerpark cowboy so i got porrys address out of the directory and drove out there while she was at work the guy was home of course he really didnt look like any kind of threat he was fivenine with a rose tattoo on his skinny right arm looked like hed spent the day killing a sixpack and greasing an engine he was belligerent but i just braced him against the trailer with my forearm under his chin and told him if he touched portia again hed have me to answer to he got very apologetic he actually started to cry he said he couldnt help it it was the bottle hey buddy you know how it is he said hed get himself under control and i went away thinking id done some good on my way out of town i stopped by the office where porry worked and left her a check something to help her get independent two days later i got a call from a seattle emergency ward shed been beaten badly and was hemorrhaging from a cranial artery she died that night her boyfriend burned the trailer and left town on a stolen motorbike far as i know the police are still looking for him god chris im so sorry no im sorry its not a good story for a stormy night he touched her hand it doesnt even have a moral except shit happens but if i seemed a little reluctant to jump in between you and ray i understand and i do appreciate your help but chris i can handle ray with you or without you preferably with but you understand youre telling me youre not portia there was no light in the room now but the glow of the sunset on umae subject had reclined for the night above the canyon wall stars shone in constellations no one had named no one on earth at least im telling you im not portia and im offering you a cup of tea interested she took his hand and walked with him to the kitchen where the window was blank with snow and the kettle sang counterpoint to the sound of the wind twentyfive sue sampel was wide awake when the doorbell chimed though it was well after midnight almost three according to her watch between the storm outside and the nervous energy she had stoked up during her raid on rays office sleep was out of the question sebastian bless him had gone upstairs around midnight and fallen immediately and soundly asleep she had curled up with his book as a sort of vicarious presence his book plus a big snifter of peach brandy but the book seemed less substantial on her second gothrough it was beautifully written and full of striking ideas but the gaps and leaps of logic were more obvious now she supposed this was what had put elaine costers back up sebastians cheerful love of outrageous hypotheses for instance sebastian explained in the book how what people called the vacuum of space was more than just an absence of matter it was a complex brew of virtual particles popping in and out of existence too quickly to interact with the ordinary substance of things that jibed with sues memory of firstyear physics she suspected he was on less firm scientific ground when he said that localized irregularities in the quantum vacuum accounted for the presence of dark matter in the universe and his fundamental idea that dark matter represented a kind of ghostly neural network inhabiting the quantum vacuum was taken seriously by almost no one apart from sebastian himself but sebastian wasnt a scientist and had never claimed to be one pressed he would say these ideas were templates or suggestions perhaps not to be taken literally sue understood but she wished it could be otherwise she wished his theories were solid as houses solid enough to shelter in not that her own house seemed especially solid tonight the wind was absolutely ferocious the snow so dense that the view from the window was like an obec image of some planet unsuitable for human life she nestled a little deeper into the sofa took another sip of brandy and read life evolves by moving into preexisting domains and exploiting preexisting forces of nature the laws of aerodynamics were latent in the natural universe before they were discovered by insects and birds similarly human consciousness was not invented de novo but represents the adoption by biology of an implicit universal mathematics this was the idea sue liked best that people were pieces of something larger something that popped up in a shape called sue sampel here and in a shape called sebastian vogel over there both unique but both connected the way two distinctive mountain peaks were also pieces of the same planet otherwise she thought what are we but lost animals lost animals exiled from the womb ignorant and dying the doorbell startled her her house server was kind enough to ring it quietly but when she asked who was there the server said not recognized her stomach clenched someone not in her catalogue of regular visitors ray scutter she thought who else elaine had warned her that something like this might happen ray was impulsive more impulsive than ever since the lockdown maybe impulsive enough to brave the storm and show up on her doorstep at three in the morning by now he might have seen elaines massive mailing he would know though he might not be able to prove it that sue had duped the copies from his desk he would be furious worse enraged dangerous yes but how dangerous just how crazy was ray scutter she wished shed had a little less to drink but she had thought it would help her sleep and shed run out of pot a month ago in sues experience drugs and alcohol were like men and pot was the best date cocaine liked to get dressed up and go out very elegant but coke would abandon you at the party or hector you into the small hours of the morning alcohol promised to be fun but ended up as an embarrassment alcohol was a guy in a loud shirt a guy with bad breath and too many opinions pot however pot liked to cuddle and make love pot liked to eat ice cream and watch the late show she missed pot the doorbell rang again sue peeked out the side window sure enough that was rays little midnightblue car parked against the drifts at the curb and it must have a pretty good drive system she thought to have made it this far through the deepening snow there was another round of ringing which the server muted disdainfully she could of course ignore him but that struck her as cowardly really there was nothing to be afraid of what was he going to do yell at her im a grownup she thought i can deal with that better to get it over with she thought about waking up sebastian and decided against it sebastian was many things but he wasnt a fighter she could handle this herself see what ray wanted if necessary tell him to bugger off but she went to the kitchen and took a carving knife out of the knife rack just in case she felt idiotic doing it the knife was really just a kind of emotional insurance something to make her feel brave and she kept it hidden behind her back as she approached the door opening the door because after all this was blind lake the safest community on the surface of the earth even if your employer happened to be seriously pissed at you her heart was beating doubletime ray stood under the yellow porch light in a long black jacket the wind had tousled his hair and adorned it with snow stars his lips were pursed and his eyes were bright sue kept herself squarely in the doorway ready to slam the door should the necessity arise bitter air gusted into the house she said ray youre fired he said she blinked at him what his voice was flat and level his lips fixed in what looked like a permanent sneer i know what you did i came to tell you youre fired im fired you drove out here to tell me im fired this was too much the tension of the day had accumulated inside her like an electric charge and this was so ludicrously anticlimactic ray firing her from a job that had long ago become redundant and unimportant that she had to struggle to keep a straight face what would he do next kick her out of blind lake but she sensed it was absolutely necessary to conceal the amusement she felt ray she said look im sorry but its late shut up shut the fuck up youre nothing but a thief i know about the documents you stole and i know about the other thing too the other thing do i have to draw you a diagram the pastry the dingdong that did it she laughed in spite of herself a choked giggle that turned into a helpless fullthroated roar god the dingdong sebastians ersatz birthday cake the fucking dingdong she was still laughing when ray reached for her throat sebastian had always been a sound sleeper he was quick to nod off slow to wake morning classes had been the bane of his academic career he would have made a lousy monk he had often thought incapable of celibacy and always late for matins he slept through the distant sound of the doorbell and through the considerable noise that followed he woke to the sound of someone whispering his name or maybe it was only the wind in a cocoon of blankets he opened his eyes to the darkened room listened a moment and heard nothing but the keening of the storm about the eaves he reached across to sues side of the bed but found it cold and empty not unusual sue was something of an insomniac he closed his eyes again and sighed sebastian sues voice she was not in bed but she was in the room with him and she sounded terrified he shed layers of sleep like a wet dog shaking off water he reached for the bedside lamp and nearly toppled it the light sprang on and he saw sue by the bedroom door one hand clenched against her lower abdomen she was pale and sweating sue whats wrong he hurt me she said and lifted her hand to show him the blood on her nightgown the blood pooling around her feet twentysix charlie grogan when he wasnt troubleshooting the eye lived in a onebedroom condostyle unit a couple of blocks north of the plaza charlie slept in the bedroom his old dog boomer slept in a nest of cotton blankets in a corner of the kitchen the chime woke them simultaneously but boomer was first on his feet charlie coming out of a confused dream about the subject grabbed for his pocket server and punched the lobby connection whos there ray scutter im sorry i know its late hate to disturb you but its something of an emergency ray scutter down in the lobby in the worst storm of the winter middle of the night charlie shook his head he was unprepared for serious thought he said yeah okay come on up and buzzed the lock he had thrown on a shirt pants and socks by the time ray reached the door boomer was freaked by all this latenight activity and charlie had to order him to keep quiet as ray entered the apartment boomer sniffed at the mans knees then shuffled uneasily away ray scutter charlie knew the executive administrator by sight but he hadnt spoken to him oneonone before now nor had he watched rays town hall address earlier though hed heard it was a disaster charlie was generous about such things he hated public speaking and knew how easy it was to get tonguetied at a podium you can hang your jacket in the closet charlie said sit down ray did neither i wont be here long he said and im hoping youll leave with me hows that i know how strange this sounds mr grogan its charlie right charliell do charlie im here to ask for your help something in rays voice troubled boomer who whined from the kitchen charlie was more troubled by the mans appearance rumpled suit hair askew what looked like fresh scratches on his face there had been a lot of gossip about ray scutter to the effect that he was a lousy manager and an asshole to deal with but charlie held such hearsay inadmissible in any case the boss was the boss tell me what i can help you with mr scutter you carry an allpass transponder out at the eye right i do but all i want is a tour pardon me i know its extraordinary i also know its four in the morning but i have some decisions to make charlie and i dont want to make them until i personally inspect the facility i cant tell you more than that sir charlie said theres a night shift on duty im not sure you need me ill just call anne costigan dont call anyone i dont want people to know im coming what i want is to go out there just you and me and well do a discreet walkthrough and see what we see if anyone complains if anne costigan complains ill take responsibility good charlie thought since it was rays responsibility reluctantly he took his winter jacket off the hook in the hall boomer wasnt happy with this turn of events he whined again and stalked off to the bedroom probably to find a warm spot in charlies bed boomer was an opportunistic hound they rode in rays car a squat little vehicle with lots of badweather options it took the snow pretty well microprocessors controlling each wheel finding traction where there should have been none but it was still slow going the snow came down like bags of wet confetti almost too fast for the wipers to clear from the windshield in this opacity of space and time the only landmarks were the streetlights candles passing in the darkness with metronome regularity in the close interior of the car ray smelled pretty ripe his sweat had a strange acetic undertone not pleasant and there was something coppery on top of that the kind of smell you registered with your back teeth charlie tried to figure out how he could crack a window in the middle of a blizzard without insulting ray ray talked a little as he drove this wasnt really a conversation since charlie had very little to contribute at one point charlie said if you tell me what youre looking for at the eye mr scutter maybe i can help you find it but ray just shook his head i trust you he said and i understand your curiosity but im not at liberty to discuss that since ray was pretty much the boss of blind lake since the shutdown charlie would have thought he was at liberty to discuss anything he liked he didnt press the issue however he realized he was afraid of ray scutter and not just because ray was executive management ray was giving off very peculiar vibes the spots on his jacket and slacks charlie thought looked like dried blood youve worked a long time with the obec processors ray said yessir since gencorp actually i knew dr gupta back in the berkeley lab days did you ever wonder charlie what we woke up when we built the eye excuse me when we built a motherfucking huge mathematical phase space and populated it with selfmodifying code i guess thats one way to think of it theres no phenomenon in the universe you cant describe mathematically everythings a calculation charlie including you and me were just little sequestered calculations water and minerals running millionyearold makeme instructions thats a bleak point of view said the monkey apprehending a threat pardon me nothing im sorry im a little short on sleep i know the feeling charlie said though he felt as wide awake as he had ever been somehow ray kept the car on the road charlie was vastly relieved when he saw the guardpost coming up on the left he wondered who had pulled guard duty on a miserable night no morning like this it turned out to be nancy saeed she scanned charlies allpass and registered with visible surprise the presence of ray scutter nancy was exnavy when she saw ray she began a salute then thought better of it moments later ray parked by the main entrance the nice thing about coming in early was you could always find good parking he escorted ray to his own office where they left their jackets charlie had conducted enough of these dignitary and vip tours that he had gotten it down to a routine prep and instructions in his office then the walkthrough but this wasnt the usual dogandpony show a long way from it i met your daughter here the other day charlie said ray cocked his head like a hunting animal catching a scent tessa was here well she yeah she came by and wanted to see the works by herself her mom picked her up afterward ray grimaced i wish i could tell you im proud of my daughter charlie unfortunately i cant in many ways shes her mothers child you always take that chance when you spin the genetic roulette wheel you have any kids no charlie said good for you never unwind your base pairs its a suckers bet sir charlie said trying not to stare what did she want charlie your daughter just to look around tess has had some emotional problems sometimes madness is contagious if its catching charlie thought then youre overdue for a checkup strange things happen he said trying to make himself sound amicable why dont you take off your shoes and put on a pair of these disposables ill be back in a minute where are you going see a man about the plumbing charlie said he walked far enough down the main corridor to make it look convincing as soon as he turned a corner he thumbed his pocket server and asked for tabby menkowitz in security she picked up a moment later charlie its an hour to dawn what are you doing here i think we might have a problem tab weve got lots of problems whats your flavor ray scutters in my office and he wants a tour of the plant youre kidding me i wish i was tell him to make an appointment were busy tabby i cant just tell him he thought about what shed said busy with what you dont know talk to anne maybe its a good thing you showed up when you did what i hear is the obecs are putting out strange numbers and the obs people are all excited about something but its not my department all i know is everybodys too busy to play politics with management so keep mr scutter on hold i dont think hes in a mood to wait he charlie im busy okay handle it charlie hurried back to his office something major was happening with the obecs and he wanted to get downstairs and look into it but first things first see ray out the door if possible or put him on the phone to tabby if he had a problem with that but the office was empty ray was missing also missing charlie realized was his own allpass card plucked off the lapel of the jacket he had hung up on the hook by the door shit charlie said he called tabby menkowitz again but this time he couldnt get through something wrong with his pocket server it chimed once and went bluescreen he was still fiddling with it when the floor began to move under his feet twentyseven chris came out of a black and dreamless sleep to the chirping of his pocket server which he had left on the bedside table and which glowed there like a luminous pencil he checked the inset clock before he thumbed the answer button four in the morning hed had about an hour of real sleep the storm was still gnawing at the skin of the house it was elaine coster calling she was at the blind lake clinic she said with sebastian vogel and sue sampel sue had been stabbed stabbed by ray scutter maybe you guys ought to get down here if you can make it in this weather i mean its not totally dire sues going to live and everything in fact she was asking after you but i keep thinking it would be wise for the bunch of us to stay together for a while chris watched marguerite turn uneasily under the blankets well be there as soon as we can he woke her and told her what had happened marguerite let chris drive through the snow she sat in the back of the car with tess who was only grudgingly awake and still ignorant of what her father had done marguerite meant to keep it that way at least for now tess was under more than enough stress for the duration of the drive with tessas head cradled in her lap and snow clinging to the windows of the car and the whole of blind lake wrapped in a gelid bitter darkness marguerite thought about ray she had misjudged him she had never believed ray would let himself be reduced to physical violence even now she had a hard time picturing it ray with a knife it had been a knife chris had said ray with a knife using it ray putting the knife into sue sampels body you know she said to chris i only fainted once in my life it was because of a snake chris wrestled the steering wheel as they turned a corner toward the mallway the car fishtailed microprocessors blinking lossoftraction alerts before it straightened out but he had time to shoot her a curious look i was seven years old marguerite said i walked out of the house one summer morning and there was a snake curled up on the porch stairs basking in the sun a big snake bright and shiny against the old wood step too big and too shiny to be real i assumed it was fake that one of the neighbor kids had left it there to tease me so i jumped over it three times three separate times in case anyone was looking just to prove i couldnt be fooled the snake never moved and i went off to the library without giving it a second thought but when i came home my father told me hed killed a rattler that morning it had come up on the porch and hed used a shovel to cut it in half the snake was lethargic in the cool air he said but he had to be careful a snake like that can strike faster than lightning and carries enough venom to kill a horse she looked at chris thats when i fainted they reached the blind lake clinic twenty minutes later chris parked the car under the shelter of a concrete overhang its passengerside wheels straddling the sidewalk elaine coster met them in the lobby sebastian vogel was there too slumped in a chair his head in his hands elaine gave marguerite a hard look sue wants to see you wants to see me the wound is more or less superficial shes been stitched and drugged the nurse says she ought to be sleeping but she was wide awake a few minutes ago and when i mentioned you guys were coming in she said i want to talk to marguerite oh god marguerite thought i guess if shes still awake ill show you the way chris promised to look after tess who was taking a sleepy interest in the waitingroom toys come on in hon sue said im too feeble to bite marguerite edged inside the room sues room was just down the hall from the room where adam sandoval lay comatose the man who had dropped into blind lake in a damaged aircraft sue definitely wasnt comatose but she looked dismayingly weak she was propped in a semireclined position a saline drip plugged into the crook of her elbow her face was pale she seemed much older than her fortysomething years but she managed to smile honest she said its not as bad as it looks i lost some blood but the knife didnt cut anything more important than what dr goldhar calls adispose tissue fat in other words i guess i was rescued by every dessert ive ever eaten like the guy in the movies who wouldve been shot through the heart if not for the bible in his pocket theres a chair by the bed marguerite dont you want to sit down it makes me tired to see you standing there dutifully marguerite sat you must be having a lot of pain not anymore they pumped me full of morphine or something like it the nurse says it usually makes people sleepy but im an idiosyncratic responder i think that means it made me want to sit up and talk do you suppose this is how drug addicts feel on a good day maybe at first meaning it wont last im sure youre right it has that houseofcards feeling like it cant go on forever euphoria with a price tag i want to enjoy it while it lasts it could end at any time marguerite thought i cant tell you how sorry i am thank you but you dont need to be sorry really i appreciate you guys coming out here in this awful weather when i heard it was ray that he was the one who hurt you what about it i owe you an apology i was afraid youd say that which is why i wanted to talk to you she frowned it made her face seem even more pallid i dont know you real well marguerite but we get along okay dont we i think so well enough that i can get a little personal she didnt wait for an answer i get the impression ive had more experience with men than you have not necessarily good experience but more of it im not saying im a slut or youre a virgin just that we fall on different parts of the distribution curve if you know what i mean im sorry im a little lightheaded bear with me one of the things ive learned is you cant take responsibility for what a man does especially if youve already kicked him out for being an asshole so please please dont apologize on behalf of ray hes not some pit bull you should have kept on a shorter leash hes totally responsible for how he behaved when you guys were married and hes absolutely responsible for this she gestured at the bandage bulging under the thin clinic sheet marguerite said i wish i could have done something to stop him me too but you couldnt i keep thinking no marguerite no really you couldnt perhaps not but she had consistently underestimated the degree of rays madness she had jumped over that rattlesnake a hundred times a thousand times with only her dumb innocence to protect her she could have been killed sue nearly had been well can i say im sorry you got hurt you already did and thank you i want to talk to chris too but you know maybe i am getting a little sleepy here her eyelids retreated to halfmast suddenly i feel all warm and sort of whats the word oracular oracular like the oracle of delphi wisdom for a penny if i can stay awake long enough to dispense it i feel very wise and like everythings going to be okay ultimately that would probably be the morphine talking chris is a good guy though youll do okay with chris hes trying real hard whether it shows or not all he needs is a reason to think better of himself he needs you to trust him and he needs to live up to that trust but that parts up to him marguerite just stared now sue said spectacularly pale against the offwhite bedsheet i believe i really do need to sleep she closed her eyes marguerite sat quietly while sues breathing steadied then she tiptoed into the hallway and closed the door behind her sue had surprised her tonight so had ray in a much more terrifying fashion and if i cant figure out these people she thought how can i even pretend to understand the subject maybe ray had been right about that all her big talk about narratives it was absurd ridiculous a childish dream her server trilled in her pocket a message from the eye with a priority tag on it marguerite thumbed the answer button expecting more bad news it was a text message a headsup from the guys in data acquisition get to a screen asap it said i understand sebastian vogel said to chris the wound isnt as bad as it seemed at first in all honesty i thought she might die but she was talking when i drove her here almost nonstop sebastian looked fragile chris thought his round body crammed into the ungenerous circumference of a waitingroom chair elaine coster sat at the opposite side of the clinics reception space scowling while tess played listlessly with waitingroom toys meant to amuse children much younger than herself she ran a train of colored beads around a wireframe rollercoaster the beads clacked together when they slid from peak to valley she insisted on talking about my book sebastian said can you imagine that considering the pain she was in how nice elaine said caustically from across the room you must have been flattered sebastian looked genuinely hurt i was horrified so why mention it she might have been dying elaine she asked me if there really was a god the sort of god i described in the book from which our minds arise and to which they return she was quoting me so what did you tell her maybe i should have lied i told her i dont know how did she take it she didnt believe me she thinks im modest he looked at elaine then at chris that fucking book that piece of shit book of course i wrote it for the money not even a lot of money just a small advance from a minorleague press something to pad out my pension no one expected it to take off the way it did i never meant it to be something people take as a creed at best its a kind of theological science fiction a thinking mans joke a lie in other words elaine said yes yes but is it lately lately what i dont know how to say this it feels more like inspiration do you understand the history of that word inspiration the pneuma the sacred breath the breath of life the divine breath inhaling god maybe something was speaking through me sounds like your bullshit detector has malfed elaine said though she said it more quietly chris noticed and with less obvious scorn sebastian shook his head elaine do you know why your cynicism doesnt hurt because i share it if i was ever sincere about the existence of god i grew out of it not long after i reached puberty if you call my book bullshit elaine i wont argue with you remember when you predicted id write a sequel you were absolutely right i signed the contract the week before i left for crossbank wisdom the quantum vacuum laughable isnt it but oh jesus the money they offered me to write a few harmless aphorisms in fancy language who could it hurt no one least of all me my academic career is finished any credibility i had as a scholar was flushed away when i published the first volume nothing left to do but milk the cow but sebastian paused elaine came across the tiled floor and sat down next to him chris watched tess play with a crude wooden car if the girl was listening she showed no sign of it but elaine prompted but as i said i find myself wondering that is i wake up some mornings believing it believing it wholeheartedly believing it the way i believe in my own existence believing what that youre a prophet hardly no i wake up thinking i stumbled on a truth despite myself a fundamental truth what truth sebastian that theres something living in the physical processes of the universe not necessarily creating it modifying it maybe but chiefly living in it eating the past and excreting the future tess gave him a curious look then rolled her car a little farther away you know elaine said thats like the final stage of lunacy when you start to actually pay attention to the voices in your head obviously i may be crazy elaine but im not stupid i can diagnose a delusion so i ask myself whether ray scutter might be right whether blind lake has been infected with a contagious madness it would explain a great deal wouldnt it it would explain why weve been quarantined it would explain some of rays own behavior it might even explain why sue is in a clinic ward with a knife wound in her belly and it might explain mirror girl chris thought he looked for tess worried that she had overheard this remark about her father but tess had abandoned her wooden car next to the swinging doors marked hospital personnel only and disappeared down the corridor he stood and called her name no answer tess was looking for her mother when she opened the door into the sleeping mans room at first she thought the room was empty it was only dimly lit but from the doorway she could make out the bed the window a silently blinking medical monitor the skeletal shape of an iv tree she was about to retreat when the sleeping man said hey there dont go she hesitated the sleeping man lay motionless in his bed but apparently he wasnt sleeping after all he sounded friendly but you could never tell you dont have to be afraid the man said he said hafta for have to tess noticed somehow that made him less frightening she took a cautious step closer she said youre the man from the airplane thats right the airplane my name is adam like the palindrome madam im adam his voice was an old mans voice gravelly and slow but it sounded sleepy too ive had my pilots license for fifteen years he said but im a weekend flier mostly i own a hardware store in loveland colorado adam sandoval the man from the airplane thats me whats your name tessa and this must be blind lake yes sounds like its cold outside its snowing you can hear the snow blowing against the window poor visibility adam sandoval mused as if he were taxiing down some imaginary runway are you badly hurt tess asked he still hadnt moved well i dont know im not in pain im not sure im even altogether awake are you a dream tessa i dont think so she thought about what this man had done he had literally fallen out of the sky like dorothy he had come to blind lake on a whirlwind whats it like outside snowing you said and it seems to be nighttime no i mean outside of blind lake the man paused it was as if he was rummaging around in a box of memories a box that had been locked up so long he was no longer sure what he might have left inside it it was hard to get in the air that day he said at last there was national guard at the airports even the local strips everybody worried about the starfish he paused again the crossbank starfish took my wife or she took it maybe thats a better way of saying the same thing tess didnt understand this not even a little but she was patient while the man kept talking it would be rude to interrupt she hoped at least some of what he said might sooner or later make sense karen thats my wife she was diagnosed with cervical cancer six years ago they couldnt cure it because of some quirk of her immune system the treatment would have killed her as quick as the disease so she had some surgery and took a handful of pills every four hours to inhibit metastasis and she would have lived another twenty years no problem and so what if you have to choke down a few capsules of this and that now and then but karen said the pills made her sick and i have to admit she was running to the bathroom all the time made it hard for her to leave the house and the surgery left her tired and feeling old and i guess she was clinically depressed on top of all that though she seemed more sad than sick sad all the time im sorry to hear that tess said she watched a lot of video when she was home by herself so when that crossbank starfish popped up she saw it right away on the panel made me print out the newsmagazines for her too i was at crossbank tess declared last year i dont remember a starfish yeah but that was before even at the time there werent a lot of pictures at first they tried to keep it out of the press but there was amateur video circulating and then another one popped up in georgia and suddenly the whole world knew it was happening even if they didnt know what was happening there was a faction in congress wanted to nuke the starfish outright karen was horrified by that idea so help me she thought they were beautiful beautiful the starfish especially the crossbank starfish the size of it like the biggest and most perfect thing you ever saw and all the spines and arches made of whatever theyre made of like motherofpearl with rainbows built in you knew you were looking at something special but some people thought it was holy and the rest of us figured it was and the four horsemen put together karen fell into the first category and i fell into the second maybe if youre depressed something like that begins to look like salvation but if all you want is to hang on to your life and wrestle it back to normal its just another threat and a distraction i dont know what you mean i guess you had to see it from the beginning especially the big starfish that grew at crossbank where that peculiar telescope used to be karen got more and more agitated the more she watched it on the nets the soldiers everywhere and the roads closed and all those foreign countries wanting to know what hellish thing we had cooked up and was it dangerous and of course nobody could answer either question you know what surprised me about karen the energy she had all of a sudden this woman who hadnt climbed off the sofa for six months shed been getting pretty heavyset despite the bathroom calls and the pills but she perked up fast im not absolutely sure she wasnt palming her medication she seemed to think it didnt matter anymore if she lived or died it was trivial what happened to her she didnt talk about these things you understand but she was obviously real interested when the government admitted it had lost several human beings and a shitload pardon me of robots inside the starfish at crossbank you could walk inside that thing or you could send a remote with a camera but the cameras always died and the people who went inside too far just never came back tess walked to the window which was dark and obscure with snow she could imagine mr sandovals starfish surprisingly clearly a cloistered maze like a snowflake she thought unfolded in three dimensions she could almost see it in the clouded window glass she looked away hastily what happened to mrs sandoval she asked karen took off one day in our old ford no explanation no note nothing of course i was frantic about it i talked to the police several times but i guess the police had their hands full what with all the people heading west before the mississippi roadblocks came down eventually i got word shed been arrested with a handful of socalled pilgrims trying to cross into the nogo zone around crossbank then the police called back and said it was a mistake she hadnt been arrested although shed been with that group she was one of a dozen or so who managed to get through the blockade on an old ozark hiking trail its strange to me picturing karen out in the woods climbing rocks and drinking out of streams she never even liked a backyard barbecue for christs sake complained about the mosquitos i swear i dont know why she wanted to be out in the woods like that did she go inside the starfish so they tell me i wasnt there and she didnt come out she didnt come out mr sandovals voice had gone flat tess thought about this did she die well she didnt come out thats all i know thats what made me a little crazy i guess tess was vaguely alarmed that he was still motionless in his bed mr sandoval if you cant move maybe i should call a doctor i cant move like i said im not even sure im awake but im pretty sure i dont need a doctor honest honest why did you come to blind lake to kill whatevers growing here tess was shocked like dad she thought mr sandoval had come here to kill mirror girl she backed away a step it seems frankly crazy to me he said lying here and thinking back funny what you do when youve lost someone and you dont know who to blame it was too late to do anything about crossbank obviously but blind lake had been in the news the fact that it was shut down in case the same thing happened here that pissed me off they ought to bomb the place i thought if theres even a chance bomb it out of creation but no there was just the quarantine it seemed way too chickenshit i apologize for my vocabulary its okay tess said but if theyd bombed us wed all be dead as she said it she wondered whether it was true maybe mirror girl wouldnt have let the bombs fall could mirror girl do that mirror girl seemed awfully close right now dont look at the window tess instructed herself but the wind rattled the glass as if to attract her attention as if to say look at me look at me i guess i know that now mr sandoval said i guess i was a little crazy at the time i thought i could climb into my plane post a flight plan through fargo and up into manitoba make a little detour at the right place i was gonna fly right into your telescope do as much damage as possible and kill myself at the same time this was true tess realized motes of mr sandovals old anger hung in the air above his bed like snowflakes it was adult and mysterious and somehow childish at the same time the plan was like something edie jerundt might have come up with but the anger and the grief were wholly adult if mr sandovals emotions had a smell tess thought theyd smell like something broken and electric like overheated wires and blackening plastic of course mr sandoval said its too late for that now yes they shot down your plane no i mean its already started cant you feel it tess was afraid she could marguerite meant only to find out what had excited the obs people out at the eye the clinic building was nearly deserted dr goldhar had left after stitching and stabilizing sue rosalie bleiler and a couple of paramedics were on night duty plus the security and housekeeping people marguerite checked doors until she found an empty boardroom inside she closed the door for privacy she felt furtive though she was doing nothing wrong and linked her pocket server to the rooms ample display screen the live feed from the eye came up quickly and crisply looked like late afternoon on umae afternoon winds kicked dust into the air turning the sky abalone white subject appeared to be continuing his enigmatic odyssey walking a series of shallow eroded canyons just as he had the day before and the day before that what was so unusual there were no text tags from the da people nothing to explain their apparent excitement the sheer clarity of the image perhaps maybe the clinic had installed a more modern display the image was as vivid as marguerite had ever seen it even at the monitors out at the eye clean as a window she could see the dust clinging to the subjects coxcomb each particulate grain of it she could almost feel the desiccating breeze on her face this creature she thought this thing this enigma subject followed an ancient arroyo around another sinuous curve and suddenly marguerite saw what the data acquisition team must have spotted earlier something so strange she took a step backward and almost tumbled over a conference room chair something exceedingly strange something artificial possibly even his destination object of the subjects quest it was obvious why this structure hadnt been spotted in the highaltitude surveys it was large but not ridiculously large and its spines and columns were covered with years if not centuries of dust it shimmered in the morning sunlight like a mirage subject moved into the shadow of this structure walking more quickly than he had for many days marguerite imagined she could hear his big splayed feet scuffing against the pebbly desert floor but what was this thing big as a cathedral so obviously ancient and so obviously neglected what had made the subject travel so far to find it please she thought not one more mystery not one more unfathomable act subject passed beneath the first of the great spinal arches into a softening shade what do you want here marguerite said aloud subject turned and looked at her his eyes were huge solemn and pearly white a thin dry wind tousled the loose strands of marguerites hair she fell to her knees in astonishment grasping for the conference room table anything to support her weight but there was only grit under the palm of her hand the dust of ages the desiccated surface of umae twentyeight when the floor moved under his feet and the klaxons began to signal the evacuation of the eye ray was dismayed but not surprised it was inevitable something was awake and something didnt like what ray had come to do but he had been groomed for this confrontation that was increasingly obvious to him ray wasnt a great believer in fate but in this case it was an idea with a great deal of explanatory power all kinds of life experiences that had seemed mysterious at the time the years of academic infighting his deep skepticism about the functioning of the eye his first initiation so many years ago into the rites of death made sense to him now even his ridiculous marriage to marguerite her sullen stubbornness and her unwillingness to compromise on anything that was important to him her sentimental ideas about the natives of umae these were the stones against which ray had been whetted like a blade blade provoked an unwelcome memory of the events at sue sampels house that had been purely reflexive he had never meant to physically hurt her she had infuriated him with that insolent screechy laugh and he had pushed her and the blade had appeared in her hand and he had been forced to wrestle it away and then after a thoughtless moment there had been blood god how he hated blood but even that awful encounter had been a tutelary experience ray thought it had proven that he was capable of a bold transgressive act he was familiar enough with the layout of the alley that he was able to locate the central elevator bank two of the four elevators sat empty doors opening and closing like spastic eyelids the tremor that had shaken the floor had subsided now an earthquake in this part of the country was unlikely but not impossible but ray doubted the tremor had been caused by an earthquake something was happening down below down in the deeps of the eye the night staff had obviously been wellrehearsed for an emergency evacuation staff poured out of the stairwells twobytwo seeming alarmed but basically calm probably telling themselves the tremor had stopped and the evac was a formality one gimleteyed woman spotted ray where he stood by the elevators approached him and said were supposed to go directly to the exit not back down into the works and were definitely not supposed to use the elevators fucking hall monitor ray thought he flashed the stolen allpass card and said just leave the building as quickly as possible but we were told unless you want to lose your job run along otherwise give me your name and badge number the voice of authority she winced and departed with a wounded look ray stepped into the nearest elevator and pushed the sublevelfive button the closest approach to the obec gallery he assumed he had a certain margin of time in which to work once the civilian staff had left the building shulgin would dispatch a crew of inspectors but the storm would slow that process to a crawl klaxons reverberated deep in the courses in which the elevators rose and fell he was four stories under the minnesota prairie when the sirens fell silent the elevator stalled in its shaft and the lights winked off power failure in a few seconds the backup systems would kick in even now ray thought shouldnt there be emergency lights apparently not the darkness was absolute he took his server out of his pocket but even that device had ceased to glow he might as well have been blind ray had never liked dark enclosed spaces he put his hands out to orient himself he backed into a corner of the elevator adjoining walls to his left and right the burnished aluminum surfaces were cold and inert to the touch this wont last he told himself and if the power failure did continue it could only be bad news for the obecs the pumps would fail the liquid helium would stop flowing the temperature in the platens would rise above the critical fahrenheit but a dissenting voice inside him said the fucking things got you now hang on he told himself he had arrived at the eye full of certainty and with a sense of his own power he had come here by a series of irrevocable steps fueled by his conviction that the obecs were source of everything that had gone wrong at blind lake but the building had stolen his momentum he was locked in a box and his confidence began to seep away into the darkness im not here for myself ray thought he had to keep that in mind he was here because the gullible children who had been placed under his charge were playing with a dangerous machine and he meant to stop them whether they liked it or not that was essentially a selfless act more than that it was redemptive ray had made a mistake at sue sampels house and he was prepared to admit it he took a certain pride in his willingness to look at a problem realistically maybe everyone else had been blinded by cupidity denial or fear not ray the device in this building had become a threat and he was going to deal with it he was performing an act of such fundamental moral necessity that it would wash clean any mistakes he might have made in the process unless he had come too late the elevator was motionless but ray imagined he could hear the building creak and groan around him deforming in the darkness whatever we woke up ray thought its powerful its strong and its gaining a sense of its own strength methodically he rolled up one leg of his trousers ray had left sues with the bloody knife still clutched in his hand he hadnt wanted to let it go or leave it behind the knife the act of using it as a weapon had made what followed both possible and necessary that was when he had formulated his plan to penetrate the eye using charlie grogans allpass tag he had started driving to charlies with the knife next to him on the passengerside seat of the car an untouchable thing decorated with threads of sue sampels blood then he had pulled over to the side of the road wiped the knife clean with a disposable tissue and carefully strapped the blade to the calf of his left leg with a roll of duct tape from the glove compartment it had seemed like a fine idea at the time now he wanted the knife in his hand ready to use worse he couldnt help thinking that he might have left some blood on the blade after all and the idea of sue sampels blood touching his skin invading his pores was grotesque and intolerable but in the absolute darkness of the stalled elevator he had a hard time finding the loose edge of the tape he had wrapped himself up like a fucking mummy nor had he given much thought to the physical problem of peeling what seemed like a quartermile of duct tape off his hairy leg he was almost certainly taking some skin off along with it he drew deep gasping breaths the way marguerite had learned to do in that lamaze class they had attended before tessas birth he was leaking tears by the time the last layer of tape came loose and when he jerked that away it took the knife with it slicing a neat little chunk out of his calf along the ankle that was too much ray screamed in pain and frustration and his screaming made the stalled elevator seem much smaller unbearably small he opened his eyes wide straining for light he had heard that the human eye could register even a single photon but there was nothing only the sting of his own sweat i could die here he thought and that would be very bad or worse what if he was wrong about the eye what if shulgin found him here after the crisis had passed raving and with an incriminating weapon in his hand the knife the fucking knife he couldnt keep it and he couldnt get rid of it what if the walls closed on him like teeth he wondered whether if it became necessary he could successfully kill himself with the knife like a bushido warrior falling on his sword how badly how quickly could he hurt himself with a sixinch blade would it be more efficient to slit his wrists or stick himself in the belly or should he try to cut his own throat he thought about death what it would be like to sink away from his own untidy self to drift deeper and deeper into the static and empty past he imagined he heard marguerites voice in his ear whispering words he didnt understand ignorance curiosity pain love more evidence as if he needed it that the obec madness had already infected him and then the lights winked back on god fuck ray said momentarily dazed the elevator hummed to life and resumed its journey downward ray discovered he had bitten his tongue his mouth was full of blood he spat it out onto the green tiled floor rolled his cuff down over his bleeding ankle and waited for the door to open twentynine maybe she went to look for her mother elaine said but when chris called tessas name there was no answer and the brightly lit groundfloor corridor of the clinic was empty as far as he could see he took out his pocket server and spoke her name again no answer he tried marguerite also no answer this is just spooky elaine said it was worse than that chris felt as if he had stepped into one of those nightmares in which something absolutely essential had evaporated in his hands what room is sue in twoeleven elaine said promptly upstairs you ring the duty nurse and ask her to look for tess ill find marguerite elaine watched chris sprint for the stairwell elaine herself wasnt terribly worried the kid was probably down in the cafeteria or off riding a gurney cart quite the family man she said to vogel our chris dont begrudge him what he found here vogel murmured it could end at any time he discovered sue sampel very nearly asleep alone in her darkened room marguerite left already she said chris is that you chris is marguerite lost or something i cant raise her server its nothing to worry about it she yawned bullshit youre worried go on back to sleep sue i think i will i think i have to but i can tell youre lying chris dont get lost in the dark chris i wont he promised whatever that meant he walked the hallway from end to end opening doors apart from the room where adam sandoval lay motionless in his coma there were only empty storage spaces locked pharmaceutical closets vacant boardrooms and darkened offices his server buzzed he took it out of his pocket and talked to elaine who told him the night nurse had called security and that the staff on duty were beginning a roomtoroom search but theres something going on out at the eye too i got hold of ari weingart who says the alley is being evacuated chris looked at the server in his hand if his was working why not marguerites or tessas if marguerite and tess were both missing did that mean they were together and if they werent in the building where had they gone he made his way back to the lobby to the heavy glass doors if marguerite had left the clinic she would have taken the car there was no other way to travel in this weather if the car was gone maybe he could borrow a vehicle and follow it but marguerites conservative little runabout was parked where chris had left it wheels on the curb under a fresh layer of snow he opened the door and snow came into the lobby on a fugitive wind small flakes turning to watery diamonds on the tiled floor elaine stood behind chris and put a hand on his shoulder this is freaky but you need to calm down you think ray has something to do with this i thought of that ari said hed been on the phone to shulgin who talked to charlie grogan rays out at the eye somewhere chris held the door open a crack letting frigid air play over his face she was right here elaine playing with that fucking wooden truck people dont just disappear but they do he thought they slip through your fingers like water mr carmody this was rosalie bleiler the duty nurse could you close that door please elmo elmore fisk hes our night guard would like to see you at the back entrance did he find tess rosalie flinched from his voice no sir but he found some childsized footprints in the snow out there tess wasnt dressed to be outdoors did he follow the footprints she nodded about fifty yards out past the visitors lot but thats the problem he says the footprints dont go anywhere they just sort of stop thirty to date there had been seven serious attempts to break out of blind lake three of them had resulted in the deaths by pocket drone of those who breached the fence and entered the nogo zone four more had been interrupted in the attempt by security forces within the lake the most recent case had been an agoraphobic caterer who had elected to scale the fence solo but had lost his nerve halfway up by the time security found him and talked him down he had suffered frostbite to the fingers of both hands herb dunn a fiftytwoyearold navy veteran had worked in civilian security ever since he was downsized from a fedex branch in fargo ten years ago the quarantine of blind lake had severed communications between herb and his creditors including two exwives which he regretted not at all he missed access to current movies and webbased erotica but that was about it once he realized he wasnt about to contract some kind of plague herb had settled into the lockdown quite comfortably except this week this week he was on what the security force called dawn patrol nobodys favorite duty the idea of dawn patrol was to send out a guy in an allweather vehicle to ride the circuit of the fence presumably to rescue miscreants from their own misguided escape attempts dawn patrol had yet to encounter even a single miscreant but herb supposed it had a certain deterrent effect today given the shitawful storm that had blown through the lake overnight shulgin had told him his route was cut short just a drive out to the main gate and back but that was bad enough the snow had begun to taper off when he left the garage but a fierce wind out of the northwest was still complicating matters these security vehicles were decent machines smartdrive hondas with mutabletread tires but a snowmobile would have been more efficient herb thought the main road from the plaza at the center of town had been plowed during the night but only as far south as the staff housing tracts from there to the fence it was all blown and drifting snow not quite deep enough to conceal the road but slow going even for the honda herb took some consolation from the fact that there was absolutely nothing urgent or even necessary about this run it made the delays easier to endure he settled back in the steamy warmth of the cab and tried to picture his current favorite actress in a state of radical undress back home he had videoserver apps that did this trick for him by the time he approached the main gate dawn had come and gone there was enough light now to mark the limits of vision a bubble of windblown snow around the cab of the honda and a glimpse of ponderous clouds in a sky like a muddy river he reached the turnaround point at the main gate no daring escape attempts in progress and stopped idling the vehicles motor he was tempted to close his eyes and make up for some of the sleep hed lost sitting up after midnight watching old downloads up at to get ready for this pointless expedition but if he was caught sleeping hed be on dawn patrol for the rest of his natural life anyway his breakfast coffee had worked its way through him and he had an urge to write his name in the snow he was climbing out of the cab into the frigid morning when the low clouds lifted and he saw something moving beyond the main gate something out there in nomansland something big he supposed at first it was one of those robotic delivery trucks carrying food and supplies but when the wind shifted again he saw more of these uncertain shapes huge machines just outside the fence he goosestepped a few feet closer through the snow just to see he told himself he was as near the main gate as he meant to get when without warning it began to swing open there was another lull in the wind a moment of almost supernatural calm and he recognized the vehicles out there as powell tanks and armored personnel carriers dozens of them lined up outside the lake he turned and took a few awkward steps back toward the honda but before he reached it he was surrounded by a halfdozen soldiers in camouflagewhite protective suits and aerosol masks soldiers wearing enhancedvision goggles and carrying sonicpulse rifles herb dunn had been in the service he knew the drill he put up his hands and tried to look harmless i only work here he said thirtyone confused beyond the point of terror marguerite forced herself to focus on her breathing she ignored the sandy soil under her hands and knees ignored the sensation of dry heat above all closed her eyes and ignored the presence of the subject draw breath she thought breathing was important breathing was important because because because if she were really on the surface of umae breathing would be impossible the atmosphere of umae was less oxygenated than earths and highly rarefied the pressure differential would have burst her eardrums had she traveled here from blind lake but it was fear not anoxia that was making her gasp and her ears felt normal therefore she thought still kneeling eyes tightly closed therefore therefore im not really here therefore im in no immediate danger but if im not here then why do i feel the grains of sand under my fingernails why do i feel the breeze on my skin the summer marguerite turned eleven her parents had vacationed in alaska much to marguerites dismay her father had bought the family a ride over glacier bay national park in a tiny singleengine aircraft the aircraft had dipped and rocked in the mountain winds and marguerite had been terrified to the point of nausea far too terrified to even think about looking out the window then her father had put an arm around her and said in his most profoundly ministerial voice its all right margie youre perfectly safe she had repeated that phrase to herself for the rest of the flight her mantra youre perfectly safe oil on troubled waters it had calmed her the words came back to her now youre perfectly safe but im not im lost im helpless i dont know whats happening and i dont know the way back home perfectly safe the perfect lie she opened her eyes and forced herself to stand the subject stood motionless more than a meter away from her marguerite knew from experience that once he was still he would probably stay that way for a while she remembered chriss comment not a great party planet and suppressed an incoherent urge to giggle those inscrutable white eyes stared at her or at least in her general direction and she was tempted to stare back but first things first marguerite told herself be a scientist youre a scientist youre perfectly safe two enabling lies evaluate your surroundings she stood just inside the perimeter of the structure the subject had entered looking back through its arches marguerite could see with a shocking immediacy the desert which she instinctively put into the context of the geography of umae the central plateau of the largest continental plate far from any of the planets shallow salty seas at the equatorial extreme of a temperate zone but it was so much more than that it was a sky as luminous and white as freshly fired china it was a range of eroded basaltic hills fading into the distance it was the long light of a foreign sun and shadows that lengthened visibly as she watched it was an irregular wind that smelled of lime and dust it was not an image but a place tactile tangible fully textured if im not here marguerite thought where am i the ceiling of this structure screened the direct light of the sun structure she thought was one of those weaselwords so beloved of the people in obs but could she really call it a building there were no proper walls only rank upon rank of pillars abalonewhite and coralpink arranged in a series of irregular arches that joined to form a roof farther in the shadows deepened to impenetrability the floor was simply blown and drifted sand it resembled nothing in the lobster city it might have grown here she thought over the centuries she touched the nearest pillar it was cool and faintly iridescent like motherofpearl her hand began to tingle and she pulled it away of course it was all impossible and not just because she was breathing normally on the surface of a planet unfit to support human life the obec images of umae had traveled across fiftyone lightyears what the monitors had displayed was almost literally ancient history there was no such thing as simultaneity not unless the obecs had learned to defy the fundamental laws of the universe maybe it was better to think of this experience as deep vr immersive observation a vivid dream flimsy as that scaffolding was it gave her the courage to look directly at the subject the subject was halfagain taller than marguerite none of her observation had prepared her for the sheer animal bulk of him she had felt the same the first time she went to a petting zoo back in grade eight animals that had looked innocent on television had turned out to be larger dirtier smellier and far more unpredictable than she had imagined they had been so disconcertingly themselves so indifferent to her preconceptions the subject was very much himself apart from his erect bipedal stance there was nothing human about him nor did he resemble an insect or a crustacean despite the ridiculous lobster tag that had been foisted on him his feet were broad flat leathery and lacking toes or nails built for standing not running they were coated with the dust and grime of his long walk and in some places the pebbly tegument had been eroded to a raw smoothness marguerite wondered if they hurt his legs were no longer than her own but nearly twice as thick there was an implied muscularity about them like two tree trunks wrapped in brickred leather his legs met seamlessly at his crotch where there was none of the complex paraphernalia of human sexuality perhaps not surprisingly there might be better places to install ones genitalia not that anyone had ever demonstrated that the subject or his kind even possessed genitalia of the conventional sort his thorax broadened to the shape of a fat disk to which his arms were attached his manipulating arms were slender lithe and equipped at their ends with what looked roughly like human hands three fingers and an opposable digit although the joints were all wrong the stubby foodgrasping arms just long enough to reach from his shoulders to his mouth were altogether stranger as much an externalized jaw as an extra set of limbs instead of hands these secondary arms possessed bony cupandblade structures for cutting and grinding vegetable material subjects head was a mobile dome with wattles of loose flesh where human anatomy would have put a neck his mouth was a vertical pink slit that concealed a long rasping almost prehensile tongue his eyes were set apart almost as widely as a birds cosseted in bluishpurple gristle the eyes themselves not purely white marguerite realized but faintly yellow the color of old piano keys no interior structure of the eye was visible no pupil no cornea his eyes might have been unorganized bundles of lightsensitive cells or perhaps their structure was concealed under a partially opaque surface like a permanent eyelid the orange coxcomb atop his head served no purpose anyone had been able to define on earth such features were usually sexual displays but among the subjects people it could hardly be gendered since every individual possessed one the most prominent or most prominently strange feature of the subject was the dorsal cavity running down the center of his thorax this was widely understood to be a breathing orifice it was as long as marguerites forearm and it opened and closed periodically like a gasping lipless mouth ray in one of his more classless moments had told her it looked like a diseased vagina when it opened she could see porous honeycomblike tissue beneath it moist and yellow fine silvergray cilia made a fringe surrounding the opening im perfectly safe she thought but in all honesty she was frightened of the subject frightened by the obvious weight and substance and implicit animal strength of him frightened even of the smell of him a faint organic stink that was both sickly sweet and richly unpleasant like the smell of a citrus rind gone green with mold well then marguerite thought what now do we pretend this is a real meeting do we speak could she speak fear had dried her mouth her tongue felt numb as a wad of cotton my name is marguerite she whispered i know you dont understand he might not understand even the concept of a spoken language she stood staring at him for a long moment maybe his silences spoke volumes maybe he spoke a language of immobility but he wasnt totally immobile his breathing slit opened wider and emitted an almost inaudible wheezing sound could this be language it sounded more like respiratory distress how fucking laughable marguerite thought to be here whatever this place was and for whatever reason only to be confronted once again with the impossibility of communication i cant even tell whether hes talking or dying the subject finished his discourse if that was what it was exhaling a gust of sourmilk air apart from that he still had not moved if this was an opportunity marguerite thought and not just a hallucination it was a wasted one her fear was laced with frustration to be so incredibly implausibly near to him and still as far away as ever still mute still dumb outside the shadows lengthened toward nightfall the pale sky had turned a darker bluer shade of white i dont understand what you said marguerite confessed i dont even know if you said anything subject exhaled and fluttered his cilia yes he spoke said a voice it wasnt the subjects voice the sound came from all around her from the motherofpearl arches or from the shadows farther in but that wasnt the strangest thing the strangest thing was that the voice sounded exactly like tessas thirtytwo elaine coster tagged chris as he headed out the clinic door whoa she said hang on where are you going she knew he was freaking out over the disappearance of tess and marguerite the duty nurse had shared with elaine the story about the girls footprints how they had vanished in the snow elaine hated to think of tess who had seemed like nice enough kid out in this bitter weather but there was daylight coming fast and the girl shouldnt be that hard to find elaine thought if only chris would exercise reasonable patience as for marguerite im driving out to the eye chris said the eye im sorry but what the hell for ari says its being evacuated i cant explain she grabbed his arm before he could open the door come on chris you can do better than that you think tess and marguerite are at the eye how is that even possible please elaine thought let this not be one more case of blind lake lunacy tess wasnt just wandering around out there her footprints are straight as a ruler and theyre pointed directly at the eye but the footprints stop yes so maybe she just came back to the clinic door you know stepping in her own tracks walking backwards in the snow in the dark well what do you think if shes at the eye howd she get there did she sprout wings chris or maybe she beamed herself there maybe she traveled in her astral body i dont pretend to understand it but the last time she disappeared from school thats where she went you really think she walked that distance in this weather i dont know about walked but i think thats where she is i think shes in trouble and i think marguerite would want me to go find her you can read minds too ari and shulgin and a bunch of other people are already keeping their eyes out for tess and marguerite let them do their work theyre better at it than you are chris listen to me listen to me i got a call from one of my contacts on the security force a whole fucking battalions worth of military gear and personnel just showed up at the main gate and theyre coming inside you understand the siege is over i dont know what comes next but in all likelihood the lake will be evacuated by nightfall you me tess marguerite everybody im heading down the main road and i want you to come with me were still journalists weve got a story here he smiled at her in a way elaine didnt like rueful and sad she decided she hated all tall young men with doleful eyes you take it elaine he said its your story youre the one to tell it elaine watched him angle his big body into the car watched as he drove off through the stillfalling snow at a reckless speed sebastian vogel crammed into his lobby chair like a buddha into an airline seat said i think i finally figured it out elaine sat next to him wearily please no more metaphysical bullshit there were things she needed to do pack up her server and her written notes and keep them with her even if some armed bureaucrat wanted to confiscate them consider facing the exterior world whatever the exterior world had become with its pilgrims and falling airplanes and roadblocks east of the mississippi ever since crossbank sebastian said ive been wondering why you agreed to take this assignment a veteran scientific journalist hired by a frankly secondrate new york magazine to address a subject thats been done to death sharing the spotlight with a crank theologist and a discredited scandalmonger that never made any sense to me but i think i figured it out its because of chris isnt it oh fuck off sebastian you read his book followed his story in the press watched his congressional testimony maybe youd already picked up hints about gallianos ethical problems you saw chris being pilloried and you knew he was right in spite of all the outrage and bad press you were curious about him maybe he reminded you of yourself at that age you took the job because you wanted to meet him this would have been less annoying had it been untrue elaine mustered her fiercest gotohell stare was he a disappointment sebastian said as a personal project i dont have time for this elaine thought she felt dizzy with lack of sleep maybe she could just sit here until the soldiers came for her all the really important work shed done was stored in her pocket server after all and they would take her server from her only when they pried it out of her cold dead hands when i met chris i thought theyd beaten him down he was obviously unhappy he wasnt writing he was a little too free with the recreational chemicals and he was carrying a load of guilt that was way too big for him im not sure thats all because of his experience with galliano probably not i just thought you wanted to help sebastian said gently yes im a fucking saint now shut up you wanted to lend him some of your cynicism hed be a better journalist if he learned not to care though perhaps not a better human being im not discussing this what he needed elaine and i dont mean this badly but what he needed it wasnt in your power to give it to him speaks the guru she bit her lip so what do you think you think he found it whatever it is he needs i think hes looking for it right now sebastian said chris ran into outbound traffic on the road to the eye night staff leaving the facility he guessed as rumors circulated that the siege was coming to an end even in this wan daylight the road was treacherous driving he saw more than one car abandoned in the drifts workers in burly winter coats flagging rides from colleagues he drove past an untenanted guardpost directly to the entrance to the eye where he found charlie grogan herding stragglers out of the lobby into the cold morning air the sound of klaxons beat against the raging wind not even remotely possible charlie said when chris explained what he wanted to do the building suffered a tremor of some kind early this morning and all kinds of electrical and communications problems since then weve got strict protocols about this i cant let anyone in until the building is declared structurally sound even after we get inspectors inside we still have to worry about containment on the cryogenics he looked mournful the obecs are probably dead already tessas inside so you said but i doubt that a whole lot mr carmody our security people conducted a very orderly evacuation what would tessa be doing here at five in the morning anyway looking for mirror girl chris thought it wouldnt be the first time she got inside without being seen you really have a solid reason to believe tess is in this building yes you want to share that information with me im sorry youll have to trust me im sorry too look even if she is inside weve got the lakes security people headed in maybe they can give you some advice charlie you need to doublecheck on that i heard shulgins men were detoured to the south gate what this thing about the military coming in call shulgin ask him when you can expect to see a security detail charlie sighed look ill talk to tabby menkowitz and see if she can get a volunteer from our own people to do a walkthrough if tess sees a stranger shell just hide in an installation this big im sure an elevenyearold girl can avoid getting caught but shell come out for you i believe theres a chance she will what do you mean to do look inside every room in the building last time you found her in the obec gallery right yeah but its the obecs shes interested in i could lose my job charlie said is that really an issue at this point jesus chris then if they end up pulling your body out of the rubble what am i supposed to say say you never saw me i wish it was true charlies server buzzed in his pocket he ignored it tell you what take this he gave chris his yellowstriped hard hat theres a transponder in the crown itll give you emergency allpass privileges if any of the automated security is still up put it on and if shes not where you think she is get the fuck out of there all right thank you just bring back my goddamn hat charlie said thirtythree as soon as marguerite identified the voice as tessas tess herself stepped out from behind or somehow inside the nearest iridescent pillar but it wasnt really tess marguerite knew that instantly it was the image of tess down to the denim overalls and yellow shirt in which marguerite had hurriedly dressed her daughter for the trip to the blind lake clinic but tess had never looked so surrealistically flawless so lit from within so unblinkingly cleareyed this was mirror girl you dont have to be scared mirror girl said yes marguerite thought i think i do i do have to be scared youre mirror girl she stammered tess calls me that what are you really then theres no simple word for it did you bring me here yes why because this is what you wanted was it what do you have to do with my daughter i learned a lot from tess have you hurt her i dont hurt people this creature this thing that had appropriated tessas appearance had also mastered tessas diction and tessas oblique way with questions and answers tess said you live in the eye in the obec processors i have a sister at crossbank mirror girl said proudly i have sisters in the stars almost too many to count i have a sister here we talk to each other this conversation was too bizarre to be real marguerite decided it had the trajectory and momentum of a dream and like a dream it would have to play itself out her participation was not only necessary but mandatory ursa majoris had begun to settle toward the horizon casting long and complex shadows into the maze of arches this planet is years and years away from earth marguerite said thinking of time the passage of time the paradox of time i cant really be here youre not out there the image of tess said gesturing at the desert youre in here its different in here more different the farther inside you go its true if you walked out of here you would die your body couldnt breathe or go on living and if you counted the hours they would be different hours than the blind lake hours how do you know about blind lake i was born there why do you look like tess i told you i learned a lot from her but why tess mirror girl shrugged in a distressingly tesslike fashion she knew my sister at crossbank before i was born it could have been someone else but it had to be someone like the subject marguerite thought we could have picked any individual to follow it just happened to be him the subject regarded this exchange indifferently if his motionlessness signified anything like indifference go on mirror girl said talk to him isnt that what you want to do ultimately yes but it had never been more than a daydream she didnt know how to begin she faced the subject again hello she said feeling idiotic her voice cracking there was no response she looked back helplessly at mirror girl not like that tell him a story mirror girl suggested what story your story absurd marguerite thought she couldnt just tell him a story it was a childish idea a tesslike idea she had been here too long already she wasnt like the subject she couldnt stand in one place indefinitely she was still a mortal human being but even as she had these thoughts she felt a wave of calm coming over her it was like the feeling she had putting tess to bed tucking her in reading before tess had become too sophisticated for this something from the old strange childrens books she had found so fascinating oz the hobbit harry potter marguerites fatigue lifted perhaps this was a spell cast by mirror girl and she closed her eyes and found herself wondering what she could tell the subject about the earth not its history or geography but her own experience of it how frighteningly strange it would no doubt seem to him her story born in the customary manner of human biology to human parents her memory emerging diffusely from a haze of cradles and blankets learning her name she had been margie for the first twelve years of her life plunged into the tedium terror and rare joys of school miss marmette mr foucek mrs bland the stern deities of grades the cycle of the seasons naming the months september and school november and the first truly cold days january dark and often painful the storming and melting months before june june hot and full of promise the fleeting freedoms of august childhood dramas appendicitis appendectomy influenza pneumonia friendships begun sustained or aborted a growing awareness of her parents as two real separate people who did more than cater to her needs her mother who cooked and kept house and read large books and made charcoal sketches of abstracted rural villages notionally spanish drenched in clinical sunlight her father distant and equally bookish a presbyterian minister sonorous lord of sundays but gentle on the home front who had often seemed to marguerite a lonely man lonely for god lonely for the deep architecture of the cosmos the scaffolding of meaning he imagined when he read the synoptic gospels and in which he confessed to her once he had never really been able to believe her own dawning curiosity about the world and its place in time and her place in nature a curiosity strictly scientific at least as she understood science from video shows and speculative novels how good it felt to master what was generally known of planets moons stars galaxies and their beginnings and ultimate ends relishing even the unanswered questions because they were shared acknowledged and systematically challenged unlike her fathers fragile religiosity which he had been reluctant even to discuss faith she surmised being like an antique tea set beautiful and ancient but not to be exposed to light or heat knowing too the pride he took in her growing list of accomplishments straight as in everything but music and physical education where her clumsiness betrayed her the math badges and sciencefair awards the scholarships the sudden indecencies of adolescence making sense of the female body that had begun to surprise her in so many ways learning to equate the blood spots in her underwear with the biology of reproduction eggs and seeds and ovaries and pollen and a chain of carnal acts connecting her to the common ancestor of everything alive on earth her own skirmishes with the erotic a boy named jeremy in the furnished basement of his house while his mother hosted a party upstairs an older boy named elliot in his bedroom on a winter night when his parents were stranded by monsoon weather in an airport somewhere in thailand her early fascination with the obec images of hrb oceanscapes like victorian colorplate illustrations of mellville typee oomoo a fascination that led her to astrobiology the princeton scholarship at her graduation her mother had wept with pride but suffered that night the first of a series of ischemic attacks that would culminate in a killing stroke half a year later standing with her father at the funeral willing herself to stay upright when she wanted to lie down and make the world disappear her first real longterm relationship a university affair with a man named mike okuda who had also been obsessed with obec images and who once admitted fantasizing when they made love that he was under invisible surveillance from other worlds the pain of separation when he took a job designing hall effect engines somewhere on the west coast and her subsequent realization that she would never stumble into love but would have to construct it from its constituent parts with the help of a willing partner her apprenticeship at crossbank working out tentative classification systems for chthonic plant species based on images sequestered from obs the fourlobed peristem the pale taproot exposed by a storm her first encounter with ray when she had mistaken her admiration for him for the possibility of love and their first physical intimacy sensing in ray a reluctance that bordered on distaste and for which she blamed herself the erosion of their marriage his relentless vigilance and suspicion begrudging even visits to sick friends his aloofness during her pregnancy and the things that sustained her during that difficult time her work long walks away from the house the weight of winter sunsets her water breaking and labor and giving birth dazed and sedated in a hospital delivery room while ray in the hallway outside conducted a loud argument with a nurses aide the miracle and fascination of tessa sensing some divinity her father might have said in the exchange of roles daughter become mother witness to what she had once herself experienced her increasing frustration when the blind lake installation began to derive images of a new inhabited world while she continued to catalogue seaweed and lagoon flowers the divorce the bitter custody dispute an increasing physical fear of ray which she dismissed as paranoia but shouldnt have it was a real snake the transfer to blind lake fulfillment and loneliness the lockdown chris how could she put any of this into words the story wasnt one story it was fractal stories within stories unpack one and you unpacked them all quod est superius est sicut quod est inferius and of course the subject wouldnt understand but he does mirror girl said does what he understands some of it anyway but i didnt say anything yes you did we translated for you interesting this royal we mirror girl and her sisters among the stars marguerite presumed but the subject was still motionless no mirror girl said in tessas voice hes talking was he his ventral orifice flexed his cilia made windonawheatfield motions the air smelled suddenly of hot tar licorice stale milk he may well be talking i still dont understand close your eyes and listen i cant hear anything just listen mirror girl took her hand and knowledge flooded into her too much knowledge a tsunami of it far too much to organize or understand its a story mirror girl whispered its just a story a story but how could she tell it when she couldnt understand it herself there was a storm raging in her mind ideas impressions words as evanescent as dreams liable to vanish if she didnt fix them at once in memory desperate she thought of tess if this was a story how would she tell it to tess the organizing impulse helped she imagined herself at tessas bedside telling her a story about the subject he was born but that wasnt the right word better to say quickened he was quickened no start again the subject the person we call the subject the person we call the subject was alive marguerite imagined herself saying long before he was anything like what he became long before he was capable of thought or memory there are creatures you remember this tess who live in the walls of the great stone ziggurats of the city in hidden warrens small animals smaller than kittens and a great many of them with their nests like tiny cities inside the city itself these small animals are born alive and unprotected like mammals or marsupials they emerge from their homes at night and feed at the blood nipples of the subject and his kind and they return before dawn to the walls they live and die and breed amongst themselves and thats that usually usually but once every thirteen years as umae calculates years the subjects people produce in their bodies a kind of genetic virus which infects some of the creatures that feed from them and the infected creatures change in dramatic ways this is how the subjects people begin life as a viral infection in another species not really an infection a symbiosis do you know that word tess initiated millions of years ago or sexual dimorphism taken to a freakish extreme the subjects people had debated this question without resolving it subject began his life this way one of several thousand yearling creatures suddenly too large and awkward to return to their warrens he was captured and educated into sentience at a lyceum deep beneath the city a place of which he retained fond memories warmth and the humidity of seepwater and sweet binges in the food wells the evolution of his body into something new and strong and large the knowledge that grew unforced into his brain and the knowledge he learned from tutors entering a fresh chamber of mind every morning his gradual integration into the citys daily life replacing workers who had died or lost their faculties coming to understand that the city was a great machine and that he worked for the comfort of the city just as the city worked untiringly for him coming to understand too the place of the city in the history of his kind and the history of the world there were many cities like his city but no two alike each one unique some cities were mining cities and some cities were manufacturing cities some cities were places where the elderly and infirm went to die in idle leisure some cities were foreign cities on continents far across the shallow seas where the towers looked like huge stone blocks and were built of bricks or carved into the sides of mountains subject often longed to see these places himself by his second fertility cycle he had traveled beyond his own city of sky to its northern trading partners the sandstonered city of culling and the smokyblack city of immensity and back again and he knew he would never travel farther except under extraordinary and unlikely circumstances he learned that he liked traveling he liked the way he felt waking to a cold morning on the plains he liked the shadows of rocks at nightfall his fertility cycles meant little to him in his lifetime he knew he might make only one or two real contributions to the citys genetic continuity his viral gametes combining with others in the bodies of the night feeders to become morphologically active it was abstractly pleasing though to realize he had cast his own essence into the ocean of probability where it might come floating back unknown to him as a fresh citizen with new and unique ideas and odors it made him think of the long span of history he had learned in the lyceum the city was ancient the story of his people was long and cadenced they had learned a great deal in their millennia roused by nature to a sleepy inquisitiveness and the making of things with their fingers they learned the ways of rocks and soil wind and rain numbers and nothingness stars and planets somewhere on the nearest moon of umae was the ruin of a city his ancestors had built in the culmination of one particularly inventive cycle and then abandoned as unsustainable and unnatural they had distilled the essences of atoms they had built telescopes that tested the limitations of atmosphere metals and optics they had listened to the stars for messages and received none and long ago marguerite imagined tessas widened eyes they had built subtle and almost infinitely complex quantum calculators that had explored the nearest inhabited worlds just like we did at crossbank she imagined tess saying just like at blind lake and they learned what were learning now that sentient technologies give birth to wholly new kinds of life they had discovered worlds more ancient and worlds younger than their own worlds on which the same pattern had recurred the lesson was obvious the machines they had built dreamed deep into the substance of reality and dreaming found others like themselves it was the subject believed a cycle of life far slower but just as inevitable as the life cycle of his own people a drama of creation transformation and complexity played out over millions of years subject imagined it often the great days of the stargazing cities their quantum telescopes and the structures that had been born and grown in staggered lines across the surface of the planet structures like nothing his species had built or contemplated building structures like huge ribbed crystals or enormous proteins structures which one might enter but not easily leave structures that were conduits into the living machinery of the universe itself structures which were themselves in some sense alive structures like this one marguerite understood but the subject had never expected to see one of these structures for himself no city had been fostered near one for centuries subject and his kind had learned to avoid the structures had dismissed them as doors into chambers that defied comprehension they built their cities elsewhere and curbed their curiosity still subject had often wondered about the structures it was disturbing but intriguing to think of his species as an intermediary between the thoughtless night feeders and creatures who spanned the stars apart from these occasional feelings his life had a healthy sameness a cyclical routine that was rounded complete and satisfying he replaced a dying toolmaker at a busy manufactory and served his city well his hours were satisfyingly selfsimilar at the end of each day he constructed an ideogram to represent what he had felt thought seen and scented during his work cycle the ideograms were almost identical like his days but like his days no two were alike when he had covered his chamber completely with ideograms he memorized the sequence and then washed the walls in order to begin again in his life he had memorized twenty complete sequences if this sounds dull marguerite imagined herself telling tess it wasnt the subject like all of his kind was often motionless for long periods of time but he was never inert his stillness was rich with savored stimuli the smells of dawn and dusk the texture of stone the subtleties of the seasons the way memory informed silence until silence became bountifully full at times he felt a strange melancholy which others of his kind said was an atavistic remnant of his life as a thoughtless nightfeeder we would call it loneliness he felt it when he looked out from the spiral roads of his home tower across the many towers of the city to the irrigated fields green and moist and the dry plains where wind whirled dust into the whitening sky it was a feeling like i want i want a wanting without an object it always passed quickly leaving an aftertaste of sadness piquant and strange then one day a new feeling overwhelmed him civilizations that give birth to star structures are never quite the same yes that means us too i dont know how much well be changed tess only that well never be what we were before this century when we first began to look at umae the star structures were aware of us they felt blind lake our obecs the presence of what must have seemed to them a childlike new mentality i dont know if they called her mirror girl they knew we were watching the subject and before long the subject knew it too we became a presence in his mind have they taught you the uncertainty principle in school yet tess sometimes just observing a thing changes its nature we can never look at a thing unlookedat or see a thing unseen do you understand at first the subject conducted his life as before he knew we were watching but it was irrelevant we were distant in time and space we meant nothing to the city of sky we registered only as a quaver in his daily glyphs like a distant unfamiliar scent but we began to come between the subject and the thing he loved the most because of their strange phylogenesis the subjects people never mated among themselves never bonded in pairs never fell in love with one another their overarching epigenetic loyalty was to the city into which they were born subject loved the city both in the abstract as the product of numberless centuries of cooperative effort and for itself for its dusty alleys and high corridors its sunny towers its dimly lit food wells its daily chorus of footsteps and soothing silences at night the city was sometimes more real to him than the people who inhabited it the city fed and nurtured him he loved the city and felt loved in return but we set him apart tess we made him different and it was a difference others of his kind easily sensed because we watched him and because he knew it he was suddenly in a different kind of relationship with the city of sky he felt estranged from it set apart suddenly alone in a way he had never been alone before thats right alone because we were with him he saw the city as if through different eyes and the city his peers looked differently at him it made him unhappy he thought more and more often about the star structures the star structures had seemed almost a legend to him a story made by the telling now he understood that they were real that the conversations between the stars were continuous and that chance had elected him as a representative of his species he began to consider traveling to the nearest of the structures which was nevertheless a great distance away in the western desert it was unusual for a person of his age to make such a pilgrimage it was widely believed that entering a star structure would cause the pilgrim to be assumed into a larger intelligence an unappealing fate for the young though the elderly and dying were sometimes moved to make the journey subject began to feel that his destiny had been tied to the star structures and he began planning his own voyage idly at first more seriously as he was ostracized for his strangeness ignored at food conclaves and treated perfunctorily at his work what else was there for him to do the city had fallen out of love with him he loved the city nevertheless and it hurt him terribly to say goodbye to it he spent an entire night alone on a high balcony savoring the citys unique pattern of lightness and dark and the subtle moving moon shadows in the thoroughfares it seemed to him he loved all of it at once every stone and cobble well and cistern sooty chimney and fragrant green field his only consolation was that the city would go on without him his absence might lightly wound the city he would have to be replaced but the wound would quickly heal and the city in its benevolence would forget he had ever lived which was as it should be it was easy for him to locate the star structure evolution had equipped the subject and his kind with the ability to sense subtle variations in the planets magnetic field north south east and west were as obvious to him as up and down are obvious to us the name they had given the star structure contained four suspirated vowels that defined its location with as much precision as a gps device but he knew the walk would be long and taxing he ate as much as he could storing moisture and nutrients in the linings of his body he traveled conservative distances each day he saw things that provoked his curiosity and admiration including the dunebound ruin of a city so ancient it had no name a city abandoned eons before his birth he rested often nevertheless by the end of the journey he was weak dehydrated confused and bereft i think he pitied me tess for never having loved a city just as i was tempted to pity him for never having loved a fellow creature when he found the star structure it seemed less awesome than he had anticipated a strange but dusty agglutination of ribs and arches at the core of which he knew there had once been a quantum processor a machine his ancestors had built at the zenith of their cleverness was this really his destiny he understood more when he stepped inside some of this i cant explain tess i dont know how the star structures do what they do i dont really know what mirror girl means when says she has sisters in the stars and that this structure was one of them i think there are matters here which are terribly difficult for a human mind to grasp subject understood that what waited for him deeper in the structure was an apotheosis of some kind his physical death but not an end to his being before that happened however he was curious about us perhaps as curious as we had been about him that was why mirror girl brought me to him to say hello to tell a story to say goodbye a story like this story does that make any sense tess i wish it had a better ending and im sorry about all the big words it was almost night on the western plains the sky beyond the arches was blue silk turning to black and blackness grew like a living thing in the canyons and under the eastfacing terraces of rock marguerite felt curiously sleepy as if the aftermath of shock had drained all energy from her the subject had finished his story now he wanted to finish his journey he wanted to go to the core of the star structure and find whatever waited for him there marguerite felt his urge to turn away and was suddenly reluctant to let him go she said to mirror girl can i touch him a pause he says yes she put her hand out and took a step forward subject remained motionless her hand looked pale against the textured roughness of his skin she rested her fingers against his body above the oral vent his skin felt like pliant sunwarmed tree bark he towered over her and he smelled perfectly awful she steeled herself and looked into his blank white eyes seeing everything seeing nothing thank you she whispered and im sorry ponderously slowly the subject turned away his huge feet on the sandy soil made a sound like dry leaves rustling when he had vanished into the shadowy inner reaches of the star structure marguerite sensing that her time here was almost at an end knelt down next to mirror girl how strange she thought to see this thing this entity in the shape of tess how misleading how many other intelligent species have you known you and your sisters mirror girl cocked her head to the side another tesslike gesture thousands and thousands of progenitor species she said over millions and millions of years do you remember them all we do thousands of sentient species on worlds circling thousands of stars life marguerite thought in almost infinite variety all alike no two alike do they have anything in common a physical thing no then something intangible sentience is intangible something more than that mirror girl appeared to consider the question consulting her sisters perhaps yes she said finally her eyes were bright and not at all like tessas her expression was solemn ignorance she said curiosity pain love marguerite nodded thank you now mirror girl said i think you need to go help your daughter thirtyfour the elevator door opened onto the dark and flickering spaces of the obec gallery and ray was astonished to find tess waiting for him she looked up at him with wide wondering eyes he lowered the knife but resisted the temptation to hide it behind his back it was difficult to understand the purpose or meaning of her presence here youre sweating she said the air was warm the light was dim the obec devices were still a corridor away but ray imagined he could feel their proximity a pressure on his eardrums the weight of a headache what had he come here to do to kill the thing that had eroded his authority overturned his marriage and subverted his daughters mind he had presumed it was still vulnerable he had only a knife and his bare hands but he could pull a plug cut a cable or sever a supply line the obecs existed by human consent and he would withdraw that consent but what if the obecs had discovered a way to defend themselves why do you want to do that tess asked as if he had spoken aloud maybe he had he looked at his daughter critically you shouldnt be here he said she reached for his hand her small fingers were warmer than the air come look tess said come on he followed her through a series of unmanned security barriers to the gallery to the glasswalled platform overlooking the deep structure of the obec devices where ray realized that his plan to shut down the machines had become unrealizable and that he would have to consider a different course of action inside the obec platens quasibiological networks inhabited an almost infinite phasespace linked to the exterior world at first by the telemetry from tpf interferometers running fourier transforms on degraded signals fading into noise then mysteriously deriving the desired information by what theorists chose to call other means they had spoken to the universe ray thought and the universe had spoken back the obec array knew things the human species could only guess at and now it had taken that interaction with the physical world to a new level the obec chamber three stories deep had been a nasastyle clean room nothing apart from the obecs should have lived there but it seemed to ray in this dim light that the chamber had been overrun with something if not life at least something selfreproducing a transparent growth that had partially filled the obec enclosure and was rising up the walls like frost on a winter window the bottom of the chamber thirty feet down was immersed in a gelatinous crystalline fluid that glinted and moved like sea foam on a beach its so the obecs can sustain themselves without exterior power tess said the roots go down way underground tapping heat how deep did you have to go to tap heat from a snowbound prairie a thousand feet two thousand all the way to molten magma no wonder the earth had trembled and how did tess know this clearly tess had developed some kind of empathy for the obecs a contagious madness ray thought tess had always been unstable perhaps the obecs were exploiting that weakness and there was nothing he could do about it the platens were beyond his reach and his daughter had been hopelessly compromised the knowledge struck him with the force of a physical blow he backed against the wall and slid to a sitting position on the floor the knife in his limp right hand tess knelt and looked into his eyes youre tired she said it was true he had never felt so tired you know tess said it wasnt her fault or yours what wasnt whose fault ray gave his daughter a despairing look when you got out of the car she said that you lived you were just a child she was talking about his mothers death but ray had never told tess that story he hadnt told marguerite either or anyone else in his adult life rays mother her name was bethany but ray never called her anything but mother had driven him to school in the familys big ford a kind of car you never saw anymore powered by the combination of biodiesel fuel and rechargeable cells that had been commonplace after the saudi conflict a patriotic vehicle in which he had always been proud to be seen the car was a vivid red ray remembered red as some desirable new toy teflonslick and enamelbright ray was ten and keenly aware of colors and textures his mother had driven him to school in the car and he had hopped out and almost reached the schoolyard fence snapshot baden academy a private junior school in a treelined chicago suburb a fashionably oldfashioned yellowbrick building slumbering in septembermorning heat when he turned to wave goodbye hand upraised listening to childrens voices and the highvoltage whine of cicadas in time to see a modesto and fuchs managed care mobile health maintenance truck hijacked he learned later by an oxycontin addict attempting to score narcotics from the vehicles onboard supply as it careened from the wrongway lane of duchesne street directly into the side of the bright red ford the patriotic ford sustained the impact well but rays mother had seen the truck coming and had unwisely tried to exit the vehicle the modesto and fuchs truck had crushed her between the door and the frame and had then bounced back several yards leaving bethany scutter in the street with her abdomen opened like the middle pages of a blue and red book ray seeing this from the olympian mountaintop of incipient shock made certain observations about the human condition that had stayed with him these many years people like their promises were fragile and unreliable people were bags of gas and fluid dressed up for masquerade roles parent teacher therapist wife liable at any moment to collapse into their natural state the natural state of biological matter was roadkill ray didnt go back to baden academy for a year during which time he received courtesy of his father every pharmaceutical and metaphysical medicine for melancholy offered at the better clinics his recovery was swift he had already shown a predilection for mathematics and he immersed himself in the inorganic sciences astronomy and later astrophysics wherein the scales of time and space were large enough to lend a welcome perspective he had been secretly pleased when mars and europa were proved devoid of life how much more disturbing it would have been to find them shot through with biology rotten as a crate of christmas oranges gone green in the corner of the basement cascades of silverygray frostfingers ran up the windows of the obec gallery dimming the light arranging themselves into shapes reminiscent of columns and arches ray decided he shouldnt have told tess this story if indeed he had told her it seemed in his confusion that she had been telling it to him youre wrong tess said she didnt die to make you hate her his eyes widened startled and angered by what his daughter had become ray took up the knife again thirtyfive shes here chris thought he ran down the emergency stairs toward the obec gallery consumed with a sense of urgency he couldnt explain even to himself his footsteps rattled up the hollow concrete column of the stairwell like the sound of gunfire she was here the knowledge was as inescapable as a headache tessas vanishing snow trail had been an ambiguous clue at best but he knew she was in the obec gallery just as surely as he had known where porry had gone on the night of the tadpoles it was more than intuition it was as if the information had been delivered directly to his bloodstream maybe it had if tess could vanish from a snowbound parking lot what else might be possible what was happening here must be very like what had happened at crossbank something massive apparently catastrophic possibly contagious and profoundly strange and tess was at the heart of it and so very nearly was he he arrived at a door marked gallery level restricted it unlocked itself at his touch courtesy of charlie grogans transponder the alley groaned around him shifting after this mornings tremor subject to stresses unknown chris knew the structure was potentially unsafe but his concern for tess overrode his considerable personal fear not that he had any business being here porrys death had taught him that good intentions could be as lethal as malice that love was a clumsy and unreliable tool or so he thought yet here he was many long miles up shit creek desperately trying to protect the daughter of a woman for whom he cared deeply and who had also vanished but the dread he felt for tess seemed not to extend to marguerite he believed marguerite was safe again this was a sourceless knowledge the building groaned again the emergency klaxons stuttered and went dead and in the sudden silence he was able to hear voices from the gallery a childs voice probably tessas and a mans perhaps rays the whole universe is telling a story mirror girl explained tess crouched behind a massive wheeled cart bearing an empty white helium cylinder twice the size of her body mirror girl was not physically present but tess could hear her voice mirror girl was answering questions tess had hardly started to ask the universe was a story like any other story mirror girl said the hero of the story was named complexity complexity was born on page one a fluctuation in the primordial symmetry details of the gestation the synthesis of quarks their condensation into matter photogenesis the creation of hydrogen and helium mattered less than the pattern one thing became two two became many many combined in fundamentally unpredictable ways like a baby tess thought she had learned this part in school a fertilized cell made two cells four cells eight cells and the cells became heart lungs brain self was that complexity an important part of it yes mirror girl said part of a long long chain of births stars formed in the cooling expanding universe old stellar cores enriched galactic clouds with calcium nitrogen oxygen metals newer stars precipitated these elements as rocky planets rocky planets bombarded by ice from their stars accretion disk formed oceans life arose and another story began single cells joined in strange collectives became multicellular creatures and then thinking beings beings complex enough to hold the history of the universe inside their calcified skulls tess wondered if that was the end of the story not nearly mirror girl said not by a long shot thinking creatures make machines mirror girl said and their machines grow more complex and eventually they build machines that think and do more than think machines that invest their complexity into the structure of potential quantum states cultures of thinking organisms generate these nodes of profoundly dense complexity in the same way massive stars collapse into singularities tess asked if that was what was happening now here in the dim corridors of eyeball alley yes what happens next it surpasses understanding how does the story end no one can say is that my fathers voice it was a voice that seemed to come from the observation level of the obec gallery where tess wanted to go but where she was deeply afraid of going yes whats he doing here thinking about dying mirror girl said the obec observation gallery was circular in the style of a surgical theater and chris entered it on the side opposite ray he could see ray and tess only as blurred shapes distorted by the panels of glass that enclosed the yardswide obec chamber the glass should have been clear instead it was obscured by what looked like ropes and columns of frost something catastrophically strange was happening down in the core platens he crouched and began to move slowly around the perimeter of the gallery he could hear rays voice soft and uninflected couched in echoes from the rounded walls i dont hate her what would be the point she taught me a lesson something most people never learn we live in a dream a dream about surfaces we love our skins so much we cant see under them but its only a story tessas voice was unnaturally calm what else could it be now chris could see them both around the curvature of the glass wall he crouched motionless watching ray sat on the floor legs splayed staring straight ahead tess sat on his lap she caught sight of chris and smiled her eyes were luminous ray had a knife in his right hand the knife was poised at tessas throat but of course it wasnt tess ray felt as if he had fallen off a cliff each impact on the way down doing him an irreparable injury but this was the final blow the hard landing the awareness that this thing he had mistaken for his daughter was not tess but the symptom of her sickness of all their sicknesses perhaps this was mirror girl you came to kill me mirror girl said he held the knife against her throat she had tessas voice and tessas body but her eyes betrayed her her eyes and their intimate knowledge of him you think the only true thing is pain she whispered but youre wrong this was too much he pressed the knife into the hollow of her throat impossible as this act was a murder that couldnt succeed the execution of a primordial force in the shape of his only child and pulled it hard across her pale skin expecting blood but there was no blood the knife met no resistance she vanished like a broken bubble there was another tremor deep in the earth and the opaque glass walls of the obec gallery began to crumble into dust but its not really tess chris thought and he heard panicked footsteps behind him and a small voice screaming no this was tess running toward her father chris turned in time to catch her by her shoulders and lift her off her feet she kicked and squirmed in his arms let me go the glass walls crumbled opening the gallery to the obec enclosure tendrils of a substance that looked like motherofpearl began to snake across the floor in lacy symmetrical arrays the air stank of ozone chris watched as ray struggled to his feet and blinked like a man waking up from or into a nightmare ray stumbled toward the obec chamber now an open pit spikes of crystalline matter rose to the ceiling and pierced it shaking loose a snow of plaster the overhead fluorescent bars dimmed ray chris said hey buddy were not safe here we need to get out we need to get tess up top tess yielded in his grip waiting for her father to react chris kept a firm hand on her shoulder ray scutter gazed into the abyss in front of him the obec chamber was a well of crystalline growth three stories deep a barrel full of glass he gave chris a quick dismissive glance obviously were not safe thats the fucking point maybe youre right i dont want to argue with you we have to get tess upstairs we need to take care of your daughter ray ray seemed to be evaluating that option but ray wasnt in a hurry anymore he gave them both another long look it seemed to chris he had never seen such weariness in a human face then his expression softened as if he had solved a troublesome riddle he smiled you do it he said then he stepped over the edge tess twisted herself out of his arms and ran headlong to the place where her father had been thirtysix subject vanished and so did the cathedral arches of luminous stone and the arid highlands of umae marguerite blinked into a sudden disorienting darkness the darkness became the outline of the windowless conference room on the second floor of the blind lake clinic her knees buckled she grabbed a chair to hold herself upright the wall screen was a flickering rectangle of meaningless noise loss of intelligibility marguerite thought how long had she been away assuming she had been gone at all more likely she had never left this room though every cell of her body proclaimed that she had been on the surface of umae that she had touched the subjects leathery skin with her fingers this empty boardroom the clinic a snowy morning in blind lake rays madness how to reinsert herself in that story she thought of tess tess down in the reception room with chris and elaine and sebastian she took a calming breath and stepped out into the hallway but the hallway was busy with people in white protective suits people carrying weapons marguerite stared uncomprehending until two of them approached her and took her arms my daughters downstairs she managed to say maam were evacuating this building and the rest of the buildings in the installation it was a womans voice firm but not unfriendly well get everyone sorted out once the premises are clear please come with us marguerite submitted to this indignity as far as the clinic lobby where she was allowed to retrieve her winter coat from the back of a chair then she was escorted outside into a razorcold morning and a small crowd of clinic personnel there was no sign of tess or chris and her stomach sank she spotted sebastian vogel and elaine coster as they were herded into a personnel carrier with a dozen other people she called out to them called tessas name but elaine was pulled inside by a helmeted man and sebastian could only wave vaguely toward the west toward the alley visible as marguerite craned her head down the street opposite the mallway marguerite gasped the concrete cooling towers were gone no not gone but encapsulated encased in a scaffolding of knotted silvery spines crystalline minarets and arching buttresses the encapsulating substance grew as she watched sending out radial arms like an enormous starfish tess she thought my baby dont let my baby slip away thirtyseven tess stood at the rim of the abyss that had contained the obec platens and which was now a seething pit of glassy coral growths for a fraction of a second chris appreciated the incongruity of it tess motionless in her dusty overalls and bright yellow shirt as the gallery evolved around her tess gazing into the chasm where her father had disappeared where she was plainly tempted to follow chris walked toward her until she turned her head and gave him a warning look that was unmistakable in its intent he said tess he jumped she said there was noise in the air now a glassy tinkling and grinding chris strained to hear her yes ray had jumped should he acknowledge that ten more steps he thought ten steps and ill be close enough to pick her up and carry her away from here but ten steps was a long way the toes of her shoes tested the abyss is he dead tess asked every instinct told him she would not be easily reassured she wanted the truth the truth i dont know i cant see him tess come closer she said another step no not to me to the edge he moved slowly and obliquely trying to narrow the space between them without alarming her when he reached the pit he looked down pale crystals crawled up the rim of the chamber but the obec platens were lost in a pearlescent fog no sign of ray shes only protecting herself tess said she mirror girl or whatever you want to call her she couldnt depend on the machines to keep her safe anymore so she made her own was tess talking about the obecs had they contrived to regulate their own environment and eliminate their dependency on human beings i cant see him tess mourned can you see him no ray was gone is he dead tess wasnt crying but her grief was etched into her voice a wrong word could fuel her despair and send her toppling over the edge an obvious lie could have the same effect i dont know he said i cant see him either that was at least some of the truth but it was also an evasion and tess gave him a scornful glare i think he died well chris said breathlessly it looks that way she nodded solemnly swaying chris took another small step closer how many more of these incremental movements before he could grab her and pull her back from the edge six seven he didnt like the story he was living in tess said she caught chris in motion and shot him another warning glance im not porry you know you dont have to save me step back from the edge then chris said i havent decided maybe if you die here you dont really die this is turning into a special place it isnt eyeball alley anymore no chris thought it isnt mirror girl would catch me tess said and take me away even so thered be no coming back no no coming back porry wouldnt jump he said how do you know i know porry died tess said shes he was about to deny it but stopped himself in time tess watched his face closely how did you know that i heard you talking to my mom the ultimate porry story how did she die tess asked the truth whatever that meant where did truth live and why was it so alluring and so evasive i dont like to talk about it tess she shifted her weight deliberately one foot to another was it an accident no she looked back into the pit was it your fault another infinitesimal step closer she i could have done better i should have saved her but was it your fault those memories lived in a dark place porrys murderous boyfriend porrys boyfriend weeping i swear to god i wont touch her its the fucking bottle man not me porrys boyfriend on the last day of porrys life stinking of drunk sweat and promising redemption and i believed the son of a bitch so was it my fault how to unravel this monument of pain hed built mourning his sister with every selfinflicted wound tess wanted the truth no he said no it wasnt my fault but the story doesnt have a happy ending a step another some stories dont her eyes glistened i wish she hadnt died chris i wish that too does my story have a happy ending i dont know nobody knows i can try to help give it one tears rolled from her eyes but you cant promise i can promise to try is that the truth the truth chris said now give me your hand he swept her into his arms and ran from the gallery ran toward the stairwell ran against the beating of his heart until he could taste the edge of winter and see at least a little of the sun part four intelligibility marvel not my comrade if i appear talking to you on superterrestrial and aerial topics the long and the short of the matter is that i am running over the order of a journey i have lately made lucian of samosata icaromenippus c ad thirtyeight they crossed the ohio border at the end of a languorous august afternoon chris drove the last leg of the trip while maguerite listened to music and tess dozed in the back of the car they were ultimately bound for new york where chris was scheduled for a series of meetings with his publisher but marguerite had lobbied for a weekend at her fathers house a couple of days of gentle decompression before they were borne back into the world it was reassuring chris thought to see how little this part of the country had changed since the events of last year a national guard checkpoint stood abandoned at the indiana border mute testimony both to the crisis and its passing otherwise it was cows and combines truckstops and county lines many of these roads had never been automated and it was a pleasure to drive for hours at a time with no hands on the wheel but his own no proxalerts overrides or congestionavoidance protocols just man and machine the way god intended he nudged marguerite as they approached the county limits she took off her headphones and watched the road she had been away too long she told chris she was distressed by the shabby mallways drug bars and cordiality palaces that had sprung up along the old highway but the heart of the town was just as she had described it the centuryold police station the commons lined with chestnut trees the more modern trefoil windmills riding the crest of a distant ridge the several churches including the presbyterian church where her father used to preside her father was retired now he had moved from the rectory to a frame house on butternut street south of the business district chris followed her directions and parked at the curbside out front wake up tess marguerite said were here tess climbed out of the car smiling groggily at her grandfather who came down the porch steps beaming marguerite had worried that the meeting between chris and her father might be awkward that fear proved baseless she watched in mild surprise as her father shook chriss hand warmly and ushered him into the house chuck hauser had changed very little in the three years since her last visit he was one of those men who reach a physical plateau at middleage and glide into their seventies only lightly touched by time same saltandpepper beard stubblecut scalp respectably small paunch still wearing the monochrome cotton shirts he had always favored in and out of fashion same blue eyes despite a recent keriotomy he had prepared a meal of meat loaf peas corn and mashed potatoes served on the big dining room table where he informed tess marguerite used to do her homework when she was a girl that had been at the rectory on glendavid avenue she had worked out math problems every evening after dinner sitting next to a big faketiffany lamp that cast a light she remembered as buttery yellow almost warm enough to taste her fathers dinner table conversation made no reference to crossbank blind lake ray scutter or the global events of the previous year he encouraged chris to call him chuck he reminisced at length with marguerite and when tess grew obviously restless he let her take her dessert into the living room where she turned on the quaintly rounded old video panel and began to search for cartoons he came back to the table with a pot of coffee and three mugs until the day i got that call from provo last february i didnt know whether you were alive or dead provo utah was where the people of blind lake had been held after the end of the lockdown six more months of medical and psychological quarantine living like refugees on a decommissioned continental defense force base six months waiting to be declared sane uncontaminated and not a threat to the general population it must have been awful marguerite said not knowing more awful for you than me i imagine i had a feeling youd come through okay the sky outside had grown dark chris finished his coffee and volunteered to keep tess company her father switched on a floor lamp illuminating the oaken bookcase behind the table as a bookish child marguerite had been both drawn and repelled by these shelves so many intriguing buff or ambercolored volumes which turned out on closer inspection to be marrowless churchrelated or inspirational works although she had swiped the kipling just so stories she noticed some books he had lately added astronomy and cosmology titles most published within the last couple of years there was even a copy of sebastian vogels godandscience doorstop he pulled his chair next to marguerites hows tess dealing with the death of her father well enough given the circumstances and considering she just turned twelve she still insists he might not be dead he vanished inside the starfish marguerite winced at that popular name for the obecgenerated structures like lobsters it was a gross misnomer why must every unfamiliar thing be compared to something washed up on a beach lots of people vanished the same way like those socalled pilgrims at crossbank but they dont come back no marguerite said they dont come back does tess know that yes that and perhaps more there were times chuck hauser said when i despised that man for the way he treated you i was more relieved than i let on when you divorced him but i think he genuinely loved tess at least so far as he was able to love anyone yes marguerite said i think thats true he nodded then he cleared his throat a phlegmy bark that reminded her just how old he had become looks like a clear night he said clear and cool youd hardly know its august he smiled come out into the backyard marguerite theres something i want to show you tess had already found something to watch on the video panel one of those twentiethcentury blackandwhite movies she was so fond of a comedy the jokes were either bizarre or incomprehensible it seemed to chris but tess laughed obligingly if only at the expressions on the actors faces chris leafed through a stack of magazines marguerites father had left in the rack beside the sofa they were all news magazines and the oldest dated back to september of last year it was a years history in miniature the burbank murders military setbacks in lesotho the devaluation of the continental dollar the panarab alliance and of course above all else the screaming headlines about crossbankblind lake everything he had missed during the lockdown history from the outside looking in astronomical facilities closed in unexplained govt move no real details but much speculation about the obec platens there was a sidebar explaining how crossbanks processors differed from the usual quantum computers qubits excitons and selfevolving code another issue dated a week later starfish structure resembles final images captured by crossbank quantum scope crossbank had discovered an apparently artificial structure on the watery world of hrb the crossbank processor had promptly generated a nearexact copy of the structure around itself like a kind of spiky armor was this contamination or procreation infection or reproduction both crossbank and blind lake had been immediately quarantined confusion at crossbank some researchers disappeared inside structure sources say automated probes revealed that the labyrinthine interior of the crossbank starfish was a very strange place human volunteers retreated in confusion robots vanished remote telemetry quickly became unintelligible exclusive photos of crossbank anomaly the nowfamiliar image from the air the six radial arms from ground level the iridescent arches and spongiform caverns in the text a note that the material from which the anomaly was constructed was scale invariant under a microscope any piece looks much like the whole thing does to the human eye chris leafed ahead second starfish appears hundreds of miles from crossbank sparks panic the second structure had manifested overnight in a soybean field south of macon georgia apart from a few acres of fallow ground it destroyed nothing and killed no one though a curious farmhand disappeared inside it before local authorities could establish a cordon nevertheless large numbers of residents had fled their homes and spread confusion across the southeast since then five more starfish had appeared in isolated areas around the globe apparently following force lines in the earths magnetic field none had proved dangerous to anyone prudent enough to avoid stepping inside national governments call for calm cite no evidence of hostile intent these had been the weeks of greatest panic the apocalyptic pronouncements and instant cults the hawks and the pilgrims the blockaded highways private plane reported shot down over blind lake nofly zone introducing adam sandoval owner of a loveland colorado hardware store who had since admitted his intention of flying his aircraft directly into the blind lake obec installation aka the alley in order to prevent another manifestation of the kind that had lured his wife away from him sandovals wife had been a pilgrim vanished and presumed dead in a group penetration of the crossbank artifact chris had gotten to know adam sandoval during the postlockdown confinement in provo sandoval had recovered from his coma and his burns though his skin was still shockingly pink where it had been restored he had been contrite about his aborted suicide attempt but remained bellicose on the subject of his wifes disappearance introduced to sebastian vogel in the provo provision line one evening sandoval had refused to shake sebastians hand my wife read your book he said shortly before she decided to run off looking for transcendence whatever that fucking word means dont you ever think about the people you peddle your bullshit to last week sebastian and sue had left provo to set up housekeeping in carmel where a friend had offered sue a job at a realestate firm sebastian was refusing interviews and had announced that there would be no sequel to god the quantum vacuum blind lake event prompts military incursion and rescue blind lake detainees removed to undisclosed location for quarantine debriefing rescue meant a terrifying roundup initiated as soon as the blind lake eye began to transform itself into the familiar symmetric starfish structure quarantine meant six more months of detention under the newly enacted public safety protocols debriefing meant a series of interviews with welldressed and wellmeaning government personnel who recorded everything and often asked the same questions twice most of the population of blind lake had cooperated willingly everyone who had lived through the lockdown had a story to tell the last and most recent issue of chuck hausers newsmagazines contained no screaming headlines only a guest editorial in the back pages what we know and what we dont a survivors perspective and as the fear subsides we can begin to take account of what weve learned and what we have yet to understand something momentous has happened something that still defies easy comprehension were told that we created in our most complex computers what is essentially a new form of life or else we have assisted into existence a new generation of a very old form of life a form of life perhaps older than the earth itself we have evidence from the nowdefunct facilities at crossbank and blind lake that this process has already happened on two lifebearing worlds elsewhere in the local neighborhood and perhaps across the galaxy but the starfish and cant we come up with a more elegant name for these really quite beautiful structures seem little interested in contacting us much less intervening in our affairs we have the example on umae of a sentient culture that has coexisted with the starfish for probably centuries without any meaningful interaction at all this lends credence to those who suggest the starfish represent not only a wholly new form of life but a wholly new form of consciousness which overlaps only minimally with our own we have looked deep into the sky in other words and met at last the limits of intelligibility but there is the counterexample of hrb a planet on which those who constructed the quantum nuclei of the starfish have disappeared altogether perhaps naturally in an extinction event or perhaps not perhaps we are being offered a choice perhaps a species that pursues a genuine understanding of the starfish can reach that goal only by becoming something other than itself perhaps to truly understand the mystery we will have to embrace it and become it wasnt it heisenberg who observed that the seer and the seen become inextricably interlinked it ran to a page and a half and it was a good piece thoughtful and carefully reasoned the byline belonged to elaine coster a respected science journalist only recently released from the quarantine camp in utah chris glanced at tess who was yawning sprawled across the upholstered cushions of her grandfathers sofa tess hadnt mentioned mirror girl to the authorities nor had marguerite nor had chris they had not agreed in advance to a conspiracy of silence it was a decision each had reached singly arising at least on chriss part from a reluctance to report events that could only be misunderstood an untellable tale should a journalist really believe in such a thing but what he had felt was more than just fear of ridicule things had happened that he couldnt explain satisfactorily even to himself things that would never be set in banner headlines tess said without taking her eyes off the video panel im kind of tired getting on toward bedtime chris said he walked her up to the small spare bedroom of her grandfathers house she said she might read until marguerite came to tuck her in chris said that would be okay she sprawled across the comforter on the bed this is the same room i stayed in last time we visited tess said three years ago when my father was with us chris nodded the window was open an inch or so spilling latesummer perfumes into the room tess left the window ajar but pulled the yellowing blind all the way down to the sill hiding the glass you havent seen her since the lake have you chris said her mirror girl no tess said you think shes still around tess shrugged you think about her much tess do you ever wonder who she was i know who she was she was but the words seemed to tangle her tongue and she stopped and frowned for a moment back in blind lake tess had identified mirror girl with the obec processors as if the obecs aroused to a dawning consciousness had wanted a window onto the human world into which they had been born and at both crossbank and blind lake they had chosen tess why tess maybe there was no real answer chris thought any more than the blind lake researchers could say why they had chosen the subject out of countless nearly identical individuals it could have been anyone it had to be someone tess found the thought she had been struggling for she was the eye tess said solemnly and i was the telescope marguerite followed her father into the cool summer night the backyard of the house on butternut street only the garden lights were lit luminescent rods planted among the coleus and she paused to let her eyes adjust to the darkness i assume you know what this is chuck hauser said he stood aside and grinned marguerites breath caught in her throat a telescope my god its beautiful where did you get it optical telescopes for amateur stargazing hadnt been commercially manufactured for years these days if you wanted to look at the night sky you hooked a photomultiplier lens into your domestic server or better linked yourself to one of the public celestial surveys old dobsonian scopes like this sold for high prices on the antique market and this one was genuinely old marguerite realized as she examined it in lovely condition but definitely premillennial no attachments for digital tracking only manual orbits and wormdrives lovingly oiled the works have been restored and refitted her father said new optics ground to the original specs otherwise its totally vintage it must have cost a fortune not a fortune he smiled ruefully not quite when did you take up an interest in astronomy dont be dense margie i didnt buy it for myself its a gift you like it she liked it very much indeed she hugged her father he couldnt possibly have afforded it he must have taken out a second mortgage marguerite thought when you were young chuck hauser said all this stuff was a mystery to me all what stuff you know stars and planets everything you cared about so much it seems to me now i should have stopped and looked a little closer this is my way of saying i admire what youve accomplished maybe im even beginning to understand it so think you can get this thing packed up tight enough to fit it in that little car of yours well find a way i notice you put your luggage in the same room with chris she blushed did i i wasnt thinking really its just habit making it worse he smiled come on marguerite im not some hardshell baptist from what youve said and from what ive seen chris is a good man youre obviously in love have you talked about marriage her blush deepened she hoped he couldnt see it in the dim light no immediate plans but dont be surprised hes good to tess very good she likes him better she feels safe with him then im happy for you so tell me does presenting you with this gift entitle me to offer a word of advice along with it anytime i wont ask what you three have been through at blind lake but i know its been especially tough for tess she used to be a little uncommunicative it doesnt look like thats changed it hasnt you know marguerite you were exactly the same way thick as a brick when your interests werent engaged i always had a hard time talking to you im sorry you dont need to apologize all im saying is its easy to let these things glide past people can become almost invisible to each other i love you and i know your mother loved you but i dont think we always saw you very clearly if you know what i mean i know dont let that happen to tess marguerite nodded now her father said before we pack this thing up you want to show me how it works she found him ursa majoris in the optical scope an undistinguished star no more than a point of light among many points of light less bright than the fireflies blinking under the bushes at the back of the yard thats it huh thats it i guess you know it so well by now it must feel like youve been there thats exactly what it feels like she added i love you too daddy thank you marguerite shouldnt you be putting that girl of yours to bed chris can take care of it it might be nice to sit out here a while and talk its pretty chilly for august i dont care when at last she came back into the house she found chris in the kitchen mumbling over his pocket server making notes for the new book he had been working on it for weeks sometimes feverishly has tess gone to bed shes in her room reading marguerite went up to check the most disturbing thing about the events at blind lake marguerite thought was that they implied a connection over immense distances through a medium not understood a connection that had made it possible for her to touch and be touched by the subject the subject who had known somehow all along that he was being watched seeing changes the seen had tess been watched in the same way had marguerite would that bring them then at the end of some unimaginable pilgrimage to one of those enigmatic places linked to the stars in lieu of death a plunge into the infinite not yet marguerite thought maybe never but certainly not yet she found tess fully clothed asleep on the bedspread with her book splayed open and her hair askew marguerite woke her gently and helped her into her nightgown by the time tess was properly tucked into bed she was wide awake again marguerite said do you want anything a glass of water a story tess said promptly i dont really know a whole lot of stories about him tess said who chris ray her grandfather the subject tess said all the things that happened to him marguerite was taken aback this was the first time tess had expressed an interest in the subject you really want to know about all that tess nodded she lay back and bumped her head against the pillow about one beat per second gently summer air moved the window blinds against the wooden sill well where to begin marguerite tried to recall the pages she had written with tess in mind pages she had written but never shared stories untold but she didnt need pages first of all marguerite said you have to understand that he was a person not exactly like you and me but not completely different he lived in a city he loved very much on a dry plain under a dusty sky on a world not quite as big as this one long ago far away
