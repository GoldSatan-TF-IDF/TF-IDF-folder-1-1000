streets of laredo by larry mcmurtry part i a salaried man most train robbers aint smart which is a lucky thing for the railroads call said five smart train robbers could bust every railroad in this country this young mexican is smart brookshire said but before he could elaborate the wind lifted his hat right off his head he was forced to chase itnot the first time he had been forced to chase his hat since arriving in amarillo he had taken to ramming his hat down on his head nearly to his eyebrows but the texas winds were of a different order than the winds he had been accustomed to in brooklyn where he lived somehow time after time the texas winds lifted his hat before he could even get a hand up to grab it there it went it was just a common fedora but on the other hand it was his only hat and it was not his custom to go through life bareheaded at least not while he was conducting business for the railroad colonel terry would not have approved brookshire was only a salaried man and he could not afford to ignore colonel terrys preferences in such matters this time the hat rode the wind like a fat bird it had a twentyyard lead on its owner before it hit the ground and when it did hit it rolled rapidly along the gritty street fortunately for brookshire a wagon was parked to the south of the station and the hat eventually lodged against one of the wagon wheels he strolled over and picked it up trying to appear nonchalant though in fact he was more than a little out of sorts at the behest of his superiorscolonel terry in particular colonel terry the president of the railroad was the only superior who countedbrookshire had journeyed all the way from new york to hire a bandit killer brookshire was an accountant hiring bandit killers wasnt his line of work but the man who normally handled the task big johnny roberts had accidentally swallowed a wine cork and choked to death just as he was about to depart for texas from colonel terrys point of view it was a nuisance he took a look around the office and before brookshire knew it he was on a train going west in johnny robertss stead in his years with the railroad he had performed a number of services but never in a place where his hat blew off every time he turned a corner having to chase his hat was an aggravation but the real reason he was out of sorts was because he wasnt at all impressed with the killer he had been instructed to hire about the best thing brookshire could find to say for the small wearylooking man standing in front of the little shack of a depot a saddle and a duffle roll stacked beside him was that he had been punctual he had ridden in at dawn hitching his sorrel mare outside the hotel precisely at seven am the time agreed upon still brookshire had barely been able to conceal his shock when he saw how old the man was of course brookshire was aware of his reputation no one in the west had a reputation to equal woodrow calls in brookshires view reputation did not catch banditsat least it didnt catch bandits who covered country as rapidly as young joey garza the young mexican was said to be only nineteen years old whereas captain call from the look of him was edging seventy nonetheless brookshire had been ordered to hire woodrow call and no one else more than that he had been entrusted with a fancy engraved colt revolver which colonel terry had sent along as a special gift to brookshires dismay captain call scarcely glanced at the gun he didnt even bother to lift it out of its rosewood box he didnt twirl the chamber or admire the fine engraving thanks but ill pass he said he seemed more grateful for the coffee of course it was wintry and the old ranger was only wearing a light coat good lord what will i tell colonel terry brookshire asked this gun probably cost him five hundred dollars this engraving is handwork it dont come cheap why the colonel can keep it himself then call said i appreciate the thought but ive no place to keep a fancy weapon id have to deposit it in a bank and i prefer to avoid banks i generally depend on the rifle not the pistol he added if youre close enough to a killer to be in reach of a pistol bullet then generally youre too close good lord brookshire said again he knew colonel terry well enough to know that he wasnt going to be pleased when told that his gift had not been wanted colonel terry hadnt been a colonel for nothing either having such an expensive present rejected by a fellow who just looked like an old cowpoke would undoubtedly put him in a temper in which case brookshire and anyone else who happened to be in the office would have to scramble to keep their jobs call saw that the man was upsethe supposed really that he ought to accept the gun that would be the polite thing but in the past few years governors and presidents of railroads and senators and rich men were always offering him fancy weapons or expensive saddles or the use of their railroad cars or even fine horsesand always something in him resisted for one thing he despised fancy gear he rode a plain saddle and all that he required in a weapon was that it be reliable and accurate for another thing he had never met a governor or a president of a railroad or a senator or a rich man that he liked or felt comfortable with why place himself in some arrogant fools debt for the sake of a gun hed never shoot nor probably even load only a few days before call and charles goodnight had discussed the matter of gifts from the rich and powerful it had been the day in fact that goodnight had ridden out to the little line cabin he let call use when he was between jobs and handed call the telegram asking him to meet a mr ned brookshire in amarillo at seven am in the lobby of the best hotel goodnight himself was famous probably as famous as a cattleman could get he had also been offered twentyfive or thirty engraved winchesters in recent years but like call he was skeptical of the rich and powerful and seldom felt comfortable in their company throughout most of their lives which had only occasionally intersected woodrow call and charles goodnight had not exactly gotten along somehow in the old days the indianfighting days they had rubbed one another the wrong way almost every time they met even now they did not exactly consider themselves friends once a week or so when goodnight was around his home ranch he had formed the habit of riding out to the little line cabin to check on his guest the famous texas ranger the shack sat not far from the north rim of the palo duro canyon often the two men would sit largely in silence looking down into the canyon until dusk and then darkness filled it in the dusk and shadows they saw their history in the fading afterlight they saw the fallen the rangers the indians the cowboys let a man give you a fancy gun and hell tell everybody in five counties that hes your friend when in fact you may despise him goodnight said spitting i dont number too many rich fools among my friendshow about you i have not had a friend for several years call said only after he said it did it occur to him that the remark might sound a little oddas if he were asking for sympathy of course theres pea and theres bol he added hastily bols out of his head but i count him a friend oh your cook i think he fed me once goodnight said if hes out of his head how do you keep up with him i left him with a family in san antonio call said when i get a job down near the border i sometimes put him on his mule and take him with me theres another family in nuevo laredo i can board him with when it comes time to do the work he enjoys a little travel call added hes still got his memorieshe just cant put any two of them together hell i can barely sort out two memories myself goodnight said its what i get for living too long my head fills up and sloshes over like a damn bucket whatever sloshes out is lost i doubt i still know half of what i knew when i was fifty years old you take too many train trips call observed in a mild tone i thought we were talking about my bad memory goodnight said squinting at him whats train travel got to do with it all this traveling by train weakens the memory its bound to call said a man that travels horseback needs to remember where the water holes are but a man that rides in a train can forget about water holes because trains dont drink goodnight let that observation soak in for a few minutes i was never lost night or day he said finally how about you i got turned around once in mexico call said it was a cloudy night my horse fell and got up pointed in the wrong direction i was yawny that night and didnt notice till morning was you mad at the horse when you did notice goodnight asked i was mad at myself call said well this is a pointless conversation goodnight said turning abruptly toward his horse without another word he mounted and rode away he had always been abrupt call reflected when charles goodnight concluded that a conversation had overrun its point he was apt to make a swift departure while mr brookshire was walking back across the street trying to whack the dust out of his fedora by hitting it against his leg the train he and call had been waiting for came in sight it was the train that would in time deliver them to san antonio call was trying to think of a polite way to inform mr brookshire that the fedora wouldnt do in a windy place like texas a hat that kept blowing off could lead to no end of trouble when dealing with a bandit as advanced as joey garza even more call wished brookshire could be persuaded just to go on back to new york leaving him to deal with the young mexican bandit alone traveling across the west with errand boys such as mr brookshire took considerably more energy than tracking the bandits themselves call had little to say to such men but they invariably had much to say to him six hundred miles of mr brookshires conversation was not something he looked forward to this wind puts me in mind of chicago brookshire said when he returned to where call was standing he didnt bother putting his hat back on his head instead he clutched it tightly in both hands ive not visited chicago call said to be polite the winds not like this back home brookshire said back home i can go for months without my hat blowing off my head a single time i got off the train here yesterday and ive been chasing my hat ever since the train wheezed and screeched to a halt when it had come to a full stop captain call picked up his saddle and duffle roll brookshire to his surprise suddenly found that he was feeling a little desperatehe felt that he didnt dare move the wind had become even more severe and he had the sickening sense that he not his hat was about to blow away there wasnt a tree in sight that he could see just endless plain unless he could roll up against a wagon wheel as his hat had there would be nothing to stop him for days if he blew away he knew it was an absurd feeling grown men especially heavy men such as himself didnt just blow away yet the feeling persisted and every time he happened to glance across the street and see nothing nothing at all except grass and skythe feeling got worse call noticed that brookshire had an odd look on his face the man stood with his fedora clutched to his stomach looking as if he were afraid to move yet he was standing on perfectly level ground on a sunny winter day are you ill mr brookshire call asked after all the man had been polite he had agreed to calls terms and had cheerfully paid for the coffee as well id like to get on the train brookshire said i believe ill soon perk up if i could just get on the train why here it is right behind you call told him i assume youve got the tickets we can step right on im afraid ive left my valiseyou see thats my problem brookshire admitted oh at the hotel call asked yes its right in the lobby brookshire said looking at the ground he did not feel it would be wise to look across the street again it was when he looked across the street that the blowingaway sensation seized him the most fiercely well the train just pulled initll be here awhile i expect call said youve got plenty of time to go get your valise then he looked again and realized that his traveling companion was having some sort of attack brookshire was frozen his eyes fixed on his feet he didnt appear to be capable of movingwalking the hundred yards to the hotel was for the moment clearly beyond him i cant do it brookshire muttered i cant do it id just like to get on the train he paused his eyes still on his feet what id like very much is to get on the train he said again call immediately set down his saddle and duffle roll and took mr brookshires arm the man was close to panic and when a man was close to panic discussion rarely helped here ill just escort you to your car he said holding brookshires arm brookshire took one small step and then another soon call had him situated in a railroad seat brookshires chest began to heave and the sweat poured off him but at least call reckoned the panic was broken just stay here and settle in call said ill stroll over to the hotel and pick up that valise grateful was all brookshire could say what he really wanted to do was crawl under the seat but of course that would be impossible anyway the railroad car had walls he wasnt going to blow away a few minutes later captain call came walking in with the valise and with his own saddle and duffle roll he sat down across from brookshire as if nothing untoward had happened but brookshire knew that something had happened something very untoward he was embarrassed and also deeply grateful to the captain not only had he guided him onto the train and then walked two hundred yards out of his way to fetch the valise but he had done both things politely he hadnt asked brookshire why he couldnt walk a hundred yards and tote his own baggage he just accepted that it was an impossibility and put him on the train without a fuss brookshire worked for people who never let him forget that he was an underling captain call hadnt been especially friendly when they met that morning but he hadnt treated brookshire as an underling when he noticed that a crisis was occurring he had dealt with it efficiently and with no evident feelings of contempt for brookshires weakness it was exceptional behavior in brookshires view he had met with a good deal of exceptional behavior in his years with colonel terry but most of it had been exceptionally bad he was not used to decent treatment but he had received it from captain call when his heart finally stopped pounding he took another look at the man who sat across the aisle from him call was smoking if he even remembered that something out of the ordinary had happened on the railroad platform he gave no sign the train started and they were soon cutting a narrow furrow through the endless miles of prairie the stiff wind was still blowing ruffling the surface of the sea of grass does your hat ever blow off captain brookshire asked rarely call said you see ive got mine trained he added looking over at the man from brooklyn youre new to these partsit takes you a while to get yours trained just right i doubt mine will ever be trainedill probably have to chase it all over texas brookshire said then relaxing he fell asleep when he awoke and looked out the window there was nothing to see but grass captain call seemed not to have moved he was still smoking the stock of a rifle protruded from his duffle roll brookshire felt glad call was there it was a long way to san antonioif he had no one to share the ride with he might get the blowingaway feeling again probably after all his superiors had been right in their choice of bandit killers most likely captain call could do the job how long have you been a lawman captain he inquired to be polite call didnt turn his head i aint a lawman he said i work for myself after that a silence grew brookshire felt rather as he felt when he went to a dance somehow he had stepped off on the wrong foot well you picked an exciting line of work id have to say he said captain call didnt answer brookshire felt at a loss he began to regret having made the remarkhe began to regret having spoken at all he sighed the captain still said nothing brookshire realized he didnt know much about texans perhaps they just werent inclined to conversation certainly captain call didnt appear to be much inclined to it he didnt appear to be excited about his line of work either brookshire began to miss katie his wife katie wasnt lavish with her conversation either a month might pass with the two of them scarcely exchanging more than three or four words but the plains outside the window were vast and empty the wind was still blowing rippling and sometimes flattening the top of the grass brookshire began to wish very much that he could go home to brooklyn if only he were in brooklyn and not in texas he might not feel so low if he were in brooklyn he felt sure he would be sitting with katie in their cozy kitchen katie might not say much but in their cozy kitchen the wind never blew lorena woke to the sound of the baby coughing pea eye was up walking her trying to get her quiet for a minute or two lorena let him she felt too sad to movesad or mad or a mixture even without a sick child she was apt to feel that way on nights before pea eye had to leave i guess shes croupy pea eye said give her to me lorena said wearily she propped up a little took the baby and gave her the breast its not the croup its that dry coughyou ought to recognize the difference by now lorena said the boys all had the same coughclarie didnt have it as she said it she heard clarie go past their bedroom on her way to milk clarie was the oldest at fifteen she already had more energy than most grown men and she didnt have to be told to do the chores even pea eye admitted that there were days when his clarie could outwork him and pea eye was neither lazy nor weak i guess im just the worrying kind pea eye said relieved that the baby had stopped coughing if only in order to nurse theres other diseases children can have besides croup lorena reminded him seems like every time i have to leave someone around here is sick pea eye said ill be dreary company for the captain worrying about you and the children he would worry about them lorena felt sure but right at the moment what he wanted was sympathy and right at the moment sympathy was the last thing she was in the mood to give him youre the one going off to get shot at she reminded himthere was anger in her voice she couldnt suppress it clarie and i can take care of things here she said if we have trouble the neighbors will help usim their only schoolteacher theyll fetch me a doctor if laurie gets worse when the little girl finished nursing lorena held her out to pea eye he took her with him to the kitchenhe needed to get the coffee started it was a fourhour trot to the railroad where he was supposed to meet the captain he needed to be on his way soon but when he tried to saucer his coffeehe had long ago formed the habit of drinking his coffee from a saucer laurie wiggled causing him to pour too hard most of the coffee splashed out when lorena came into the kitchen pea eye was looking for a rag he needed to wipe up his spill i wish youd learn to drink coffee out of a cup like the rest of us lorena said its just a habit i got into when i was rangering pea eye said i didnt have no babies to hold in those days i could concentrate better i was just a bachelor most of my life same as the captain is you were never the same as the captain is lorena informed him she took the baby and scooted a chair well back from the table so coffee wouldnt drip on her gown i hadnt learned to be married yet in those days pea eye said mildly lorie seemed slightly out of temperhe thought it best to take a mild line at such times no you hadnt learned to be marriedi had to teach you and im still at it lorena said were both lucky clara got me started on my education and i got you started being a husband both lucky but im luckier pea eye said id rather be married than do them fractions or whatever they are that you teach the brats at least i would if its you that im married to he said reflecting i dont like it that he keeps taking you away from us lorena said she felt it was better to say it than to choke on it and she had choked on it a good many times why cant he take someone younger if he needs help with a bandit she asked besides that he dont even ask he just sends those telegrams and orders you to come as if he owned you though pea eye had not yet admitted it out loud to lorie he himself had begun to dread the arrival of the telegrams the captain dispatched them to the little office in quitaque they were delivered within a week or two by a cowboy or a mule skinner any traveler who happened to be coming their way they were short telegrams even so lorena had to read them to him she had learned to read years ago and he hadnt it was a little embarrassing being the husband of a schoolteacher while being unable to read clarie of course could read like a whizshe had won the local spelling bee every year since she turned six pea eye had always meant to learn and he still meant to learn but meanwhile he had the farm to farm and farming it generally kept him busy from sunup until sundown in the harvesting season it kept him busy from well before sunup until well after dark usually the captains telegrams would consist of a single sentence informing him of a date a time and a place where the captain wanted him to appear short as they were though lorena never failed to flush with anger while reading them to him a deep flush would spread up her cheeks nearly to her eyes the vein on her forehead would stand out and the little scar on her upper lip would seem whiter in contrast to her darkening face she rarely said anything in words her blood said it for her now down on one knee in the kitchen trying to wipe up the spilled coffee with a dishrag pea eye felt such a heavy sadness descend on him that for a moment he would have liked just to lie down beneath it and let it crush him little laurie was only three months old lorena had school to teach and the baby and the three boys to look after and yet here he was about to go away and leave them again just because some railroad man wanted the captain to run down a bandit of course clarie was nearly grown and would be a big help to her mother but knowing that wouldnt keep him from feeling low the whole tripevery night and morning hed miss lorie and the children he would also worry constantly about the farm chores that werent getting done even if little laurie hadnt taken the crouphe considered her sickness the croup though lorie didnthe wouldnt have wanted to go it was beginning to bother pea eye a good deal that the captain just couldnt seem to recognize that he was married not only was he married but he was the father of five children he had other things to do besides chase bandits when he left he would be doing one duty but at the same time hed be neglecting others and the ones hed be neglecting were important it meant feeling miserable and guilty for several weeks and he didnt look forward to feeling that way the truth was half the time he felt miserable and guilty even when he wasnt neglecting his wife or his children or his chores ive heard its a young bandit this time pea eye said maybe it wont take too long why wouldnt it if the mans young lorena asked the captains got too much experience pea eye said the young ones seldom give him much trouble if its going to be so easy why does he need you she asked pea eye didnt answer because he didnt know twice he had gone to wyoming with the captain once they had gone to yuma arizona an exceptionally hot place in pea eyes view several times theyd gone to oklahoma and once or twice into old mexico but normally they were able to corner their quarry somewhere in texas a few hard cases fought to the end but the majority of the outlaws bank robbers mostlyrealized once they were up against the famous captain call it was time to surrender as soon as they gave up pea eyes duties really began he was in charge of seeing they were handcuffed properly or tied to their horses or whatever the situation required compared to indian fighting it was not particularly dangerous work he rarely had to fire his gun or even draw it it hardly seemed important enough to leave home for yet here he was preparing to leave home and feeling blue all the way down to his bones as a result i expect ill worry the whole way pea eye said but at least ill be paid cash money lorena was silent she hated the mornings when pea eye had to leave hated the night before he left just plain hated the whole period after one of the telegrams came she knew pea eye no longer wanted to leave living with her working the farm helping her with the children was what he wanted to do she didnt doubt his love or his devotion or his loyalty or his strength all these were at her service except when captain call needed some part of them to be at his service lorena had resolved though not to help pea eye leave the fact that he had a loyalty to the captain was part of the bargain she had made when she married him clara allenthe woman clarie was named forhad told her how it would be in that respect and clara had been right were pea eye not loyal to the captain who had employed him most of his life he wouldnt be likely to bring much loyalty to her either clara pointed that out but she would not help pea eye leave she wasnt going to pass a benediction on it as she was sitting in silence avoiding pea eyes miserable gaze clarie came in from the milking shed with a brimming pail of milk it was a cold morning the bucket steamed a little and clarie had color in her cheeks lorena couldnt help smiling even in unhappy moments the sight of her beautiful young daughter was apt to make her smile clarie got a cheesecloth spread it carefully over the old milk strainer and slowly poured the hot foamy milk through it ill help you ma while pas gone clarie said why yes youll help me when you can spare the time from roy benson lorena said clarie was a young woman and the cowboys were already coming around the gawky benson boy was particularly attentive oh ma dont talk about him clarie protested embarrassed like i say its cash money pea eye said feeling that his problem had somehow been forgotten it was often that way with women it seemed one minute lorie would be drilling holes in him with her eyes and the next minute she and clarie would be combing one anothers hair and singing tunes we heard you lorena said it was true that her wages for the schoolteaching were apt to be a side of beef or handmedown clothes for the children or a horse that was getting along in years and might do to pull her buggy her wages were likely to be whatever folks could spare it was a fair arrangement indeed the only possible arrangement in a place where there were still only a scattering of homesteads and not many settlements pea eye had only brought up the cash money in order to remind lorena that the captain didnt expect him to work for nothing having cash money never hurt another bad aspect of the banditcatching trips was that the very fact lorena had secured enough education to become a schoolteacher caused some tension between pea eye and the captain lorenas educational accomplishments filled pea eye with pride and he liked to talk about them it was clara allen the woman who sheltered lorena in nebraska who had seen to it that lorena learned to read and write and figure perhaps that was why the captain got so stiff every time pea eye bragged about his smart wife clara and the captain rubbed one another the wrong way that was no reason though in pea eyes view why he should be any less proud of lorenas scholarly skills clara had gone all the way to st louis to find acceptable teachers for lorena and of course the teachers were expected to instruct claras two daughters as well clara boarded the teachers in her own home often for months at a stretch betsey her oldest daughter had even married one of them everyone agreed that lorena was the sharpest pupil in that part of nebraska for a time clara ordered books for her but soon lorena was ordering them for herself it was a proud day for all concerned when lorena received her diploma from the correspondence college in trenton new jersey once they bought the farm in texas the neighbors soon found out about lorenas diploma and they promptly persuaded her to teach their children her first classes were held in a barn charles goodnight rode by one day saw her teaching in the cold drafty barn and wrote a check on the spot sufficient to allow the community to construct a oneroom schoolhouse on a bluff overlooking the red river the school was a fivemile buggy ride each way from their farm but lorena drove it without complaint when their babies came she took them with her lining an old cartridge case with quilts to make a crib to pea eye and to many citizens of the plains it was impressive that lorena would care enough about her teaching to bounce her children ten miles over the prairie every day she didnt want to disappoint her pupils most of whom could only expect three or four years of schooling at best once the boys got to be nine or ten they would be needed for work the benson boy who liked clarie so much was still in school at fourteen but that was exceptional even the girls would be needed in the fields by the time they were eleven or twelve lorena thought captain call resented the fact that his old partner gus mccrae had left her his half of the proceeds from the herd the hat creek outfit had trailed from texas to montana lorenas half didnt amount to that much moneynot enough to resent in pea eyes view the whole montana scheme had collapsed in less than two years gus was killed before they even established the ranch dish boggett their top hand quit the first winter the captain left that spring newtthe captains son most people thought although the captain himself had never owned to ithad been killed late in the summer when the hell bitch the mare the captain gave him reared and fell back on him the saddle horn crushed his rib cage and crushed his heart as well it was the view of everyone who knew horses that while an able ranch manager newt was much too inexperienced to trust with a horse as mean and as smart as the hell bitch still the captain had given newt the horse and newt felt obliged to ride her he rode her and one day she killed him just as lippy and jasper and one or two others had predicted she would after newts death the ranch soon fell inffdisorder the captain had to come back and sell it cattle prices were down so he didnt get much but lorenas half enabled her and pea eye to buy the farm in texas lorenas view expressed to clara not to pea was that the captain wasnt prepared to forgive her hard past he dont think whores should become schoolteachers she said to pea eye lorena advanced a different theory he didnt like it that gus liked me she said now that you married me ive taken two men from him i took gus and then i took you hell never forgive it but i dont care pea eye preferred to put such difficult questions out of his mind with so much farm work to do and no one to do it but himselfnone of the boys was old enough to plowhe had little time to spare for speculation if he had more time he wouldnt have used it trying to figure out why the captain did things the way he did or why he liked people or didnt like people the captain was as he was and to pea eye that was just life lorena and clara could discuss it until they were blue in the face no talk would change the captain it bothered pea eye considerably that the captain had never ridden over to see their farm or meet their children his shack on the goodnight place was not that far away pea eye was proud of the farm and doubly proud of his children he would have liked to introduce the captain to his family and show him around the farm instead in only half an hour he would have to leave his wife and children to go help a man who didnt like his wife and had never met his children the thought made pea eye sick at heart catching bandits was tricky work there was no telling how long it might take little laurie was tiny she had come nearly a month early and was going to have to struggle through a bitter panhandle winter pea eye loved little laurie with all his heart he thought she looked just like her mother and could not get enough of looking at her he had bought a rabbit fur robe from an old deaf kiowa man who lived on the quitaque the robe made a nice warm lining for the cartridgebox crib lorena kept assuring him that it was a snug enough crib now that it was lined with rabbit fur but still pea eye worried the cold was bitter winter never failed to carry off several little ones from neighboring farms and ranches pea eye had many dreams in which little laurie died it tormented him to think she might not be there to look at when he returned for days he had been choking his fear downno need to burden lorie with his worriesbut suddenly kneeling on the kitchen floor and trying unsuccessfully to wipe up the spilled coffee fear and sadness came rushing up from inside him too swiftly and too powerfully for him to control i dont want to go this time he said what if laurie dies while im gone he thought lorena would be mighty surprised to hear him say that he didnt want to go with the captain never before had he even suggested that he might not accompany captain call if the captain needed him lorena didnt seem surprised though perhaps she was too busy with laurie because laurie was so tiny she was a fitful nurser giving up sometimes before she had taken enough milk to satisfy her lorie had just given her the breast again hoping she would take enough nourishment to keep her asleep for a while what if we all died while you was gone lorena asked calmly she didnt want any agitated talk while the baby was at the breast but her husband had to be very upset to say such a thing and she didnt want to ignore his distress either well id never get over it if any of you died pea eye said you wouldpeople get over anythingive got over worse than dying myself and you know it lorena said but thats in the past you dont need to worry so much im not going to die and i wont let this baby die either i wont let any of our children die pea eye stood up but despite lories calm words he felt trembly he felt he could trust lorieif she said shed keep their family alive he knew she would do her best but people did their best and died anyway sometimes their children outlived them that was the natural order but sometimes they didnt he knew lorie meant well when she told him not to worry but he also knew that he would worry anyway the captain would be unlikely to sympathize because he didnt understand it captain call had always been a single man he had no one to miss much less anyone to worry about i never finished cleaning those guns pea eye said distractedly looking down at his wife august the youngest boy not yet two came wandering into the kitchen just then he was rubbing his eyes with his fists hongry he said only half awake he began to crawl into his mothers lap you cleaned them enough to smell like gun grease all night lorena said august had a runny nose and she held out her hand for pea eyes rag this is a dishrag he said still distracted it wasnow its a snot rag lorena said august arched his back and tried to duck awayhe hated having his nose wiped but his mother was too skilled for him she pinned him to her with an elbow and wiped it anyway you should take care of your weapons if youre going after a killer she said i dont want you neglecting important things even if i complain about you being smelly i dont want to go pea eye said i just dont want to go this time there was a silence broken only by augusts whimpering and the soft sucking sound the baby made as she drew on the nipple pea eye had just said the words lorena had long hoped to hear but the fact was she hadnt gotten her sleep outshe was drowsy and would have liked to go back to bed it was a hopeless wish august was up and ben and georgie would be crawling out of bed any time whether she liked it or not the day had begun she had long resented pea eyes blind loyalty to the captain but knew there was nothing she could do about it mainly she just tried to shut her mind to it clara had told her that was how it would be but clara had advised her to marry pea eye anyway hes simplesometimes thats good clara said hes gentle too but hes not weak his horses respect him i tend to trust a horses respect he doesnt talk much though she added i dont care whether he talks or not lorena said i wouldnt marry a man just for conversation id rather read now that i know how than listen to any man talk youre going to have to propose to pea eye you know clara said he has no inkling that you want him i doubt its ever crossed his mind that he could aspire to a beauty like you pea eye had been working for clara about a year at that time july johnson the former sheriff from arkansas who had loved clara deeply but failed to win her drowned trying to ford the republican river with a herd of seventy young horses july had no judgment about horses or water or women as it turned out his son martin was going to know more but that was because martin had her to teach him clara reflected after newts death and the breakup of the hat creek outfit pea eye had drifted south meaning to descend the ladder of rivers until he got home to texas but as luck would have itthe best piece of luck in his whole life in his viewhe showed up in ogallala at a time when clara was shorthanded and she hired him on the spot out her window as she was advising lorena to marry him clara could see pea eye in the lots trying to halterbreak a young sorrel colt of course pea eye was older too old in a way for lorena but people couldnt have everything clara herself would have liked a husband she considered herself to be reasonably goodlooking she attempted to be considerate and thought she was tolerably easy to get along with but she had no husband and no prospects decent men were scarce and she knew that pea eye was a decent man lorena had little to gain by waiting for someone better to come along and clara told her so looking at her husband so shaky from the thought of leaving her that he could barely stand up lorena knew that clara allen had been right he was loyal to her and loyalty from men was a rarity in her life even gus mccrae her greatest love had really been in love with clara and would have left her to marry clara if he could have persuaded clara to have him someday lorena imagined some bandit would finally outshoot captain call and she would finally have pea eye all to herselfif he could just stay alive in the meantime coffee was still dripping off the tablepea eye had made a poor job of wiping up his spill he patted august on the head and left the room in a few minutes he came back wearing his hat and carrying his slicker he didnt have his guns are your guns so dirty youre planning to leave them she asked surprised never before had he left without his guns i wont need them pea eye said im just going to the railroad to tell the captain i cant go on no more chases with him though it was exactly what she wanted to hear lorena felt a little frightened pea eye had followed the captain wherever the captain went for many many years so many that she didnt know how many and pea eye probably didnt know either rangering with the captain had been pea eyes life until she took him from it for pea eye to end it now just because the baby woke up coughing represented a big changeindeed a bigger change than she had anticipated having to face on that particular day pea she said you dont have to do this just because of me you dont have to do it because of the children either we arent in any danger and well all be here when you get back only lately had she been able to remember to say arent rather than aint she was proud of herself for remembering it so early in the morning when she was sleepy all i ever asked is that you be careful she said help this man if you want to just dont get killed for him i aint going to get killed for him because i aint going pea eye said ive got too many obligations here this chasing bandits has got to end sometime he walked out to the little smokehouse and got a slab of bacon when he returned to the kitchen the three boys ben georgie and august were all propped up in their chairs looking sleepy and eating bread soaked in the warm milk clarie had brought in it was their usual breakfast although sometimes if lorena was up early she made porridge clarie sat on a stool churningthey had run out of butter the night before you boys help your ma while im gone pea eye said forgetting that he wasnt really going this time lorena turned to look at him wondering if he had changed his mind that would have been unlike him it might take pea eye a while to make up his mind but once he made it up he rarely doubled back on himself oh pea eye said realizing from lories look that he had made a slip of the tongue help your mother this morning he said ill be back this afternoon daddy buy me a gun ben said ben was nine and fascinated with firearms no hes not buying you a gun lorena said youd just shoot georgie and i cant spare georgie georgie seven was strawheaded and bucktoothed but he was lorenas favorite anyway she couldnt help it every time she looked at georgie she felt her heart swell he had a bit of a stammer but he would grow out of it probably ill shallshallshallshoot havehavehim georgie countered pea eye picked up his slicker and put on his hat he looked at lorena who met his eye she didnt say anything but there was something disquieting in her look of course that was nothing new there was something disquieting in most of lorenas looks pea eye tried to think of something more to say but failed he had never been a man of many words and being married to a schoolteacher hadnt changed him much hundreds of lories looks like this one left him baffled see you for supper he said finally if you dont show up ill know you changed your mind lorena said he might talk you into going yet no he wont talk me into going pea eye said all the same loping across the plains he dreaded the meeting he was riding to it was a fine crisp day but pea eye didnt feel fine he had never said no to the captain and now he would have to the captain wasnt going to like the news eitherthe captain definitely wasnt going to like the news when captain call saw pea eye standing by the railroad track with no duffle and no firearms he knew that the moment of change had come it was an unpleasant shock but it was not a surprise lorena had been tightening her hold on pea eye year by year in the last two years particularly pea eyes reluctance to accompany him had been evident and had even begun to affect his work half the time on their trips he was too homesick or womansick to function as skillfully as he once had and his skill had its limits even when he was a young man well i guess ive stopped this train for nothing if you aint getting on call said he was annoyed and he knew pea eye knew it but since pea eye had arrived without his equipment he saw no profit in forcing the issue id better just go call said good luck with your farm he shook pea eyes hand and got back on the train which in a moment left soon even the caboose had vanished from pea eyes view swallowed up by the sea of grass as surely as a boat would have been by the curving sea pea eye walked slowly over and caught his horse it had grazed some distance away he felt stunned the captain was gone the captain hadnt even argued with him though he had looked a good deal put out of course he noticed immediately that pea hadnt brought his guns forget your arsenal the captain asked when he first stepped off the train no i didnt forget it i just left it at home pea eye said a man in a fedora had been looking out the window of the train at them pea eye was uncomfortable anyway and being stared at by a man in a fedora hat didnt help oh thats brookshire hes with the railroad the captain said glancing around at the man hell have to replace that hat if he expects to travel very far with me a man who cant keep his hat on his head wont be much help in mexico i guess i wont be being no help in mexico neither captain pea eye said ive got a wife and five children and ones a baby the times come for me to stay home though call had been expecting such a decision from pea eye for some time hearing it was still a shock he had paid pea especially well on the last few trips hoping to overcome his reluctanceit took money to farm and what little lorena had inherited from gus must have been long gone by now but call knew pea eye too well to suppose that money or anything else would prevail much longer pea eye was through with rangering and call had to admit that what they were doing was only the shadow of rangering anyway call always felt angry when he anticipated pea eyes desertionand in his eyes it was desertionbut there by the train tracks on the windy plain just north of quanah he swallowed the anger down shook pea eyes hand and got back on the train the woman had won in the end it seemed they always did brookshire was startled when he saw the captain come back alone the man looked testy then the train pulled away leaving the tall man and the grazing horses behind on the prairie whats wrong with your man brookshire asked was he sick no hes not sick hes married call said running down bandits dont tempt him no more but i thought it was arranged brookshire said more than a little alarmed his instructions from colonel terry had been to let call bring his man pea eye himself was a legend in a small waybrookshire had been looking forward to meeting him it was said that he had escaped from the cheyenne indians and had walked over one hundred miles naked to bring help to the other famous ranger augustus mccrae not many men could have walked one hundred miles naked in cheyenne country and survived brookshire doubted that he could walk one hundred miles naked across new jersey and yet new jersey was settled country and his home state to boot he had hoped to meet the man and hear about his adventures so far he was certainly not hearing about many of captain calls it would have been entertaining to hear about the hundredmile walk but evidently it was not to be i apologizehes always been a reliable man call said he served with me more than thirty yearshes the last man i would have thought likely to marry he never sought women when he rode with me oh well i married myself brookshire said thinking of katies fat legs those legs had once had great appeal to him but their appeal had diminished over the years there were times when he missed katie and times when he didnt when he wasnt missing her he sometimes considered that he had been a fool to tie himself down indeed he was hoping that one bonus from his long train trip might be a mexican girl the popular view in brooklyn was that mexican girls were pretty lively and cheap wholl we get to replace him he asked remembering that colonel terry expected resultsand not next year either joey garza had struck seven times stopping trains in remote areas of the southwest where trains were rarely bothered he had killed eleven men so far seemingly selecting his victims at random seven of the dead had been passengers the rest crew four of the seven trains had been carrying military payrolls and one of the seven had leland stanford aboard at that time leland stanford was thought to be the richest man in california the boy had taken his rings his watch and the fine silk sheets off the bed in his private car he also took his diamond cuff links leland stanford was not a man who took kindly to having his sheets removed by a young mexican not yet out of his teens it was stanford who stoked the fire under colonel terry prompting him to hire expensive help such as captain woodrow call it disturbed brookshire that their plan had already gone awry though they were still hundreds of miles from the border and no doubt many more hundreds of miles from where joey garza was to be found if he was found one thing could be said with certainty about colonel terry he did not like for plans to go awry if some did go awry anyway someone invariably got blamed and most of the time that someone was brookshire ill be lucky not to get fired brookshire saidhe was mainly just thinking out loud why pea eye was never your responsibility call said you never even met the man and cant be blamed for the fact that he married and settled down i can be blamed for anything brookshire assured him im one of those people everybody blames when theres a misfortune for several minutes he sat with his head down feeling sorry for himself it seemed to him that life was nothing but one misfortune after another and he got blamed for them all he had been the seventh boy in a family of eight children his mother had blamed him for not being the little girl she had hoped for his father blamed him for not being able to go out in the world and get rich his brothers blamed him for being a runt and in the army he was blamed for being a coward that one was fair he had to admit he was a coward more or less fisticuffs appalled him and gunfire alarmed him violently he didnt like storms or lightning and preferred to live on the first floor of apartment buildings so escape would be easier in case of fire he had been afraid that katie wouldnt marry him and once she did he began to fear she would leave him or else die but of all the things he had managed to be frightened of in his life colonel terrys anger was unquestionably the most powerful brookshire feared the terry temper so much that he would rather bite his tongue off than give the colonel even the smallest particle of bad news call didnt doubt what brookshire said a man who couldnt even control his hat was likely to attract a lot of blame in that respect call reflected brookshire was not unlike pea eye himself pea had a strange tendency to assume that any bad turn of fortune was probably his fault on the long cattle drive to montana various things happened that could not easily have been prevented one morning the little texas bull that all the cowboys feared got into a fight with a grizzly the grizzly definitely didnt fear the bull the fight was more or less a draw though the bull got much of his hide ripped off in the process of holding his own for reasons that no one could fathom pea eye decided the encounter was his fault he felt he should either have roped the bull or shot the bear though neither in calls view would have been sensible procedure if he had roped the bull it might well have jerked peas horse down in which case the bear would have got them both if pea had tried to kill the grizzly with a sidearm the bear might have turned on the cowboys instead of on the bull five years and more later pea eye was still worrying about his role in the encounter what it showed was that people werent sensible when it came to assigning or assuming blame people were rarely sensible about anything in calls opinion he had taken he thought a sensible approach to pea eyes desertion while he was actually in the mans presencebut now that he wasnt actually faced with his old corporal call found that his anger was rising he had taken pea eye into his troop of rangers when the latter was no more than a boy too young to be an official member of any military organization but because the boy looked honest call had bent the rules which were more bendable then than they would become now it seemed pea eye had deserted him in favor of matrimony and the desertion left a bitter taste in his mouth call had supposed that if he could count on any of his old troop he could count on pea yet it turned out to be lorena once a whore now a schoolteacher who could count on pea call had no doubt that clara allen had been behind the match and though fifteen years had passed he still resented her interference it was one thing to educate lorena whores had as much right to improve themselves as anybody else but it was another thing to arrange matters so that the girl could take his most trusted helper dish boggett the best of the hat creek cowboys and far better on horseback than pea had ever been had mooned over lorena for years why couldnt clara have nudged the girl into accepting dish up to that time pea had shown no great inclination to domesticity though he briefly courted or was courted by a rather bossy widow in the village of lonesome dove the trail drive had ended that if thered been anything to end because of claras meddling or lorenas boldness or a combination of the two call was riding south with only a yankee office worker to go after the most enterprising young bandit to show up on the border in a decade or more it galled callwhen he next encountered pea eye he intended to make that clear i regret now that i didnt force him call said to brookshire it leaves us shorthanded its just that i never expected to have to force pea eye hes always followed me before brookshire noticed that the captain looked a little tight around the mouth how long has your friend been married he asked fifteen years i suppose he had a number of children though i have not met them call said you have not married yourself i take it brookshire asked cautiously he did not want to annoy the man as he clearly had earlier in the day by asking him how long he had been a lawman oh no call said its one thing i never tried but youre married and youre here your wife hasnt stopped you from doing your duty why katie wouldnt care if i went to china brookshire said shes got her sewing and then theres the cat shes very fond of the cat call said nothing he knew women were sometimes fond of cats though the reason for the attraction escaped him so what will we do for a second man now that your deputy has declined brookshire asked know any good gun hands in san antonio nobody reliable call said i dont know what a gun hand is but if i ever happened to meet one i doubt id want to hire him no offense brookshire said thats just what we call them in new york i would rather do the job alone than to take someone unreliable particularly if we have to go into mexico call said we might i guess brookshire said he did rob that train with the governor of coahuila on it that was his worst act after robbing mr stanford i doubt he knew the governor was on the train call said that was just luck i doubt he ever heard of mr stanford either i hadnt myself until you mentioned him maybe i ought to wire the colonel brookshire suggested the colonel could raise an army if he wanted to im sure he can find us one man no call said ill do my own looking your colonel might find the wrong fellow i leave it to you captain brookshire said call didnt answer the question of pea eyes replacement was not one he was ready to consider he was still brooding about pea eye the man who hadnt come his temper kept rising too it rose so high that it took all his selfrestraint to keep from stopping the train and going after pea eye part of his anger was directed at himself for having been so mild and meek in the face of plain desertion of course in strict terms it wasnt desertion no war was on he himself wasnt even a ranger anymore and neither was pea the man wasnt really in his employ and they were just going to eliminate a bandit no very glorious cause or glorious work either but then none of their work had been glorious it had all been bloody hard and tiring from their first foray against the kiowa until now there were no bugles no parades and very few certainties in the life they led as rangers call had killed several men indian white and mexican whose courage he admired in some cases he had even admired their ideals many times going into battle a portion of his sympathies had been with the enemy the mexicans along the border had been robbed by treaty of country and cattle that had been their grandparents the comanche and the kiowa had to watch the settlement of hunting grounds that had been theirs for many generations call didnt blame the mexicans for fighting he didnt blame the comanche or the kiowa either had he been them he would have fought just as hard he was pledged to arrest them or remove them not to judge them but he did blame pea eye for not coming with him on the trip of course the reasons pea gave were not empty excuses he did have a wife to care for children to raise and a farm to work in calls view there was an obligation stronger than those and that obligation was loyalty it seemed to him the highest principle loyalty he preferred it to honor he had never been exactly sure what men meant when they spoke of their honor though it had been a popular word during the time of the war he was sure though what he meant when he spoke of loyalty a man didnt desert his comrades his troop his leader if he did he was in calls book worthless jake spoon a friend he had ended up having to hangthere was an example of a man without loyalty jake had rangered with gus and call he was as pleasant and engaging a man as call had ever known but he had no loyalty as he had proven in kansas when he ran off with a gang of thieving killers when they caught him jake could scarcely believe that his old companeros would hang himbut they hung him pea eyes case was far less extreme of course he hadnt thrown in with killers and thieves he had merely married pea was not a man who could be said to be without loyalty but he had changed loyalties and what did that say the whole point of loyalty was not to change stick with those who stuck with you pea eye had proven his loyalty countless times on the old trails but then he had chosen a new trail thinking about the matter caused call to alternate between anger and sorrow one minute he wanted to ride over to the quitaque and order pea eye to get his rifle and saddle and come but the next moment he felt he ought to respect pea eyes choice and leave him in peace with his wife his children and his farm he himself would have enjoyed the trip south a great deal more if pea had been along but then he was not in the business for enjoyment he guessed he was in the business to make a living once there had been more to it than that or at least he had convinced himself that there was more to it the politicians said that the killing he had done was necessary call was no longer so sure it had been necessary but even if it had always been in the main a way to make a living loyalty to ones own was still the first duty and he felt a painful pressure in his breast when he thought of pea eyes defection brookshire looked at the long plain outside the train window and sighed the train seemed to creep there was nothing but the horizon to measure its progress by and the horizon was just an endless line he remembered that he had some books in his valisedime novels he had provided himself with in kansas city in case he came down with the doldrums during his travels there was also a pack of cards in his valise on the whole he preferred card playing to reading card playing didnt wear the mind down so captain are you a cardplaying man he asked hopefully a good game of cards would go a long way toward relieving the tedium of train travel no call said well i didnt really think you were brookshire said he sighed and rummaged in his valise until he found the dime novels he pulled them out glanced at them and put them back where he found them after a little more rummaging he located the pack of cards i reckon itll be solitaire then he said with another hopeful glance at the captain captain woodrow call didnt say a word on his way home pea eye made a detour in order to ride by the schoolhouse the little building was perched on a low bluff overlooking the red river he could see it in spots from fifteen miles away pea rarely went to the school on the few occasions when he did show up there lorena made it plain that he should state his business and then go on about it the school was her place on an active day she had as many as thirty children to manage and she needed to pay attention clarie was so good with spelling and also with arithmetic that lorena sometimes let her daughter help her with the little kids but she was the schoolmistress and most of what had to be done she did still pea eye felt an urgent need to see his wife even though he knew she would not be at her most welcoming at first when captain call politely shook his hand and got back on the train pea felt relieved the captain didnt seem quite himself but at least he hadnt been angry and he had not attempted to insist that pea eye go with him but pea eyes relief scarcely lasted until he was out of sight of the train he felt good for a few minutes but then he began to feel strange it was as if he were leakingemptying out like a bucket that had bullet holes in it he began to feel sadthe same sadness he had felt in bed the night before he had lain beside lorena then warmed by her body wishing he didnt have to go anywhere now it was clear that he wouldnt have to go he could be with his wife and children and get on with his many chores the spring winds had blown a corner off the roof of the barn all summer and fall he had meant to get it mended but he hadnt now he could attend to it and to other much needed repairs as well he could do whatever he wanted to around the place yet he felt so sad he could hardly keep from crying his memories were getting mixed up with his feelings thinking of the barn with the leaky roof reminded him of the barn that had belonged to the hat creek outfit way south in lonesome dove that barn had no roof at all for years of course it seldom rained in lonesome dove so the stock didnt suffer much as it would have if that barn had been in the panhandle but the stock wasnt really what was on pea eyes mind or in his memory what was on his mind was the old hat creek outfit itselfhis old companeros the men he had ridden withfor years captain call of course and gus mccrae and deets and newt and dish boggett old bol the cook and jake spoon soupy and jasper fant and all the rest now they were scattered not merely all over the cattle country but between life and death as well gus had died in miles city montana of gangrene in his leg deets was killed by an indian boy in wyoming jake they had to hang in kansas then the boy newt a good boy whom pea had always liked and respected had the life crushed out of him by the hell bitch way up on the milk river pea loved his wife and children and he couldnt imagine life without them he hadnt wanted to go with the captain and he still didnt but despite that he missed his old partners of the trail the boys would never ride out together again they would never be an outfit again it was sad but it was life he knew too that the captain must have had a hard time holding his temper when he discovered that he would have to go after joey garza alone the matter of the bandit didnt worry pea eye though he couldnt imagine a bandit that the captain couldnt subdue that was just the order of things it was lorena though who kept pointing out that the order of things could change nothings permanent she insisted well get old and the children will grow up ill get old firsti guess im old now pea eye answered you wont get old for a long time i dont know about that lorena said ive borne five children it dont make you younger now riding beside the pale river with its wide sandy bed occasionally catching a glimpse of the schoolhouse where his wife spent her days pea eye had to admit that the order of things had changed this was one of the days when it changed lorena saw pea eye coming through the glass window of the school room the glass had to be ordered from fort worth and the whole of the quitaque community was proud of it few were the settlers who could afford glass windows for themselves here comes your pa she said to clarie i wonder if captain call lit into him he better not have he dont own my pa clarie said she deeply resented the captain a man she had never met he had never even come to meet her and the other children yet he loomed in her life because of the power he had to take her father away she knew her father felt obligated to the captain but she didnt know why it wasnt the captain who had given her mother the money to buy the farm her mother resented the old man too clarie knew that from eavesdropping on her parents half the arguments she had overheard as she was growing up had to do with captain call they were not arguments really her father didnt know how to argue or didnt want to but her mother certainly knew how to argue her mother said many ugly things when she was mad mostly her father just quietly obeyed her mother he tried his best to do what she wanted him to do the only times he didnt was when the captain needed him then he just saddled up and left i thought he went with the captain clarie said surprised to see her father coming no he didnt go lorena said he finally stood up to the man goodness clarie said it was a big shock a big change are you glad ma i will be when i know i can trust it lorena said she had been about to test some of the older children in multiplication but she closed her arithmetic book and went to the back door of the school pea eye rode up looking a little hangdog he knew she didnt really like for him to show up at the school she didnt like to see him looking hangdog either thoughit made her feel that she must have been mean to him she didnt want to feel that she had been mean to pea in the years of their marriage he had never raised his voice much less his hand to her in anger he knew she wasnt an angel and yet year in and year out pea treated her like one a man that steady was rare and she knew it still the fact was she was busy she had an arithmetic class to teach and few of her pupils were adept at arithmetic well the captain left without me pea eye said quietly he felt out of place he always did when he visited lorie at the schoolhouse he wasnt really even sure why he had come he felt sad inside and just wanted to be with his wife for a few minutes did he fuss at you lorena asked she was touched that pea had come she lived with many doubts but she never had to doubt that pea eye needed her if he needed anything he needed her at the moment he looked gloomy and pale lately he had been waking up with bad headaches are you sick honey she asked softening suddenly why was she so stiff with him so often he just seemed to bring it out in her for no better reason than that he loved her to distraction she liked it that he loved her but she wished sometimes that he wouldnt be so obvious about it no he just shook my hand and left pea eye said have you got one of those headaches she asked its pounding pea admitted this horse has got a stiff trot it isnt the stiff trot its the stiff wife lorena thought to herselfno point in saying it to pea he usually didnt know he was being punished even when he was being punished severely wait a minute she said turning back into the schoolhouse clarie was comforting a little boy who had wet his pants the childs mother had gone berserk that winter and had to be sent away two days out of three the little boy wet his pants in the schoolroom he missed his mother badly clarie you better go home with your pa lorena said hes feeling poorly but ma roy and i were going to study together clarie protested looking across the room at roy benson roy was the tallest boy in the school by several inches and he was also the nicest he was nearly as tall as her pamaybe that was why she liked him so you can study with roy tomorrowyour pa needs you today lorena said but wholl help you with laurie and the boys on the way home clarie asked trying hard to come up with a good reason why she should stay roys folks were thinking of taking him out of school since he couldnt be spared from the ranch work much longer she hated to miss even one day with roy the benson ranch was fifteen miles from their farm clarie felt she would never get to see him once he left school since when have i not been able to get home with my own children lorena asked a little impatiently she was anxious to get clarie and pea eye gone the children were beginning to act up as they always did when her attention wavered for more than a minute or two roy benson was usually the instigator too he was a bright boy but full of the devil well you can take care of them but laurie is my sister and i like to help with her clarie said you do help but now i need you to help your father lorena said i wouldnt ask it if i didnt need it clarie gave up the look in her mothers eye was a look you didnt argue with if you were smart can i just go tell roy i cant study with him today she asked ill tell him lorena said he aint made of air clarie hell be here tomorrow ma you said aint clarie told her startled her mothers grammar only slipped when she was angry or in a hurry yes because youre vexing me lorena said you know i slip up when you vex me roy might not be here tomorrow clarie said returning to the original point at issue his folks might make him work and then ill never get to see him she felt bitter roy was the only nice boy she knew and now his folks might make him leave her in order to help with the cow work but bitter or not she knew it was unwise to provoke her mother past a certain point and that point was not far away with another futile glance at royhe was teasing a little kid and did not see hershe went outside and obediently climbed up behind her father windmill her fathers big gray horse grunted but at least didnt break wind for some reason hearing horses break wind embarrassed her keenly at least it did when there was a man around even if the man was her father pa do you like roy benson she asked as they were trotting homeward roy hes gangly but then so am i pea eye said billy williams had to walk the last five miles into ojinaga because he lost his horse it was a ridiculous accident it was sure to hurt his reputation as the last of the great scouts and his reputation had been slipping badly anyway the horse became misplaced as a result of the fact that billy had to answer a call of nature he had been riding at a sharp clip all the way from piedras negrasthe news he had was so urgent that it prompted him to neglect the call until disgrace was at hand then he failed to tether his mount properly and the horse wandered off perhaps because of the sharp clip he had maintained or the tequila he had drunk while maintaining it billy relaxed so much in the course of his call of nature that he dozed off for a few minutes still squatting that in itself was nothing new since he often nodded off for a few minutes while squatting in response to natures call squatting was a position he found completely comfortable in fact it was one of the few that he did find comfortable when he stood up straight he coughed too much his diagnosis was that a couple of his ribs were poking into a lung the result of an encounter a few years back with a buffalo cow that looked dead but wasnt lying flat on his back was not a good position either a headache usually accompanied that position probably because billy never lay flat on his back unless he was dead drunk the fact was his horse wasnt very far away billy just couldnt see him his vision had once been so sharp that he could see a small green worm on a small green leaf at a distance of thirty yards now he couldnt even see his own horse if the horse was thirty yards away it was a sad state for a great scout to have come to willie you best retire his friend roy bean told him the last time the two of them visited a man as blind as you are ought not to be riding this river you could fall in a hole and be swallowed up and that would be that roy bean didnt deliver that opinion with much concern in his voice like most of roy beans pronouncements this one got said mainly because the man was vain and arrogant he had never been able to get enough of the sound of his own voice though it held no particular charm for anyone but himself youre blind drunk nine days out of tenwhat keeps you from falling in a hole and being swallowed up billy asked the fact is i sit here in this chair in this saloon not nine days out of ten but ten days out of ten roy bean said if i could sit here in this chair eleven days out of ten i would i dont go wandering off where there might be a hole that could swallow me up that point was hard to dispute roy bean seldom left his chair even seldomer did he leave his saloon and never so far as anyone living knew had he been outside the town of langtry texas a town that consisted mainly of roy beans saloon but then i aint the last of the great scouts roy bean said i dont have to go traipsing through the gullies i got no reputation to maintain i wont fall in no hole billy assured him i wont get swallowed up neither i would have to be a lot blinder than this before i quit tracking billy added though that claim was bravado traveling was becoming more and more worrisome and as for tracking he probably could track an elephant if he could stay in hearing distance of it but tracking anything smaller including his own horse was a hopeless matter well if you do avoid holes theres the problem of killers roy bean reminded him you cant see in front of you or behind you or to the side the dumbest killer in the west could sneak up on you and cut your throat billy refrained from comment the two of them were sitting in roys dirty flyblown saloon while they were having the discussion the saloon was hot as well as filthy and the liquor cost too much but it was the only saloon around and contained the only liquor to be had along that stretch of the border roy bean out of a combination of boredom greed and vanity had recently appointed himself judge of a vast jurisdictionthe transpecos westand nowadays hung people freely often over differences amounting to no more than fifty cents it was an ominous practice in billys view he had often found himself having differences with roy bean amounting to considerably more than fifty cents roy had been told by many of his constituents that he shouldnt hang people over such paltry sums and of course he had a ready reply a man that will steal fifty cents would just as soon steal a million dollars and he would if the opportunity presented itself roy said roy the opportunity aint going to present itself not around here billy pointed out nobody around here has a million dollars to steal not many of them has fifty cents not in cash money well i have fifty cents roy said i mean to keep it too if i was to steal it would you hang me billy asked he didnt suppose roy to be a man of much tolerance but he thought hed ask the question anyway id hang you as soon as i could find my rope roy said amiably weve known one another a long time billy reminded him ive nursed you through several fevers and i once killed a mexican who had it in for you i expect he would have cut your throat later in life if i hadnt laid him out whatd you shoot this mexican fellow with roy asked he was a master of the diversionary question billy had to stop and think several years had passed since the encounter and his memory had grown almost as cloudy as his eyesight it wasnt no colt he said finally i dont remember what it was a gun of some kind what difference does it make hes dead which is one reason youre alive now youre telling me youd hang me for fifty cents i consider that harsh well i dont know that i could put my hands on my hanging rope in a hurry roy said you might escape if you were agile who said you could be a judge anyway billy inquired id want to see some papers on it before i let you hang me since when can you read law papers roy asked ive known you for too long and ive never seen you read anything unless you count a pack of cards i could read if it was that or be hung billy said you cant just say youre a judge and have it be true there has to be some papers on it somewhere out here west of the pecos you can be a judge if you want to bad enough roy said i want to bad enough suppose i only stole a dime billy asked what would happen then same sentence if you stole it from me roy said i need my dimes if you stole ten cents from a mexican i might let you off the loss of any sum is more than i can tolerate officially he added i cant tell that youve ever amounted to much roy billy informed him its irritating that you set up to be a judge of your fellowman so late in life its all because of this saloon its the only saloon around here and thats why you think you can be a judge i admit it was a timely purchase roy said you didnt purchase it you shot the owner billy reminded him tom sykes i knew him he was nothing but a cutthroat himself thats rightso i purchased his saloon with a bullet roy said three bullets in all tom wasnt eager to die thats still cheap billy said not as cheap as one bullet roy said the sad truth is my marksmanship has declined in my prime i would not have had to expend that much ammunition on tommy sykes because of the saloon it was necessary to put up with roy but the more urgent necessity was to get to ojinaga and give maria the news he had picked up in piedras negras it was a great annoyance to billy that because of a long shit and a short nap he had lost his horse but that was the truth of it and there was nothing he could do but limp along by the time he finally stumbled up to marias house billy was exhausted his head was swimming from the strain of the long walk and he was sweating a rainstorm he had to grope his way through marias goats her goats seemed to think he had come hurrying all the way from piedras negras just to feed them maria heard the goats bleating and went out to have a look someone had seen a cougar near the village she didnt want a cougar getting one of her goats but they were only bleating at billy williams who looked as if he might fall on his face at any moment wheres your horse she asked walking out to have a better look at him she had known billy williams for many years sometimes she let him stay at her house because he loved her children and would help her with them far more than any of her husbands ever had he also loved her but that was not a matter she allowed him to discuss wheres joey i got bad news billy said stopping amid the goats maria frightened him a little she always had he presumed nothing when he came to her house joey lefti dont know where he went maria said damn the luck billy said ive traveled a long way to bring him some news and now im tired im tired and im blind and im old and im thirsty you can sleep in the saddle shed maria said come inill feed you and give you coffee i cant do nothing about your other problems id rather have a bottle of beer if you can spare one billy said limping into the house i seldom walk in the heat and i wouldnt have today but my horse escaped i dont keep beer in my house maria said you know that you stay here if you want beer youll have to go to the cantina well whats the harm in beer billy asked wishing maria didnt sound so stern he didnt know why he had asked for beer since he knew she didnt keep it maria had been wonderfully beautiful once probably she was still beautiful because of his poor eyesight all he could see when he looked at her face was a dim outline he had to fill in the outline with his memories when he was younger he had coveted her greatly he would have married her or given her anything for a taste of her favors but he had never tasted them he still did covet maria although he couldnt really see her now except in his memories the harm is not in the beer maria told him the harm is in men drunk men some of them beat women some of them have beaten me if you want beer go to the cantina but tell me your news first this is important news billy said he saw a water bucket sitting by the stove with a dipper in it he limped over and helped himself to a dipperful the water was cool and sweet before he knew it he had helped himself to three dipperfuls dont you even know which direction joey went billy asked maria didnt answer she didnt like to answer questionsnot about her son joey not about anything what she knew was hers no one had a right to it unless it was her children and even their rights had limits much of what she knew was for no one to know it was hers and by knowing it she had survived people were curious women were even worse than men in that respect but that was not her problem where does the wind go she said joeys young a thousand miles isnt long to joey no and a thousand miles might not be far enough eitherthis time billy said maria just looked at him he was in disgusting condition filthy and drunk his weak eyes dripped rheum down his cheeks which were red from years of drinking but he had been loyal to her and her children for many years billy was the only man who had been good to joey when joey was small he had bought joey his first saddle he just walked up with it one day and gave it to joey when joey was six it was joeys happiest day the day billy brought him the saddle maria was with juan castro then her second husband and her worst juan castro was so jealous that maria never dared tell him that joey was her son so she pretended he was her dead sisters child even so in that same year juan castro sold joey to the apaches maria was away in agua prieta helping her mother die when she returned to ojinaga and found her son gone she was wild she told juan castro she would kill him the first time he went to sleep he beat herhe had beaten her many timesand left maria never saw him again but she didnt have to kill him his own brother did it in a fight over a horse at that point she went to billy williams and begged him to go trade with the apaches to get her son back maria had never sold herself she had never been with any man she didnt want but she was desperate she offered to be with billy williams if he would go save her son she had never said such words to a man before she considered herself a modest woman she had picked badly when it came to men but she had picked for love joey was her firstborn and she knew the apaches would kill him if he angered them or else they would trade him themselves farther and farther north so that she could never find him maria didnt want to live if joey was lost and yet she had her children to raise the two she had by juan castro rafael the boy had no mind and would die without her care teresa the girl was bright and pretty and quick but born blind rafael lived with the goats and the chickens teresa his sister was never far from him for she was the only one who could understand rafaels jumbled words maria knew she wouldnt have the strength to raise her damaged children unless she got joey back if she lost her firstborn she would give up she would whore or do worse than whore billy was said to be a good scout since he could talk the indian tongues for the sake of her children she didnt want to give up so she went to billy williams and offered herself to her surprise billy williams who had often pursued her and even tried to marry her looked embarrassed oh no that wouldnt be righti couldnt have that billy said he tilted his chair back as if to remove himself from the slightest temptation for a moment maria felt hopeless she had nothing else to offer and now the man was refusing what he had often sought it wouldnt be right billy repeated dont disturb yourself about it mary ill find joey he found joey far to the north in the sierra madre but the apaches wouldnt trade him all he could tell maria was that joey looked healthy and could speak apache better than he could a year later when maria was so unhappy billy feared she would die he went again to the sierra madre but again he had to return and report failure he had taken enough money that time to buy joey but joey was nowhere to be found he had escaped and even the apaches couldnt catch him since then no one had caught him he showed up in ojinaga a week after billys return just as maria was slipping into hopelessness later joey claimed that it was his years with the apaches that enabled him to rob gringo trains so easily the apaches held a hard school but they knew much joey learned what they knew and he had not forgotten it tell me your news maria said im here and joeys not the railroads hired woodrow call thats it billy saidhe was glad to have it out you know who that is dont you i shouldhe hung my father and my brother maria said and my brotherinlaw my sisters a widow because of call well thats who theyve hired billy said its a compliment i guess a railroad wouldnt spend that kind of money on just any bandit do you know call maria asked the name sent a chill through her she had loved her father and her brother they had done no more than take back horses that the texans had taken from them no living man had caused her as much grief as woodrow call not the four husbands three of whom beat her not the gringos who insulted her assuming that because she was a brown woman she was a whore now call wanted joey he wanted her firstborn i know the man but the acquaintance aint real fresh billy said i rangered for him about a month once but he turned me out for drinking on patrol im older than he is and ive drunk when i had a thirst all my life it dont affect my vigilance much but the captain didnt believe me or didnt like me or something he turned me out would you recognize him maria asked why yes i expect i would billy said if he comes here show him to me maria said why so you can kill him billy said maria didnt answer billy knew better than to repeat the question repeating questions only made maria close up more tightly what was your last husbands name he asked changing the subject its slipped my mind roberto sanchez maria said i dont see himdid he leave he asked he left maria said that makes four husbands by my count billy said the two mean ones and benito and this one i dont know if this one was mean why are you counting my husbands maria asked despite herself she felt some amusement poor skinny and blind as he was billy still had some life in him he was still interested in her enough to want to know if her husband was around life still amused him once it had amused them both a lot they had danced together laughed together there were times when it still amused maria but those times were rare it interested her though that an old man with no money and almost no eyesight could still derive amusement from the things humans did and he could still want her i just like to keep track of your husbands its my pastime billy said why did senor sanchez leave if i aint prying youre prying maria said my feet hurt tell me anyway billy said maria smiled billy couldnt see the smile but he could tell that her tone was a little less severe he wished he could see her face all he could see was a sort of outline he left me because he didnt like me maria said why he married youwhy didnt he like you billy asked he liked the way i look maria said he mistook that for me i sympathize with him ive often made the same mistake billy said im sure id make it again if i could see better i think joey went to crow town maria said she didnt want to talk about her husbands or her dealings with men crow town good lord billy said joey is young maria said he likes such places im old i dont billy said id almost rather crawl off and die than go to crow town who said you had to go maria asked woodrow call has hung enough mexicans billy said i better go and warn joey swift as he is he might get away if my going to crow town will help then ill go to crow town you dont listen maria said you dont let me talk and when i do you dont listen ill go to crow town myself youll go billy said how long do you think youll last in that stink hole long enough to warn my son maria said no ill go joey relies on me to keep him informed about lawmen and such billy said you lost your horse maria reminded him well it aint the only horse billy said i can get another horse i doubt even woodrow call would go to crow town he added everybody that lives there hates him hed have to kill the whole town youve forgotten how he is maria said if hes hired to go there hell go if they sent him to kill joey hell go wherever joey is well i mean to get there first even if i have to walk billy said the man turned me out i cant forget it thinking about crow town gave him such a terrible thirst that he limped off to the cantina and bought two bottles of tequila there was an outhouse behind the cantina that afforded him a little shade and he sat down in the shade and drank one bottle rapidly midway through the second bottle as he was about to pass out a vaquero came riding up leading billys lost horse i found your horse old man pedro the vaquero said billy found that the mere thought of his horse not to mention the sight of him to the extent he could see him made him furious the willful beast had caused him not only discomfort but embarrassment for a man of his prestige to have to walk into a onesaloon town such as ojinaga was little short of disgraceful without hesitation but not without difficulty he managed to extract his pistol from its holster his hand didnt seem to want to go where his brain told it to his hand often rebelled in such fashion when he was drunk but he eventually got the pistol more or less firmly in his grasp and without worrying too much about aiming he emptied it in the direction of pedro and the horse of course he had no wish to injure pedro who was a decent vaquero he only meant to shoot the horse in the head if possible but the only casualty of the fusillade was a little white goat who happened to be standing idly by just in the wrong spot gracias pedro said tipping his hat to the old man who leaned against the outhouse wall thats one less goat to get in my way pedro was a little disgusted the old man had once been a renowned scout he had been good enough to track indians it was said he had once been a notable shot too now he couldnt hit his own horse at a distance of twenty yards in pedros view it would be better for such men to die and not go around shooting other peoples goats later billy found a bush that offered better shade than the light outhouse he finished the second bottle of tequila and took a little nap when he awoke with an empty bottle and an empty gun beside him maria was kneeling by his legs she seemed to be looping a rope around his legs her spotted mare was standing with her he could just make out the spots then he was being dragged slowly if the dragging had been rapid it would have upset his stomach when the dragging stopped he was behind marias house near the pump before billy could give the matter more thought he found himself under a waterfall cold water was splashing in his face he felt he could drown if he wasnt lucky from the flood of water but when it stopped splashing he was not drowned he tried to raise up and bumped his head hard on marias pump she had been pumping water in his face i have to go find joey maria said look after my children dont let anything happen to them well i wont billy said are you armed no i dont like guns maria said you ought to take my pistol youd be safer he told her i dont want your gun billy maria said if i have a gun some man might take it away from me and beat me with it i want you to stay here and see that rafael and teresa come to no harm but billy persisted finally maria took the gun as she rode away on her spotted mare billy realized that she had called him by his name that was a change it had been several years since maria had called him by his name when bolivar saw the captain he began to cry capitan capitan he said sobbing call had grown used to it since bol cried every time he showed up but brookshire meeting the old man for the first time was embarrassed the place where the old man boarded was only a hovel made of mud or of a mudlike substance at least soon josefeta the mother of the family that cared for bolivar was crying too god sent you just in time captain she said in a shaking voice we cant have bolivar with us no more roberto has no patience with him he hits him well he oughtnt to hit him call said whats bol done to bring it on last week he set himself on fire josefeta said sometimes he cuts himself in the night he cries out and wakes the children call sighed bols hair was snow white he was still crying and shaking he needs a haircut call said the old mans hair was nearly to his shoulders making him look shakier than he was last time we cut it he grabbed the scissors and tried to stab ramon josefeta said then he cut himself i think he wants to end his life its a mortal sin call had a good deal of respect for josefeta she had nine or ten children and a husband who was apparently none too nice the money he paid her for keeping bol was probably about all that kept the family going he knew that dealing with the old man must be a trial but he had not supposed it to be such a severe trial that they were considering putting the old man out brookshire was appalled the old man was sure to be an impediment to their travels although the captain had made it clear that they were only taking him as far as laredo still in brookshires reckoning every minute counted that was colonel terrys philosophy too of that there could be no doubt the colonel expected them to catch joey garza before he robbed any more trains particularly any more trains that might happen to be carrying a military payroll the military did not take kindly to having its money snatched hints had been received the military let it be known that they might have to find other modes of conveyance if the young mexican struck one more time one of josefetas little boys came around the house leading bolivars mule the boy had saddled it for him it was with some difficulty that they managed to hoist bolivar onto the mules skinny back the experience darkened brookshires mood even more the old fellow could not even mount his own mule unassisted but captain call seemed undisturbed he was patient with bolivar and he gave the woman a nice sum of money for the trouble shed had im sorry for the trouble josefeta call said hes just old and wandering in his mind maybe a little travel will improve his spirits as they got ready to depart children began to gather around the old man and his mule they seemed to be about half and half boys and girls and all were weeping we dont want him to go we love him josefeta said only roberto has no more patience im afraid something bad will happen brookshire had been worried all morning but as they made their way at a slow pace toward the outskirts of town he found that the heat was so great it overwhelmed even his capacity for worry it was winter on the plains but summer still in san antonio at night brookshire lay in his little hotel room as hot as if he slept in a box with a stove under it his underclothes were soaked his bedclothes soaked he sweated so much that he awoke in a puddle the hotel room had windows but no breeze blew through them all that came through them was mosquitoes wasps and other flying bugs each morning he woke up feeling more fatigued than he felt when he went to bed if the captain was bothered by the heat it didnt show if he was bothered by anything it didnt show he had taken brookshire with him to visit the sheriff of san antonio call wanted to see if the man might have a reliable deputy he could spare mr brookshire represents the railroad call said he thought that was enough information to give out being introduced as if he were colonel terry or somebody important perked brookshire up briefly it made him feel like a bankerhe had often regretted that he hadnt become a banker it was a breeze to his vanity going around with the famous ranger but long before evening came brookshire had sweated out his vanity the one cheering thing he could think of was that his wife katie wasnt along katie disapproved of sweat she considered it uncivilized in her view nice people didnt get drunk spit in public break wind or sweat on occasion in the summertime when the brooklyn heat was at its most intense katie even denied him her favors in order to maintain her standards in regard to sweat walking around san antonio in the heat or lying in his little box of a room at night brookshire had at least one thing to be grateful for he and katie werent leading their conjugal life in south texas feeling as she did about sweat life would be bleak if they lived in san antonio where even the briefest embrace would be bound to give rise to a good deal of sweat a sheriff in the town a young man much in awe of the captain had no deputies to spare so the captain spent the rest of the day looking at horses and pack mules or choosing the equipment they would need on a journey up the river it was at this point that brookshire gave the captain a bad start when colonel terry instructed his people to send the captain a telegram he meant of course to make it clear that brookshire was to accompany him from beginning to end that is until joey garza was dead or caught the colonel didnt spend money recklessly brookshire was a trained accountant for more than twenty years he had kept up with the colonels bills the only bills he wasnt allowed to see were those that pertained to the colonels mistress a mystery woman named miss cora no one in the office had ever seen miss cora though it was known that the colonel kept her in an apartment on fifth avenue once in a while a bill for flowers or jewelry would get misdirected and arrive in the office a circumstance that invariably threw the colonel into a temper why that idiot thats for cora he would say snatching the bill and stuffing it into his pocket the colonels wife another mystery figure was known in the office as miss eleanora she was thought to be prim and her primness in the minds of the office workers explained miss cora and the apartment on fifth avenue and the jewelry and the flowers now and then seeing one of the misdirected billsthey were always from establishments of high reputebrookshire would dream a little he would imagine that he was as rich as the colonel and able to keep a nice girlie one whose standards in the matter of sweat were not as high as katies he thought of this girlie as his miss belle for he liked the name belle of course it was just a little dream brookshire knew that he would never be as rich as the colonel and even if he did acquire a little more money he might never find a girl named belle who would care to live in an apartment on fifth avenue and receive flowers and jewelry from him it was just his little dream the point though that startled captain call was that colonel terry expected brookshire and his ledger books to accompany call on his chase the captain had been promised his expenses as well as a substantial bonus in the event of rapid success an expedition even a small one was bound to incur expenses so naturally brookshire was expected to keep a full accounting mostly when trouble had arisen in the past it had involved dirty work on the part of colonel terrys rivals in chicago or cleveland or buffalosomeplace civilized in those cases brookshires job was to rein in the pinkertons as a rule pinkertons were inclined to be casual about money and the colonel wasnt employing captain call to catch joey garza was not as simple as hiring the pinkertons to beat up a switch buster there was only one point of similarity which was that in both cases the colonels money was being spent and when the colonels money was being spent he expected a full accounting why doesnt the man trust me call asked when brookshire revealed that he was expected to accompany him the colonel dont trust god brookshire said the comment just slipped out colonel terrys unwillingness to trust was not lost on any of his employees he was constantly popping into the office to inspect their work when brookshire turned in his ledgers at the end of each week the colonel sat right down took out his big magnifying glass and went over the pages line by line call was inspecting a stout gray gelding that he thought might do when brookshire revealed that he was expected to come along call had just lifted the horses foreleg in order to inspect the hoof he was going into rocky country and the animals would need good feet the notion that brookshire a man who couldnt keep his hat on his head was planning to go with him into mexico had never occurred to call bol shaky as he was would be less of an impediment at least bol was used to hard living and he was mexican brookshire seemed to be a decent man but decency was one thing experience entirely another call had no idea whether the man could even ride but mr brookshire he said youre not equipped and this isnt your line of work i know youre a family man and there is some danger involved to be blunt id rather not take you id rather not go neither but what choice do i have brookshire asked im a salaried man i work for colonel terry he expects me to keep the daily accountsbesides that he expects reports reports call asked yes im expected to report brookshire said it was clear from the captains stern look that he was not pleased with what he was hearing if you capture the young mexican or kill him the colonels going to want to know right away brookshire added hes a stickler for promptness i expect hes a stickler for results too call said what if i dont catch the young bandit promptly enough what if he manages to rob the army a few more times brookshire felt uncomfortable with the question he had not been the only one in the office to voice doubts about the captains age of course everyone admired calls reputation he had undoubtedly been the best there was once in his prime joey garza probably wouldnt have lasted a week with the captain in pursuit but now the man was old and looked it if colonel terry could see him he would probably have taken back his offer or at least reduced the stipend i hope im not getting deaf call said i didnt hear you answer what happens if i aint quick enough hell fire you in a minute brookshire said im glad you admit it call said ill get joey garza for you but i cant say when ill get him and god couldnt either mexico is a big placeso is west texas we might not be handy to a telegraph office the day the colonel decides to fire me captain just catch the bandit brookshire said dont worry about colonel terry too much worrying about the colonel is my job couldnt you get another job call asked i dont think you enjoy this one too much this colonel of yours sounds like hes rough on the help brookshire didnt deny it but refrained from confirming it he had learned to be cautious in remarking about the colonel remarks uttered hundreds of miles from the office nonetheless had a way of reaching the mans ear i like a loyal man call said seeing that brookshire had nothing to say i think you are a loyal man but being loyal dont mean youre suited for this work its unreasonable of your boss to expect you to do work youre not trained for he is unreasonable though brookshire said before he could check his tongue he expects me to go and i better go i admit i aint qualified im about as unqualified a man as you could find anywhere but here i am im expected to go send the colonel a telegram call suggested tell him youve caught the texas itch tell him the doctor says youre not to ride for six weeks whats the texas itch brookshire asked wondering if he would catch it how do you get it you just get it call said amused the man was so green it was almost painful to see call couldnt help thinking what a time his old friend gus mccrae would have had with mr brookshire gus would have joshed him within an inch of his life no doubt he could have thought up diseases far more frightening than the texas itch well i dont want it brookshire said i dont want to take you off and get you killed either call said can you shoot i can point a rifle fairly well brookshire said i learned that much in the war but then they made me a medical orderly i havent pointed a rifle since how long since youve ridden a horse call asked my experience with horses is mostly limited to horse cabs brookshire admitted i may not have personally ridden a horse myself in a fair number of years i did sit on a camel once he remembered it was at the hippodrome it was the colonels birthday whats the hippodrome call asked its a show place brookshire said buffalo bill has performed thereive seen him three times i even saw old sitting bull the colonel has met buffalo bill and sitting bull too i expect call said nothing have you met mr cody brookshire inquired feeling a little uneasy stern as the captain could be when he spoke he was even more stern when he kept silent ive not had the pleasure call said dryly he considered cody a showoff and braggart no doubt he had killed a number of buffalo but any man with a gun and a reasonably good aim could have killed a number of buffalo back when there were millions of them once while in el paso call had seen a picture of some of the indians who worked in codys show the indians were sioux and they were playing baseball call supposed when he reflected on it there was no reason why sioux indians shouldnt play baseball what else did they have to do there was no reason why they shouldnt be paid money to race around a ring and pretend to rob stagecoaches either cody was clearly a man of some enterprise he figured out that people who had never seen a free indian much less fought one would pay money to watch such things there might be no harm in it but it didnt cause him to be eager to make the acquaintance of bill cody or of sitting bull either anyway the colonel insisted that i sit on the camel and get my picture took brookshire said it had been innocent enoughjust a birthday party at the hippodrome but brookshire felt merely mentioning it had taken him down a notch in the captains estimation he didnt suppose he had ever occupied a very high place in the captains estimation but he couldnt afford to drop many more notches you cant ride and you dont know whether you can shoot the captain said in a tone that was not unkind your hat blows off every few minutes and the heat dont suit you we may have to cross a desert or two to catch joey garza we may never catch up with him and if we do he might shoot us both shoot you brookshire said surprised why i dont expect he could shoot you he might call said hes said to be a notable shot but youve got a reputation brookshire said the colonel wouldnt have hired you otherwise theres one sure thing about my reputation mr brookshire call said it wont stop a bullet thats why id rather not take you with me i dont want to take you off and get you killed killed brookshire said why would i get killed it occurred to brookshire that the heat might have affected his hearing he had worked for the railroad for many years but never before had the question of dying arisen accountants didnt get killed not even traveling accountants such as himself during the worst troubles in the chicago yards he had still rested comfortably in a hotel room at night and had even allowed himself a nip of brandy now and then killed or not the colonel expects me to go brookshire repeated in a voice that wavered a little try him with the texas itch while i inspect these horses call said youll have ample time to send your telegram brookshire did send a telegram he didnt mention any disease or disability for that might only cause the colonel to put him out to pasture after much thought and a few trial runs he whittled his telegram down to a sentence and a query captain call unwilling to take me on the expedition stop advise brookshire the reply was immediate and also brief insist that you accompany call stop no compromises entertained terry brookshire showed the telegram to call just before they set off to collect bolivar call looked at it and handed it back to him ill compromise if he wont call said ill try you as far as laredo you can help me watch bol sometimes he wanders off in the night you can ride one of the spare horses could i have a gun brookshire asked what kind of gun call asked a rifle i guess brookshire said or a shotgun and a few pistols i believe id feel more comfortable if i was armed help yourself call said theres a hardware store right across the street ive got to see a blacksmith and buy some extra horseshoes ill see if i can locate you a saddle while im at it ill be ready in thirty minutes call arrived back thirty minutes later riding one horse and leading two more plus a pair of mules to find that brookshire had equipped himself with two large colt revolvers a winchester and an eightgauge shotgun good lord call said what do you expect to do with an eightgauge shotgun well the fellow in the hardware store recommended it brookshire said defensively he had been proud of his big shotgun but now the captain was looking askance at it and his confidence began to sag the captain picked up the gun and hefted it to his shoulder a time or two itll take a whole mule just to carry the shells he remarked handing the shotgun back to brookshire the man said it would be useful for selfdefense brookshire said i cant dispute that call said itll kick you into next week but if you survive the kick you probably wont have to worry much about the enemy the revolvers are the newest model brookshire said unhappily the sense that he was totally unfit for what he was about to do struck him with renewed force but the die seemed cast captain call had turned away and he was methodically strapping baggage onto one of the pack mules from there they went to retrieve the old mexican who was out of his mind by the time the full heat of the day arrived they had left the last mud hovel behind and were headed across a dusty thorny plain toward the mexican border the horse that had been chosen for brookshire was a thin sorrel named dob i dont understand the name brookshire said wishing the beasts spine werent so thin he had expected his saddle to afford him more comfort than it did its just a name call said maybe he was named after a dirt dobber but thats just a guess brookshire was wondering if colonel terry would honor the bill for dob the horse had cost eightyfive dollars a vast sum in brookshires mind what if colonel terry had only meant to allow him a sixtydollar horse where would the difference come from call had insisted that brookshire dispense with the fedora and buy a proper felt hat he had also insisted on equipping him with rough clothes boots even chapaderos the leggings that were necessary in the brush country near the border the result call had to admit made the man look ridiculous not only in his eyes but in the eyes of almost everyone who saw him somehow his yankeeness was more potent with the clotheshe looked like nothing so much as a new york accountant who had been forced to assume a costume that was completely out of keeping with his nature brookshire himself had felt quite selfconscious in his new clothes but once they rode out of san antonio he found that how he looked was the least of his worries his new hat seemed to weigh several times as much as his beloved fedora he had not considered the fedora beloved until he tried the new hat which besides being heavy fitted him so tightly that it gave him a headache the heat didnt help his headache nor did the boots help his feet they squeeze dont they brookshire said but captain call looked as if he had no idea what brookshire could be talking about the captains boots apparently didnt squeeze to brookshires surprise and dismay sitting on dob was somewhat like sitting on a saw the horse was very lean and the saddle narrow and hard though his head hurt and his feet hurt and he felt that within a few miles he would probably be sawed in two none of these discomforts was as troubling to brookshire as the nature of the country they were traveling through he had not supposed there could be country so bleak and inhospitable anywhere in the american nation the ground was covered with flat cactuses the captain called them prickly pear there were also thick gray thornbushes called chaparral interlaced amid the equally thorny mesquite several times they encountered rattlesnakes which buzzed alarmingly though it was only midafternoon brookshire was feeling tired but looking at the ground beneath him he had a hard time imagining where he was going to sleep the one thing he didnt expect he would have to fear was a chill the sky was not like the skies of home it was vast and instead of being blue it was white not with cloud but with heat captain call was not satisfied with the behavior of one of the mules the beast was skittish he jumped around so much that the captain was finally forced to get down and lash the baggage more securely do snakes crawl around at night brookshire asked thats when they hunt call said im sorry i chose this mule the mule as if annoyed by the comment tried to bite call who whacked him on the nose with a glove i expect id better replace him in laredo call said im glad bols calmed down he usually does once we get moving indeed the old mexican seemed much calmer once in a while he muttered something in spanish but his eyes were dreamy and he seemed happy to be on a mule brookshire found that despite the many discomforts and the prospect of a thorny sleep he was not entirely discontented the clothes took some getting used to particularly the boots he was sweating so much that katie would probably divorce him on sight in her shock at discovering that he contained such reservoirs of sweat still it was an adventure the first of his life unless you counted the war but he had been so young and so scared during the war that he couldnt enjoy himself now though he was riding out of san antonio bound for mexico with the famous captain call they were going in search of a dangerous mexican bandit joey garza it might be uncomfortable but it was exciting too he owned four guns and they were loaded he was on his own in the weston his own except for captain call colonel terry couldnt find him to yell at him he couldnt even yell at him by telegram not for a while the captain had said it would take about three days to reach laredo brookshire felt that he would be an accomplished horseman by the time they got there perhaps he would be an accomplished shot too that night to his surprise he slept heavily so heavily that if any snakes crawled over him he didnt notice breakfast was only coffee the captain suggested that brookshire familiarize himself with his guns by loading them and unloading them a few times to learn the mechanisms while the captain was making coffee brookshire did just that the eightgauge was the easiest all he had to do was open the breech and stuff two of the big shells into the barrels hold it tight if you ever shoot it the captain said i doubt either one of those mules could kick as hard as that gun i dont believe ill shoot it brookshire said indeed he had no intention of ever shooting the big gun not unless he was heavily besieged he was about to unload it and put the shells back in their case when to his dismay old bolivar suddenly jumped up grabbed the shotgun and fired both barrels at the nearest mule the shotgun kicked the old man so hard that he fell backward over a saddle dropping the gun with scarcely a kick the mule died its stomach blown away he shot the wrong mule dern it the captain said this was the good mule he was disgusted with himself for not keeping a closer eye on the old man bols fancies were apt to get away from him particularly in the mornings los indios bol said jumping up call grabbed the shotgun no indians bol just mules call said in pity he wondered what happened to an old mans brain to disturb it so that it could confuse a mule with an indian he himself would be old soon if he lived he could not help wondering if a morning or an evening would come when he was as confused as bol confused enough that he could mistake a brown mule for a brown man well have to split this baggage until we get to the border and replace this mule he said he soon had it divided among his mount the sorry mule and brookshires lean sorrel seeing the dead mule its side blown away destroyed brookshires taste for coffee in the war he had seen a great many dead horses and mules but that had been a long time ago how much did the mule cost captain he asked as they were mounting he had his ledger in his saddlebags and he wanted to record the lost property before he forgot fortyfive dollars call said ill make an entryim the accountant brookshire said i should have entered all this yesterday but i was getting used to my new clothes and i forgot one decent mule and two shotgun shells if your boss is such a stickler id be sure i listed the shells call said joey garza had first gone to crow town when he was seventeen a cowboy so drunk he had forgotten which side of the border he was on insulted maria in the streets in ojinaga when maria tried to walk away the cowboy opened his pants and showed himself to her joey was standing in front of their house a few yards away he agreed with the gringo his mother was a whore why else would she have four husbands but he had been wanting to kill a texan and the cowboy was right there handy joey put a pistol in his belt walked past maria who was hurrying home her eyes down and went over to the gringo who was attempting to button up without saying a word joey stuck his pistol in the mans face and blew his brains out the cowboy was too drunk even to realize that he was about to die but maria knew she felt death in joey when he walked past her joey was smiling but not at her she knew her son didnt like her he was smiling because of the death he was about to deal joeys smile soon became part of the legend the gringos made about him joey garza always smiled before he killed maria gave joey her horse and made him leave she knew the gringos would be back to kill him he had to leave she didnt suppose he had killed the cowboy because of the insult to her either joey didnt do things for other people he did things for himself it didnt matter to him that a drunk gringo had showed himself to his mother he just wanted to kill and chose that moment and that man when the men came from the ranch where the dead cowboy had worked they beat her with a lariat and then pretended they were going to hang her with the same rope after they pretended to hang her they beat her again maria wanted to be silent but the men were determined she cried out it was merely for pleasure that the men beat her they didnt expect her to tell them where to find joey it was easier to beat her than to go look for joey she knew it wouldnt end with the beating either and it didnt later that night after they had been to the cantina the men came to her house maria had given joey her horse she had no way to flee and anyway she could not leave her children what happened in her house was worse than the beating maria had never been used by men who hated her she was a modest woman and had not supposed she would have to bear such shame such humiliation she fought but as a woman without spirit would fight her spirit had become a crow it flew to crow town to be with her son the son she had to love despite the bitter knowledge that he was no good the white men from the ranch across the border were men without purpose even degrading maria was not purpose enough to interest them for long they degraded her until they lost interest in degrading her and then they left as deep as the shame of being handled by men in their lust was the pain of knowing that she would not have joey much longer when the men left maria cried until she was empty for days she would fill up with tears and then cry until she was empty whether joey lived or not maria knew she had lost her sonthe good son she had until juan castro sold him that son was gone farther away even than crow town he was only seventeen but already he belonged to death when joey returned maria told him that joey only laughed we all belong to death mother he said youre too young to say that to me maria said angrily i dont belong to death i brought you out of me i want you to stay alive you have only killed one american you should go to the mountains the whites wont hunt you for long i dont like the mountains joey said then he left just in time the next day four lawmen came the bad one named doniphan the hard sheriff only watched while the others did the work the lawmen were rougher than the cowboys they tied marias feet together and loped around the village dragging her after that they dragged her into a prickly pear then they strapped her over a mule and took her across the river the river was up their horses had to swim and so did the mule in the middle of the river the men let the mule go maria and the mule were swept far downstream maria thought she would drown but the mule finally struggled up the rocky bank hitting marias head against a rock as it struggled maria heard the men laughing not the sheriff but the others they kept her in jail for a month during which time she was feverish from the festering cactus wounds because they kept her handcuffed she could only draw out a few thorns she could only sleep slumped against a wall if she lay down she merely mashed the cactus thorns deeper into her flesh though the lawmen never said it maria knew they were keeping her in jail in hopes that joey would try to free her the lawmen didnt know that her son disliked her only she knew it joey wouldnt try to free her he had no loyalty to her but she had loyalty she ignored the lawmens questions she wouldnt tell them which way joey went they didnt degrade her but they starved her some days she would get nothing and when they did feed her it would only be a tortilla and a little water she grew tired and very weak when they finally let her out maria was so weak she couldnt walk across the street she didnt have the strength to walk to the river much less to cross it she fell and had to crawl to the shade of a small mesquite tree to rest while she was resting she began to think about dying her body would heal but she didnt know about her spirit her spirit smelled old it no longer smelled like the spirit of a woman who wanted to be a woman a woman who wanted to live her spirit smelled too bad to her she thought she ought to die and let it go to some new life someone who smelled like birth and not like death but there was rafael and teresa she couldnt die while she was resting and trying to summon the will to go on living billy williams found her he rode into town rather drunk and saw a brown woman sitting under a tree that was not uncommon in presidio he had almost ridden past before he saw that the brown woman was maria good god mary he said and immediately brought her water and then more water he went to the house of a mexican woman and begged a little menudo but maria was too weak to eat seeing marias condition billy began to boil her hands were almost black from poor circulation caused by the handcuffs most of her cactus wounds had festered i despise lawmen he said i despise their stinkin hearts he went back to his horse his face red with anger and yanked his rifle out of its scabbard what are you doing maria asked alarmed i am going to kill those sorry dogs billy said no take me home im sick maria said all right theni will kill them later billy said tom johnson the oldest of doniphans deputies came and watched as billy carefully loaded maria onto his horse i didnt know you fancied mexican whores billy tom johnson said i fancy cutting your stinkin heart out tom billy said i expect ill come back and do it once i take mary home the lawman laughed you oldtimers have got rough tongues he said do you fancy all whores or just this one he turned to see if his deputy joe means was coming to watch the fun he only glanced off for a second it seemed but when he turned back toward billy williams there was a crack and his right ear went numb he thought a wasp might have got him but when he put his hand up to his head he found that his ear was just dangling by a little strip of skin blood was pouring down his cheek whatd you do billy tom asked astonished the old man was walking toward him a big knife in his hand tom became frightened these old scouts were unpredictable he thought he should draw his gun but he felt paralyzed before he could reach for his weapon the old man was there he severed the little strip of skin that held the ear then he shook the severed ear in front of the shocked lawmans eyes it could just as easy be your stinkin heart he said then he stuffed the ear in the mans shirt pocket and backed away he didnt think tom johnson would recover from his shock in time to shoot him but there was no point in taking chances tom johnson walked back to the jail still in shock joe means had his boot off and was shaving a callus off his right big toe when tom johnson walked in blood covered one side of toms face so much blood that joe almost slit his toe instead of the callus his first thought was apaches tom had only left the jail a minute before could the man have somehow gotten scalped good god tom wheres your other ear joe means asked horrified its in my shirt pocket tom said numbly it didnt occur to him that the remark might sound odd after all joe had asked where the ear was and the ear did happen to be in his shirt pocket the line would be repeated along the border for the rest of tom johnsons life he considered himself an able lawman if nothing else he outlasted his friend joe means by more than three decades joe was killed the very next year by a rattlesnake he had ridden home one night rather in his cups and had the misfortune to step off his horse right onto a coiled rattlesnake normally the snake would have rattled loudly enough to have warned joe but it was joes bad luck that the snake had broken off all but one of its rattles if it rattled its one rattle joe didnt hear it most men didnt die of snakebite but joe means gave up the ghost within twentyfour hours he was mourned by few in the town of presidio joe had a tendency to be surly since being a deputy had gone to his head he frequently arrested people for minor offenses that a more seasoned lawman would have overlooked tom johnson felt he was a seasoned lawman but that was lost on the populace such as it was all anyone on the border could remember was that he had once kept his ear in his shirt pocket tom took to drink when drunk he often cursed billy williams he didnt forget the mexican woman either she had been the start of it all it was because of her that he had become a figure of fun along the border if he ever had occasion to arrest her again he meant to do worse than he had done in the meantime there were other brown women in presidio or across the river that he could wreak vengeance on and he did any brown woman who got taken to tom johnsons jail knew she was in for trouble two suffered so much that they died several times tom johnson had gone to ojinaga meaning to arrest maria herself to show her she could not get away with making a mockery of a white lawman in his memory maria had mocked him but for some reason when the moment came he didnt arrest her sometimes he took a substitute he would take another unlucky brown woman strap her on a mule and pull her across the river once in a drunken moment he told a cowboy in a bar that the reason he wasnt arresting maria was because he wanted her to worry he wanted her to wake up thinking about what he would do to her the next time billy williams laughed when the cowboy told him that story that aint why he leaves mary alone he said well he said it was the cowboy said he leaves her alone because he knows if he harms her ill do worse than shoot his ear off billy said next time ill tie him to a stump and cut his stinkin heart out whoa the cowboy said his name was ben bridesall youd cut a deputy sheriffs heart out i would billy assured him whoa thats strong talk ben said again killing a lawmans as bad as stealing horses in the laws eyes you better keep a fast horse handy if you do that theyll chase you clean to canada i wouldnt go to canada billy said id go to crow town that might do it ben said theyd have to want you pretty bad to come and get you there maria was a midwife the only one in ojinaga she did not want to be gone to crow town too long several women in the village would need her soon crow town lay two hundred miles north of the border in the sandhills maria had never been there but she knew its reputationeveryone knew its reputation an evil one in earlier times slaves had been traded in the sandhills stolen children white or brown stolen women to have gone to crow town and survived was a mark of pride to the young pistoleros along the border years before when the buffalo were being killed a large remnant of the great southern herd had wandered south off the plain and into the sandhills there they were pursued by the kiowa and comanche and by the most unremitting of the buffalo hunters more than fifteen thousand were slaughtered by the buffalo hunters in a last great frenzy of killing the skins were piled in great heaps awaiting wagons to transport them east but the hide market collapsed and the wagons never came the towering heaps of hides slowly rotted the ropes that bound them into piles were chewed by rodents in the fierce winds of winter and spring the hide stacks began to blow apart wolves coyotes and badgers played with them soon the hides swarmed with lice and fleas the thousands of hides were scattered throughout the sandhills one spring two years after the last buffalo had died cowboys began to see crows in the sandhills crows and crows and then more crows something in the hides some nit or flea attracted the crows at night hundreds roosted on the few piles of hides that remained in the daytime a crowd of wheeling crows could be seen from far away at certain times of the year thousands of crows could be seen and heard their cawing was audible thirty miles away an indian named blue skin built the first structure in crow town a oneroom adobe hut blue skin was shot by a vaquero on the run from trouble in mexico the vaquero took blue skins hut he lived in it for a while and then went back to mexico the hides continued to rot more and more crows came to caw and to wheel then a basque sheepherder built himself a little shack not far from blue skins hut the basque had been horsewhipped in kansas for bringing sheep into cattle lands the sandhills of the pecos were not yet cattle land and only charles goodnight and his partner loving passed through them with cattle the basque felt that he wouldnt be bothered since the land was too poor for cattle sheep could barely survive it then the famous killer john wesley hardin passed through and killed the basque on a whim john wesley found the crows amusing if there was another building or two here we could call it crow town he said speaking to his horse john wesley hardin traveled alone what conversation he made he made with his horse he repeated the remark in el paso and the name stuck later with the law after him john wesley fled to crow town two rough brothers from chicago were sharing blue skins hut it was kill neither or kill both fatigued john wesley chose to kill neither he contented himself with a tent the old basque had left the soil around crow town boiled with fleas from the thousands of rotting hides but john wesley wasnt bothered by fleas his only problem with crow town the community he had named was the unavailability of victims he didnt have to kill every day or even every month or every year but he did like to have people handy in case the killing mood came on he left but returned to crow town whenever he needed a respite after some killing spree every year he found more people thereadobes that were smaller and more crude than the one blue skin had built low frame houses and ragged tents finally there were twelve houses and a little saloon an irishman named patrick obrien owned the saloon whiskey deliveries were few and far between when wagons did arrive patrick obrien stacked the whiskey around his house to the height of his roof he had unpredictable customers and was nervous about running out of liquor it was risky stacking whiskey outside in such country patrick slept with four guns in his bed and often had to run outside and empty two or three of them into the darkness to protect his whiskey in crow town where the sound of cawing could be heard night and day the tamer types of citizens rarely appeared most of those who rode in were bad ones not a few of them were worse than bad many a traveler had been casually shot down in the street his death watched only by the crows the crows rested in the skinny mesquite sometimes they walked among the buildings as if they were people the air even on nice spring days had a kind of rotten smell the legacy of thousands of rotting hides behind the town was a low sandy hill with one skinny mesquite tree on it bodies of the dead were casually buried there most of them would be dug up again within a day or two by enterprising varmints the most enterprising of the varmints was a giant feral hog which showed up one sunday and consumed substantial portions of three bodies the locals annoyed by the impudence of the swine assembled a hasty firing squad and fired a fusillade at it but to their amazement the hog defied them it didnt die or even retreat it kept on eating in the night it disappeared and was not seen for a month then one day it reappeared and ate an unfortunate mule skinner who had been gored by his own ox the ox normally a placid creature suddenly went insane and killed the mule skinner though he had coaxed it across the prairies for eight years in time the great pig grew bolder sometimes it would walk through town attended by a contingent of crows who would flank it or walk ahead of it cawing when the pig stretched out to sleep in the hot sun several crows would attend it cleaning nits and ticks out of its hide the poor people who worked in the sandhills feared the pig they called it the devil pig the pig disappeared for long stretches only to reappear just when people had begun to hope that it had gone forever the most superstitious of the poor people believed the pig walked down to hell to receive instructions from the devil entering through a long tunnel that was said to open in the riverbank just south of boquillas sightings of the pig came from all points of the compass from as far east as abilene as far north as tascosa and as far south as piedras negras an old woman who lived near boquillas claimed to have seen it go into the tunnel that led to hell only the handful of people who stayed in crow town ever got used to the crows gamblers or outlaws who passed through found their cawing so distracting they almost went mad one famous gambler known throughout the west as tennessee bob became so maddened by the cawing that he pulled his revolver in the midst of a card game and blew his own brains outand hed been holding a winning hand too tennessee bob had played cards successfully from dodge to deadwood to yuma and he was playing cards successfully in crow town what he couldnt deal with was the cacophony of the crows tennessee bobs real name was sam howard like most of the temporary residents of crow town he had gone there because he had more or less used up the west his career had taken him from memphis to abilene from abilene to dodge city from dodge city to silver city from silver city to denver from denver to deadwood from deadwood to cheyenne from cheyenne to tombstone and from tombstone to crow town other renegades whether mexicans swedes indians irish or american took the same route in different order what they shared was a sense that there werent too many places left where life was so cheap that the law wouldnt bother trying to preserve it why send rangers or the army to clean out a dirty little village in the sandhills whose residents were so quarrelsome that they could be counted on to eliminate one another themselves at the rate of one or two a month renegades of all descriptions could reside in crow town and feel themselves safe from the law they just werent safe from one another the few women who came there enjoyed no illusions about their safety they werent safe from anyone and they knew it very few lawmen ventured into the sandhills i doubt even woodrow call would go to crow town billy williams said some two months before maria left he was discussing the matter in marias kitchen with an experienced smuggler named olin roy whose specialty was moving gold across the border at the behest of corrupt mexican generals who were afraid they would be robbed by generals yet more corrupt olin roy was a large man weighing just over three hundred pounds he had trouble finding mounts that could carry him swiftly over the distances he sometimes had to cover i expect call would go to crow town if he felt like it olin said probably he dont feel like it though maria overheard the conversation she could not have avoided it since billy and olin were in her kitchen olin roy had once tried to marry her she had refused him but he still had hopes he and billy were opposites in one respect billy was always drunk olin always sober though large olin was delicate in his appetites he could stomach only the mildest of peppers preferring to diet on raw eggs stirred into a little sugary milk in his travels eggs were often unavailable to him as a concession to the great fondness maria knew he bore her she tried to have eggs on hand when he came to visit she could tell that olin appreciated such small attentions when billy and olin were in ojinaga at the same time maria was careful she was no mans woman but men were men and she had a lot of trouble with men who became confused about her affections her first husband carlos garza was so jealous that he would fight any man who turned his eyes in marias direction she was beautiful then men often turned their eyes there were many fights she tried to soothe carlos to see that he rose content from their bed but her love though she gave it all was not enough even if he had just left her bed jealousy burned in carloss dark eyes he loved but he could not trust and when she became pregnant with joey he beat her and accused her of taking a lover he would not accept that the child was his for maria his distrust brought pain and shock she was young and she had given herself body and soul to carlos she could not understand how he could think she would accept another man she wanted no other man could not even imagine wanting one only carlos garza could move her he was very handsome and he could move her with a touch or a look many times she begged him not to be foolish not to fight over things that wouldnt happen over feelings she didnt have but carlos was like a deaf man from him maria learned that few men trusted women carlos heard only his own fears marias words meant nothing for to carlos women were liars when joey was one year old carlos noticed a soldier turn his eyes to maria she was making tortillas outside in the sun the soldier a fat federale was sitting in a wagon across the street it was a hot day probably the soldier was hungry and only wanted a few of the tortillas maria was making but carlos didnt think the soldier only wanted tortillas maria had seen the man look but her mind was on her task carlos was supposed to be carrying water she thought he was at the river until she heard the sound of his voice raised in anger the soldier had a crowbar since the federales had been repairing the telegraph she saw the soldier strike carlos once but he struck so hard that maria was a widow before she could even run across the street carlos had been right about the soldier too three weeks later he was back in ojinaga maria spat on him in full view of several federales she expected to be killed but in fact the man was a coward and did nothing for a year maria felt guilty she felt she had not done enough to make carlos happy if she had done even a little more perhaps carlos would not have been so tormented by jealousy if he had lived surely in time he would have come to accept that she wanted no other man but carlos died leaving joey fatherless and herself a widow since then she had been cautious around males she treated them carefully as vaqueros treated bulls everyone knew that bulls were at their most dangerous when they fought and at such times the loser was more dangerous than the winner maria didnt want billy and olin to fight she valued their experience and their affection and didnt want to lose one of them in a silly fight i dont think either of you know this woodrow call maria said i know him but ill be perfectly happy to leave him alone olin said the two men fell silent mention of call seemed to remind them of the uncertainty of life along the border ill do better than that olin added id ride about a hundred miles out of my way to avoid the man didnt you sell call the horse that killed his boy billy asked no no olin said wishing the legend of the hell bitch would just die why i thought you sold her to call billy said thats what everybody thinks i did once own that mare olin admitted at the time i had no idea call had a son for her to kill it was growing dark great shadows stretched into chihuahua the two men talked too much history too much about things that were past bad things had happened to her too but she did not like to dwell on them a certain restlessness took her when she heard too much about the past she still liked to laugh to dance a little in the cantina roberto sanchez her last husband had not been a very good man but despite that she missed him she would have liked to have a husband she enjoyed being with a man at night and not just a pistolero or a man of the cantina she wanted a man who was not so prone to comings and goings one who would spend months or even years with her someone whose hands she liked whose ways she liked perhaps this man if she could find him would also like her ways and would welcome the laughter in her not all men liked happiness in a woman they seemed to fear her laughter was it only men who were supposed to laugh of her four husbands only benito the third had laughed with her carlos and juan her first two husbands had been too jealous juan was also too violent roberto sanchez had been too restless he didnt like to stay put he could not even stay in bed all night much less stay with her for months he didnt live in the past though men who lived in the past brought out her restlessness life was there in the house in the yard in the town in the bedroom in her hands in her womb it was not in the past the bad things that had happened to her had not killed her they had not even killed the laughter in her she became a little annoyed at billy and olin because they so easily turned their eyes backward men were odd one day they were hard far too hard the next day they were soft far too soft they were like porcupines prickly on the outside but with soft bellies benito her third husband had not even been prickly on the outside he never scolded her and would never have thought of striking her his only fault was laziness benito would lie in bed all day looking at her with his big eyes if she happened to stop in her chores to pause near the bed benito would put out a hand is that all you can think about she asked one day flattered if a little flustered im old why do you want me benito shrugged and smiled his littleboy smile he was younger than joey benitonot in years but in feeling joey had never been young benito would never have been old even if he had lived but benito got a toothache a bad one after a month the toothache was so bad benito could scarcely think he ceased putting out his hand to maria when she stopped near the bed maria wanted him to let her pull the tooth or let the priest pull it or the blacksmith or anyone but benito kept shaking off this advice he had beautiful white teeth and was vain about them he wanted to keep them all why so you will look beautiful in heaven maria asked vexed by his attitude yes i want to look handsome in heaven benito agreed smiling shyly he thought it was a worthy goal though he could tell it didnt please maria her nostrils flared a little when she looked at him flared as a mares might flare who says you will even go to heaven maria asked you are too lazy you never get out of bed when im gone you might become a sinner you might have to go to the bad place when youre gone i dont want you to be gone benito said the thought of being without his maria frightened him terribly what would he do who would take care of him everyone agreed that maria was the most competent person in ojinaga his clothes were only simple clothes but they were always cleaner than other mens clothes his meals were tastier than the meals other mens wives cooked for them sometimes maria walked far down the river looking for chilies or herbs that would make her posole more tasty but it was not only her competence that he needed there was her smile her cool hands her soft breasts the thought that he might lose all that caused him a moment of panic he wondered if he pleased maria really pleased her in their embraces she seemed to be pleased but she was a woman it was hard to tell perhaps she was merely pretending perhaps she had already found a loverhe suspected the butcher gordo dominguez gordo had always wanted maria and perhaps he wanted her now perhaps they were doing things that were more pleasing than anything else benito was able to do maybe maria liked what gordo did so much that she was preparing to run away with him maria saw the worry in her husbands eyes for there was no missing it an angel might come and get me she said smiling the remark was intended to show benito that she was teasing no angel ever came to chihuahua she was not going to heaven i need you the angel cant have you benito said he felt a quick desire for his wife which overpowered his toothache he was so insistent that maria closed the door and went to the bed few people in ojinaga closed their doors in the hot mornings she wondered what people would think might be happening but neither marias competence nor benitos insistence dulled the toothache for long in a few more days it hurt so badly that he couldnt eat the tasty meals or appreciate the clean clothes or be affected by the soft breasts go to chihuahua city maria said theres a dentist there but its a long way benito complained its a long time that youve been sick too maria told him you might die finally one day the toothache got so bad that benito decided to go to chihuahua city after all maria fixed him a poultice of hot cornmeal to hold against his tooth she gave him the gentlest of goodbye kisses his jaw was very swollen i wish you would come he mumbled i hate to ride so far alone i have the children maria said looking at them teresa was holding her new chick just born the day before rafael sat with his goat singing a little song whose words only he understood brother and sister were happy together they were never apart more than a few minutes sometimes rafael led teresa always teresa thought for rafael though they were happy together it made maria sad to look at them and to know that they would never be as other children were they were damaged joey was damaged too his limbs were normal his eyes were clear but his soul was sick the children were only a little unhappy yet because of them at times maria felt a failure none of her children were as other children were and they would never be she felt she didnt know how to be a mother though she was a midwife and a good one in her own birthings something went wrong she didnt know what errors she had committed to cause her children to be so damaged she could not feel that she was a good wife either benito was lazy and she had not tried to cure him of it she let him be as he was two of her husbands had been killed and now a third one was sick she felt oppressed she did her best and yet the knowledge she had was often the wrong knowledge the dentist better not hurt benito said i dont want to ride all the way to chihuahua city to be hurt youll be glad you went maria said youll feel so much better that i wont be able to fight you off even when the children are in bed later she was to cry and cry over that remark when she made it she did not realize that it would be the last thing she would ever say to benito who didnt make it to chihuahua city or to the dentist less than ten miles from ojinaga his horse was shot out from under him benito tried to run but the killer roped him and hoisted him up the side of a large boulder then the killer cut off his hands and feet with a machete the killer loosened the rope and rode away leaving benito to bleed to death benito crawled almost three hundred yards back toward ojinaga before he died the killer was never found the federales came but they didnt look very hard benitos mother and sisters were more upset by his mutilation than by the death they felt it might mean that benitos soul would be rejected by god they felt he might never be allowed to rest maria didnt worry about benito being allowed to rest he was good at resting it made her smile to think of him resting now he could rest forever he was not a traveling man it may have been what she liked best about him he was always there where she could find him in the bed benito had been a kind man maria knew she would miss his touch he had been more kind to her than her father her brothers her uncles her other husbands it was wrong that he should die so cruelly but at least he had crossed the border into a land where there was no pain maria didnt believe in hell if there was a hell it came to you in life the texans brought it they had evil in them and they had exercised their evil on her when they caught her in her house that was hell and it had happened to her in her own house hell was not happening to benito he had always liked to rest and now he was resting but he would not be able to put out his hand to her when she came near the bed she would not be able to take his hand and guide it to her maria felt that the killer might have known what she and benito did when she shut the doors in the morning perhaps that was why the hands were taken she didnt know some old ones still made necklaces of fingers perhaps someone had taken benitos hands and feet to be made into necklaces maria didnt know would never know beneath marias sorrow was anger she felt a loyalty to benito and though her sorrow was deep her anger was deeper her first two husbands were selfish men they would have taken younger women given time but benito wanted no one but herhe would never have taken a younger woman that knowledge fueled her anger someday the killer might reveal himself to her when that happened she would take her own vengeance even if it resulted in her death she would have liked to sit on the bed and touch benitos hands one more time but it couldnt be do you think the killer is in mexico or texas she asked joey a day or two after the funeral he had gone to the place and looked at the ground but if he reached any conclusions he kept them to himself texas or mexico whats the difference joey asked he liked to take questions and make them into other questions there were times when her son was so insolent that she wanted to slap him he toyed with her in a way that made her angry he was a smart boy but too goodlooking he thought his looks gave him the right to be disrespectful to his mother joey was blond a guero he would look at maria insolently waiting for her next question it did not occur to him to be helpful it would not have occurred to his father either he would rather twist her questions make them into other questions one is texas and the gringos own it maria said this is mexico we own it thats a difference its two names for the same place joey said we should own it all it was ours once and we didnt have to smile at gringos when we crossed the river i dont smile at gringos but texas was never mine maria said im a woman nothing is mine not even my children not even you i am nobodys joey said smugly maria suddenly slapped him he was too much like all men he was insolent and he didnt care that she was sad about benito the only kind husband she had ever had joey didnt move when she slapped him the cold came into his eyes he had a hat on when she hit him a little white sombrero her slap knocked it off joey picked it up quickly and examined it carefully to see if it was smudged he turned it around and around in his hands he was particular about his clothes the tiniest speck would spoil the hat for joey that is the last time you hit me mother joey said carefully setting the hat back on his head maria slapped him again harder and again the spotless white hat got knocked to the floor youre my son she said ill slap you when you need it joey picked up his hat and took it outside to dust it off he left and was gone for a week when he returned he didnt speak to maria he took his dirty clothes out of his saddlebags and handed them to her to clean he was riding a black horse maria had never seen the horse before or the saddle he was also wearing silver spurs maria didnt ask joey about the horse she went outside to rafael and teresa they were sitting with their chickens and goats under a little tree rafael was chanting one of his melancholy songs rafael was a big boy and much nicer than joey only rafael was lost in his mind maria grew sad thinking about it she gathered her washing and started to walk to the river rafael followed with two of his goats teresa stopped to talk to an old woman who was grinding corn teresa was popular in the village she was so quick and got around so well that some people almost forgot she was blind her children dirtied a lot of clothes it took maria three trips to get all the clothes to the place where the women washed that morning because it was late only one woman was there old estela old estela had borne thirteen children and outlived them all one drowned in a flood and the rest were killed wasdiseases old estela had only a few clothes to wash because she had no family once she told maria that she came to the river because she heard the voices of her dead children call from the water she had convinced herself that her children were not really dead they lived in the river with the frogs and the fish and the little snakes god had given them gills like the fish had so they could breathe old estela knew they were there every morning she heard them rafael helped maria with the clothes there were one or two simple tasks he could do and he always did them he liked to beat the clothes against the rocks and to spread them so that the cold water ran over them once in a while a shirt would slip away before he could place a rock on it then rafael would have to wade in the water to retrieve it the sheep disturbed by seeing him in the water would set up a bleating sometimes teresa would follow them she knew the path to the river and all the other paths around the village teresa and rafael did not like to be apart too long they needed one another teresa could not sleep except with rafael he had become her eyes she became his mind it touched maria that her boy and her girl were so careful to help one another do you hear your children today estela maria asked i hear the girls estela said in her tiny crack of a voice they are over by that bush where the coyote drinks near the bush the water made a rilling sound the boys i dont hear them estela said maybe they have gone to piedras negras i think thats where my boy went maria said thinking of the black horse and the silver spurs joey garza journeyed to the city of mexico in search of a better gun when he was seventeen an old prospector named lichtenberg had come through ojinaga carrying a little case made of fine leather with a crest stamped on it in gold joey was interested in fine things he admired the little case and wanted to know what was in it old tomas who had once worked for the german on one of his prospecting ventures said it was where senor lichtenberg carried his rifle joey thought that a gun carried inside a case would be useless when trouble arrived if trouble arrived it usually arrived quickly the apaches who bought him from juan castro could kill you several times in several ways while you were trying to get a rifle out of a leather case joey had seen them kill people who had their guns in their hands but were too terrified to fire because they were terrified of dying they died the old german was very tired when he reached ojinaga he was weaving on his feet he politely asked maria for board and he gave her a gold coin which she accepted then he removed his hightopped boots and was soon asleep he took no precautions at all with his possessions maria had a husband then roberto sanchez he came home from the cantina to find that maria had rented their bed he took the gold coin from her but raged anyway about the loss of the bed due to a fear of scorpions roberto hated to sleep on the ground he was a fool joey thought scorpions could come in a house and bite people they often did roberto raged for a long time but maria finally persuaded him that renting the bed was a smart move one night on the ground wouldnt hurt them she herself would clean the ground to make sure no scorpions were there to bother them roberto sanchez was still drinking tequila but he finally stumbled after maria rafael the idiot boy was playing with a chicken behind the house while he sang a little idiot song a sad tone came into his voice when he saw his mother go into the darkness teresa sat near rafael when she heard the sad note enter the song she scooted closer to rafael and put her fingers to his lips to feel from his breath what sadness he felt she herself didnt care that her mother had gone out of the house she heard her go but for teresa it only meant that she could whisper through the night to rafael and not be scolded teresa loved whispering to her brother at night in the darkness she felt that she and rafael were the same neither could see and it didnt matter that rafael sang songs that had meaning only to him as soon as maria and roberto left joey took the little case into another room where he lit a lamp and examined it carefully it had a small lock but he opened it with a piece of wire inside the case resting in velvet grooves was a rifle the most beautiful joey garza had ever seen the barrel was heavy it weighed as much as most rifles in joeys mind that gave the gun dignity this rifle was not merely a gun it was so beautifully crafted that holding it made him feel powerful the stock was of polished wood and the trigger guards curved beautifully the german rifle was the most desirable weapon joey had ever seen he determined at once that he must have it or one that was as good or better if he had to kill the old german he would do it but he didnt intend to kill him right away almost as fascinating as the rifle was a little spyglass that nestled in its own velvet groove it had a fitting that attached it to the gun barrel joey attached it and looked through the spyglass even in the dark room lit only by the flickering lamp he could see what the spyglass did it brought the target near even when the target was far he slipped outside and practiced sighting through the spyglass with only the moon and stars for light he wished it were day at first light he meant to take the gun and sight through the spyglass having the spyglass was like having a better eye the rifle was so well balanced that joey knew he could kill from great distances with it he could lie on a roof in ojinaga and kill gringos across the river in presidio if the wind was blowing strongly the gringos would never even hear the report of the rifle three gringos could be walking in the street and in a second two of them would be dead the third would have no idea who was shooting joey considered stealing the rifle then and there he could leave and go where no one would ever find him he knew the mountains to the south in the great bend of the river and knew the madre he could live in the mountains for years eating the roasts of fat mule deer but the old prospectors rifle was the first fine gun he had ever seen in the city of mexico there were bound to be many and perhaps some that were even finer he sat outside his mothers house until almost dawn simply holding the gun in his hands then he detached the little spyglass took the rifle apart and put it carefully back in its case he felt divided impatient yet patient he wanted to take the rifle and go but he also wanted to learn patience among the apaches the best hunters and the best man killers were the most patient men in the tribe though it was hard to wait they waited the best hunters did not take the first deer they saw they waited for the fattest deer they shot when they were sure and joey resolved to do the same he would shoot when he was sure when the old german woke up the next morning joey politely asked about the little case the old man seemed surprised but after he had several cups of marias strong coffee he opened the little case and showed joey the rifle he explained the function of the little spyglass and showed joey how to attach it joey pretended to be amazed when he looked through the little glass later in the morning the old german walked up and asked joey if he would like to shoot with him he suggested a little contest if we shoot i will beat you joey said he had nothing against the old man until he saw him looking at his mother when she was bending over getting a tick off her old dogs ear his mother loved the old brown dog for some reason though the dog was mangy and had a broken tail and a sore that had never really healed from where a javelina had gored him joey considered his mother a whore and if roberto sanchez died he had no doubt she would take another man only a whore would seek four husbands joey thought but that didnt lessen his hatred of the men who helped his mother whore the minute he saw old lichtenberg looking at his mothers bosom he decided to kill him someday for now he would be content with a shooting lesson joey took some melons far down the river and lined them up on rocks but they are too far lichtenberg complained when joey came walking back there was something about the lightskinned mexican boy that was a little disturbing he had a coldness in his face like some of the indians had particularly the indians in the mountains his mother was a desirable woman though lichtenberg had meant to leave that morning but he thought he might stay a few days perhaps for a coin or two the woman would go with him in his travels in mexico he had paid for many brown women he could afford to pay for one more first though he would show the cold blond boy the guero how to shoot you first lichtenberg said when you miss i will shoot joey had lined up eight melons on the rocks he took the beautiful rifle with the heavy barrel and caused the eight melons to explode one by one lichtenberg was startled the boy could never have shot such a gun before yet he hadnt missed one of his own beliefs was that indians had better eyesight than white men in the madre the indians would sometimes see things he could not see at all often they would mention landmarks that to them were obvious but that he could not see until he had walked several hours this boy must have some indian in him lichtenberg thought joey set up eight more melons lichtenberg on his mettle burst them all a draw lichtenberg said relieved his hand was shaky that day it would have been embarrassing to be beaten with his own gun by a boy who had never shot a german rifle before can we shoot again joey asked politely i will find something smaller lichtenberg was not eager he would have been happy with a draw but the boy had a challenge in his tone that he as a german could not simply ignore this time joey chose prickly pear apples handling them carefully so as not to get the tiny fuzzy stickers in his fingers would you like to shoot first he asked the old man politely noyou first lichtenberg said he was sorry he had been polite to the boy better to have stayed in the hut and waited for the womans husband to leave then he could have tried his money he had a bad feeling about the shooting it was as if the boy was the teacher the one with confidence he had young eyes eyes that were accustomed to the distances of chihuahua to the space that the great eagles looked across lichtenberg didnt know if he could hit a prickly pear apple at such a distance even with his scope joey hit ten apples he balanced the gun beautifully and aimed only for an instant before firing when he finished he politely gave the gun to lichtenberg who took it and missed five times twice he hit the rock beneath the little red apples the bullets whining off down the valley the rest of the time he shot high after the fifth miss he quit he did not feel it would be a good day the mexican woman wouldnt accept his coin his horse might go lame a snake might bite him he might be robbed he would not find any gold or even a stream in which to pan for it a sense of the melancholy of life began to crush him why had he come to this stinking village in a stinking country where neither the water nor the food agreed with him why had he left prussia he had known bismarck onceif he had stayed in prussia he might have been a minister or a rich man not a tired wandering prospector going from village to village trying to scrape up a few flecks of gold any day he might be killed by a bandit an indian anyone he happened to meet now he had been defeated by a boy who could shoot his own rifle better than he could he walked slowly back to marias hut and put the rifle back in its case for a moment looking across the hot plain he considered shooting himself with it one bullet and he would not have to go on with such an uncomfortable existence traveling on a horse that was narrowbacked and surly but he put the gun back in its case in a few minutes he began to feel a little better the sun shone beautifully and the coffee that maria brewed had a fine aroma lichtenberg loved coffee he had thought of going south far south where they grew coffee in the mountains he decided not to kill himself because of the coffee smells and the comely woman her husband was a brute that was clear the brute had made it known that he did not like lichtenberg sleeping in his house the husband smelled of drink but the woman was very comely the husband might go away and even if he didnt go away lichtenberg could always look for her part maria wished the old german would go she saw him looking at her there were many men who showed their lust in their eyes she could not keep them all from looking at her roberto her husband had a harelip he had once worked across the river for a big ranch shoeing horsesthe cowboys teased him about his harelip so much that he hated all whites and the old german was very white in the wrong mood if he intercepted one of the old mans lul looks roberto might take a knife to him or an axe or a gun a more likely problem though was that joey would rob him of something valuable joey was a quick and gifted thief although the old mans clothes were ragged from neglect and hard wear many of the things he owned were nice there was the fine rifle and in another leather case a set of mining instruments his belt had a silver buckle and he wore a ring with a green stone in it maria had not touched his bags but he had produced the gold coin from one of them and might have other gold coins in his valise joey might steal any of it maria knew that he might steal it out of curiosity joey liked to look at interesting things particularly weapons there was no telling what the old german might have that joey would like to steal but if he did steal something trouble would come from across the river the hard sheriff doniphan liked nothing better than to beat mexicans who stole things the river meant nothing to doniphan the notion that mexico was a nation with rights like other nations andwitha border that needed to be respected made joey laugh mexico was a nation of whores lazy men indians and bandits in doniphans view he crossed the border when it suited him taking any prisoners he wanted to take in ojinaga there was no one to stand up to him if joey stole from the old german he would steal and go when doniphan arrived with his rough deputies and their quirts it would not be joey who would suffer their vengeance it would be roberto sanchez or some man on the street that they just happened to noticethe shoemaker perhaps they were not coming to do justice they were coming to hurt mexicans there would be less danger if the old german would just go before roberto lost his temper or joey stole from him but if maria hoped for something it seemed that that fact alone the fact of her hope made the something not occur the old german didnt go he drank tequila all day smoked cigars made water frequently and wiped the sweat off his face with a fine silk handkerchief when he was not drinking or wiping sweat off his forehead he looked at maria or talked to joey are there many rifles like this in your country joey asked him oh yes many lichtenberg replied would i find some in the city of mexico if i went there joey asked you would find beautiful guns but what would you buy them with you are just a poor boy lichtenberg said startled that this youth living in a filthy village would aspire to travel to the city of mexico in search of a rifle i would buy them with money joey said there was something a little frightening about the boy lichtenberg thought a chill in his look or in his tone he reminded lichtenberg of someone he had once known long ago an austrian named blier a young count and assassin whose task it was to murder hungarian rebels there were many hungarian rebels and the emperor wanted to avoid the expense of many trials young blier killed forty rebels before they caught him and impaled him on a pole count blier died hard but he had done his job saving the emperor the expense of forty trials lichtenberg had not known count blier well but he had been with him a few times and remembered the look in his eyes this boy joey had the same eyes such eyes could look on a hundred deaths or a thousand without pity lichtenberg had seen men executed both in mexico and in europe he had seen them shaking in front of firing squads or crying and begging as the noose was put around their necks some lost their water as they awaited death some emptied their bowels as well he could not without pity look upon men staining themselves as their deaths came near but count blier could see it without pity and so probably could this boy joey a boy who could outshoot him with his own gun joey was very goodlooking he was a guero as they said in mexico guero almost white in certain moods lichtenberg might have offered him a coin boys were usually easier than women but not this boy this guero with eyes like the famous count bliers maria saw joey looking at the old germans things his eyes turned again and again to the rifle case she also saw that the old german looked at joey as he looked at her she wished the man would go too much trouble would come of his visit but when you wished men to go they never did and the old german was no exception he stayed for four nights four times she had to persuade roberto to sleep on the ground he didnt like it he cursed her and he cursed the german but he only hit her once and he didnt bother the german on the fifth morning as lichtenberg was leaving joey stole six coins from his valise lichtenberg was drunk when he left and didnt notice joey went down the river and bought a horse a black gelding three years old when he rode home with it maria knew he had robbed the german her best hope was that the old german wouldnt notice otherwise doniphan and his deputies would come i didnt know you owned a horse maria said to joey yesterday you didnt own a horse i only stole six coins mother joey said if the old man comes back ill just kill him what if doniphan comes maria asked tell him to find me in the city of mexico joey said that night he left after four or five days maria relaxed a little lichtenberg was many miles away even if he missed the coins he wouldnt come back a year later she learned that the old man had drowned in sonora he had attempted to cross a wash when the wash was running and the water had swept him away the vaquero who found his body took some silver ore from his saddlebags but lichtenberg was dead and could not tell where he had found the silver the news of his death made maria feel light that night she danced in the cantina and several vaqueros fell in love with her when she danced she often became happy became welcoming and men fell in love with her it was the death of the german that allowed her to feel light if he was dead she was safe from his vengeance only when men were dead could she feel really safe from their vengeance if he were alive old lichtenberg might ride in someday with doniphan to back him up and beat her half to death because joey had stolen those coins in the city of mexico joey garza felt at home for the first time he felt that he had come to the place where he belonged all night there were people in the streets the air was soft the ringing of the church bells beautiful young priests went barefoot in the street particularly around the great cathedral joey was not a worshiper but he loved the great cathedral several times he came back to stand inside happy just to look at the high ceiling and the great space it contained in ojinaga all the ceilings were low as he walked in the night whores followed him because of his horse they thought he was rich for in the city of mexico not many boys his age had fine black geldings joey ignored the whores and didnt frequent the cantinas he had come for a gun if possible one with a little spyglass on it it took him three days to find the gun he wanted an old trader had it a frenchman a man with a vast belly and empty eyes joey had the urge to stick a knife in the mans belly to see if he could cause the emptiness to leave his eyes perhaps as he died the man would look alive for a few moments when joey showed him the five coinshe had spent one on the geldingthe man didnt say a word he just put the rifle away and nodded for joey to get out of his shop that night joey walked the cantinas looking for card players who were winning in a cantina not far from the great cathedral he saw a small man with quick hands who had many gold coins when the man had enough of the card game he put the coins in a little sack and had a whore carry it when a second whore wanted to go with him he shoved her away joey followed the man for a while as he lurched along he kept sticking his hand under the dress of the young whore it reminded joey of the way benito had behaved with his mother of how all men behaved with his mother all her husbands put their hands on her in the house they didnt care who saw them joey followed the man and the whore until they were well away from the cantina as he was walking along a cobbled street he saw a cobblestone that had come loose joey believed in omens the loose cobblestone meant that it was time for him to act he picked up the cobblestone came quickly up behind the small man and smashed his head with it he grabbed the whore and took the sack of money from her the whore became frightened and fled joey did not check to see whether the small man was dead he took the sack of coins got his horse and rode to the edge of the city of mexico where he slept the next day he walked into the fat frenchmans shop jingling the coins the fat man didnt change expressions but he sold joey the rifle later joey bought some bullets two pistols and a fine saddle he went to stand in the great cathedral once more and then rode north out of mexico ten days later on the texas border west of laredo joey robbed his first train the robbery was an accident in a sense the train was stopped at a water tank it was a train carrying sheep two sheepherders and the four men who ran the train were standing around the water tank smoking joey was three hundred yards away the heat was so great that it cast a haze no one from the train crew had seen him joey decided it was an excellent chance to practice with his new rifle so he tied his horse and crept a little closer to the men he shot the two sheepherders first it was easy to tell they were sheepherders because they wore huge sombreros and looked shaggy like the animals they cared for joey then shot two of the railroad men the two fat ones he didnt like fat people there were too many of them in the world juan castro and roberto sanchez two of the husbands his mother whored with had been fat as a child he had often wakened to see a fat body on his mothers her husbands grunted like pigs when they were on her shooting the fat railroad men was only a small revenge for the pain his whoring mother had caused him the two other railroad men began to run not into the train but down the river toward laredo joey watched them run he was trying to judge what would be a fair distance to shoot a distance that would allow his rifle to perform at its best when the man in the lead was about four hundred yards away joey looked through the spyglass and shot he aimed for the neck but the man was running downhill and his aim was a little high the bullet blew the mans face off joey rode over later to inspect the body and most of the mans face was gone the sixth man ran for his life he sped along the river so fast that it annoyed joey joey loped away on the black gelding letting the man see him letting him think that he had abandoned the hunt the man slowed to a trot and then to a walk joey loped down the river until he was well in front of the man he was satisfied with his rifle now he wanted to try his new pistols and at close range the man from the train finally stumbled out of a gully not thirty yards from where joey sat on the black horse the man was terrified he began to plead and name the saints hearing the saints named only angered joey a priest in the village had the habit of twisting his ear cruelly while talking to him about the saints joey began to shoot at the weeping pleading man but to his annoyance shooting a pistol proved far more difficult than shooting his fine rifle he emptied the two pistols twelve shots and did no more than nick the mans arm joey threw the pistols away disgusted they were poor weapons he was not ready to admit that his aim was bad joey rode to a little rise overlooking the river when the man was about seventy yards away joey took out the great rifle and shot the man twice aiming for his knees he did not mean to cut the mans arms and legs off as he had benitos but he did mean to cripple him the mans knees were shattered and he writhed on the ground screaming when he passed out joey rode close to look at him his legs were leaking a pool of blood probably the man would bleed to death as benito had benito had made his mother whore like a beast on all fours joey had seen them in the bed many times in the early morning benito would be behind his mother prodding her as bulls prodded or dogs that was why joey followed him roped him and cut off his hands and feet with the machete so that he would not prod his mother on all fours again the railroad man was not so guilty but he looked a little like benito which was his misfortune his mother didnt even know that joey had seen her in her shame or that he had followed benito and killed him later in a cooler mood joey went back and got his pistols he shot the bleeding railroad man at close range ten yards away then he rode back to the train he had never been on a train and was curious about it the men he had killed must have some possessions there might be things he would want among their baggage what he found far exceeded his expectations three of the men had winchesters fairly new winchesters he could sell besides the rifles he found two watches a nice knife a razor with ivory sides a little shaving brush and some soap that smelled like the soap a woman might use the soap surprised joey the men were just men not clean not neat he wondered which one had used the fancy soap he also found three hundred yankee dollars in gold finding the money stunned him three hundred dollars was more than all the people in the village of ojinaga had put together it was more money than he had ever expected to see and yet this was just a poor train carrying a few hundred sheep if such a train yielded several guns the knife the razor the watches the nicesmelling soap and the three hundred dollars what would he find if he robbed a train with many people on it what if he robbed a train with rich gringos on it what would they have joey had only killed the men to try out his new rifle he had not been particularly interested in robbing the train but now that he had robbed it he began to think it might be interesting to rob a better train a train with wealthy people on it people who would own interesting things once joey had combed through the mens effects againhe had missed two coins and a nice pocketknifehe prepared to ride away into texas when they discovered the bodies they would expect him to go into mexico but they did not think very well the texans he thought he might go to san antonio and buy things with his new money as he prepared to ride away he paused for a moment to consider the sheep there were several hundred of them stuffed into the hot boxcars the day was very hot and the sheep had no water no food if he didnt let them out or if someone didnt find the train all the sheep would be dead joey thought about letting the sheep out he could use them for target practice he could let them graze a few hundred yards away and pick them off with his great gun pretending they were gringos but his ammunition was limited he did not have cartridges to waste on sheep his brother rafael lived with sheep and goats he would have brought them into the house if his mother had permitted it rafael with his curly dirty hair looked like a sheep he sang like a sheep too his little songs were like bleats teresa defended rafael fiercely once when joey was teasing him she had managed to grab a knife and stick him in the shoulder through his shirt because teresa was blind he had underestimated her when he laughed at rafael teresa grabbed the knife and struck at the sound joey knocked her down and kicked her but the damage was done she had made a hole in his shirt it was a new shirt too one that he had bargained for in presidio it was a shock to discover that a blind girl could be so quick remembering rafael and teresa and his ruined shirt hardened joeys mind toward the sheep he did not let them out he merely whistled at them a few times as he loped beside the cars that held them prisoner seven hundred and twelve sheep died in the boxcars the cars were covered with buzzards when the railroad men found the train the sky was so black with buzzards that they could be seen for fifty miles the men from the railroad had to wrap wet blankets around their heads in order to be able to run in and disconnect the cars that held the hundreds of dead and melting sheep the buzzards were so thick around the sides of the cars that the men had to beat them away with clubs the couplings of the cars were fouled so badly that some men fainted and some ran away they could not breathe long enough to work the couplings loose finally they had to be content with taking the engine and even that was covered with buzzards you know how flies will swarm on meat goodnight told call goodnight had been in south texas at the time and took an interest in the incident yes they swarm call said im told the buzzards swarmed on that train like big flies goodnight said the garza boy wasnt known at the time but it sounds like him to me not too many people would ride off and leave seven hundred sheep to die seven hundred and twelve call said well i wasnt there to count so i dont know why they think they know that goodnight said he was often annoyed by woodrow calls pedantry when it came to matters of that sort i expect the railroad knew beforehandthats probably how they got the figure call said then i doubt it was accurate goodnight said i never met a railroad man who could count animals on the hoof particularly sheep sheep all look alike call said that aint my point goodnight said an animals an animal the problem is most people cant count accurately i never met a railroad man who could count the legs of a threelegged cat the more goodnight thought about human incapacity of which he had witnessed a great deal the more he warmed to his subject i cant say that its just railroad men he said people cant count animals i am one of the few that can whats the most you ever counted in one count call asked the mans irascibility had always put him off slightly though he knew that he himself had a reputation for being a fair rival to goodnight in that area eleven thousand eight hundred and fourteen cattle goodnight said without hesitation that was four herds i counted them into a holding pasture in pueblo colorado the last time i made the trip it should have been eleven thousand eight hundred and fortyeight we lost thirtyfour head or rather bill starr did i entrusted him with the second herd which was a mistake i like bill but he was deficient in a sense and he still is those sheep would have been hell to count once they burst call said goodnight had driven a wagon into clarendon to bring back some groceries and a few posthole diggers and call riding a horse that in goodnights opinion was beneath his standards fell in with him on the return trip joey garza had just robbed his third train killing five people all of them white but goodnight was not thinking of the young killer on the border he was still thinking about human incapacity do you think a man can acquire sense or would he have to be born with it he asked call sense call asked cow sense or weather sense or what kind i thought i was asking the questions goodnight said youre known to be directjust be direct are you born with sense or do you acquire it a little at a time i didnt know much when i was twenty call replied i believe i make better decisions now i thought your best decision was to take that herd to montana goodnight said it was bold because the indians werent whipped they got your partner and they might have got you but it was a good decision anyway montana was there waiting it needed someone to come and put a herd in it call said nothing the man was tactless to bring up montana goodnight and virtually every adult in the west if they were interested in the cattle trade knew what a failure his montana venture had been it might have been smart if i had known how to run a ranch call said finally i didnt gus was able he could run pretty much anything but he died before we got started the whole venture was a total failure i dont see it that way goodnight said well it wasnt your ranch call pointed out no it wasnt my ranch but i hate to see you thinking like a banker goodnight said from a bankers point of view all my ventures have been failures including this one im venturing now this palo duro ranch the lawyers will take it away from me before im dead lawyers and bankers are like shit beetles theyll finally carry off everything ive built up like they carried off your ranch up above the yellowstone i would have liked to see the yellowstone ive heard its mighty fine country up there he added if i could get around like i used to id ride up to the yellowstone just to be able to say id seen it you ought to goit is fine country call said goodnight rode in silence for several miles he had to pop his little team of mules hard with the reins to get them to pull the wagon up the bank once they forded cow creek im no student of the ledger sheets he said a little angrily once they left cow creek behind call found goodnights way of talking hard to follow they hadnt been talking of banks or ledger sheets what did the man mean bankers live by ledger sheets goodnight informed him they decide youre a failure if your balance hits zero or if you cant pay your note youre a damn fool for thinking like a banker i dont think like a banker call assured him i dont even have a bank account it was a bold thing driving that herd to the yellowstone goodnight said you went right through the sioux and the cheyenne it was a bold thing you ought not to let the bankers tell you youre a failure because you went broke ive been broke nine times in my life and i may be broke again before im through but ive never been lost day or night rain or shine and i aint a failure i wonder if roy bean knows anything about the garza boy call asked he might goodnight said hes got a good eye for thieves thats because hes tight roy bean would hang a man over a fart if he didnt like the smell call found the conversation tiring he had only fallen in with goodnight to be sociable after all he was the mans guest he trotted ahead for a bit thinking about the seven hundred and twelve dead sheep he had seen the bones of the comanche horse herd the one colonel mackenzie had destroyed but those were just bones cleaned by the winds and the sun seven hundred dead sheep crammed into boxcars was a different story if i was the railroad i expect id just burn those boxcars he said when he dropped back even with goodnight would you accompany me if i decide to make that trip to the yellowstone goodnight asked as they rode up to his barn no youll have to find other company if you go call said id rather be shut of montana you cant miss the river though i told you ive never been lost day or night goodnight said i can generally locate a river i expect so i dont know why i said it call replied the man was a famous plainsman of course he could find the yellowstone river i am not good at conversation goodbye he said but goodnight was already unloading the posthole diggers and didnt answer brookshire knew the minute he walked into the telegraph office in laredo that there was trouble big trouble no fewer than seven telegrams awaited him all from colonel terry two telegrams from colonel terry was so unusual that it usually meant war had been declared brookshire had never expected to be unlucky enough to receive seven at one time and yet it had occurred in the hot town of laredo aint you gonna open them the old telegraph clerk said his name was johnny whitman and he had been a telegraph operator on the border for twentynine years never before had he received seven telegrams for one person only to have that person refuse to open them and share the excitement perhaps there was a war perhaps troops were on their way from san antonio with orders to kill all the mexicans if that was so and johnny whitman hoped it was there would be rapid business for a few months brookshire knew the man wanted him to open the telegrams and share the news with him but he didnt care seven telegrams from colonel terry could only mean one thing the garza boy had struck again before captain call could do his job if that was the case then at least one of the telegrams might be informing him that he was fired in that event he wouldnt have to worry about colonel terrys fiery temper anymore but he would certainly have to worry about katies she did not like change katie he had a job and she expected him to keep it news that he was fired would undoubtedly cause her temper to flare up it had been nippy in amarillo winter was supposed to be nippy and brookshire hadnt minded then in san antonio which was still in the same state it had been hot mighty hot he didnt suppose it could get any hotter than it had been in san antonio but after a few hours in laredo he was forced to admit an error laredo which was in the same state was hotter still their arrival in laredo had been unpleasant on other grounds too bolivar had begun to cry and wail when they crossed the river into nuevo laredo bolivar knew that the captain was about to leave him no capitan no he pleaded i want to go i can ride and shoot yes and you have shot call reminded him you shot our best mule and for no reason bolivar had a vague memory of shooting a mule he had shot it in the stomach with a big gun now though he couldnt remember why perhaps the mule had tried to bite him mules were known to bite i thought i was shooting the devil bolivar said in hopes of convincing the captain that shooting the mule had been an act prompted by forces stronger than himself no you thought it was an indian call said you have to stay here bolyou might get hurt if i take you ill be back for you when i head home soon he was handing money to a small tiredlooking mexican woman who was not unlike the woman he had given money to in san antonio brookshire decided the old man must have been a superlative cook for the captain to keep supporting him all these years bolivar didnt appreciate the fact that the captain had another decent family to place him with though he wanted to ride the river with the captain to ride and shoot kill or be killed at the thought that he would have to stay with the woman and the children again he began to weep and he was still weeping when the captain and brookshire rode off be quiet youre old you need to rest juanita said she was not happy to see the old man he caused many problems but she needed the money he was not a bad old man just noisy and sometimes a little violent to himself brookshire stumbled out of the telegraph office pale with shock and took the seven telegrams to captain call who was talking with the local sheriff a young man named jekyll who sported a walrus mustache call was trying to find out the local gossip about the garza boy to the surprise of both call and the sheriff brookshire simply thrust the seven telegrams into calls hands would you read them please im too worried he said call led brookshire a little distance down the road to a shade tree before opening the first of the telegrams he knew sheriff jekyll was dead curious about the information they contained but he preferred to take the cautious rather than the polite approach the less information got spread around the better well its bad call said when he had read all seven telegrams hes done it again and somebody else has started doing it too he gave brookshire the telegrams and brookshire read them quickly three more trains had been struck three three my god brookshire exclaimed even one more train robbery would have been a calamity but three amounted almost to a world catastrophe news that an earthquake had leveled new york city could not have been more unwelcome i dont see anything about a second robber wheres that brookshire asked the telegrams dont say itits the distances that say it call said according to this a train was robbed in van horn one afternoon and another in deming new mexico the next morning nobodys swift enough to cover that distance in twelve hours call methodically arranged the telegrams in order and read brookshire the totals two crew and three passengers killed near van horn little money taken two crew and two passengers killed near falfurrias little money taken and three crew and four passengers killed near deming another military payroll lost o lord spare us brookshire said thats another payroll lostthe army will be mad for sure its the passengers the lord should have spared call said thats sixteen lives lost in a little over a week mr brookshire i fought indians for fifteen years on the frontier and i lost six men this is not a robber were after its a killeror two killers it looks like now if theres two robbers or two killers whos the other one brookshire asked i dont know call said well one of thems a robber too brookshire said hes taken three payrolls and lots of trinkets yes he takes the money call said or they take the money because its there but the killings worry me more how many were killed before i took this job brookshire tried to think three robberies had occurred before he left new york another occurred while he was in chicago the one with the sheep wasnt on colonel terrys railroad so brookshire didnt count it though he supposed he ought to count the dead men it seemed to him that there had been three or four deaths each time but he wasnt sure six had died on the sheep train and now there were another sixteen dead the count was in the thirties somewhere so there was no denying it was a startling death toll his regiment had only lost forty men during the entire civil war of course his regiment had not been in the thickest of the action still the war had been carnage from start to finish and it was a shock to realize that one mexican boy in the course of a few months had taken more lives than his regiment had lost in the war i doubt wesley hardin has killed that many people yet call said and wesley hardin is a bad one near the livery stable where call had encountered sheriff jekyll a large log had been rolled into the shade to make a sitting place two old men with only a few teeth between them were sitting on it whittling with small pocketknives call went over and sat on the log too he was annoyed with himself for not having taken the casualty figures more seriously sooner the numbers had been available but numbers were usually exaggerated he had fought several fierce battles with both indians and mexicans in which no one was killed on either side usually there were wounds but fighting men were not easily killed in the war of course the great engagements had left hundreds or even thousands dead but frontier fighting was of a different order in the worst indian fight he had engaged in he had only been able to say positively that two indians were killedhe buried the two himself call rarely saw a newspaper and had not followed the garza boys murdering that closely he had assumed that the figures were exaggerated let one or two people get killed in a feud or a ruckus and as the story went up and down the trail the figure would swell until it became twenty or thirty before the garza boy showed up the most notorious outlaw in the west was billy the kid who was said to have killed a man for every year of his life when he was nineteen but dish boggett the gifted hat creek cowboy who was now selling hardware in lincoln county new mexico where the troubles occurred assured call that the boy had only killed four or five men goodnight who had been in lincoln county while the range war was going on agreed with that figure if the information in the telegrams was true joey garza had quickly eclipsed billy the kid as a killer in his conversation with sheriff jekyll call had asked if anyone knew how the garza boy got the trains to stop one man working without a gang would have to be inventive to stop a train he piles rocks on the tracks sheriff jekyll said he aint lazy he works in the night piling up rocks till he gets a kind of wall but a locomotive going full speed could bust through a pile of rocks surely call said maybe but the train might derail and then youd be in a pickle the sheriff replied if joey garzas after you youre in a pickle anyway a lanky deputy named ted plunkert observed if it was me and i was driving the dern train and i seen a pile of rocks and thought joey garza had piled it up id pour on the steam the deputy added sheriff jekyll looked startled and embarrassed by his deputys remark it had never occurred to him that ted plunkert would venture an opinion of any kind in the presence of the great captain call ted plunkert had not made a comment of such length and complexity since jekyll had hired him what could have prompted him to wag his tongue for five minutes when he the sheriff was discussing serious matters with captain woodrow call ted you were not consulted sheriff jekyll said bluntly ill consult himhes making better sense than you are call said no less bluntly he didnt like jekylls manner which was fawning yet superior many young lawmen took a similar tone with him nowadays sheriff jekyll blushed scarlet call thought the man might have a seizure he was so embarrassed well the engineer can plow on if he wants to risk it the sheriff said its run or fight if youre dealing with joey deputy plunkert said i doubt id be ashamed to run if he had the drop on me are you employed steady or would you consider accompanying me call asked he liked the deputys dry manner and matteroffact outlook its steady but its warm the deputy said i wouldnt mind going to higher country where there might be a breeze once a month or so now plunkert who asked you into this conversation sheriff jekyll said he considered it damn unneighborly of the captain to try and hire his deputy he didnt much care for ted plunkert but if he left there would be no one but himself to sweep out the jail call sat on the log by the toothless old men and considered the situation survivors of the robberies claimed there was no gang a single blond mexican boy well mounted showed up and took their finer possessions though some of the passengers were armed something in the boys manner kept them from using their arms in their own defense the lost payrolls had come to almost a million dollars in cash dozens of watches and rings and jewels had been taken and the people killed had not been offering any resistance the boy stopped trains carrying a score or more passengers robbed them killed a few and left only to strike again far away when it suited him in calls experience it was unusual for criminals to have such confidence one reason they ran in packs was because confidence was one quality they seemed to lack it was also unusual for criminals to have much ability when they succeeded it was usually because they had circumstance on their side it might be that the garza boy was an exceptiona criminal with real ability brookshire was so upset that he could not keep still he saw captain call sitting on the log with the two old men obviously the captain was thinking matters over brookshire tried to allow him his privacy but it was hard another telegram could arrive from colonel terry at any moment informing them that they were both fired the colonel had never been loath to change help brookshire found himself edging a little closer to the log where the captain sat if only they could get started he might feel a little better aint we gonna start soon he asked joey garza could be getting farther and farther away thats just a guess though call said he might be headed back down the river toward us for all we know what are we going to do brookshire asked the colonel wont sit still for much more of this nobodys asking him to sit still call said he can catch the next train and come out here and catch the boy himself if hes impatient oh but he wont want to brookshire assured him the colonel dont like to leave new yorkhes too attached to miss cora for one thing do you still want to go with me call asked he had taken a liking to brookshire the man was incompetent and he usually despised incompetence but for some reason brookshires incompetence made him likable there was something brave in it for a man who could neither ride nor shoot to be willing to travel over some of the roughest stretches of the west in pursuit of a young killer who had already accounted for nearly forty lives took guts i have to go with you brookshire said ive been ordered suppose you didnt have to go though call said suppose you could choose but captain i cant choose brookshire reminded him i work for colonel terry i cant choose i dont think ive ever chosen i wouldnt know how captain call just looked at him brookshire was so taken aback by the question and the look that he didnt know what to say why ask him what he would do if he could choose he had never chosen he had taken the only job he had been offered married the only woman who would agree to marriage he was just a husband and a salaried man choice didnt play any part in his life his choices were made for him by people who were smarter than he was colonel terry and katie to name two captain call was also smarter than he was brookshire felt sure why had he asked such a question call was wondering if the man would survive there was no answer to the question of course but it was a matter he always pondered when he led men into danger it was also a question he could as well ask of himself if the years had taught him anything it was that survival was a matter that could not be predicted with any accuracy time and again on the frontier men who were well experienced and well equipped rode off one day and got killed gus mccrae his old partner was as competent as any man he had ever known and yet gus had ridden off on a kind of frolic in montana and ended up dead none of the hat creek cowboys had been as competent as gus or deetsthe black man who had served him so well for so longyet gus and deets were dead and some of the least competentsoupy for example or jasper fantwere still alive and flourishing there was no degree of competence that would assure anyone of survival and no scale that would tell a commander which man would live and which man would die if you added it all up reasonably then brookshire would be the first to fall if there was a fight and most people would expect that he himself would be the last but it might not happen that way joey garza was said to have a fine rifle with a telescope sight several cowboys had turned up dead on the pecos ranches shot while riding alone far from their headquarters it might be that joey garza was killing people who never saw him never suspected that he was anywhere near instinct however well honed could not necessarily warn one that a young killer hidden behind a rock four hundred yards away with the sun at his back was looking through a telescope sight about to squeeze the trigger if joey garza happened to see him and brookshire riding along which would he shoot first the ranger or the dude you can come with me call said but its up to you to keep up i might not be able to stop and help you youve got to try and keep up captain ill keep upim a grown man brookshire said a little insulted call stood up and handed brookshire the telegrams we need one more man he said i think ill hire that lanky deputy oh the tall fellow brookshire asked surprised yes call said you did say i could hire a man to make up for pea eye didnt you why yes provided hes not too expensive brookshire said how do you know hell go he has a job right here in town the man looked restless call replied i expect hell come doobie plunkert cried so hard she ran completely out of breath she stood in her own kitchen gasping like a fish her mouth open trying to suck in air but mainly pouring out tears ted stood behind her timidly patting her on the back as if she were a baby who needed to burp the timid way ted patted her was beginning to make doobie angry when ted walked in and announced that he was going to el paso or possibly farther to help some old lawman she had never heard of catch a bandit ted had no business chasing doobie had been stricken to the heart how could he when she was already four months pregnant with their baby a little boy she hoped she planned to name him edward after his father but they would just call him eddie and he would be the light of their life doobie had never in her short married life of almost eight months supposed that ted plunkert would leave her for any reason whatsoever not leave her overnight that is so far she and ted had slept together every single night of their marriage of course doobie understood that accidents might happen the milk cow might get loose or one of the horses run away in that event ted would have to go looking for them and might not get back just when she wanted to go to bed he might even be gone as late as midnight as he was on the nights when he was required to watch the jail until all the saloons closed and all the drunks and bullies were rounded up not having ted beside her until around midnight was just one of those things you had to put up with if you married a lawman doobie was sixteen years old and married to a deputy sheriff she expected to do her duty even when she was lonely and could think of nothing but how happy it would make her if ted would only get home take his boots off take his socks off take his pants off and his shirt off and get into bed and hug her tight the truth was doobie needed a lot of tight hugging she had grown up poor her mother had died when she was four and the aunt and uncle who raised her were too poor and too busy to pay much attention to her when ted plunkert began to pay attention to her it was like a miracle sent from heavenlike the coming true of the best dream she had ever dreamed he was just the sweetest man willing to hold her tight all night long except maybe for a few nights in july and august when it was really too hot to hold anyone tight for very long now ted was leaving after only eight months with her it was the end of all her dreams and she told ted so just before she burst into tears and cried so hard she lost her breath stop honey stop honey ted kept saying as he patted her timidly in various places were just going after joey garza thats all soon as the captain catches up with him im coming right back here to my darling but neither teds words nor his pats had any power to soothe doobie ted was going away he was going to leave her alone all night maybe weeks and weeks of nights it was the end of her happiness the only true happiness she had ever known and it was all happening because the old lawman had butted in where he wasnt wanted and persuaded ted to go with him the thing that hurt the most after the fact that ted wouldnt be there to hug her tight for many many nights was that ted hadnt even asked if he could go one of the nicest things about ted was that in all matters involving their domestic life he let her be boss even before they married he let her boss and in fact even offered formally to let her boss im too busy ive got my deputying he said you look after the rest of it ted had kept his word too if doobie wanted to go to church on sunday they went if she didnt they didnt if it was a fine day and she felt like wading in the river ted went with her took off his boots rolled up his pants legs and waded in the river with her doobie loved it that she got to be the boss during her hard life with her aunt and uncle she had been more like a slave than a boss in her marriage though doobie tried very hard to make good decisions about what to cook or when to clean or how to doctor ted when he got an ailment usually the grippe she tried hard and she had convinced herself that she was doing a good job and that ted was happy because she was convinced that she was doing a good job it hit her all the harder when ted walked in and announced that he was leaving in an hour he said it matteroffactly as if he were telling her it might rain doobie couldnt grasp it at first she thought she must have misheard or misunderstood or that she must still be asleep having the worst dream of her life instead of the best when doobie had to admit that it was true that it wasnt a dream or a misunderstanding she started crying and cried until she ran out of breath it was a worse shock than her mothers death when her mother died she had been young and her mother had always been sick there had been so little happiness that it wasnt very different when her mother went the big difference was that her aunt gladys slapped her frequently her mother had never slapped her in her entire life but it was certain doobie knew immediately that it was going to be a very different life now that ted wasnt going to be there to hold her tight every night stop patting me on the back doobie said vehemently when she started breathing again and could speak at that point she still had a little bit of hope that ted would change his mind they had a happy marriage all eight months of it and ted probably had no idea that his going away would upset her so after all he had no reason to go away and no place to go away to not until the old lawman showed up doobie had long realized that teds way of thinking was different from her own what she needed to do was let him know how strongly she felt and make it clear how much she needed him to stay with her she had been told by her one good friend susanna slack that men were a little dumb in some ways susanna maintained that they didnt understand the first thing about how women felt mainly susanna believed men didnt even care to try to understand the first thing about how women felt that had never sounded exactly right to doobie maybe ted didnt really understand how she felt but he was willing to let her be the boss of their family life and that amounted to pretty much the same thing now though in her shock and misery doobie was forced to consider that susanna had been right after all ted plunkert didnt know a thing about how she felt i guess i better go round up some bedding ted said as her tears were subsiding the captains in a hurry to get going the captain whos he doobie said furious hes just some old man i never heard of i dont see why you think you have to go with him why its captain call ted plunkert said shocked he knew his wife hadnt had the advantage of much schoolinghe himself hadnt had much eitherbut he had not supposed her ignorance to be so profound that she would never have heard of captain call i never heard of captain call i tell you doobie yelled i never heard of him he dont live here why would i have heard of him why its captain call ted plunkert repeated everybodys heard of him hes the most famous texas ranger of all time ted said still shocked he was a little embarrassed for doobie it was almost as bad as if she had told him she had never heard of air or the moon or something he had lived along the border all his life and along the border the captain was about as well known as air or the moon well i aint heard of him why do you have to go doobie asked she was ready to plead and beg if she had to doobie theres no why to it ted explained patiently the captain asked me to ride with him thats it if he asked you you could have said no doobie pointed out in what she thought was a reasonable even a calm voice he aint the president he cant just order you to run off and leave your wife doobie i swear hes captain call ted said again you dont just go around saying no to him doobie was silent she didnt want to be angry but she felt herself getting angryvery angry besides ted added its a big honor to be asked to ride with him i expect its about the biggest honor ive ever had in my life or ever will have what if you aint back when the baby is born doobie asked what if you dont never come back what if you never even see our little eddie if you go off and get killed little eddie might never even get to have a daddy i guess i better round up that bedding ted said trying to be patient in fact he was becoming a little exasperated his private belief was that doobie had temporarily lost her mind instead of feeling honored that captain woodrow call the most famous texas ranger of all time had singled him out from all the men in laredo and asked him to go up the river with him all doobie could do was cry and complain after all the great man could have asked bob jekyll to go with him bob was the sheriff and had a better claim to such an honor but captain call had walked around bob jekyll and had chosen him it ought to have been the proudest moment of their marriage and yet all doobie could do was bawl like a heifer of course he loved doobie no man could ask for a better little wife her biscuits were firstrate and she could even repair boots if the holes in the boots werent too big ted sincerely hoped she would soon get over being out of her mind she had no business suggesting that he might have turned down captain calls offer of course he couldnt refuse woodrow call just because doobie chose to bawl like a heifer for an hour it was very inconsiderate of her ted thought after all he did have to gather up his bedding and could have used some help he didnt get any help though almost an hour had passed and he had to rush one consequence of the rushing was that he forgot his slicker an oversight that was to cause him much misery on the trail doobie plunkert stood at the back door of their little house and watched hopelessly as ted and the old captain and the fat little yankee rode away she felt her heart breaking she didnt think she would be able to endure the ache if ted had just once turned in the saddle and waved at her it would have made the ache a little easier to bear even when he was just walking down the street to do his deputying ted would sometimes turn and wave at her the fact was she loved him so much that she could miss him acutely even when he was just down the street often she had an urge to run visit him at the jail just to see if he still looked the same or if his smile was as sweet but doobie could never indulge herself when she had this longing sheriff jekyll had made it plain the one time she stuck her nose in the door that it was the last time he expected to see her at the jail he lectured ted so severely about his wifes behavior that ted told her that evening never to go near the jail again theres rules he told her that night he was gentle about it but doobies feelings were still a little hurt all she had wanted to do was peek at her husband to be sure he looked the same now watching him ride north along the river with two strangers one of whom in her view was no more than an old killer doobie cried again she cried until she was cried out she felt sure that little eddie was crying too inside her there were rules just as ted had warned her and the main one seemed to be that men could leave when they chose to they could close doors to jails and other places when they wanted to and not wave when they left their wives to go off on manhunts they could do any and all of those things and worse for all she knew all the same though she didnt like the rules doobie really wanted ted to come back that night without him to hold her tight she had many dreams and tossed and turned but the best dream she had was that the bandit they were after joey garza came riding into laredo to surrender so that ted and the ranger and the yankee didnt have to go at all doobies dream was so vivid that she could even smell her husband ted plunkert he smelled of saddle soap only that morning he had taken it into his head to saddlesoap his old saddle it gave off a good smell saddle soap smelling it in her dream made doobie remember what a good man ted was and how kind he had always been to her the best part of the dream though was that ted not only smelled of saddle soap ted was there he snuck into the bedroom as he always did when he came in late he took off his boots took off his pants took off his shirt and climbed into bed to hold her tight as she always hoped he would not just for one night but throughout her whole life doobie tried to stay in her dream to hide in it but she grew more and more restless she began to have moments of wakefulness began to suspect that her dream was just a dream she tried to fight off waking up to burrow deeper into the dream but it didnt work despite herself she woke opened her eyes and knew the worst immediately ted plunkert wasnt there he wasnt there just wasnt there one day when she had no reason to expect trouble or even to be the tiniest bit worried her life with ted plunkert had ended no it aint honey hes just gone on a job her friend susanna told her a little later that morning doobie had been so upset that she had run down the street barefoot and sobbing and flung herself into susannas arms hell never come back hell never come back i know it doobie kept saying between fits of racking sobs hell come back susanna said hell come back doobie in fact she wasnt so sure she couldnt really say it with much conviction because only the year before her husband john slack by consent one of the best cowboys to be found anywhere near the rio grande had ridden out one morning to brand a few calveswork he had done hundreds of times in the twelve years of their marriageand had never come back not alive that is a calf he had just roped turned directly under his horse while the horse was in a dead run the horses front legs buckled and he fell in such a way that it drove john slacks head straight into the ground breaking his neck he died instantly and since then susanna had been a widow at least youve got his child susanna thought willy as she held her sobbing friend she and john had hoped for a child hoped year after year but no child came and now she had nothing of john slack except a few notes he had written her while they were courting and of course her memories memories of being married to the best cowboy in the rio grande valley they had once hoped to have a ranch as well as a child but now john was dead and susanna had neither she had been forced to move to town and take a job clerking in the general store to support herself doobie would not be comforted remembering her own loss made susanna a poor comforter anyway soon she was crying too he wont come back hell never come back doobie said again and again she had never been so convinced of anything as she was that her husband ted plunkert was gone for good little eddie would never know his father she would never again have a husband to hold her tight in the night i was going to give him a new saddle doobie said hopelessly to susanna indeed she had been skimping and saving for just that purpose she had paid down the immense sum of eight dollars to old jesus the local saddlemaker she had discussed teds new saddle with jesus in great detail doobie had even begun to take in sewing to pay for the saddle old jesus had promised it to her by the spring doobies dream was that someday sheriff jekyll would move away and ted would be sheriff of laredo she thought ted would be a wonderful sheriff maybe little eddie could be his deputy when he grew up she wanted ted to have a saddle worthy of the sheriff of laredo now that little dream was lost too jesus had already started on the saddle maybe the best thing she could do would be to let him finish it it could be little eddies saddle one day i hate that old man call doobie said she felt weak from crying so much and so hard but not too weak to hate what she hated she had only seen the old man from a distance the yankee too but she hated them both they had ridden in and taken her ted she hoped they were both killed and that the buzzards ate their guts who does he think he is anyway just to come here and take people like that she asked susanna susanna was ten years older than doobie she had heard many stories about captain call for the cowboys were always talking about him but it had mainly just been men talking she had not paid much attention doobie coming in so upset had upset her too and now it was almost time for her to go to work i think he was an indian fighter susanna said i wish the indians had killed him then doobie said bitterly dont think about it susanna advised she soon had to leave for her job in the store doobie walked back home barefoot not caring how she looked not caring about anything she wished an indian would ride into town and kill her it would be easier than suffering but then she remembered that she had to stay alive so that little eddie could be born it seemed hard but she would have to do it she would have to do it without ted too yesterday he had been there today he was gone and he would not be back ted was not very tough doobie knew that he would not be very hard to kill somebody would kill himthis joey garza or someone else she knew it in her bones doobie walked on home and hid in her bed all day wondering who would be the one to bring her the news and how long it would be before it came as a girl of ten maria had been given a crippled ponynot a true pony but a small spotted horse that had injured itself badly on some barbed wire strung by the men who owned the big ranch across the river the men had been careless with their wire and the little horse had become entangled in a coil and had cut one foot so badly that everyone thought it would lose its hoof the villagers in ojinaga were hoping that old ramon who owned the horse would kill it and make horsemeat jerky that was what the people of ojinaga wanted but that was not what ramon wanted ramon though already an old man wanted maria who was only ten ramon had a wife named carmila a quarrelsome woman liked by no one but liked least by ramon whod endured her angry eyes and acid tongue for thirty years now carmila was sick it was thought she had a tumor in her womb as the tumor grew carmila became even more angry and spiteful and refused to be with ramon she told him she thought he had put the tumor in her womb out of spite because she would bear him no more children she had already borne him thirteen denied relations with his wife ramons thoughts turned more and more to maria whose breasts were already budding one day noticing that maria came every day to pet the crippled horse the horse he had been thinking of making into jerky ramon impulsively gave it to maria he was not just being generous he was preparing the way for a serious courtship as soon as carmila died he meant to go to tomas marias father and ask for her hand that plan failed because tomas and his oldest son and soninlaw got caught in texas with twenty stolen horses a ranger troop led by captain call and captain mccrae caught the men and they were hung within an hour of their capture ramon considered and decided not to take back the horse which could walk fairly well and even trot although it had only three good legs when the news came that her father and brother were dead maria took her horse whom she called three legs and walked far down the river farther than she had ever gone before she never rode three legs but she loved him more than anything else in her life every day she made a poultice for his wounded hoof hoping it would heal but a tendon had been severed when three legs got caught in the wire with the tendon cut the leg could not heal during her time on the river mourning for her father maria ate mesquite beans and nibbled carefully at prickly pear apples once or twice she was able to scoop a little fish out of the water the fish she ate raw once she caught a small turtle meaning to eat it but instead she kept it for a few days and let it go during the day she walked with three legs as he foraged during the worst of the heat she found shade often she looked across the river at the hated place called texas where men killed other men over a few horses she wanted to kill all the men who had hung her father and brother she did not suppose it would ever be in her power to kill them but she vowed to do it if she could at night she looked at the bright stars sleeping little listening to the river she did not understand rivers where did so much water come from she wondered if the river began in the sky where the rain lived on some days she didnt eat at all though always she drank the cold water of the river ramon was furious with maria for going away with the horse he had given her he wanted to find her and beat her but in the end he was too lazy to go look for her it didnt bother ramon that tomas and his boy had been hung they were sloppy thieves and it was no surprise to him that the rangers had caught them and hung them they had known the danger before they crossed the border horse thieves had to hang that was the law on either side of the river it angered ramon that a girl of ten would take it upon herself to leave without asking anyone andwitha horse he had given her carmila his wife was dyingshe might go any day now her stomach was blue and swollen she could not keep food down all ramon could think about during marias absence were her little budding breasts he wanted to touch fresh young breasts not the tired sacks that carmila had finally maria walked back to the village the mesquite beans were gone and she was hungry two days after marias return ramon caught her in the cornfield she was feeding three legs corn from her hand maria greeted ramon with a friendly smile but one look at his face told her that ramon was not in a friendly mood she knew little about men and women she was shocked when ramon simply shoved her down in the cornfield and began to pull at her clothes she screamed and ramon hit her she screamed again and he hit her again maria thought he had gone berserk when he tried to pry her legs apart no one in the village came maria was weak from her fast and ramon was strong also maria was so shocked at the change in ramon who had been her neighbor all her life that she did not know what to do she thought his wifes illness must have driven him insane he was acting like a crazy man his face was twisted he bared his teeth and he was ready to hit her again if she tried to scream maria gave up her life had become nothing but pain she was surprised by ramons pleasure which soon dripped out of her along with her own blood while he still held her down ramon told maria that he wanted her to live with him now carmila would soon be dead as soon as she died he would marry maria even as he crushed her into the dirt ramon was eager to let maria know that his intentions were good maria was almost more shocked by what ramon told her than by what he had done to her she did not want to marry ramon or anyone what had happened in the cornfield frightened her and hurt her but it also taught her something it taught her what men really wanted of women what they really wanted was what ramon had just taken from her carmila died the next day two days after her funeral marias mother silvana told maria that ramon had asked to marry her silvana thought maria should do it ramon had moneynot much but more than they had maria had two younger brothers and a little sister they were mouths that silvana had to struggle hard to feed she did not think much of ramon but he was no worse than most men if maria married him he might be kind to her family to silvana and the little ones again maria was shocked she knew that her mother was tired silvana had worked hard all her life she had lost a husband and a grown son she had given up maria knew what it was to give up for she had given up in the cornfield given up because she was afraid a crazy old man might kill her still maria had no intention of marrying ramon or anyone he is a bad man maria told her mother he did a bad thing to me she had not meant to tell about the bad thing but she could not hold back silvana was saddened by this news it confirmed a fear that she had had for two years ramon was not to be trusted around maria silvana cried but not for long it was only one more sorrow heaped on many others so many that silvana could not cry long for any of them he is not as bad as some men silvana pointed out he is a bad man he bit me maria said she showed her mother a mark on her shoulder a mark ramon had put there with his teeth he is not even as bad as your father silvana said your father did worse things marry ramon maria it will help us eat but maria wouldnt not even if they all starved silvana had to tell ramon that maria had refused she was a stubborn girl stubborn enough to deny her mothers wish ramon did not take this news well he cursed silvana and he told her he did not think she had asked maria he was only seventytwo and he had given the girl a horse crippled it was true but still a horse how many men in ojinaga were wealthy enough to give a tenyearold girl a horse after that ramon watched maria constantly he became obsessed with her sometimes he even crawled up to her window at night hoping to see her undress he watched the cornfield meaning to catch her again and repeat what he had done soon he was convinced maria would accept him she was not experienced if she would consent or if he could catch her she would realize that he was a good man soon she would welcome his attentions he was convinced of it but while ramon was watching maria maria also watched him she would not be caught again as she had been caught when she thought ramon was her friend now she knew what he was and he was not her friend perhaps no men would be her friends not if they went crazy as ramon had every time they wanted to go between her legs not if all they wanted was to make her serve their pleasure she was determined that ramon for one would never have that pleasure with her again her dead brother had left an old machete behind when he went to texas on the raid that led to his death the machete was dull but maria carefully sharpened it on the grindstone until its blade was as keen as a razor she began to wear the machete in its scabbard over her shoulder whenever she led three legs into the cornfield in search of fodder she carried the machete in one hand one day when silvana had gone to the river to wash clothes ramon snuck into her house hoping to take maria by surprise instead he found her just inside the door in the dim kitchen her machete gripped in both hands ramon cursed her bitterly then but he didnt challenge her knife he was too slow and his eyesight was not good maria might cut him badly before he subdued her he might bleed to death or get an infection in the cut many men he knew had died from infections in the cuts they received in fighting ramon did not plan to lose his life because a tenyearold girl cut him with a machete that afternoon when silvana was back ramon came over and offered to buy maria he could not get the girl off his mind he felt that the rest of his life would be a sour thing if he could not have maria he wanted her so badly that he offered silvana two hundred pesos for her two hundred pesos was an unheardof price for a girl so young and inexperienced to ramons surprise and chagrin silvana countered by offering herself in marias stead she doesnt want you silvana said she wont marry you take me i am your neighbor and i need a husband ramon was outraged he wanted the girl not the mother you are too old he said almost as old as carmila sell me the girl she wont go with you shell cut you when youre asleep silvana said tomass mother was part apache maria is like her they are not afraid to cut men i didnt know tomass mother ramon said a little daunted he did not like apaches but he still wanted maria and he said so no she wont marry you silvana repeated take me i am not so old silvana had not expected to offer herself to a man who wanted her daughter but then she had not expected many things that had happened in her life this was just one more surprise and it would help her feed her children ramon spat and turned away in disgust he did not want any more old women the next morning a gunshot woke maria fear went through her heart she ran outside with the machete but she was too late ramon had shot three legs he didnt make him into jerky though he just led him out beyond the cornfield and shot him maria cried until she couldnt cry anymore when her mother came to comfort her she stopped crying and became like a stone it was another lesson about men they wanted only one thing and they were vengeful if they didnt get it or enough of it later she was to learn that if someone else got what they wanted they were even more vengeful a few weeks later ramon changed his mind and took silvana he had begun to be a little bit afraid of the girl after all she was part apache she might cut him in his sleep whenever he looked at her he saw hatred in her eyes black hatred he began to avoid her especially to avoid her hating eyes her hatred was too black she might be a witch he began to be fearful that maria would sneak in and cut him in his own house she was only a filthy indian he had been a fool to want her silvana was not so old after all she did not smell bad as carmila had she was a decent mexican woman and she had something of the beauty her daughter had ramon didnt want to marry her but he took her into his house her brats had to stay in her house though he gave her a little money for their food but he didnt want them underfoot silvanas younger children the two boys and the little girl stayed with maria in silvanas house maria became their mother they saw little of silvana once she became ramons woman although his house was only a few steps away maria forgave her mother she knew that silvana was only tired she had accepted ramon because her spirit was weary and dying only a woman whose spirit was dying would submit to a man like ramon when ramon killed three legs maria felt that her spirit might die too she had loved her horse more than anything but her spirit didnt die her hatred kept it alive hatred of ramon and for a time hatred of all men they were creatures of violence brutes maria planned to live alone she would raise her brothers and sister but she did not plan to live with a man as other women did the only way a man would have her was if he was quicker and stronger and took her as ramon had silvana gave ramon two more children much of the time they lived with maria and the other little ones maria felt sorry for her mother because her spirit was so damaged she helped her mother as much as she could but she never turned her back on ramon all she gave him was the hatred in her eyes in time ramon came to fear maria as he feared his own death in the matter of men though maria was wrong she never expected to be with one willingly but the years passed and then carlos garza rode into town he was then a vaquero who worked in the south she saw him looking at her and when he spoke to her in his soft voice she felt a change inside her a few days later she went with carlos willingly and even eagerly only later was maria to learn that carloss soft voice belied his jealous nature soon after she went with him the first time carlos gave her a horse a little white gelding who was too slow for cattle work maria named her little horse chapo because he was so short the day after carlos gave maria the horse the two of them rode together far down the river past the place where maria had gone to mourn her father they entered a canyon whose great cliffs rose over the never carlos garza looked especially beautiful to her that day she was eager for him more eager than she had ever been before in the time of their ride joey was conceived after carlos gave her chapo maria was never without a horse maria traded work for corn in order to feed her boy and her horse joey was six when juan castro sold him to the apaches he was gone two years maria had begun to give up before her son came back and once he did return she found she had to give up again though in a different way juan castro had traded away a good boy a child she loved but the boy who came back was not even a child she knew no one knew joey garza he was the most beautiful boy in the village the girls looked at him and hoped but they hoped in vain it was to be that anyone who invested hope in joey garza hoped in vain from the time he was ten he often left the village to be gone for a month or more maria wondered if he went back to the apaches if the indian ways were stronger than her ways once she asked him if he went to the apaches joey merely looked at her smiling why do you care he asked youre my son she said cant i be curious i wonder about you i dont go to the apaches joey said if i ever go to the apaches again it will be to kill the ones who beat me later by accident maria found out the truth joey went down the river as far down as laredo and he went to steal he was a thief and a gifted one olin roy told her about joeys thieving olin said that joey had found a cave somewhere in the mountains north of boquillas olin had glimpsed joey once at dusk on the mexican side of the river joey had been carrying a fine saddle with silver trappings the silver shone in the late light olin knew the saddle was stolen because only two nights earlier he had stayed at the home of the hidalgo joey stole it from the old man thought an indian had taken it because there were no horse tracks leading to or from his ranch there were no tracks at all it was a long way from the hidalgos ranch to the mountains near boquillas and yet joey was there by the river carrying the saddle it was a thing an apache could do apaches had little use for horses they walked and they left no tracks olin roy camped near the river that night meaning to see if he could find joey the next day but olin didnt find him there were many caves in the high limy cliffs and the mountains rolled back for many miles into texas where the river made its great bend cougars lived in the caves cougars and even a few grizzly bears olin told billy williams what he had seen and billy told many others soon a legend was born the legend of joey garzas cave it was said that joey was filling a cave with things he had stolen rifles fine spurs fancy bridles ivory combs and jewels stolen from the bedrooms of rich ranchers on both sides of the river the river was no boundary to joey he crossed it as he would cross any stream olin told maria what he had seen he loved maria and knew that she worried about her son he also knew that things had not been good between mother and son since joey returned from the apaches when he left here he was on a horse a sorrel he got from ramons son maria said in response to olins news when he came back he was walking he leaves on horsebackhe returns on foot or he leaves on foot and returns with a horse hes a boy i dont understand maybe joey eats the horses apaches do you know olin said when he was discussing the matter with billy williams its a long way from ojinaga to laredo but joey steals from laredo like it was a candy store if he steals horses then its better that he eats them billy said he had always liked joey he thought he was a good boy but strange being strange was not something he could hold against anyone after all he himself was strange life makes everybody strange if you keep living long enough billy told maria once maria disagreed i am not strange she said i could be a happy woman if i had a little help well ill help you billy said you name it ill do it if you really wanted to help me i wouldnt have to name it maria said youd be doing it right now she smiled when she said it though billy williams felt disquieted they had just eaten a good meal cabrito and frijoles what could it be that maria wanted help with he considered asking but in the end he didnt he got drunk instead maria had almost no money she worked as a midwife for food for herself and rafael and teresa her two brothers had run away to texas and her little sister had died one winter she got a sickness in her chest and died within a week maria had to work hard to see that there was enough food for rafael and teresa when joey returned from his journeys he always had money he wore it in a belt that went across his shoulders like the belt of the machete she had once carried to defend herself against ramon it angered maria that her son would not share his money not even the few pesos it would have taken every week to keep his family in food besides her midwifing maria did washing and cleaning so as to be able to give corn and frijoles to her children joey liked for his mother to wash his clothes because she did it well when she did them they were clean and soft joey took the soft clean clothes as his due he never offered to pay for the food he ate and he took no notice of his brother and sister at all unless he was in the mood to torment one of them one day when maria was tired and angryan old man she cooked for had tried to poke his bony hand between her legs and when she shoved him away he spat at hershe challenged joey about the cave i hear you have a cave full of treasures near boquillas she said is that true joey looked at her insolently as he always did when questioned who was this woman to ask questions of him she was a woman who had whored with four men perhaps there had been even more where do you go when you go maria asked when joey said nothing she felt like slapping him maybe punching him with her fist rafael and teresa her damaged children loved her even rafael would come to her bed and try to speak to her to express his little hopes if he had a new chick he would bring it to his mother and offer it to her as a present cupping it tenderly in his large hands teresa would come to her bed to cuddle with her every morning if maria was sad if tears leaked from her eyes teresa would whisper to her and wipe the tears away dont worry mama teresa said i am here rafael is here we will take care of you it made maria angry that her children who had no giftsone who could not see the other who could not reasonwould help her with their love while joey the brilliant one the one whose mind was quick as a young deer whose eyes were blue whose teeth were so white that girls and even grown women melted at his smilejoey gave nothing not even little scraps of information maria did not really much want his money what she wanted was his help someone saw you near boquillas maria said near the cave where you keep the treasures i dont have a cave joey said i go to piedras negras not boquillas there is nothing in boquillas maria thought of following joey to his cave she didnt believe him when he said he didnt have one she didnt want his money for herself she wanted it for her children she had heard that in the city of mexico there were doctors who could cure many ills it was said that there were doctors who could make blind people see she wanted to take teresa to such a doctor it saddened her that her little girl had never seen the beauty of the world also she had heard that there were doctors who could help people whose minds were incomplete or whose thoughts could not stay in order she wanted to take rafael to such a doctor so that someday he could think like other people maria wanted to take her children and go and seek the great doctors in the city of mexico but she had no money joey had money maria wished he could be generous and give her what she needed but she knew he never would joey was not generous and not interested in her life or the lives of his brother and sister he was only interested in himself you help no one she said to joey one day bitter i help myself joey said are you the only one in the world maria asked what is wrong with you joey didnt answer he left as he always did if she asked questions the day maria rode off to crow town to warn joey that captain call the famous manhunter had been sent to kill him billy williams sobered up and made food for marias children as he cooked and set the plates billy felt sad he should have gone with maria although he was nearly as blind as teresa he would have gone if maria had asked him should have gone even though she hadnt asked he was too old for places such as crow town going there might mean his death but it also might mean marias death he would worry now until the moment he saw her again he wondered if maria had refused him because he was a texan after all her husbands had been mexican he didnt know if that had been her reason probably he had made some mistake and maria had turned away from him instead of toward him he ate his frijoles in sadness he was old it was too late the large boy crooned the little blind girl chattered billy thought it would be enough if maria could just escape harm if she could return from crow town to her children his job was to stay sober and take care of her children later though when marias children were asleep on their little pallets the power of the lost never captured love became too much for billy he couldnt bear it not sober and he began to get drunk again now you wish youd gone dont you lorena said pea was standing just outside their back door looking across the plains it was past time to get the team hitched to begin the days work but he was just standing there looking across the plains a norther had blown in around morning and it was going to be a cold ride to school but that wasnt what worried lorena for nearly a month after sending call off without him pea eye had worked with a will but then his will began to falter usually he was out of bed and at work in the kitchen getting a fire started or the boys up or making a beginning at breakfast before she finished feeding laurie and hauled herself from under the covers ten minutes more in bed to gather her energies for the day was something lorena had come to count on but she was able to count on it only because pea was so good about getting up and getting started with the early chores he still got up and made a start on things but with only half a will he made mistakes put one boy into another boys clothes burned the porridge he seemed to be distracted or in a daze or something instead of saving her time he cost her time all of it spent correcting his mistakes the same distractedness stayed with him throughout the day clarie complained that he gave hay to the horses but forgot the milk cow he went off to work as he always did but instead of working from dawn until dark as he had to if the farm was to flourish he would come home in the middle of the afternoon often she would find him in the barn when she returned from school he would have taken a harness to the work bench meaning to repair it but then he didnt repair it he would just hold it and go into his daze lorena let him be for three weeks she had days when she didnt concentrate so well either sometimes she forgot things too or did them badly or just felt lazy she didnt fret that much about human inconsistence for she was human and inconsistent herself but after a time peas distractedness began to irritate her they all had their work she wanted him to do his as she did hers hard work was the basis of their life in the past when pea had gone off with call she and clarie had worked harder than ever so they would still have a life and a farm when pea got back they did well too they couldnt do all the field work but otherwise they kept things going so well that sometimes it took a week or two to adjust to having pea back none of the stock died the barn didnt burn down and the essential things got done picking up the slack when pea eye was gone was one thing having to pick it up when he was there was vexing even more vexing was the cause of his distraction he wished he had gone with captain call lorena stepped outside in the cutting wind and repeated herself now you wish youd gone dont you she said again i wish the captain hadnt gone pea eye said i wish hed quit quit and do what lorena asked he doesnt know how to do anything but kill that aint fair lorie pea eye said if there was one thing he hated to do it was argue with lorena his wife about captain call his old commander yet that was exactly what he was doing and in a cold wind too it is true lorena said maybe in the days of the indian troubles there was a need for a man like him you know there was look what blue duck did and he was just one man pea eye said i dont need to remember what blue duck did lorena said i taught myself to forget it clara taught me about forgetting things like that why he never bothered clara pea eye said he too tried not to think about the terrible time when blue duck one of the worst outlaws ever to terrorize the plains had kidnapped lorena gus mccrae had rescued her and she had survived she had recovered and become his wife what had happened with blue duck was the kind of thing that happened to people all over the frontier in those days he himself had fought over twenty engagements with indians and the first one had frightened him the most it was known to locals as the battle of the stone houses the indians fired the grass and stole the rangers horses putting them afoot in territory where it was easily possible to starve they hadnt starved but pea eye had been a little deaf in his left ear ever since the result of a terrified ranger firing his rifle into the smoke when the smoke was so thick he was unaware that pea eye was kneeling only a yard away those had been hard times without the captains and guss leadership pea eye doubted that he would have been alive to try dirt farming on the plains clara allen though lived in nebraska so far as he knew she had never been taken by anyone as bad as blue duck clara has things to forget too lorena insisted theres other kinds of bad things besides what happened to me all three of her boys died we got three boys how would we be if all three of them died oh lord dont even mention it pea eye said lets get back in the house he felt chastened of course losing children was worse than being half deafened in a fight the thought of his children dying was not something he even wanted to let his mind approach lorie as usual was right life was hard for women too even though they didnt often have to go into battle clara has more to forget than i do lorena said saddened by her own statement and by the memory of claras kindnessand claras sadness which now that clara was older and had seen her girls marry only seemed to sit on her the more heavily judging from the letters she wrote lorena at least clara loved horses and had her herd to work with if i was to lose three children id give up she told her husband if i even lost one child i might give up but clara lost all her boys and she didnt give up and everything she did for me she did after her grief i wasnt saying anything bad about clara pea eye said i guess if it hadnt been for her we might not have come together and i wouldnt have none of this im obliged to clara and i always will be i didnt have nothing but the clothes on my back and she helped me i aint the kind of man who forgets the folks that helped him its just that captain call is one of the folks who helped me he said now he came asking for my help and i didnt go i cant not feel thats wrong even though i know id feel wronger if i went not wrongermore wrong lorena corrected all of a sudden without her wanting it or even expecting it tears flooded her eyes tears of anger and hurt it would never be finished the trouble over call not while the captain was alive it wouldnt go she said vehemently go i want you to ill never really have you while hes alive and neither will the children go and if you get killed good riddance pea eye looked at her stunned i dont want to go he said i told you why and i told the captain why since we been married i aint really wanted to go havent really wanted to go she corrected him again havent pea eye just looked at her bewildered he saw her tears and her anger but didnt really understand that she was trying to correct his grammar i didnt go he pointed out i didnt go i didnt want to neither its just that i feel bad for the captain i cant help it lorena turned away it was a subject she was sick of she didnt speak another word to pea before leaving for school but the sad look in his eyes when she and the children left made her feel sorry all day and as soon as she got home she went down to the barn where she found him trying to straighten a horseshoe he was not that good with tools pea wasnt clarie could often fix things that left pea eye at a loss but seeing him holding the shoe in his handit seemed to lorena that he was just making it more bent touched her he was not mechanical or even very competent physically it was a wonder he had survived in a place where physical competence was so important yet his very lack of skill in areas where most frontiersmen excelled moved her it always had pea eye was a man she could do things for and he would let her do things for him he accepted her instruction gratefully whereas most men she had tried to instruct in even small unimportant matters had usually bristled and become angry in some cases even violently angry but pea eye had no violence in him and he surrendered meekly and tried to pay attention when she or clarie was trying to show him how to do some simple task i didnt mean that about good riddance if you didnt come back she said im sorry i said it i was just mad when lorena apologized to him which she did almost every time she got mad at him and she got mad at him fairly often pea eye felt even more unhappy lorena oughtnt to be having to apologize in his eyes lorie was never wrong if they disagreed he was the one who was wrong in the matter of the captain he had to feel doubly wrong in relation to lorena and his family if he went in relation to the captain if he didnt but this time it seemed he felt even worse the captain had looked old when they met by the train in fact the captain was old he oughtnt to be chasing bandits at his age of course ordinary bandits of which there were a great many still running loose in the west would give the captain no trouble even at his age it was just that the garza boy didnt sound like an ordinary bandit pea eye had run into charles goodnight while at the blacksmiths in quitaque and goodnight had been startled to see him thought you went with call to run down the garza boy he said looking gruff no my familys got too big pea eye said charles goodnight was a stern fellow even when he wasnt being gruff being even slightly in his disfavor was not comfortable ive got a new little one and my wife has to teach school pea said though he felt explanation was hopeless all the good reasons he could muster for not going with the captain werent likely to be good reasons to mr goodnight he would doubtless view them as the captain had excuses made by a man who had no stomach for conflict anymore i dont care to know the details goodnight said looking critically at the hoof of a horse that had just been shod well the captain went away with the man from the railroad pea explained thats a young boy hes after i doubt hell give the captain much trouble the young ones never do youre scarce on your facts goodnight said lifting the hoof so high that the horse almost fell over goodnight was a big man though old he could still lift most of a horse if it was necessary what facts pea eye asked we dont hear that much news out at the farm they estimate joey garza has killed over thirty men and thats just the ones whove been found goodnight said there may be more who havent been found and never will be found he shoots a german rifle with a telescope sight they say he can kill at five hundred yards which is farther than most people can see half the line riders west of the pecos may be dead for all we know whos going to find a line rider if hes shot fifty miles from the bunkhouse who would even miss one line riders dont come back half the time anyway pea had seen rifles with telescope sights they had been available for many years but they were too slow for most of the rangering action and so he had never fired one the notion that a man could be killed at five hundred yards other than by a freak shot such as the famous one billy dixon had made during the adobe walls fight was difficult to grasp most of the killing he had seen had taken place at distances under thirty yards and in many cases under twenty yards five hundred yards was about the distance from lories schoolhouse to the red river he himself could see a bull or a buffalo at that distance but that didnt mean he could hit it if he shot at it good lord i hadnt heard any of that he told goodnight you ought to have gone with your captain goodnight said bluntly this is a time when he might need an experienced man well i swear pea eye said he felt bad in his stomach suddenly mr goodnight was probably right he should have gone i guess the captain will manage he said guiltily in my opinion woodrow call is a fool to be pursuing young killers at his age goodnight said im his age and i aint pursuing young killers pea eye was silent his sense of guilt was swelling within him he had become sick at his stomach just from the weight of the old mans displeasure is he that dangerous this boy pea asked the whole comanche nation would take a year to kill thirty men and that would be in a good year too goodnight replied looking at pea eye solemnly then as if suddenly weary of his thoughts or perhaps even of thinking goodnight set the geldings foot down and mounted him theres always a time when you dont win he said with me its lawyers ive never won against any lawyer not even the dumb ones but lawyers just rob you legally they dont shoot german rifles with telescope sights pea eye had met only two lawyers one of them lived in quanah and had drawn up the deed when he and lorena bought the farm theres always a trip you dont come back from goodnight said he turned his horse as if to leave and then turned back again stood up in his stirrups reached in his pocket and found several coins which he handed to the blacksmith were you just going to let me ride off without paying you he asked the young blacksmith yes sir the blacksmith jim peeples replied it would never have occurred to him to ask charles goodnight for money well that would have been a damn nuisance goodnight said then id have had to ride the whole way back to pay you if you want to thrive in business you better learn to speak up yes sir jim peeples said terrified he had never supposed charles goodnight would speak to him at all much less lecture him it was a little like being lectured by god or at least by the prophet moses jim peeples was a baptist he read the bible every night and much of sunday too he didnt really think he had a clear picture of how god looked but he did think he could imagine the prophet moses fairly accurately in jim peepless opinion moses had looked a lot like charles goodnight goodnight looked down at pea eye the man had made a remarkable walk nearly a hundred miles naked through the cheyenne country to find call and bring him to where his wounded partner augustus mccrae lay dying it was a great thing in goodnights view that walk not too many men in his experience had achieved a great thing even one very few ever achieved more than one he knew he had led men himself many men men as faithful as pea eye had been to call had served with him until they fell and the best of them had fallen goodnight was a married man himself but had no children he had always wondered what it meant to have offspring how would it affect his leadership his ability to go and keep going his attitude toward the dangers of the trail it hadnt happened but he didnt suppose it would have simplified matters if he had in a time of danger he had sometimes thought of his wife but he always thought of his men he did not worry too much about his wife he had never supposed himself to be a very good husband he had always been too busy his wife was an able woman and would probably be happier with someone more settled if something happened to him but he had never had to worry about children and the man who stood before him did have to worry about children i suppose your wife dont like it he said dont like what pea eye asked he was a little surprised to find himself in such a lengthy discussion with charles goodnight a man known all over the west for his dislike of long conversations you and call goodnight said divided loyalties dont appeal to women not that ive noticed i aint divided im loyal to them both pea eye replied that would be fine if call was bunking with you goodnight said the fact is he bunks with me when he bunks which aint much he sure dont bunk with you though now hes in mexico chasing a boy with a german rifle and a dern good eye if he can shoot people at five hundred yards pea eye didnt know what to say captain call had been in danger much of his life but pea eye in the years he had been with him had never really considered that the captain might be killed that was goodnights point thoughthe captain might be killed you think joey garza could kill the captain he asked yes i do goodnight said and turned and rode away pea walked back to the house with lorena after her apology they had a good supper the children were peaceful for once lorena read the boys stories until they fell asleep little laurie liked to listen to the stories too at least she liked to listen to her mothers voice while her mother was reading her little eyes were so bright she waved her hands but she was very quiet while lorena read it was a fine evening but in the middle of the night pea eye woke with a start he was shivering as if with a chill it seemed to him that death was in bed with them when he had been trapped with gus under the cutback in montana his death almost a certainty he hadnt given it much thought he had too much to do keeping alive to worry about dying then on the last day of the long cold hungry walk out he had begun to feel that perhaps he was dead in the dark of the last morning he had felt that deets his friend the black cowboy was walking beside him guiding him deets was dead if he was with deets he must be dead too but he hadnt been within a few hours pea eye found the herd and deets if he was there went back to the place of ghosts now though with lorena beside him and their five children in the house near him pea eye faced death as a thought and as a fact in a way he never had far south below the border captain call might be facing it even at that moment little laurie might be taken the next time she had the croup lorie might be taken the next time she bore a child what would it mean if any one of them died lorena knew pea eye was awake she had awakened while he slept for he was restless in his sleep and had scraped one of her legs with a toenail he was lazy about cutting his toenails and rarely cut them until she had complained two or three times but it wasnt the scrape from the toenail that bothered her a bad dream had come from the past from the time when she had been with bad men she always tried to pull herself out of such dreams as quickly as possible better to face those memories awake with thoughts of her husband and children to support her than to let the dream carry her far down into the depths of pain and fear lorie im scared pea eye said im so scared ive got a chill lorena put her arms around him indeed he was clammy as if sweating out a fever his skin was cold maybe youre getting what georgie has lorena said georgie had been running a high fever for several days ill get you warm she said pulling her body close to his i aint cold outsideits inside pea said though he was glad lorie was lying close to him it had seemed a miracle the first time she had drawn him into her body it still seemed a miracle that he who had never been able to rise higher than the rank of corporal could be wanted by a woman as fine as lorie and have the warmth and the pleasure of her body in the bed at night through his life she was generous with him he knew from the complaints of other men that all women werent so generous he put his arms around her and held her grateful and warmer but still frightened lorena liked it that she could comfort pea eye so easily just by taking him into her arms she hoped she wasnt with child it was too soon for she was still tired from laurie but if she was she did not plan to stop wanting her husband because of the inconveniences of pregnancy lorena knew that clara allen must be very wise to have advised her to marry pea eye she had never expected to marry any man or even to share a bed with one and want him too much of her life had been spent at the mercy of men she didnt want even of men she despised or in having to refuse the love of decent mendish boggett was the main one although there had been others in ogallalawhose feelings she couldnt return why she had been able to return pea eyes love she really didnt know in a way she thought gus might have wished it he and pea had been friends but perhaps that was silly gus had been as jealous as anyone in his way still gus had loved clara and herself as well and pea had been his corporal and clara her own best friend something had caused her to want pea perhaps it was only his simple honest need and she still wanted him which was more of a blessing than many people had in life more than clara had herself shed had no men since her husbands death years before that made it all the harder to turn loose though to allow him to do his duty by old captain call she might have to turn loose yet probably would have to but she still wanted to fight it woman against man that was what it was too woman against man her body her spirit her affection and passion the children she and pea shared the life they shared on the farm that had cost them all her money and years of their energy it was that against the old man with the gun and the way of life that ought to have ended probably there was more to itit involved the loyalty of fighting men to one another and to their leader but lorena gave that no respect not where pea eye was concerned he was a gentle man he should never have been a ranger should never have had to deal out violence there were many men who dealt out violence naturally old call should never have had the use of one like pea a man who was comfortable with gentleness who would spend hours taking prickly pear stickers out of the boys hands working at each one gently until he got it out pea had never been meant for military life he had turned out of it eagerly happily into a life with her he loved best the days in the summer when she didnt have school to teach when they could work together at some of the lighter tasks around the farm he had driven a wagon all the way to amarillo to get lilac bushes for her to plant and had helped her cover the little plants against the biting northers and the freezes of february and march she ought to win lorena knew she held him in her arms put her legs over his she wanted him to know that there was more life with her more children if he wanted them and more of her love but pea eye was staring past her even as he held her tight its like i dread something he said i dread something lorie he whispered it pea was always nervous about waking the children his voice when he whispered was exactly like georgies voice when georgie whispered his little secrets into his mothers ear lorena felt some dread herself she was only one woman and she could only do so much she knew she came first in pea eyes affections it wasnt that he loved the captain and not her she had thought much about this subjectit had dominated their marriage in a wayand the fact she couldnt change was that the captain had been there longer in pea eyes life he was there first and not by a week or two either but by almost three decades that was the fact she couldnt eliminate she could change her husbands habits and she had but she couldnt change his history and it was in his history that the problem lay i ought to go find him pea eye whispered hes an old man i aint you arent lorena corrected but then what was the point of correcting his grammar if he was going to call good grammar wouldnt save him and saving him was what mattered most now the dread that pea eye felt crossed into lorena they were both gripped by it husband and wife lorena had watched him go away several times always with irritation but never with such trepidation she hated to see him leave but always before she had assumed he would return she didnt know why this trip should be so different and neither did pea eye yet they lay together equally troubled equally frightened at least i get paid in cash pea eye said i dont care if you get paid in cash lorena said cash cant hug me it cant make me a baby it cant be a father to augie and georgie and ben and the girls well it wont have to pea said ill come back i dont believe you this time lorena said if you go you wont come back well never lie in the bed like this again ill get old and i wont have you and neither will the children pea eye said nothing he had begun to have wild thoughts one being that the captain was already dead that would mean that he didnt have to go but of course if the captain had been killed he would have heard about it and he hadnt lorena didnt say a thing either her thoughts were disordered too if pea got killed she would probably have to turn dish boggett down again he kept a store in new mexico and was still single unless he had recently married if pea got killed dish would soon hear of it and ride over to court her he wasnt a bad man in fact he was a good man but she didnt want him never had and all the tea in china wouldnt change that i wish this would stop she thought i wish it would stop its going to drive me crazy if it dont stop in the morning they were both as drained as if they had done three days work clarie had to deal with everything including the chores and the younger children too whats wrong mama she asked disturbed whats wrong pa neither parent would say when clarie went out to milk lorena made one last try what makes you think you can find him she asked hes been gone nearly a month he could be in the middle of mexico by now he could be as far away as the pacific ocean i expect i can find the captain pea eye said people notice when hes around roy bean or somebody will know where he is go on then today lorena said go now i cant stand another night like last night go right now before i leave for school pea eye got his slicker and his rifle and walked down to get his horse youre going to ride lorena asked when he came back you could take the train he took the train no ill ride i might not find a trustworthy horse down on the border pea said patches his big bay with white spots was a trustworthy horse pea eye kissed each of his children goodbye all of them cried clarie the most she was a big strong girl the boys cried themselves out and laurie cried because everybody else was crying lorena went in and got ready for school she dressed slowly very slowly slowly very slowly she put her lesson books in order usually she just threw them in her bag and sorted them out once she got to school but this morning she put them in order carefully and slowly as if her sanity or even her life depended upon keeping her schoolbooks in the correct order it was all she could do once she got outside even to raise her eyes to her husband but she did just briefly his eyes though troubled were the same honest eyes that had won through her reluctance long ago in wyoming she kissed him briefly gave him a long tight hug and then moving stiffly like a woman whose back has been injured helped her children into the buggy and drove away to school the children all looked back at their father but lorena didnt she kept her eyes fixed on the plains ahead pea eye put a little salt and pepper in a sack stuck a small skillet in his saddlebags and stood at his back door a minute wondering when he would see them all again his loved ones already almost out of sight to the north then he mounted patches made sure his rifle and scabbard were tight and turned himself south toward mexico to go to the assistance of captain woodrow call on his way into mexico call stopped to say goodbye to bolivar the old man had been with him a long time seeing him brought back memories good and bad of the ranger troop and the hat creek outfit memories of gus and deets pea eye and newt calls son only after the boys death in montana had call been able to admit that newt had been his son now with the boy several years dead it made call sad to think of him he had fathered a son but had not been a father to him although newt had lived with the hat creek outfit most of his short life he had lived with the outfit but as an employee not a son now it was too late to change any of that the memory of it was a sore that throbbed every time his mind touched it bolivar who had not many more years to live was so woven into calls memories of earlier days that call had begun to hate leaving him behind although bolivar was an old frail man who could not travel hard and perhaps ought not to travel at all but leaving him behind had become to call like leaving his own life behind capitan the bell i can still ring the bell bolivar said he had a desperate look in his eye and a quaver in his voice he saw that the capitan was about to leave without him the two gringos with him were mounted and there was a pack mule well laden it meant the capitan was going perhaps never to come back the bell he referred to was the dinner bell near the livery stable in lonesome dove a business that call and his partner gus mccrae had once owned bolivar had summoned them all to his never very appetizing meals by whacking the dinner bell with a broken crowbar as he grew older and less in control of his mind he sometimes rang the bell whether he had made a meal or not he often rang it when there was no one in hearing to come and eat the meal he had made beating the bell with the broken crowbar took his mind off the disappointments of life the bell rang so loudly that it almost deafened him but he continued to beat it fiercely nonetheless his life had contained many disappointments and he needed something to make him forget them even if he was deafened in the process call and bolivar too regretted that the hat creek outfit was gone what they had in common now was their regret but the outfit was gone some of its members were dead and those still living were scattered up the rivers and across the plains newt and deets and gus were no longer alive and call had the feeling that bolivar might not be alive either when he returned to laredo that old man needs a haircut deputy plunkert said as they were leaving nuevo laredo the old mans white hair hung almost to his shoulders he tried to stab the barber with the scissors the last time anyone tried to cut his hair call explained id rather see him with hair down to his ankles than to trust him with anything he might hurt somebody with brookshire said he remembered with rue that bolivar had grabbed a shotgun out of his hand and killed the best mule with it he was glad bolivar was being left behind he had been a little worried that call might relent and let him come with them something that would not have pleased colonel terry the fact that captain call immediately left texas and crossed into mexico startled deputy plunkert a bit his personal preference would have been that they continue to travel on the texas side of the river he himself was not comfortable being south of the border particularly if he was in the vicinity of laredo itself as a deputy with his own badge ted plunkert had participated in the hanging of several mexicans he had to shoot two mexicans personally and had to whack various mexicans around a good bit after all it was his job and the community expected it of him he knew that as a result of his very diligence he had made himself not merely unpopular but hated south of the border deputy plunkert knew too that mexican families were often vengeful going to much trouble to avenge friends who had been wounded or killed the deputy was prepared to make it clear to anyone who asked that he would be more comfortable on the texas side of the river theres a fair road up to del rio he said only to be immediately slapped down by the captain were not going to del rio call said bluntly i prefer to avoid settlements when i can theres too much gossip in settlements we dont want the garza boy to know were coming if we can help it deputy plunkert didnt answer but he found the captains position discouraging before going five miles from his home he had begun to entertain some powerful second thoughts he had never supposed that the captain would just jump right into mexico of course he knew they might have to cross into it sometime but he had assumed that they would be several hundred miles up the river before that happened his own bad reputation was mainly local five or six hundred miles upriver they would be less likely to run into mexicans who might be carrying a grudge now though they were right in the thick of the mexicans who carried the hottest grudges it was going to affect his peace of mind also hed had a few hours in which to get a better look at his traveling companions in laredo he had been so in awe of captain call that he had scarcely been able to look at him at all in fact except for a glance at the beginning he hadnt looked at him the mans aura was such that merely hearing his name blinded most people as it had blinded him now though riding across the empty dusty country the heros aura had dimmed somewhat the deputy saw that he was traveling with an old stiff man a man who had a hard time lifting his leg high enough to catch his stirrup captain call had a gray weary look about him the look of a man who wasnt young and wasnt healthy the yankee traveling with them was just a raw dude of course he looked silly in his new boots and hat and pants loaded down with guns the fact that captain call would set out to catch a killer with such a man in tow made deputy plunkert wonder about the old mans judgment the deputy had a sudden powerful urge to change his mind he wanted to declare a mistake go home snuggle up to his wife doobie and kiss her until she wiggled with desire now he had set out on a long journey with an uncertain outcome when would he get to enjoy doobies wiggling again why had he thought he wanted to leave it had all been because the old captain enjoyed such a blinding reputation doubting him was like doubting the sun now that they were riding together call didnt seem infallible or even very active he just rode along saying as little as possible the deputy began to toy with various acceptable ways of saying that he had changed his mind but none of the lines of talk he toyed with sounded as if they would be acceptable either to call or to the general community and there was no denying the general community posed a problem backing out of a chance to ride with woodrow call could ruin a mans reputation forever with lawmen and citizens alike along the border but his reputation might survive he just had to come up with some honorable reason for needing to go home a lame horse would do it but to his irritation the horse he was riding showed no trace of lameness as deputy plunkert was happily contemplating returning to his eager wife captain call suddenly turned in his saddle and looked hard at him do you want to quit deputy he asked it seemed to him that the deputy had developed a faltering manner and developed it quickly if the man was going to quit he wanted him to quit now it wasnt admirable but it wasnt a crime either like pea eye the deputy had a wife they were going in pursuit of a youth who might kill them all the man had not hesitated in making his decision now he probably had second thoughts quit deputy plunkert said stunned the old man had suddenly read his thoughts yes thats what i asked call said do you want to go back to your wife doobie why shell get along fine without me i expect the deputy replied then you dont want to quit youre sure call asked why captain no i signed on and im staying on ted plunkert said it amazed him that he couldnt seem to help lying what he heard himself say to the captain was exactly the opposite of what he had just been feeling the opposite of what he had planned to say but he couldnt help himself saying the truth wasnt possible not when captain call was looking at you hard what do you think brookshire call asked though skeptical of brookshire at first he had come to respect the mans judgment in some areas he might be a fool about hats but he wasnt such a fool about people one of brookshires boots was rubbing his heel so badly that he wasnt capable of giving much thought to anything else he was wondering whether hed have a heel left when they got to camp that night also he was suffering from a touch of his blowingaway feeling again he had supposed that he had that feeling well under control for it hadnt afflicted him since they reached the brushy country around san antonio but they were not in san antonio now they were not in the brushy country either to his eye mexico looked even emptier than texas emptier and more forbidding the night before he had slipped over to nuevo laredo and purchased a few minutes with a mexican girl and the experience had been a disappointment the girl had been inexpensive but she had also been skinny and had a sad look in her eye during their brief commerce the poverty in nuevo laredo had been a surprise to him too he had read about juarez and emperor maximilian and had expected at least a little splendor even in canada a country he disliked there would occasionally be some splendor at least in montreal but there seemed to be none in mexico there were just sad women and children and old men who gave him unfrly looks youre buying their daughters or it might be their wives call had said when brookshire mentioned the unfrly looks now the captain was soliciting his opinion about deputy plunkert and the fact was brookshire really didnt have one the man had been a hasty choice in his view but that didnt necessarily mean he had been a bad one its your expedition or your colonels call reminded him do you think we ought to keep this man or send him back captain i cant go home ted plunkert said he was nearing panic it was as if his deepest thoughts were suddenly being held open to public discussion a fact that appalled him once the captain had fixed him with the hard look ted plunkert remembered who he was a deputy sheriff well respected in laredo texas now that he remembered himself he had begun to feel irritated at doobie his wife it seemed to him that it was mainly her fault that he had wavered that morning she had cried so at the thought of his going that it weakened him and made him less resolute than he normally was if doobie had any serious consideration for him she should comport herself a little better when he had serious business to attend to and there couldnt be business more serious than attending to whatever captain call might require of him doobie had nearly caused him to make a mistake of the sort that could ruin him forever as a lawman and he meant to speak to her sharply about it when he got home he himself might consider that captain call looked old and stiff but that wasnt the general opinion along the border most people of course never saw the real captain call the very one he was riding with into mexico most people only knew the man by reputation as the ranger who had protected the border south of laredo for so long captain call had protected the border from bad mexicans bad indians and bad white men too life was changing along the border it was becoming more or less settled for many years though the thought of captain call had enabled many people to sleep better at night they would not soon forget him and most of them would never know that he was a man who had trouble lifting his leg high enough to catch his stirrup now that he had strongly reiterated his desire to go ted plunkert couldnt imagine how he could ever have contemplated quitting although in fact he had contemplated exactly that very thing not ten minutes earlier he had never quit anything in his life unless you counted cotton farming and that was not a job he had chosen he just happened to be born on a cotton farm i came to ride the river with you captain he said its something i had always hoped to do i sure aint going home now call turned back in his saddle and let the matter go many men wavered as they were riding into danger they thought about their own deaths too much or imagined injuries and pain that might never come that was what excessive thinking could do even to men who were moderately brave often the same men once in a conflict settled down and fought well pea eye himself had always been a reliable if not a brilliant fighting man yet he was the most nervous man in the company until hostilities commenced he was almost too delicate for the rangering life call had concluded as much on more than one occasion but had never quite gotten around to letting the man go on the trail of indians or bandits pea was prone to headaches heartburn upset stomachs and runny bowels all of it from nerves call was convinced call felt a brief anger because pea hadnt come with him but he knew that his anger was wrong to a degree and that he needed to let it go pea eye had long since done his share more than his share of dangerous traveling with call if he now preferred his wife and children and dirt farming that was his right that night they camped on the monte ten miles south of the river call had made a snap shot at a small javelina and hit it so they had young pig to eat after eating he sat a little apart thinking about the task ahead he had not yet made up his mind where to take up the hunt take it up seriously that is he thought he should probably cut up the rio grande past the great bend and start hunting there the boy had bought his fancy rifle in mexico city and he had stopped a train in coahuila and another in van horn texas that showed a remarkable propensity for travel in a boy so young it also showed that joey garza could cover country the boy was said to be from a village north of boquillas a poor village it was said not many mexican boys from poor villages would travel to mexico city to secure a german rifle it took some thinking about do you ever get upset before a fight captain deputy plunkert asked he addressed himself to the captain although the man sat apart because he did not feel comfortable talking to a yankee so far he had addressed only a few words to brookshire mainly yes and no when the man asked him a question no i cant say that i fret much call said now thats brave brookshire said when i was in the war i was scared all the time i was only in the hospital corps too i wasnt shooting at anybody but i kept having them bad dreams whatd you dream the deputy asked he himself was often afflicted with bad dreams mainly of having one of them big shells come in low and knock my head off brookshire said that very thing happened to a man i know he was from hoboken and his name was johnny lowe bad luck i suppose call said yes id say it was bad luck brookshire said the man gave me his biscuit the morning it happened he said he was too nervous to eat he was afraid his stomach would gripe him if he ate the biscuit johnny drove the wagon we hauled the wounded in off he went while i stayed by the mess and ate his biscuit while i was sipping coffee general grant rode by that was the one time i saw general grant then me and jackie oconnor went down the road in a buggy squinching down as best we could the shells were just whistling around us like ducks most of them hit in the trees they broke off a world of limbs we werent five minutes down the road when we saw a bunch of the boys standing around the wagon johnny had been driving we thought maybe they were looking at a dead reb but no it was johnny and his head was gone there was just a red bone sticking out between his shoulders oh lord ted plunkert said thats awful it was just a bone yes a red bone brookshire said i suppose it was the end of his spine oh lord ted said again his neck bone the detail he didnt like was that the bone was red of course all the bones were inside you where the blood was but he still felt himself getting queasy at the thought of red bones call listened with some amusementnot that the incident hadnt been terrible being decapitated was a grisly fate whether you were a yankee or not but then amusing things happened in battle as they did in the rest of life some of the funniest things he had ever witnessed had occurred during battles he had always found it more satisfying to laugh on a battlefield than anywhere else for if you lived to laugh on a battlefield you could feel you had earned the laugh but if you just laughed in a saloon or at a social the laugh didnt reach deep in this case what mainly amused call was the contemplation of how amused his old partner augustus mccrae would be if he could see the crew he was riding out with on his manhunt augustus had a welldeveloped sense of humor too well developed call had often felt yet he missed augustuss laughter as much as he missed anything else in his life gus enjoyed the predicaments of his fellowmen and would have laughed long and hard at the spectacle of call brookshire and lanky ted plunkert joey garza shoots a rifle not a cannon he observed if he takes your head off hell have to do it with a knife or a saw deputy plunkert ignored the part about the knife and the saw captain call was only joking probably so far as he knew the garza boy had not cut any heads off but there were plenty of other less dramatic injuries to worry about they say that rifle of his will hit you between the eyes even if youre a mile away the deputy said several people he had talked with claimed that joey garza made kills at a distance of one mile half a mile about call said i doubt the part about hitting between the eyes if hes sensible hell shoot for the trunk its a bigger target well half a mile then how do you expect to beat him ted asked i expect to outlast him call said hes young and hes likely impatient theres three of us and hes alone he might get impatient and make a big mistake the truth is hes killed several passengers at a distance of about five feet with his pistol brookshire reminded them oh ive no doubt he can shoot the german rifle but hes done damage with some short shots too why he robs trains and makes people get off and hand over their watches and tiepins ted plunkert said some of the passengers are armed men why dont one of them try to shoot him then the rest of them could jump him ive wondered about that myself brookshire said youd think somebody would try him but they dont they just stand there like sheep and let themselves be robbed thats the effect of reputation call said once you get one as big as this boys people think youre better than you are they think you cant be beat when the fact is anybody can be beat or make mistakes i never met an outlaw who didnt make mistakes i guess blue duck didnt make many but he was exceptional joey garza hasnt made any mistakes not one brookshire said why id say he has call said he broke the lawyour colonels law particularly that was his mistake and now hes got us hunting him i guess i was talking tactics brookshire said he just seems to know when to show up and when not to if theres a company of soldiers on the train he dont show up thats just common sense call said i wouldnt show up either if i saw there was a company of soldiers on the train that dont make the boy general lee deputy plunkert was still thinking about the red bone sticking out of the dead soldiers neck once he got such a troubling picture in his mind he sometimes had a hard time making the picture go away it was as if it got stuck somewhere in his thinking machine it might be a good picture that got stuck several having to do with doobies young body got stuck just before they married but it was the bad pictures that seemed to get stuck the hardest and stay stuck the longest being sucked down into quicksand was one bad picture ted plunkert had trouble with there were patches of quicksand in the rio grande and the deputy had a deadly fear of them not being able to breathe because quicksand was filling up your mouth and your nose was a bad picture but not as bad as the picture of a red bone sticking out of a mans neck he wished brookshire had never told the story it was just like a yankee to talk about things civilized people would have the good sense to leave undiscussed how did general grant look call asked he had always had a curiosity about the great soldiers grant and lee stonewall jackson sherman well he looked drunk and he was drunk brookshire said he won that war and was drunk the whole time call said nothing but again he remembered his old partner gus mccrae gus too could fight drunk sometimes he had fought better drunk than he had fought sober id feel better if somebody could steal that rifle from that boy deputy plunkert said a miles a long way to be killed from half a mile call corrected again brookshire was wondering if katies legs would be any fatter when he got home id still like to know who the second robber is he said the one that struck that train out in new mexico id like to know that too call said in crow town joey lived with three whores he didnt use them for his pleasure he never used women for his pleasure the white whore was named beulah she had come south from dodge city with a gambler named red foot the nickname resulted from the fact that another gambler had become enraged and tried to stab red foot in the heart but being drunk as well as enraged he took a wild swing toppled out of his chair and finally managed to stab red foot in his foot red foot was very drunk too and didnt notice at first that he had been stabbed completely through his foot he only noticed the injury when someone pointed out to him that his right boot was full of blood he looked down saw that indeed the boot was full of blood and fainted a few days later he and beulah left dodge city and moved to crow town the place was said to be booming it was going to be the next dodge red foot and beulah planned to open a whorehouse and get rich but when they arrived they saw at once that crow town was not booming the rumors they had heard were lies the population was low and the few people who lived there were clearly too poor to support a whorehouse or any other business except a saloon unable to face any more travel beulah and red foot stayed red foot drank too much and he had a tendency to pass out at inopportune moments he had even passed out when playing cards and cards were his profession joey garza was a different story beulah twentyeight years old and well traveled in more ways than one had never seen a male as beautiful as joey his walk his teeth his hands were beautiful red foot was aging and unreliable beulah hoped that joey would take an interest in her and he did he asked her to come and live in his house or a house he had taken as his in crow town houses often came to belong to the best shot joey didnt have to shoot anyone to acquire his house though a killer named pecos freddy passed through crow town the week before joey arrived and he ended up killing three mexicansthe father mother and brother of the two young whores who ended up living with joey and beulah the young whores marieta and gabriela were so saddened by the deaths that they didnt care at first whether they lived or died they knew they would die soon if they continued to live in crow town but they had no money no means of travel and no hope when joey appeared they simply gave him the house a tworoom hut with low ceilings and hoped that he would let them stay he did and he soon let beulah stay too but he didnt share his bed or even his room with any of them the three women slept on the floor in the larger room even that was better than sleeping with red foot beulah decided another of red foots unreliabilities was that he frequently wet the bed he said it was because a horse had kicked him once in a bad place beulah didnt know about that but she did know that she was tired of waking up in a bed full of piss the floor in joeys house might host an occasional scorpion or centipede but at least it was dry joey let the women stay because he needed someone to cook and wash clothes beulah cooked and marieta and gabriela kept his clothes clean joey garza was by far the cleanest person in crow town he insisted that his clothes be washed frequently a difficult demand in a town where there was little water every three days marieta and gabriela tied sacks of clothes and bedding onto a small donkey someone had lost then they trudged eleven miles through the sandhills to the pecos where they washed the clothes hung them on chaparral bushes to dry and took them back to joey often they had to return to crow town by starlight marieta and gabriela were chubby girls and they didnt expect much both had been whores since they were ten walking to the pecos and washing joeys clothes was an easier life than either had hoped for it didnt bother them that joey didnt want them he was a guero and gueros were often strange beulah though was bothered by joeys indifference in her experience if men didnt want you they left you joey was the only person in crow town who had money if he left what would she do red foot hated her now he was a jealous man and he would undoubtedly try to have his revenge the minute joey garza left in his bitterness he had already told her he would tie her to a tree and leave her tied until the crows pecked out her eyes beulah didnt really believe that crows pecked out peoples eyes but she didnt take red foots threats lightly either he was perfectly capable of doing something horrible to her and he probably would if he got the chance it occurred to beulah one day that joeys tastes might be complex she had known men whose tastes were complex the most common complex taste in her view was for extra women in the bed maybe that was what joey would likeall three of them in bed at once if there was even a chance that it might work beulah wanted to try she talked it over with marieta and gabriela both of whom were skeptical three women at the same time marieta said he dont even want one woman no but he might like three beulah insisted gabriela the youngest didnt like the idea at all whoring was bad enough what beulah suggested only sounded worse gabriela had become a whore when she was ten but she didnt look at men once her own uncle had forced her to look at him he twisted her arm and beat her until she looked at him but usually she just looked away and pretended she wasnt there sometimes while she was looking away the men stole back the money they gave her gabriela never got to keep much of the money anyway her father had taken it while he was alive and now marieta took it if he dont want us he wont feed us beulah said in her experience that was how men were later the two girls talked it over they didnt want to disappoint beulah who had been good to them in their time of grief the girls didnt like crow town the wind blew very cold in winter it was always dusty and the men were rough but in mexico they had nothing neither of them wanted to go back to mexico if he dont want us he wont feed us marieta said echoing beulah she was willing to defer to beulahs judgment beulah was older and knew more about men the next night at beulahs suggestion they all got undressed except for nightgowns the girls gowns were only of thin cotton but beulahs was silk she had bought it long ago in kansas city when they went in to joey he was cleaning his fine rifle with a rag the look in his eyes when he saw them come in was not friendly he didnt speak you could have us all three beulah said timidly from the look he gave them she knew that her idea had not been a good one she had mentioned it to red foot to see what he thought and red foot certainly liked it id take three whores over one whore anytime red foot said im a man that likes whores that was true the whores in dodge city had profited greatly from red foots interest joey was different though he was a colder article beulah thought i dont want three fat women he said to beulah you cook marieta washes clothes gabriela dont have to do nothing well why dont she beulah asked stung she had already begun to be a little jealous of gabriela and now she felt even more jealous because shes pretty joey said closing the conversation hes in love with you marieta said to her sister later hes rich too he has a cave full of money joey did like to look at the young whore gabriela he liked it that she was so modest that was the way women should be but other than admiring her looks and her modesty he had no need for her during the day joey often sat for a while in the towns small dirty saloon at first the gamblers who passed through always pestered him they had heard of his robberies and knew or thought they knew of his wealth they wanted him to go robbing with them so they could have wealth too joey was successful far more successful than any of them he was feared and they too would have liked to be feared they tried to be friendly with him to suggest robberies in which he could share each of them knew of a bank that would be easy to rob or a stage office or something joey ignored all their offers he didnt trust any of the men also he didnt need them there was a boy in crow town who was slightly lame but active his name was pablo and he was twelve twice joey took pablo with him so he would have someone to hold his horse during the robberies he didnt like to tie his horse and he didnt trust it to stand either if he had to leave in a hurry having to untie a horse or look for one that had walked off would not be good pablo was his solution to the problem of the horse pablo liked joey being chosen to go with him was the happiest thing that had happened to pablo in his life he did a good job too always leading joeys horse to the handiest place for him to mount pablo thought joey was the greatest man alive he would have been proud to give his life for him except for the services of pablo and the three whores joey wanted nothing from the people of crow town they were a rough lot and also dumb in his view only smart people had a chance in life and only smart people deserved a chance most of the men who stopped in crow town stayed drunk the whole time they were there the cawing of the crows drove them to it joey didnt mind the cawing for he liked the crows they were smarter than most people in his view newcomers maddened by the sound of cawing or the smell of crowshit or the wheeling of the thousands of birds sometimes went berserk and tried to shoot the crows they emptied pistols at them or rifles they missed of course even when they tried shotguns they missed not once did joey see a crow fall they were so smart that they didnt even lose a feather when the crazy men shot at them when joey was in the saloon he sat alone at a small table near the door he wanted to be able to leave quickly if some of the stupid white men began to stab one another or fire guns joey drank coffee when he sat in the saloon occasionally he would put a spoonful of whiskey in the coffee on days when the dust made him cough he had taken a fine fur coat from off the gentleman who had the private car and when the wind blew cold or the dust was blowing he pulled the fur collar of his coat high around him and was warm men envied him the coat if he had not been watchful one would have killed him for it but he was watchful and he liked it that he was envied besides the coat he also had a good blanket that had belonged to a cowboy he shot at a great distance it was the longest shot he had made since coming back from the city of mexico with his gun when joey rode over to rob the corpse he measured the distance it was nearly six hundred yards it gave him a good feeling to be able to strike a gringo dead at such a distance finding that the cowboy had a fine blanket made him feel even better the man was not young he lay with his mouth open when joey reached him joey noticed that his teeth were false so he took the false teeth along with the blanket the cowboy had been about to ride into presidio when joey killed him and the shot was made at the last light of the day no one in presidio had noticed that the man was coming and no one saw him fall joey waited until it was dark to measure the distance and rob the man the bullet had taken off much of the cowboys skull the man wore a large pistol which joey used to smash the skull open a little more then he took a cup from the dead mans saddlebags and filled it with his brains when it was darker still he walked into town holding the cup full of brains he went to the jail and carefully set the cup inside the door the deputy who had only one ear was there but he had his boots off and was sleeping soundly joey planned to cut the mans throat if he woke up but he didnt wake up and on impulse joey stole his boots he left the dead cowboys false teeth in the cup of brains then he rode off happily what he had done was not as bad as some things he had seen the apaches do to dead white men his only nagging worry was that he had seen a cat in the jail the cat had opened its eyes and looked at him when he set the cup inside it occurred to him that the cat might eat the brains and spoil the surprise he had planned for the hard sheriff and the oneeared deputy later in crow town joey learned that the cat had not eaten the brains the oneeared deputy woke up looked in the cup and puked on the floor of the jail later in the street the deputy puked some more the deputy thought at first that it might be the work of apaches but there were no apaches anymore the federales had killed all the apaches in mexico and those in the united states had been removed to indian territory many people on the border had even forgotten apaches and what they did to people when joey left the dead cowboys brains in the jail in presidio people began to talk about him as if he were the devil not just a guero a mexican boy who was almost white only some of the older men and women remembered the apaches and how they cut one day when joey had been in crow town three weeks beulah came in with an antelope haunch she had bought from the old hunter ben lily the old man walked the west endlessly killing bears and cougars he had started his lifelong hunt in louisiana and was now in west texas killing bears and cougars as he went he ate what he could and sold the remainder in order to buy cartridges with which to kill more lions and bears his aim was to kill all the lions and bears between the gulf coast and canada by his reckoning he was not yet half done thousands of lions and bears still lived in the great west and ben lily meant to kill them all antelope didnt interest him but antelope made good eating and could also be sold profitably in rough villages such as crow town beulah looked scared when she came in with the haunch her hands were shaking as she got ready to fry it why are you scared joey asked i saw old ben beulah said he only hunts he wont bother you joey said he was hungry and he wanted beulah to settle down and cook his meat it aint ben beulah said wesley hardins here he showed up yesterday and killed that nigger that worked for the blacksmith wesley put a gun to my head once i was in fort worth then why joey asked so he wouldnt have to pay you he didnt do nothing to pay me for beulah said he just likes to see people look scared it dont matter to him if its a man or a woman he just likes to see people look scared later joey went to the saloon carrying his rifle he never left his rifle in crow town all the people were thieves and he did not intend to risk his fine gun a skinny man was sitting at the table next to his it was the only other table in the saloon the man wore a dirty black coat and had ugly skin blotched and red and it peeled in places from the sun and the wind the man had thin brown hair joey could see scabs on his scalp and on his hands as well the mans foot twitched as he sat at the table drinking whiskey he didnt have a fine rifle either just a plain revolver stuck in his belt nonetheless the killer john wesley hardin was the first gringo joey had met in a long time whom he didnt take lightly the man didnt even look at him when he came in with his rifle wesley hardin was not impressed or even interested which was unusual few people in crow town or even travelers passing through missed any chance to steal a look at joey garza but wesley hardin the killer didnt look he was chewing tobacco and spitting the juice on the floor although the saloon was provided with two brass spittoons joey had barely sat down when john wesley hardin looked up but not at him he looked up at the local blacksmith whose name was lordy bailey lordy walked in the door a large hammer in one hand and went straight to wesley hardins table the blacksmith was a large man with a heavy black beard that was so long he had to tuck it into his overalls while working his forge he was not afraid of anyone including wesley hardin when he walked up to the table where the famous killer sat lordy was frowning though john wesley hardin looked at him pleasantly its costing me fifty cents to get a grave dug for that nigger boy lordy said you shot him i think you ought to pay the fifty cents why bury a nigger wesley hardin said his voice had a tone in it that joey hadnt heard before it was a crazy tone wesley hardins eyes were cool but he was scratching his scabby wrist with his other hand joey thought the blacksmith was very foolish for speaking to the killer so brusquely he would probably be murdered for his rudeness and it would serve him right his prices were high and his work was not particularly skillful we all need to be buried lordy said do you think my nigger ought to just lay there and stink up the town drag him off a ways wesley hardin suggested that big pig might come along and eat him for you it would save you the fifty cents i paid fifty dollars for that nigger lordy said he began to flip the big hammer up in the air and caught it when it came down without even looking at it he made the big hammer seem light as a twig i figure thats fifty dollars and fifty cents you owe me he added fifty dollars for the nigger and fifty cents for burying him give it over youre a fool if you paid cash for a nigger in these days and times wesley hardin said you dont have to buy niggers anymore its not even legal abe lincoln freed them all you have to do now is take a nigger if you see one you want i paid for this one and you owe me lordy insisted give over the money youre an ignorant sonofabitch and you dont know the law wesley hardin said he began to get worked up his twitching foot twitched faster here you buy a nigger you didnt have to buy and because i killed him you come in here disturbing my morning he went on i could kill you seven times before you could drop that goddamn hammer on your toe dont be playing with that hammer in here the ceilings are too low go outside if you want to play with your hammer he took the plain revolver out of his belt and pointed it at the blacksmith but the blacksmith was too angry to back down you owe me give over the money he repeated for the third time you sonofabitch i heard you wesley hardin said if you want to live get gone if youd rather die flip that hammer again i dont think youre the killer you claim to be hardin lordy said he was wondering if he was quick enough to smash the mans head in with the hammer before he could pull the trigger i dont claim nothing wesley hardin said i dont claim one goddamn thing last time i was in jail they kept me in nine years and whipped me a hundred and sixty different times i stood it and here i am they whipped me because i wouldnt submit and i wont submit i hated the goddamn jailers and i could kill you and nine like you and never even belch ive left about forty widows so far i guess and ive killed a few bachelors too youre welcome to try me any time you want to try me lordy decided that after all the risks were unwarranted id like to smash in your goddamn skull but ill leave the pleasure of killing you to captain call lordy said i dont know if hell choose to bother about a scabby old turd like you woodrow call wesley hardin asked why would he want to kill me he arrested me once but it was just because of a little feud i got into in lampasas call aint the sheriff of crow town he dont even live here no but hes coming lordy said the news seemed to excite wesley hardin the killer his tone got crazier coming to crow town captain call he said why thats bold for an old shit his age hes coming but he aint after you lordy said you aint important enough anymore youre just an old killer waiting to die whys he coming then does he expect to clean out the town wesley hardin asked hes coming for the guero lordy said hes coming for joey here joey didnt smile or even indicate that he had heard the conversation but he felt pleased billy williams had told him many tales of calls exploits he had no fear of the man though no old gringo however famous was likely to interfere with his plans not for long anyway but it interested and pleased him that he had robbed enough and killed enough so that the americans were sending their best bounty hunter after him that was satisfying it meant he had scared the americans and hurt them by taking their money john wesley hardin had noticed joey come in he was certainly a pretty boy too pretty to last hardin thought his clothes were too clean in such a place it was irritating to see a boy with clothes that clean the rifle he kept with him was certainly exceptional though john wesley had never killed with a rifle he usually killed at close range with his revolver firing two or three shots right into the midsections of his enemies he liked the way the heavy bullets kicked the life out of them he liked their looks of shock when they fell down and saw the blood spreading underneath them he also liked to be looking at them when they died that way they would know that john wesley hardin had killed them personally he had never killed a man from ambush or from any great distance at all the notion that woodrow call would come all the way to crow town for this boy this guero was interesting though the boy must have vexed the rich men a good deal for them to call out the old ranger he looked at the boy and met a pair of cold blue eyes lordy bailey the blacksmith was still standing there with his hammer joey thought the man was a complete fool he should go while he was alive you still owe me lordy said theres no reason i should give you a nigger to kill i hate idiots like you john wesley hardin said he cocked his revolver and shot the blacksmith right in the gut then he shot him again at about the point where his beard tucked into his overalls he cocked the gun a third time and shot the man in the gut again lordy staggered backward but didnt fall he felt surprised hardin had seemed to be calming down lordy had not really expected him to shoot now he had been shot three times he felt puzzled he had meant to leave but had waited a little too long he didnt feel anything just puzzled joey garza didnt move it did not surprise him that the scabby old man had shot the blacksmith he himself would have done it much sooner but he knew better than to call attention to himself while the scabby killer had a gun in his hand waitdont die wesley hardin said to lordy bailey you forgot to tell me how you knew call was coming he was mildly annoyed with himself for having shot the man fatally before securing that piece of information most men once shot a time or two were so shocked to find themselves dying that they lost their power of speech famous shoes told me lordy said for a moment the fact that he could still talk reassured him perhaps he hadnt been shot after all it was such a comforting thought that he believed it for a second he dropped his hammer and reached down to pick it up but his hand wouldnt grip he could see the hammer but he couldnt grasp it at that point he sat down being as careful as possible all he wanted to do was pick up his hammer and leave dont sit there and die you damn bastard wesley hardin said go outside and die nobody wants you dying in here oh lordy said disturbed to have been caught in a breach of etiquette he started to sit up but instead slowly toppled over and lay on his side on the dusty floor i thought i told you not to die in here you ugly sonofabitch wesley hardin said his temper was rising the blacksmith had done nothing but vex and disobey him if you werent already nearly kilt id take a bed slat to youit might teach you some manners he added lordy bailey realized he had made a serious error bringing the black man to a town wesley hardin frequented he was well known to dislike black men ought not to have he said but then his tongue stopped working and he felt a great loosening inside himself he rolled on his back and stared upward until the light became dark patrick obrien the bartender walked over and looked at lordy hes dead and were without a blacksmith patrick said good i disliked the bastard wesley hardin said he thought i ought to pay for his nigger the damned idiot drag him out boy he said addressing the order to joey hell soon stink up the place if we leave him long joey met the scabby mans look but didnt speak goddammit is everybody stubborn in this town wesley hardin asked his face splotchy with anger patrick obrien felt a little worried many of his customers had killed a man or two but not since hed opened the bar had he had two men in it who were as dangerous as wesley hardin and joey garza between them they had killed a fair number of men it was early in the day but already a man lay dead on the barroom floor it occurred to the saloonkeeper that wesley hardin a selfish fellow who didnt take much interest in other people might not realize how dangerous joey garza was this is joey garza he said hes the one they sent call after joey looked hardin straight in the eye he wanted to study the man and would rather not have to kill him but that was up to hardin he would kill him if it became necessary with his bowie knife he had watched hardin shoot the blacksmith hardin had managed it but he was quite slow joey thought an apache would have killed the man with a knife in half the time or less and joey modeled himself on the apache when it came to killing joey knew he could slip behind hardin and cut his throat with one move and one stroke but he didnt want to kill the man and he also knew it would not be wise to underrate him just because he was a scabby old gringo wesley hardin had killed many many men the fact that he had been a little slow with the blacksmith didnt mean he would be slow if his own life was really at stake the blacksmith had posed no threat but hardin was a killer like himself he should not be underestimated wesley hardin got up picked up the blacksmiths legs and slowly dragged him outside the crows set up a cawing the minute the door opened the blacksmith was a heavy man hardin had to stick his revolver back in his belt and use both hands in order to drag him out obrien get your donkey and drag that heavy bastard off he said when he came back he was winded from his effort and his face had gone pale wes you need to hold your temper patrick obrien said that was the only blacksmith within a hundred miles wesley hardin didnt take kindly to censure he frowned at the irishman i might shoot every man woman and child in this stinkin niggerbird town and then you wouldnt need a goddamn blacksmith hows that he asked wesley hardin turned to joey with an angry look you could help me wipe this niggerbird shithole off the face of the earth if youre such a killer he said to joey you kill the men and ill take care of the women and the brats wes theres only two children in town and theyre mine patrick obrien said he had meanwhile taken the precaution of arming himself with a shotgun when wes hardin was in one of his irritable moods it was wisest to be armed i wasnt speaking to you you damn pig wesley hardin said giving the man a violent stare i was speaking to the notorious young killer here for all hardins jumpy manner his eyes when he looked at joey were clear he might twitch but he wasnt really agitated not in the part of himself that sized up men and situations the boy the guero gave back an empty gaze joey let his eyes meet hardins but in joeys eyes there was nothing only distance a distance deep as the sky why would they send woodrow call after a pup like you hardin asked but he let no insult into his voice because i steal money from americans joey said youre rightits the money not the killing wesley hardin said they dont care who gets killed out here in the baldies it dont cost the damn pigs a cent for us to kill one another out here why would they care out here west of the pecos its fine to kill but you better not steal from no trains coming from the east where the damn yankees keep their money how much did you get he inquired in a calmer tone i heard it was a million and i heard it was the armys money joey looked at the man coolly with his distant eyes did the old killer really expect him to tell how much money he had stolen in fact he had buried the payrolls only a few miles from where he stole them he didnt know how much he had taken he just knew that the money was too bulky to carry very far he was not such a fool as to bury it all in one place either he hid it in snake dens the apaches had taught him how to find them they often ate snakes when they could get nothing better he didnt have the time to carry so much money to his cave nor did he want to the money was not very interesting to him his cave was for beautiful things everything he stole he wrapped well he had taken two hundred gunnysacks from a hardware store in piedras negras to the puzzlement of the man who owned the store the man could not understand why anyone would take gunnysacks when there were guns and axes to steal joey took the sacks because he needed them to wrap his treasures that was also why he had taken the fancy sheets from the rich man who had the fur coat he didnt want to sleep on the sheets he wanted them for wrapping so that his many silver objects would not grow dingy in the cave at another hardware store in san angelo he found some excellent wooden barrels and he hired an old man named jose ramos to help him take the barrels on donkeys into the mountains he left them in one cave an empty one to fool old ramos and later came back and carried them one by one to his own cave which was three days away then he packed his wellwrapped treasures in the excellent barrels where they would be safe from rats and varmints he already had more than one hundred watches and nearly as many rings one of his regrets was that there were so few women on the trains because women had nicer things than men they had beautiful combs of ivory and necklaces and bracelets even jewels to hang in their ears joey kept all the womens things together when he went to his cave he would spend whole days unwrapping his treasures one by one holding them and letting the light play on them they were far more interesting than the money knowing that he had the treasures and that he could go there and enjoy them was a deep satisfaction to joey lately he had begun to steal things with little valueladies hairbrushes or letter openerssimply because he liked to touch the ivory or shell that they were made from the quality of his treasures was not something he intended to talk about to a killer such as wesley hardin though he decided he didnt like the nosy old gringo who asked the kind of questions his mother asked the killer was a man to be watched that was all i guess youre feeling closemouthed today are you boy wesley hardin asked of course he had not expected the guero to tell him how much money he had taken from the trains youd do better to talk to yourself wes patrick obrien said my ears get tired just from listening to you cuss when youre in a temper be glad you can hear meit means i aint shot you yet pat hardin said i can cuss old lordy now as much as i want to but he wont hear a whisper joey picked up his rifle and started to leave he would rather look at the pretty young whore gabriela than at the scabby old killer with the splotchy face hold on ill offer you a little free advice wesley hardin said they say you have a tendency to steal which is a more dangerous habit in these parts than the habit of killing one thing you ought to be careful of when youre out stealing is to stay clear of roy bean he cant abide a thief if he catches you with money on you hell hang you promptly and keep the money hes hung five men that i know about for no better reason than that they had money in their pockets and he wanted it he wont hang me but i might hang him joey replied he said it merely to meet the challenge in the old killers voice but once he began to consider it the idea grew on him roy bean was known to be a hanging judge roy bean cared little for justice or so joey had been told by billy williams joey cared little for justice himself he couldnt blame the judge for that and he didnt care that the judge wasnt fair i think i will hang him he repeated it might be pleasant john wesley hardin was startled and he wasnt a man who startled easily this pup of a boy had just had an idea that he should have had himself hang roy bean that old fart had it coming to him had for years why thats original wesley hardin said i expect that would make the newspapers old call might get fired for letting it happen do you know famous shoes joey asked the old man was a tracker a kickapoo no one knew where he lived somewhere in the sierra madre it was thought billy williams had known famous shoes for many years and thought him the best tracker who ever lived he even knew how to track birds as they flew even the apaches respected famous shoes and the apaches yielded up little respect when it came to tracking they considered themselves the best but admitted that if anyone was better than they were it was famous shoes some apaches thought that the reason famous shoes was such a brilliant tracker was that he was part eagle someone had seen him bringing the eggs of an eagle down to his camp where he ate them it was because of the eagles eggs some thought that famous shoes could see so well no one in the west could see farther or more clearly than the old kickapoo in earlier days he had been employed up and down the border by whites mexicans and indians alike to help recover children who had been stolen or sold into slavery famous shoes never failed to find the children even when he was put on the trail months late he could not always recover the children for his skill was only in tracking but he always found the children a man who could track the flight of birds and even follow eagles to their roosts in order to take their eggs would have no difficulty in tracking a raiding party that had come to take slaves i have seen famous shoes a few times wesley hardin said if i see him again ill kill him and if id known he was around id have been out hunting for him yesterday why joey asked hes an old man you wouldnt need to fear him hes an old man but his eyesight aint failed him hardin said suppose i kill the wrong fellow someone who aint just scum and the law comes after me again if they hired old famous shoes theyd find me too and if theres more of a damn posse than i could shoot id be back in prison again and next time theyll beat me to death he suddenly turned his back to joey and pulled off his coat and shirt his back was crisscrossed with scars every inch of it the time i went for the warden and tried to knock the sonofabitchs head in they gave me five hundred lashes i wasnt awake for but about two hundred of them though they will not do that to me joey said wesley hardin stuffed his shirttail back in his pants he turned to joey and smiled if they get you in jail then they can do anything they want he said if they want to beat you with a damn whip they will they wont get me in jail joey said the sight of the mans scarred back had impressed him then you better kill famous shoes and kill him next wesley hardin said thats my recommendation why him i dont even know him joey replied hes a hired hand he tracks for anybody thatll pay him wesley hardin said woodrow call might pay him to find you if hes set to find you hell find you famous shoes dont miss joey garza smiled i dont miss either he said then he took his fine rifle and left when famous shoes decided to take a walk it was usually a long one he didnt like to walk where there were federales because the federales killed indians the presence of federales distracted him and took away some of the pleasure of his long walk to avoid them he walked north through the madre until he was out of mexico before turning east he had decided to go to the rio rojo and live on it a few weeks as his people had once done he was an old man and one day soon he would have to give up his spirit he thought it would be fitting to go to the rio rojo where his people had once lived it was his view that the kickapoo people would be living along the brazos and the rio rojo still if the comanche and the kiowa had not been so hard to get along with but the comanche and the kiowa did not like the kickapoo people or any other people and it was not easy to live with the comanche or the kiowa if they disliked you they killed so many kickapoo that the old men decided the tribe had better move or soon there would be no tribe now the comanche were gone and the kiowa too famous shoes could go visit the land of his fathers without unpleasantness he walked east toward the pass of the north in a few days he would be on the great plain he wanted to visit the several forks of the brazosthe salt the clear the double mountain fork and the prairie dog fork to see if the river had moved far from where it had been when he was a boy he had known the brazos when he was young he liked to watch it wander and make itself new channels while famous shoes was walking east near agua prieta he crossed a track that frightened him so much that he wanted to crouch down it was a track he had not seen in many years the track of mox mox the manburner the apaches called him the snakeyoudonotsee for his habit of catching people unawares and burning them particularly he liked to burn young children but he would burn anyone he could catch when he wanted to burn mox mox the snakeyoudonotsee had stopped to urinate along the trail famous shoes was walking famous shoes thought he had better hurry on to the rio rojo before mox mox found him he walked for two days sleeping only a few minutes at a time when he came to the rio rojo he walked east along its wide sandy banks for two weeks on the old river he felt better the snakeyoudonotsee had not struck him he wanted to make contact with the spirit of his grandfather if possible his grandfather had lived and died on the low sandy banks of the rio rojo though famous shoes walked for days along the river he did not meet the spirit of his grandfather the old man had not liked the comanche and famous shoes decided that his grandfathers spirit had become impatient for the comanche to be taken so impatient that his spirit left its home and went to live somewhere else probably he would make contact with his grandfather as he walked south amid the forks of the brazos but that might not work either his grandfather had been an unpredictable man and all his wives had complained of his impatience and unpredictability he left when he felt like leaving and told no one where he was going or when he might return he was apt to walk south and then change his mind and walk north there was no confining the man famous shoes too was in the habit of walking where he chose and when he chose he might get up one morning and walk for three months once when he was younger he had decided to walk north to the place the ducks and the geese came from and returned to every year he knew the birds could travel much faster than he could and that he would have to get a big jump on them if he was to visit them in their home in the north he started early in the spring thinking he would be in the place the birds returned to when they returned he had been told that they nested at the edge of the world an old apache man who like himself took an interest in birds told him that the old apache believed that the ducks and geese and even the cranes flew to the edge of the world each fall to build their nests and hatch their young famous shoes wanted to see it in his dreams he saw a place where all the ducks and geese came to nest it would be noisy of course so many birds would make a lot of racket but it would still be worth it what defeated the plan was that famous shoes did not really enjoy cold weather it was cold enough in the madre and even colder on the plains north of the rio rojo but those colds were as nothing to the cold famous shoes began to encounter as the fall came in the far north he had walked to the top of the plain and into the wooded country as the days shortened he began to see strings of geese overhead and thought that he must be getting close to the great nesting place at the edge of the world but then it seemed to him he reached the edge of the world without getting to the nesting place he passed through the great forests and came to a place where the trees were only as tall as he was and famous shoes was not tall ahead he could see horizons where there were no trees at all and only a few plants of any kind there seemed to be only snow ahead of him he survived by knocking over fat birds and slow rabbits but the snow was becoming painful to his feet and the diminishing vegetation worried him with no wood to make fires he knew he might freeze also it was only fall the real cold was ahead reluctantly famous shoes stopped when he reached the place of the last tree he looked north as far as he could see wondering if the edge of the world was only a day or two away a day or two he might risk but he knew it would be foolish to go to a place without wood when the great cold was coming overhead the sky was thick with ducks and geese going to the place famous shoes wanted to go he heard them all night calling to one another as they neared their home he was annoyed with the geese for he felt that they should appreciate how far he had walked out of an interest in them and that some great goose should come down and help him go there the old apache man claimed that he had once seen a white goose big enough for a man to ride famous shoes didnt know if the story was true for the old apache man had been a little crazy and was also fond of mescal he might have been drunk and the liquor might have made the goose grow into a goose that a man could ride but if there was such a goose somewhere it too must be on its way home famous shoes waited a whole day by the last tree his feet aching from the snow hoping the great goose would see him and recognize his appreciation of the greatness of birds and alight and fly him to the big nesting place also while he was there he meant to look off the edge of the world and see what he could see but no great goose came and famous shoes was forced to turn back before his feet were frozen a few days later by great good luck he killed a small bear he made moccasins from the bear skin and hurried south hoping to get to a place where there was good firewood before the blizzards came three days later when he had just made it into the forests a great blizzard did come famous shoes had carried much of the meat of the little bear with him and he ate it while the blizzard blew months later when he was still far from his home in the madre famous shoes saw the geese and the ducks overhead flying south again it seemed to him that their calls mocked him as they flew above him for a time he became bitter and decided he didnt like birds after all they didnt care that he had walked a whole year just to see their nesting place he resolved to take no more interest in such ungrateful unappreciative creatures but once back in the sierra madre watching the great eagles that lived near his home famous shoes gradually lost his bitterness in the presence of the great eagles he became ashamed of himself two or three of the eagles knew him and would let him sit near them not too near but near enough that he could see their eyes as they watched the valleys far below their dignity made him feel that he had been silly to expect the ducks and geese or any birds to take an interest in his movements he knew himself to be a great walkerhe was not famous shoes for nothing but what was that to any bird the geese and the great cranes could fly in an hour distances it would take him a day to cover the eagles and the hawks could see much farther than he could and even the small birds the sparrows and the cactus wrens could do the one thing he couldnt do they could fly that was their greatness not his and his walking must seem a poor thing to them famous shoes was grateful to the eagles for letting him sit near them and recover himself from his long journey he needed to recover from the vanity of thinking that he was as special as the birds he did not deserve to see the great nesting places nor to look off the edge of the world he was only a man of the earth and not of the sky and his skills were not the skills of birds it was on his return from the rio rojo across the quitaque that he came upon the track of a horse carrying his old friend pea eye in the mud of a little creek famous shoes had known pea eye for a long time since the days when the rangers rode the border he could tell pea eyes track anywhere because pea eye favored his left stirrup and the horse track went deeper on the left side particularly on the rear hoof it puzzled him to discover pea eye traveling south for he understood that pea eye had a woman and several children and a farm yet he was leaving famous shoes knew that pea eyes woman was a teacher he meant someday to have her teach him to read the strange tracks in books those were the only tracks he had never been able to master for many years he had carried a small bible with him it had been given to him by an old man who carried many such books in a wagon and gave them to indians the old mans name was marshall he had come among the apaches when famous shoes was there trying to persuade an old medicine man named turtle to give up a little white girl he had captured in a raid turtle wouldnt give up the girl his own wife was shriveled and had no interest in him and he needed a young girl the money famous shoes offered money provided by the little girls family was not as important to turtle as the little girl herself turtle patiently explained this to famous shoes who understood it well enough his own wife had lost interest in him forcing him to find girls at a time when he would rather have been concentrating on other things but he had been younger then and in those days lack of a woman often caused his concentration to wander so he accepted turtles explanation and did not try to take the girl even though her family missed her and had paid him well to find her mr marshall the white man with the bibles did not accept turtles explanation as to why he needed the little girl although it was a valid one in famous shoes opinion marshall tried to buy the girl from turtle despite the fact that turtle had told him plainly that he would not sell her when marshall saw that he would not be allowed to buy the white girl he became angry he began to say bad words and make the apaches feel bad but a young apache named long thorn lived up to his name by taking a bayonet he had picked up after a battle and sticking it all the way through mr marshall who soon died it was agreed that long thorn had acted properly the white man had become abusive and deserved to be stuck with a bayonet the apaches could eat the horses that pulled the white mans wagon but the load of books with meaningless tracks in them was a different matter marshall had told them that the books came from the god who made all the whites there were many whites and they were rich the god must be powerful if he had made them all it might anger him if the book with his tracks in it was not treated properly but the apaches had no idea what they would have to do to treat the book properly by accident someone tore a few pages out of one of the books and threw them on a campfire they burned so well that the apaches decided to keep the books and use them to start fires if the god who made the whites was offended they would have to live with his wrath but after a few days of starting fires with the pages from the bibles the apaches decided that this god was too busy making whites to care what they did after that they relaxed and soon forgot the god altogether they even forgot about marshall although they ate his horses and found them to be tasty famous shoes was given a bible in lieu of the little white girl he would rather have had the girl but he took the bible and pored over it for years in his spare time he had never seen tracks as strange as the tracks in his bible after much study he could see that the little tracks were individual as were the tracks of all animals even worms and snails made tracks that were unlike those of other creatures but in the end famous shoes could make nothing of the tracks that were supposed to lead the whites to the spirit world famous shoes would have liked to see a picture of the white mans god but there were no pictures of him in the book what this gods ways might be famous shoes could not imagine if he was wrathful like his minister marshall then famous shoes was not interested in knowing too much about his ways one time famous shoes showed the bible to the old judge roy bean a white man who enjoyed hanging people famous shoes had always kept to the law and had no fear of roy bean he didnt steal and it was well known that roy bean was harshest on thieves and had a tendency to be tolerant of murder famous shoes had rarely murdered either only a time or two when he was younger and had less control over his passions now that he was older he had his passions under control to such an extent that it was not really accurate to call them passions anymore if he had a passion left it was for the flight of the eagles fortunately near his home in the madre there were many eagles whose pure beautiful soaring flight he could study at his leisure why this is the bible it tells you about jehovah and his angels roy bean said when famous shoes handed him the book roy bean was drunk this was often the case and he was not really eager to enter inffconversation with a talkative indian what is an angel i have never seen one famous shoes replied nobody aint that is they aint if theyre alive roy bean informed him testily where is heaven famous shoes asked its the place you go to when you die if youve been good roy bean said you aint been very good and i aint either so i doubt either one of us will ever see an angel after a little more questioning roy bean let slip the exciting fact that angels were men with wings famous shoes had always suspected that there might be men with wings somewhere if he had been willing to risk freezing to death when he was near the edge of the world he might have looked over the edge and seen these men with wings flying around perhaps they would have helped him grow wings himself so that he could fly off the edge of the world as the great eagles flew off the cliffs of the madre then roy bean got so drunk he couldnt talk before his tongue grew too thick to manage roy bean became irritated with famous shoes for referring to the words in the bible as tracks it did seem to famous shoes that they resembled certain tracks such as the track of the centipede or of certain delicate birds who skimmed the waters edge for their prey theyre words not tracks you damn indian roy bean insisted theyre words like im saying to you now but words are made from breath how can they live in such a thing as this book famous shoes asked he might as well have asked his question of an eagle or of the moon for roy bean had not only lost interest he had lost consciousness as well famous shoes kept the book for several more years but he never learned to make much of the little tracks finally he left the book on the ground and a golden eagle came and tore out many of its pages to use to line its nest that was a good use for such a book famous shoes thought later though he learned from the great captain marcy for whom he had scouted when he was younger that roy bean had been right the little tracks in the book were words even when he learned this famous shoes didnt regret giving the book to the golden eagle the eagle had made better use of it than he had seeing pea eyes track made him remember that pea eyes woman was a teacher who well understood the words in books this gave famous shoes an idea he might go and stay with pea eye for a few weeks and ask his woman if she would teach him how words got into books and how to know one word from another simply by its tracks it should not be too different from knowing each animal or lizard by its tracks it might be that pea eyes woman could explain words to him and even help him understand the ways of the god of whites among his people the kickapoo respect for the gods caused most people to behave well at least to behave well most of the time but the same did not appear to be true of whites most of whom behaved as if they knew no god and had no guidance stronger than their own passions when it came to deciding how to behave when he found pea eyes track in the little creek on the quitaque famous shoes saw that pea eye was about a day ahead of him he knew that as a traveler pea eye was rather lazy he was timid about snakes and did not really like to move around in the darkness which was necessary if a man wanted to cover much country also once pea eye went to sleep he didnt wake up quickly thus though pea eye was mounted and had a days start famous shoes reckoned to catch him somewhere near the clear fork of the brazos and he did he walked quietly into pea eyes camp early one morning when the stars were still out and the moon was about to go to sleep famous shoes did not like to disturb anyone so he sat quietly until pea eye began to stir as was common with whites pea eye had made a much larger campfire than was necessary several coals were still glowing famous shoes fed twigs and small branches to the coals until the fire itself woke up and burned again when pea eye heard the fire crackling he managed to open his eyes famous shoes sat beside the campfire looking at him he was a tiny old man and was wearing the same dirty bandanna around his head that he had been wearing the last time pea had seen him several years before would your woman help me learn to read famous shoes asked to get the conversation started well more than likely pea eye said shes been meaning to teach me but ive got so much farming to do that i aint learned yet i know my letters though i will go home with you then famous shoes said we can learn to read together you sure did slip in quiet didnt you pea eye said i guess if this was the old days and you was a comanche id be scalped by now theres coffee there if you want to make some pea eye added famous shoes was not a comanche nor a bad indian of any kind and he himself was in no danger of being scalped the thought made him feel so relaxed that he figured he might just doze for another minute or two while famous shoes made coffee he did doze but when he finally woke up the sun was in his face and he had the feeling he might have dozed for more than a minute or two a jackrabbit was cooking on the fire and he himself had certainly not provided any jackrabbit famous shoes must have caught one skinned it and cooked it a process that would have taken more than a minute or two although the old man had always been efficient when it came to camp chores if you are chasing somebody i dont think you are going to catch up with them unless they are crippled famous shoes said when you eat this rabbit we should go okay you can come with me pea eye said hastily shaking his boots in the hopes of emptying out whatever bugs or scorpions might have crawled into them during the night it would have been safer to sleep with his boots on but when he did that he got cramps in his legs often such bad cramps that he had to get up and stamp around in order to loosen the cramps the thing is well have to put off the reading lessons for a while i aint headed home pea eye said im going to look for the captain i got a late start and dont have no idea where he is youd be the perfect companero because you could track him if we ever cross his tracks he likes to keep his money famous shoes said captain call had never paid his scouts very liberally im not sure he would pay me if i help you find him he might think im too old to need money it wouldnt be his money though hes working for the railroad now pea eye said uneasily theres a yankee with him i expect the yankee would pay you pea eye did remember that the captain though respectful of famous shoes great skill in tracking thought the man put too high a price on his services there had been more than one dispute over money and in the end famous shoes stopped tracking for the rangers memories of this old conflict made him feel uncomfortable and just when he had been enjoying a feeling of comfort the first he had experienced since leaving lorie and his children it would be nice to travel with famous shoes he didnt mind doing the cooking and he would be a great help in locating the captain still there had been that friction in the past the captain might not be altogether pleased to have him show up with famous shoes where do you think the captain is famous shoes asked on the border somewhere pea eye said hes supposed to catch a bandit named joey garza oh famous shoes said marias son whose son pea asked she is a woman in ojinaga famous shoes said joey is her son i think he went bad i guess he did pea eye said charlie goodnight says hes killed over thirty people if charlie goodnight says it i expect its true i was in ojinaga when the federales killed marias first husband famous shoes said she is a good woman but she does not have good luck im afraid the hard sheriff will kill her someday what hard sheriff pea eye asked does the woman live in texas or mexico in mexico but the hard sheriff doesnt care famous shoes said he kills many people who live in mexico he wanted to hang me once for stealing a horse although i dont ride horses whyd he think you stole it then pea eye asked i was eating part of it when he caught me famous shoes replied a snake bit the horse on the nose and its nose closed up and it died id need to be half starved before id eat a snakebit horse pea eye said i didnt eat its nose famous shoes said the whites even nice ones like pea eye had absurd prejudices the only danger the dead horse had caused him came from doniphan the hard sheriff doniphan had marched him back to presidio meaning to hang him but a fire broke out and burned up the saloon and part of the church doniphan had been afraid that the fire might burn his jail it was a windy day with smoke blowing everywhere in the smoke and confusion famous shoes escaped it was maria garza who had given him a little jerky so that he might hurry back to the madre where the hard sheriff would never come whered you get this rabbit i didnt see one all day yesterday or i would have shot it pea eye said it was a tasty rabbit he thought about the border it was far away and he had to pass through some bleak country too it would be real handy to have a traveling companion such as famous shoes a man who was adept at catching game and cooking it too there was another factor to be considered too and that had to do with his own deficiencies as a tracker and a plainsman charlie goodnight told everybody he met that he had never been lost day or night rain or shine but this was certainly not a claim pea eye could make he himself had been lost all too often in particular he had a tendency to lose his bearings on cloudy days in truly rainy weather he was even worse he had even been known to confuse north and south on rainy days he thought he could find his way to the border simply by counting the rivers but once he got to the border then what he would have no way of knowing which direction the captain was headed or even whether he was in mexico or in texas in normal times he could locate the captain simply by asking the locals the captain was a man people noticed but along much of the border there were no locals if the captain was in mexico pea eye had his doubts about his skill in finding him that problem had made him anxious from the moment he left home what if he had left the farm and upset lorena and the children and still didnt manage to locate the captain in time to help him what if the garza boy outsmarted the captain and wounded him or something while pea eye was still miles away looking in the wrong place the captain might even be killed and if that occurred pea knew he would never forgive himself with famous shoes along some of that anxiety would be removed famous shoes could find anybody anywhere in the west and could find them more quickly than anyone else even the captain who thought famous shoes too expensive was quick to admit that the old indian was without equal when it came to tracking i think its eyesight the captain said he can see better than us that remark had been made on a nervous occasion when everyone in the ranger troop thought they saw indians kneeling in the prairie grass far ahead everyone including the captain and gus mccrae had peered hard across the prairie and concluded that there were indians ahead preparing an ambush famous shoes took only one quick look and shook his head not indians he said sagebrush and so it had proved to be when they reached the point where they thought the ambush had been planted come with me to the border pea eye said if the captain wont pay you enough maybe i can trade you reading lessons or something when we get back he said it hoping that lorena wouldnt mind too much when he actually showed up with the old man good famous shoes said if your woman will teach me to read i wont take wages from the captain it was such a relief to know that the matter of the expense had been settled or settled at least until lorena had her say in the matter that pea eye finished the tasty jackrabbit and was saddled and ready to go within ten minutes it was a bright day and the gray plain south of him for once didnt seem so bleak famous shoes as usual walked far ahead i didnt like the war brookshire said i never understood why it was happening nobody ever explained it to me they just stuck me in uniform and sent me off my mother cried and my sister cried and my father told them to dry up i was just doing my duty they were camped far out on the monte in mexico call had decided to swing west toward chihuahua city they had run into a small troop of federales who told them joey garza had been seen in chihuahua city call didnt necessarily believe it but he swung west anyway to put some distance between his party and the river too many people traveled the river country or lived in it even in the long hundredmile stretches where there were no villages there were still peopleindians travelers prospectors in his lifetime on the border call reckoned that he had run into at least fifty people lost souls mostly who were looking for coronados treasure call didnt know much about coronado just that he had been the first white man to travel through the region he had made the trip a long time ago and call had never been certain that he knew exactly where coronado had gone some reports put his route as far west as the gila but others thought he had just gone straight up the rio grande a few even argued that he had started at vera cruz and come out at galveston whichever route the man had actually taken call doubted that he had come up with much in the way of treasure he might have collected a little silver if he got into the navajo country but call himself in nearly forty years on the border had encountered mostly poor people who had no treasure avoiding the river made sense to him also he had never traveled very deeply into mexico and he wanted to see it brookshire worried and the more he worried the less call hurried he kept an eye out for tracks deputy plunkert tried to help but it soon became evident that he was no tracker about all he had ever tracked before the expedition was lost milk cows more and more the deputy missed the comforts of home in particular he missed doobies biscuits which she made every morning and had ready for him hot and buttery when he got up how come you to miss the war captain brookshire asked the likelihood of combat sometime in the near future had stirred old memories he remembered the screams of the men whose limbs had to be amputated quickly on the battlefield he remembered the sound the saw made as the surgeons cut through bone and the dull groaning of the men in the hospital tents as they awoke every morning to face another day without an arm or a leg or both legs or an eye or whatever part was missing those memories had ceased to trouble him during the quiet years in brooklyn somebody had to stay around and keep the comanches in check call said otherwise i guess they would have driven the settlers back to the sea they drove them back nearly a hundred miles as it was with us after them all the time there was trouble from the south too still is we should just take mexico and be done with it deputy plunkert said if we owned it we could make the people abide by the law call ignored the remark he thought it ignorant i wish i could have fought in the war deputy plunkert said i would have been happy to kill a few yankees thats not polite theres a yankee right here at this campfire call said mr brookshire fought for his side you cant blame him for that why no i meant other yankees the deputy said it embarrassed him that the captain had dressed him down in front of a fat little yankee such as brookshire the man had lost a little bit of his girth once the diet had dropped to frijoles and not much else but he hadnt lost any of his yankeeness not in plunkerts view that damn abe lincoln oughtnt to have freed the slaves neither the deputy said he was feeling aggrieved because no one was taking his side not even the captain the man he had left home to assist what was your opinion on that question brookshire wondered looking at call oh i grew up poor call said we would never have had the money for a slave there had been a time when gus mccrae had wanted to abandon the rangers and rush back east to fight yankees for he had gotten it in his head that southern freedoms were being trampled and that the two of them ought to go fight this despite the fact that they had more fighting than they could handle right where they were call himself had never caught the fervor of that war the best man he had working with him at the time was blackdeets later killed by a shoshone boy in wyoming he had known people who had owned slaves and mistreated them and he would certainly have fought to keep deets from being owned by any of the bad slaveholders but he could not have fought with the north against his region and was content to stay where he was doing what he was doing no one in his right mind would have wanted fiercer fighting than the comanche were capable of gus mccraes problem was that he liked bugles and parades he had even tried to persuade call to hire a bugler for the ranger troop a bugler call said half these men dont have decent saddles and were lucky if we have forty rounds of ammunition apiece why waste money on a bugler it might impress the comanche theyve got some sense of show gus retorted thats your problem woodrow or one of them youve got no sense of show aint you ever heard of esprit de corps no what is it and how much does it cost call asked i give up you dont buy esprit de corps you instill it and a good bugler would be a start augustus said the argument had taken place north of the canadian river when they were chasing a party of comanche raiders who were to put it plainly smarter and faster than they were the rangers horses were winded and the men so hungry that they were wading around in the icy canadian in february hoping to catch small fish or frozen frogs or anything that might have a shred or two of meat on it two days before they had eaten an owl the men had been cutting small strips of leather off their saddles and chewing on them just to have something in their mouths gus was standing in zero weather with a norther blowing so hard they could barely keep a campfire lit talking about buglers they didnt catch the raiders who were carrying two white children with them and they never hired a bugler although gus mccrae was still talking about it nearly ten years later when the civil war finally ended and the indian wars were beginning to wind down as for the great and terrible civil war calls main sense of it was derived from seeing people who came back from it several rangers who had served under him left to go fight yankees but those who returned were blank and mostly useless one boy named reuben who had lost an eye and an arm at vicksburg did more than anyone to make that conflict vivid to call captain you dont know reuben said looking at call sadly with his one eye when we get into it with the comanches maybe its ten or fifteen of us and fifteen or twenty of them all of us shooting at one another but in the big fight i was in its thousands and thousands on both sides and cannons and smoke and horses running around half kilt i seen one horse come by with just a leg in a stirrup no riderits terrible i got one eye left and one arm and im one of the lucky ones all but three of the men i started soldiering with are dead brookshire had been worrying a good deal about the train robbery in new mexico who could the second robber be he had no answer and neither did captain call the other robber could be anybody call told him this is a free country anybody can rob a train if they can make it stop trains travel through some lonesome country if i was a mind to be a criminal i cant think of an easier way to start than robbing trains ive always tried to be honest deputy plunkert said i stole some pecans once and cracked them with my teeth but i was just a boy then there was something about being so far into mexico that made the deputy feel hopeless he had never been very good at finding his way in new country which was one reason he had made his life in laredo the town was well supplied and there was no need to go anywhere now that he was married to doobie there was no need even to cross the river for girls but he had been swept away by his desire to be a ranger something he had always dreamed of being and now he was deep in the middle of a country he didnt like with two men who werent nearly as easy to get along with as doobie and one of them was a yankee to boot sometimes riding through the empty country where in a whole day they might not even see a bird or a rabbit and had nothing to eat but a little jerky and frijoles and had even been instructed to parcel out the water in their canteens the deputy wondered if he would ever get back to doobie or his friend jack deen who liked to hunt wild pigs something had carried him away something he hadnt expected he hadnt even known captain call was in laredo or that he was hunting joey garza it was like a wind had swept through laredo one afternoon carrying him away with it would there be another wind to carry him back home in his sad moments ted plunkert didnt think there would be a homing wind he felt that he had made one simple wrong move but one that could never be corrected he resolved to be very careful to give himself the best possible chance but he didnt know and he didnt feel hopeful they rode into chihuahua city on a freezing windy day when the streets were nothing but swirling dust the old women in the marketplace where they stopped to secure provisions were wrapped in long black shawls and the shawls were spotted with dust one old woman had killed three lizards and was offering their meat for sale it revolted ted plunkert that a people would be so degraded as to eat lizards and he said as much to the captain ive eaten lizard call said ive eaten bobcat and ive eaten skunk the deputy had lived in settlements all his life and had no notion of what sorts of things men would eat when they were hungry really hungry brookshire rode over to the telegraph office call found a barber and he and the deputy both had a shave call enjoyed his but deputy plunkert was nervous allowing a mexican such a good opportunity to cut his throat was not easy for the deputy but the mexican shaved him clean and didnt offer him any trouble of course chihuahua city was a long way from laredo around laredo any mexican barber would have been glad to cut his throat that was another strange thing about travel you went among people who had never heard of you ted plunkert had lived in laredo all his life and everybody in laredo knew him on sight even the mexicans he had been living there when doobie was born and kept on living there until she grew up and got old enough that he could marry her being in a place where people didnt know him was unusual but so far no injuries had resulted when brookshire came back from the telegraph office he had six telegrams and he looked sick your color aint good call observed i guess if i was your doctor the first thing id advise you would be to stay away from telegraph offices every time you go into a telegraph office you come out looking sick yes and theres a reason brookshire said theres a bunch of news and not a word of it good whats the worst call asked the worst is that my wife died brookshire said katie died i never expected it before he could get a grip on his feelings he found himself crying even dripping tears on the telegrams he hurriedly thrust them at the nearest man who happened to be deputy plunkert katie was dead pneumonia had carried her away she was already buried too he would never see her nor speak to her again i swear call said that is bad news im sorry to hear it i wish now id sent you back from amarillo you might have been a help its too late katies gone brookshire mumbled it was the most shocking thing that had happened to him in his life he and katie had discussed his death several times for he was fourteen years older and it would only be natural that he die first that was what they had expected what they had discussed he had supposed she would go right on being alive doing her sewing putting up with the cat and making meals for him when he got home on sundays they often ate out that was how brookshire had supposed it would be someday he would pass away if katie missed him for a while that was natural but in all likelihood her distress wouldnt last long she would soon take his death in stride and be able to continue with her life in fairly good order certainly she would be a help with her sisters children for they themselves had none often her sisters children had stayed with them and on three visits out of four there would be emergencies or crises katie was never more useful than at such times she knew how to judge the seriousness of fevers and never gave a child the wrong medicine brookshire was not nearly so useful in crises involving children katie was never more irritated with him than when he gave a child the wrong medicine or misjudged the dosage she felt strongly that he ought to learn to dose children correctly even though they didnt have any children of their own now all that had been turned upside down katie had died not he and he had no choice but to receive the news in a gritty cold mexican town where he had been sent by colonel terry to do a job he was in no way fit for youre my overseer brookshire the colonel told him the day he left see that the captain doesnt waste time and doesnt waste money i want the garza boy stopped but i dont want unnecessary expense youre a competent accountant and im depending on you keep your ledgers neat the colonel who had lost an arm in the war did not shake hands with him when he left the colonel rarely shook hands with his employees he had the notion that people caught diseases by shaking hands he avoided it unless he was with the president or the governor or the mayor of new york or some such higherup now brookshire had gone too far from home and he had tried to do his exact duty only to have katie catch something and be the one to die she would never again complain of his erratic dosing when her sisters children were ill it was a hard thing to accept real hard brookshire struggled to regain control of himself but he couldnt he wept and wept deputy plunkert quickly handed the telegrams to captain call he was surprised to see that a yankee would cry so over a wife he had heard that all yankees were cold with their women but this one mr brookshire had tears running all down his face the old mexican women in the market wrapped in their shawls against the sand and the wind were watching the man silently as if they too were surprised by his tears if you like well stop for a day its hard to travel when youre grieved ive done it call said no read the telegrams brookshire said with katie dead the only thing he had to cling to was duty he had to keep thinking of duty or he would be lost call took the telegrams from deputy plunkert and read them in the last years he had improved his reading considerably charlie goodnight had books in his house fifteen or twenty maybe call had been inside the goodnights house just once to visit them he had not paid much attention to the books but goodnight had one that had just come in the mail a few days before it was called a texas cowboy or fifteen years on the hurricane deck of a spanish ponyon its cover it had a picture of a man sitting on a pony that was clearly not spanish the book was by charlie siringo a kind of neerdowell who had cowboyed a little and rangered a little while gambling and drinking steadily at least in the years when call had been aware of him it was a surprise that such a man had written a book but there it was i want you to read it and tell me if you think theres anything true in it goodnight said i think its all yarns myself call read the book and agreed with goodnight it was all yarns but what else would anyone expect from a braggart like siringo reading siringos lies had improved his reading though he had even thought of stopping by goodnights house to borrow another book in order to keep in practice he had heard that general crook whom he had once met had written a book general crook would be far less likely than charlie siringo to fill a book with lies call took his time and read the telegrams carefully then he reread them in order to give brookshire time to recover a bit from the terrible news he had just received four of the telegrams were from colonel terry the first was merely an inquiry where are you stop report at once the second was in a similar vein important that you report at once the third telegram was the one call studied the longest a train had been stopped in mesilla near silver city new mexico it had been carrying only three passengers but all three had been killed and their bodies burned a witness a zuni man had been killed and scalped but not burned it was not the work of joey garza a local tracker said seven men were involved the fourth telegram from the colonel offered reinforcements call if he accepted the job could hire as many men as he needed catch the garza boy and then go to new mexico to deal with the new threat the fifth telegram was from goodnight a surprise to call first that goodnight would take the trouble and second that he could guess where call was going accurately enough to have a telegram waiting for him of course charles goodnight was no fool he had not lasted as long as he had by being ignorant his telegram was as terse as its author mox mox is alive stop hes your manburner stop your deputy is on his way stop famous shoes tracking for him stop mox mox burned four of my cowboys stop you may not recall stop available if needed stop goodnight the final telegram was the one with the sad news about brookshires wife call folded them all and put them in his shirt pocket the one about mox mox he meant to study later mox mox was a renegade from the country north of santa fe news that he was alive and evidently had a gang was startling the man had supposedly been killed some ten years earlier in utah by a ute indian call remembered that rumor and he also remembered the four goodnight cowboys mox mox had killed and burned in the days when mox mox had been a junior member of blue ducks gang of roving killers goodnight had pursued the man then pursued him all through new mexico and into arizona and utah but had met with one of his rare defeats mox mox had vanished into the canyons it was not long afterward that news came of his death at the hands of the ute not a word had been heard of him since now he was alive and in new mexico and he had a gang and was picking off trains it did complicate the search balancing the complication though was the news about pea eye news that call found very gratifying the man was loyal after all and if he had old famous shoes with him call would not have to go looking for his deputy the two of them would just show up one day brookshire though still wobbly from his tragic news was watching call closely katie was dead and he had only his job to think about now he wanted to get on with it he wanted to know what calls opinion was about the other telegrams are we going after the new robber captain he asked hes not a robberhes a killer call said he kills men and then burns them sometimes he dont bother to kill them before he burns them he burns people deputy plunkert said shocked burns them when theyre alive he had heard of indians torturing and burning people in the old days but this wasnt the old days this was his own time yes he burns them to death in some cases call said i dont know much about the man i had about quit rangering before he showed up he killed some of goodnights men but that was in colorado ive never been there his name is mox mox he added what kind of a name is that brookshire asked just a name call said your colonel wants us to lope up and catch him after we subdue the garza boy theres some good news too he added pea eye is coming so well have reinforcements hes bringing a tracker with himor rather the tracker is bringing pea i know the old man hes a kickapoo theres nobody better but hes not cheap i dont know if your colonel will want to finance him or not why how much does a tracker cost brookshire asked he was weak in the legs had a headache and felt as if he would just like to be alone in a nice hotel room for a while in a hotel where they could bring him brandy and where he could sleep on sheets and not have the wind and sand blowing in his hair all night nor hear the coyotes howl he had a sudden urge now that they were in a city of sorts to be inside away from the wind and sand and sky away from call and the hostile deputy who never spoke to him unless he had to still he was a salaried man even though katie who had been a good wife was dead he was not his own master colonel terry wanted action and he wanted reports remember brookshire im a man who likes to keep his finger on the pulse the colonel had said as he was leaving keep those telegrams coming i dont know how much famous shoes thinks hes worth nowadays call said if he could write hed have his bill ready the minute he arrives hell be the first to tell you he dont work for free id just like a general figure brookshire said wondering why the old women with the dirty shawls were watching him so intently more and more he wished for a hotel room but from the look in the captains eyes he knew it was not likely to be the captain had the look of a man who was in no mood to linger now theres two bandits and two killers brookshire said which one do we start with joey garza call said thats who i was hired to catch the manburner is another story theres supposed to be law in new mexico now let them stop him what if they cant do we have to do it deputy plunkert asked here was another bad picture about to get stuck the thought of burning men had got stuck in his mind he wanted to dislodge it but he could not he had once helped remove the bodies of two old women who had burned to death when their house caught on fire he could still remember how the burnt flesh smelled and how the ashes stuck to their faces that had been his most horrible duty since becoming a lawman the thought that there was a killer named mox mox who burned people routinely was very disturbing more and more it seemed to deputy plunkert that he had been swept out of his life by an evil wind the wind was blowing him farther and farther away from home he looked at captain call and he looked at brookshire he felt almost like a boy in relation to the two men he was young and they were not they were even older than sheriff jekyll who had been his boss being in a city where there were only mexicans was disquieting too even though these were mexicans who knew nothing about him he was in the path of an evil wind and he felt that he would never get home i want to buy some binoculars if we can find any call said then we can provision ourselves and leave where will we go next brookshire asked id like to send colonel terry a telegram presidio call said i think the garza boy comes from around there famous shoes might show up there too then wed have pea eye how would he know to show up there brookshire asked we didnt even know we were going there ourselves until just now call smiled thats the trackers skill he said it aint all just looking at the ground and studying tracks famous shoes will think about it and watch the birds and talk to the antelope and figure it out peas no tracker i expect it would take him six months to locate us on his own in a hardware store he purchased some field glasses they were not the highest quality but they would have to do he was about to leave the store but turned back and bought two extra rifles he rarely burdened himself with extra equipment a blanket and a winchester and one canteen had seen him through many engagements this time though he felt it might be wise to carry a couple of extra guns goodnights telegram had made him think twice about what lay ahead mox mox was a complication call did not intend to go after him but it might not be a matter of going after him mox mox might come to texas for all anyone knew also pea eye had never owned a reliable gun and famous shoes rarely went armed he moved too fast to be carrying weapons the extra winchesters would come in handy as they left the store call handed the receipts to brookshire who carefully folded them and put them in his shirt pocket the day had turned cold and the sky was the color of steel it was nearing evening brookshire still entertained the hope that they would spend at least one night in a hotel of some sort but the captain had not mentioned a hotel he was securing the provisions tying them onto the pack animals ted plunkert for once shared an opinion with the yankee who had mentioned to him hesitantly that it would be very nice to spend one night in a bed inside a building yes i dont much care what its like as long as its inside the deputy said but when call was satisfied that the packs were secure he mounted his horse and looked at the two men both standing by their mounts i guess we aint staying the night is that right captain brookshire asked why no your boss wants results aint that correct call said thats correct brookshire replied theres a full moon tonight and we should take advantage of it call said the horses are rested we should be able to make it to the rio concho how far is that captain brookshire asked i suppose about fifty miles call said if we dont strike it tonight well strike it tomorrow neither brookshire nor deputy plunkert looked happy of course brookshire had lost his wife he could not be expected to recover from such a blow immediately but there was a full moon and call didnt want to waste it mr brookshire i think its better that we go on call said im sorry about your wife but lagging wont bring her back wed better go get your boss some results well thats good brookshire said thats exactly what the colonel wants im confident the garza boys not west of us and i dont think hes south either call said i think hes east and north this is where the hunt starts we havent been in any danger so far but that might change in a day or two i want you both to keep alert hes got that german rifle dont forget it well be going through country where theres not much cover you both need to keep alert do you think joey garza knows were coming captain brookshire asked i expect so call said if he doesnt know it now hell know it by the time we cross the river wholl tell him the deputy asked why i dont know call said hes an intelligent young bandit i expect hell know were coming what do you think will he try to pick us off deputy plunkert asked he noticed that the captain was frowning at him brookshire the yankee had already mounted he looked miserable but at least he was already on his horse ted plunkert hastily mounted too i dont know what hell try lets go to texas the captain said turning his horse by the time the full moon appeared they were well out of chihuahua city the moon shone on a landscape that seemed to be emptier than any of the barren country brookshire had ridden through since coming to texas there was nothing to be seen at all just the moon and the land the wind soared sometimes spumes of dust rose so high that the moon shone bleakly through them at other times the dust cleared and the moon shone brightso bright that brookshire could read his watch by its light at midnight they struck the rio concho but the captain neither slowed down nor looked back he kept on riding toward texas the blowingaway feeling came back to brookshire but it came to him laced with fatigue and sadness over the loss of his wife katie a nice person he felt heartsick at the knowledge that he would never see katie again his heartsickness went so deep that the blowingaway feeling didnt frighten him it would be fine now if he blew away he would not have to face the colonel and explain the exorbitant expenses that might accrue in brooklyn in his work as a salaried man brookshire had never paid much attention to the moon once in a while on picnics he might admire it as it shone over the east river or the hudson if they went that far to picnic but it hadnt mattered to him whether the moon was full or just a sliver or not there at all once they were on the black desert in mexico brookshire saw that the captain had been right the full moon in the deep mexican sky was so bright that traveling was as easy as it would have been in daylight brookshire was still a salaried man but he was also a manhunter now a manhunter hunting a very dangerous man he was heading into texas with captain woodrow call and he would probably do well to start paying more attention to the moon part ii the manburner lorena was reading a letter from clara when clarie came in to tell her that mr goodnight was at the door in the letter clara was urging her to make a beginning in latin advice that caused lorena to feel doubtful she thought she could do quite well with english grammar now but she didnt know if she was up to latin or if she ever would be the baby had been sick most of the time since pea eye left and she had been sleeping tired and waking tired worrying about the baby and worrying about pea mr goodnight lorena said though he had given the money to build the school she taught in lorena had only met mr goodnight once or twice and he had never visited her home why would he come here are you sure its him she asked she felt unprepared and not merely for the study of latin either at that moment she just felt low and her feet and hands were cold usually letters from clara cheered lorena but this one made her feel more aware of her shortcomings she knew herself to be a competent country schoolteacher but somehow the latin language felt as if it should belong to a better order of person than herself a farmers wife with five children no money and no refinements if latin was anything it was a refinement learning may be the best thing we have it may be all that we can truly keep lorie clara wrote in the letter along with news about her girls and her horses lorena read that sentence several times in fact she read it again even after clarie delivered her information she felt her daughters impatience but she was reluctant to lay aside her letter to go and attend to charles goodnight the great pioneer ma hes waitinghe already took his hat off clarie said annoyed at her mothers behavior mr goodnight was on the back steps hat in hand why was she sitting there like that reading a letter she had already read five or six times laurie had just taken the breast and her mother had scarcely bothered to cover herself even though the baby was now asleep what was wrong with her ma clarie said deeply embarrassed oh hush dont scold me ive been scolded enough in my life already lorena said she buttoned her dress and put the letter under a bookaurora leigh it was she had ordered it from kansas cityand went to the kitchen door the old heavy man with the gray hair and the gray beard stood there patiently a big gray horse waited behind him i was busy im sorry you had to wait lorena apologized opening the door for him she had heard that goodnight was severe with women but she had seen no sign of it in his behavior toward her despite her past he had approved of her as a schoolteacher not everyone wealthy enough to simply write a check and have a schoolhouse built would have been so tolerant i hesitate to bother you maam goodnight said come in i can offer you buttermilk lorena said holding the door open goodnight immediately came in and took a chair in the kitchen i know youve got your duties ill be brief though i would like the buttermilk he said if i had been born in different circumstances i could have made a life of drinking buttermilk lorena poured him a large glass he drank half of it and set the glass down clarie peeked in at the door she couldnt resist everyone talked about mr goodnight but she had only seen him once before at a picnic and he hadnt stayed around long enough for her to get a really good look at him thats a finelooking young lady therei understand she helps out with the teaching goodnight said yes shes a great help lorena said clarie blushed so unexpected was her mothers compliment she had made it to the great man too im shaky at some of the arithmetic lorena admitted clarie grasps fractions better than i do goodnight drank the other half of the buttermilk and set the empty glass back on the table i expect i could chase a fraction from dawn to sunset and never come near enough to grasp it he said then he looked firmly at clarie the three boys hearing an unfamiliar voice in the kitchen were huddled behind her peeking along with their big sister ill have to ask you younguns to excuse us older folks he said ive got a private matter to talk over with your mother oh clarie said she immediately retreated taking the boys with her georgie she had to forcibly drag by the collar he had developed the illmannered habit of staring at guests lorena felt a sudden alarm had something happened to pea no your husbands fine as far as i know goodnight said seeing the alarm in the womans eyes he felt sympathy for her and much admiration it was well known that she had not missed a day of school since taking her job she arrived every day in her buggy in the coldest weather and in the muddiest weather too he himself had always been more vexed by mud than by cold and so was mary his wife skirts and highbutton shoes were a great nuisance when it was muddy mary claimed and he didnt doubt it a bit this young woman had strength and she didnt neglect her duties that he admired he felt uneasy though at the nature of the inquiry he had come to make the uneasiness had kept him at home for two weeks or more since he had first been told that mox mox the manburner had appeared again this woman had a difficult past he knew that but he didnt care life was an uneven business he knew himself to be of a judgmental naturetoo judgmental his wife assured him but with the schoolmarm he had no urge to pass judgment she was not the only woman in the panhandle to have had an uneven life and her performance with her pupils had been splendid in his opinion her past was between her and her husband goodnight was not a preacher and he had no mission to save the world either youre sure hes not dead lorena asked she couldnt help it shed had several bad dreams since pea eye left and in all of them he was either dead or about to be if he is i havent heard it goodnight said then what is it mr goodnight lorena asked what is it its mox mox goodnight replied lorena knew then why it had taken an old man known all over the west for his abruptness so long to come to the point her first urge was to run and lock her children in the bedroom where they couldnt possibly even hear the name goodnight had just spoken at the same time she felt too weak to stand up a rush of fear broke in her such as she had not felt for many years goodnight saw itthe woman had come into the kitchen a little flustered some color in her cheeks but the color left her as soon as he spoke mox moxs name it was as if the blood had suddenly been milked from her with one squeeze but hes dead aint he lorena asked it was the first time she had slipped and said aint in many months i thought so myself but now i aint so sure goodnight said ive never seen the man myself and i believe you have seen him thats why ive bothered you and took the risk of upsetting you he paused watching the young woman bring herself under control it was not a simple struggle or a brief one she stared at him wordless she was plainly scared too scared to hide it finally to be doing something he got up and helped himself to another glass of buttermilk seeing mr goodnight pouring himself the buttermilk brought lorena back to herself and just in time for a second she had felt a scream starting in her head or had heard inside herself the piercing echo of many screams from the past she felt cold and clammy so heavy with fear that for a second she didnt know if she could move during the hours when she had been a captive of mox mox and his boss blue duck she hadnt been able to move and the terror that she felt during those hours was a thing that would never leave her the name alone had brought it all back mr goodnight must have known it might or he would not have hesitated but the man was in her kitchen he was her guest and there was such a thing as manners even though her deepest urge was to gather her children and runrun to nebraska or farthershe knew that she had to control herself and try to help charles goodnight for the very sake of her children im sorry im bad scared it caused me to forget my manners she said she gripped the edge of the table and squeezed it with the fingers of both hands she needed something that would steady her something to grip but the spasm of fear was stronger than her grip despite herself she kept trembling it dont take much muscle to pour buttermilk goodnight said i regret having to put you through this why are you mox mox is dead lorena said pea eye heard it years ago he was killed in utah or somewhere hes dead aint he she asked hes dead everybody said it i chased him to utah myself goodnight said he burnt four of my cowboys in colorado on the purgatory river three of them were boys of sixteen and the fourth was my foreman hed been with me twenty years i chased mox mox but i lost him its a failure ive regretted ever since two or three years later i heard he was dead killed by a ute indian yes it was a ute that killed him lorena said thats what pea eye told me goodnight watched her shaking he wished he could comfort her but he had never been much of a hand at comforting women it wasnt one of his skills he drank the second glass of buttermilk looked at the pitcher and decided not to have a third i think mox mox is alive he said somebodys been burning people in new mexico burning what kinds of people lorena asked still gripping the table it was all she could do to keep from jumping up and gathering her children and running before mox mox could come and get them all whatever kind he catches goodnight said he stopped a train and took three people off and burned them that was three weeks ago there aint that many manburners goodnight added after a pause the suggs brothers burned two farmers but captain call caught the suggs brothers and hung them that was years ago he paused again mox mox is the only killer ive heard of who makes a habit of burning people he said finally lorena was silent but in her head she heard the screams if ive got the history right when blue duck took you from the hat creek outfit mox mox was still running with him goodnight said he spoke with caution he had known several women who had been captives several women and a few children some of them babbled about it others never spoke of it but all were damaged though used to plain speech he knew that there were times when it wasnt the best way to talk this woman who worked so hard for the ignorant raw children of the settlers in a schoolhouse he had built had been a captive not of the comanche but of blue duck one of the cruelest renegades ever to appear in the panhandle country and mox mox at various times had run with blue duck he himself had never seen either man this woman had seen one of them for sure perhaps she had seen both he wanted to know what she knew or as much of it as she could bear to tell him rarely in his long life had goodnight felt so awkward about asking for the information he needed lorena was not one to babble what she felt she mainly kept inside her fingers were white from gripping the edge of the table and her arms shook a little but she was not behaving wildly she was not screaming or crying and she was also not talking mox mox is a white man and hes short lorena said one of his eyes aint right it points to the side but the other eye looks at you and ones enough goodnight waited standing by the stove lorena took a deep breath she felt as if she might strangle if she didnt get more air into her lungs she remembered that was how she had been then too the day blue duck led her horse across the red river and handed her over to ermoke and monkey john and all the rest but not mox mox he hadnt been there then he had arrived later how many days later lorena wasnt sure she wasnt counting days then she hadnt expected to live and didnt want to or didnt think she wanted to then mox mox arrived he had three mexicans with him and a stolen white boy the little boy was about six he whimpered all night when gus mccrae rescued her she hadnt been able to speak and she had never since spoken of that time to anyonenot much anyway particularly she had never spoken about the little boy mox mox wanted to burn me lorena said ill tell you mr goodnight ill tell it today but dont ever ask me about it again is that a bargain goodnight nodded hes small lorena said he wasnt big like blue duck and hes got that eye that looks off he wanted to burn me he piled brush all around me and he poured whiskey on me he said that would make me burn longer he said it would make it hurt worse he rubbed grease in my eyes he said that would be the worst when my eyes fried he poured whiskey on me and he rubbed that grease in my eyes but he didnt burn you goodnight said im surprised its our good luck and yours blue duck wouldnt let him burn me lorena said blue duck wanted me for bait he let him pile up the brush and he let him squirt and rub grease in my eyes but he wouldnt let him burn me he wanted to use me to catch gus mccrae he wanted to catch gus real bad but then gus killed half his renegades and blue duck left what about mox mox goodnight asked i guess he didnt stay for the fight with captain mccrae did he he left like his jefe yes he left with his mexicans lorena said she stopped ive never told nobody this i dont know if i can mr goodnight lorena said dont try goodnight said you dont need to ill tell this part maam he didnt burn you but he burned the boy didnt he howd you know lorena asked looking at him in surprise because i found what was left of that boy and buried him goodnight said six months later that devil burned my cowboys im glad somebody else knows lorena said well i know goodnight said i found the remains the boys parents showed up at my headquarters about a year later they were still looking for their child lorena began to tremble so hard that charles goodnight stepped over and put a hand on her shoulder he had steadied horses that way perhaps it would have the same effect with this woman you didnt tell them did you lorena said you didnt tell them what happened did you i told them their son drowned in the south canadian river goodnight said i usually try to stick to the truth but these poor folks had been hunting that boy for a year i thought the full truth was more than they needed to hear anyway the child was dead they wanted to go to the grave and i took them im thankful they didnt try to dig up the child you did right lorena said you shouldnt have told them no more than you did they were silent lorena was still trembling but not so badly i wasnt a mother then lorena said im a mother now mox mox did the same things to that child that he said he would do to me he whipped him and he poured whiskey on him and he rubbed grease in his eyes then he piled brush on him and burned him she had said it said it for the first time she looked up at goodnight the old man of the plains were the indians that bad with people they caught she asked they were goodnight said those were bloody times the indian times but you said mox mox was white he was whitea mean little white man lorena said he whipped that boy till there wasnt an inch of skin on his body then he burned him it aint often you find two bad ones of the caliber of him and blue duck running together goodnight said but you said mox mox had his own gang three mexicans lorena said they left with mox mox when blue duck wouldnt let him burn me goodnight was about to speak when lorenas voice quickened i still hear that boy screaming mr goodnight she said ill always hear that child screaming im a mother now he was about the age of georgie about the age of georgie then a convulsion of sobbing seized her and she got up and stumbled out of the room her arms clutched about her chest as if her very organs might spill out if she didnt clutch herself tightly enough goodnight looked at the buttermilk again and again decided against another glass though he was old and should have been used to all suffering to any misery that life could place in his path he had never accustomed himself to the deep sobbing of women to the grief that seized them when their children died or their men he had no children his cowboys were his children but he had not given birth to his cowboys it must surely make a difference he went out the back door into the stiff wind and stood by his horse waiting until the young woman had recovered sufficiently to fend for herself and her children a little boy came out and walked up to him my moremoremama is crying he said looking at goodnight the boy didnt seem to be particularly upset he was just reporting well i expect she needs to let her bawl goodnight said my butbutbaby sister cries all the thatthattime but i dont cry the little boy georgie stammered two more boys came out one older one younger they stood together all were barefoot though it was cold outside then the large girl came too carrying the baby she looked scared mamas screaming in there the girl said why is she screaming like that shes never screamed before indeed when the wind lay for a few seconds goodnight could hear lorena screaming they were wild screams he supposed captive women must scream like that during the worst of it but he had never been a captive nor a woman and he could only suppose i brought some bad news im afraid its greatly upset her goodnight said shell probably be better presently unless she isnt he thought people had lost their minds over less than the schoolmarm had endured i hope she stops one of the older boys said it wasnt about pa was it clarie asked no i have no reason to think your father has had any difficulty goodnight told the girl he was not used to talking to young people and found it a strain but in the calm intervals between the surges of wind he could still hear lorena as could the children and she was still screaming then the wind would return and whisk her screams away do you ever cancancry mister the bold georgie asked seldom son very seldom goodnight replied is it butbutbecause you have a butbutbeard georgie asked he liked the old man though he certainly didnt have much to say yes i expect thats the reason goodnight said there was an interval the wind lay briefly they heard no screams shes stopped do you think i should go see about her mr goodnight clarie asked no lets just wait goodnight said i expect shell come and get us when she wants us they were all silent for a minute as the wind blew its chilly weather to go barefoot in goodnight said dont none of you have shoes we got a pair apiece the older of the boys replied ma dont like us to put em on until we get to school though she thinks its wasting shoes gogogot any horses thats for knowledgeknowledgekids to ride georgie asked i butbutbeen wantin a horse georgie its mr goodnight clarie said mortified georgie had practically come right out and asked him for a horse with their mother screaming in the house thats fine miss goodnight said a cowboy needs a horse well dododo you have one moremoremister georgie asked clarie resolved to box him soundly when she got the opportunity she had an urge to go in the house and see about her mother but she hesitated to leave georgie alone with mr goodnight there was no telling what he might ask for next why ill have to inspect my herd goodnight said amused i wouldnt want to give a cowboy like you just any horse moremoremake it brown if youve gogogot a brown one georgie said butbutbrowns my fromfromfavorite cancancolor his stutter became worse when he got excited would you come back in please all of you lorena asked from the doorway im so sorry i drove you out in the wind it aint the first breeze ive felt goodnight remarked evidence of her sobbing was in lorenas face but she had put a comb in her hair and seemed composed more composed than she had been even when he arrived you children go into the bedroom you too clarie she said i have to talk to mr goodnight a minute more then well try to get back to normal ma georgies been asking mr goodnight for a horse clarie blurted out she didnt want to go in the bedroom she wanted to report on georgies misbehavior first where hes going there are plenty of horses lorena said dont question me now go in the bedroom the children went obediently im sending them off to nebraska lorena said the minute she knew the bedroom door was closed i have a friend there shell take them till this is over i thought it was over or i wouldnt have been living nowhere near here she added he told me if i ever had children hed come and burn them like he burned that little boy it was the last thing he said to me before he and his mexicans left i should have stopped that man a long time ago goodnight said you didnt though lorena said he burned your cowboys despite you i wont take a chance with my children dont blame you goodnight said youve got a fine brood i like that talkative little boy he takes up for himself hes going to nebraska and so are the rest of them lorena said as soon as i can get them packed and on a train theyre going mox mox is a bad man mr goodnight hes not getting a chance to torment any of mine i thought all the mean wolves was about killed out in this country goodnight said i thought that man was dead or i would have stayed after him of course maybe he is dead maybe this manburner is somebody else i cant take that chance not with my children lorena said now my husbands gone too and its my fault he aint a killer and he has no business hunting killers with captain call not anymore goodnight felt a little uncomfortable after all he had urged the man to go though it was none of his business once again he wondered when he would ever learn not to meddle in other peoples business the woman was right pea eye was not a killer and had no business having to deal with a joey garza or a mox mox theres something else lorena said i think we ought to close the school until this ends if mox mox showed up he might burn all the children hes capable of ithe might pen us in and burn us all i wont risk it for my children or for anybodys what if i set a guard goodnight asked no lorena said if i had known he was alive id never have started the school when hes dead and i know it therell be time for studying and teaching but not until i know hes dead i better go myself and stop him then goodnight said that way when its done ill know its done and so will you let captain call do it lorena said im sure that sounds bold i have no right to give you orders ive no right even to make suggestions but you came here and asked what i knew and i told you i have seen that man and you havent if i were you id let captain call do it it was my men he burned goodnight said its my responsibility not calls lorena didnt respond she felt she had overstepped as it was by saying what she had said she thought she was right and had said what she felt besides part of her mind had already begun to occupy itself with the logistics of flight getting the childrens things together finding neighbors who might take their animals or hiring a helper to live in the house and look after things there was no time even to write clara lorena knew she would not draw an easy breath until the children were gone and safe clara would be surprised when five children got off the train expecting to live with her but lorena knew clara would take them since her daughters marriages clara had been too much alone anyway at least it seemed so from her letters having children in the house again might not be the worst thing for her i expect you think im too old to subdue the man goodnight said he was annoyed and surprised at his annoyance but the definite way the young woman had come down for call and not for him stirred something in goodnight the competitor perhaps or just the male in his long years as a pioneer he had always led no matter how long how difficult or how ugly the task he had always led he had been the man to do the job whatever that job was he was vain enough to think he was still the man who could do the job whatever it happened to be although his own vanity annoyed him too no youre not a killer lorena said i know you may have killed to survive but youre not a killer mox mox is a killer and so is captain call send a killer after a killer thats why i said it i wasnt thinking about your age besides people here need you she added this whole part of the country needs you youre the man who built the school and i know youve built others too you brought the doctor here you paid for the courthouse youre needed nobody needs captain call well the rich men need him goodnight said yes because hes a killer lorena said thats why they need him hes as hard as blue duck and hes as hard as mox mox hes got that other boy to catch first goodnight reminded her mr goodnight ive got to start packing lorena said standing up ive got to go to the school and dismiss my pupils theyll want to know why and im going to tell them then ive got to hunt up somebody to do the chores here for a while then ive got to pack i want to start for amarillo tonight i want my children out of here now youll be in a regular lather before you get all that done goodnight said i expect i could stop the train for you at quanah and ill send a wagon and a cowboy or two to help you get to the train much obliged lorena said and could you lend me a weapon all

nebraska goodnight said my children are going to nebraska im not lorena replied not going goodnight said why not maam youre the one he nearly burned i doubt that hes in six hundred miles of here but

your husband and bring him home none of your cowboys married him lorena said i married him hes a good man and i need him besides he wont mind anybody but me unless its the captain im going to go find him and hes going to mind me particularly now charles goodnight rarely quelled felt quelled this time he knew determination when he saw it he ceased to argue but he did promise to send two cowboys with a wagon to get her to the train at quanah as he was preparing to leave he told lorena he wanted to provide each of her boys with a horse when they returned i do like the way that talkative little boy takes up for himself he repeated dont forget to send me the gun lorena said i dont want to be going south without a gun riding to crow town across the empty land maria began to wish she would never have to arrive the happiest moments of her life had often been spent alone with her horse from the time of three legs she had always loved going away alone with her horse to avoid presidio and doniphan the hard sheriff she rode up the river for two days before crossing into texas she saw mule deer and antelope many antelope but no people it was cold and the north wind sang in her face at night she persuaded her spotted horseshe called him grasshopper because he had a way of suddenly springing sidewaysto lie down so she could sleep close to him and share his warmth twice she saw trains moving across the long plain the trains did not seem to be moving very fast no wonder joey could rob them the locomotives pulled only two or three cars they were just little trains moving slowly across the endless line of the horizon maria had ridden a train only once to go to her mother when her mother was dying it had rattled so badly that she had been unable to think grasshopper did not like the new country and he shied at many things once a tumbleweed surprised him and he bucked a few times maria was amused that he was so skittish she didnt think he could throw her she enjoyed it when grasshopper was naughty he was irritated with her for bringing him so far from the cornfield but he obediently lay down at night so maria would be warm as she rode east through the sage and the thin chaparral maria wondered about herself why was she traveling so far for a boy who didnt care about anyone but himself she should just let joey go there was a hopelessness in what she was doing and maria felt it strongly she should stay at home and help rafael and teresa for they were loving children with them even though they were damaged she could be happy as a mother and they could be happy too but joey was different he would not yield her even a moment of affection she wondered if he blamed her for juan castro and for the fact that he had been sold to the apaches it seemed to maria remembering before that time that joey had been a good boy he played with other children and she could tease him and hug him but when joey came back there was no touching him and he never smiled unless he was looking at himself in the mirror maria wondered if it was wrong to blame the change in joey on the apaches perhaps the coldness had been in him earlier perhaps it came from her grandfather a cold old man who did not speak a word to his wife marias grandmother for seven years because he blamed her for the death of their first son what was in joey could have come from that old man maria rode on toward crow town across the great empty texas plain when she came to the pecos with its steep banks she followed it north for two days before she could find the courage to cross it since the time when the lawmen tied her to the mule and almost drowned her in the rio grande she had had a fear of water that she could not control but she knew that crow town was east of the pecos she would have to cross it somewhere as she rode along fearing the river maria felt her motherhood to be a cold chain linking her to joey who wanted nothing from her and had no love for her or interest in her if she drowned crossing the pecos joey might not ever know and might not care if he did know why did she think she had to risk the water in order to warn him that the famous lawman was coming after him was it only because she had given birth to him did that mean she could never be quit of the pain of such a son would her obligation always be so hard and so unredeemed grasshopper did not like the pecos either every time she found a cut in the brushy banks and tried to force him down it he balked sulked whirled tried to resist because maria was so frightened herself she let the spotted horse defeat her several times they went on up the plain following the west bank of the river the cold was deepening ever deepening the clouds were gray like the sage grass maria awoke so stiff with cold that she could hardly mount in the mornings the chaparral thorns were white with frost and the water in the pecos was black from cold one morning maria decided to cross she felt that if she didnt cross that day she would give up and stop trying to be a good mother to joey and go home it might be for the sake of her fathers memory and her brothers that she was coming to warn joey he might not care himself he might think he was a match for captain call he might even feel complimented that such a famous man had been summoned to kill him maria broke a limb off a dead mesquite tree to use as a whip rarely had she needed to strike her horse but this morning when he refused to take the water she beat him with all her strength until finally unable to turn in a narrow cutbank he made a convulsive plunge into the dark water it was so cold that maria feared she might pass out her fingers became too numb to hold the bridle she hung on to grasshoppers neck with both arms as he struggled out of the water and up the thin cut in the east bank on the whole journey she had not allowed herself a fire she did not feel it was wise to build a fire in the texans country a fire might bring her someone she didnt want it might bring her cowboys or killers or lawmen but this morning she built a fire in order not to freeze sleet began to blow and her clothes were wet she was so numb in her hands and feet that she thought she might die if she didnt get warm the air felt cold inside her when she breathed she broke off small limbs of mesquite and made herself a little fire while grasshopper grazed on the cold tufts of grass suddenly grasshopper threw up his head and neighed maria was too cold to stop him she knew there were wild horses in texas perhaps he had only neighed at one of them she had the revolver billy had given her in her saddlebags she got it out but her fingers were stiff from the cold water she might not be able to shoot well if she had to shoot then to her relief the old kickapoo famous shoes appeared out of the sleet he moved as always at his own gait a walk that was almost a trot famous shoes saw at once that maria was almost frozen he thought he had better make coffee fortunately maria had coffee and an old bent pot with her she was trembling from cold she had made a fire so small that it warmed only part of her when maria saw famous shoes making coffee she felt relieved the old man was peculiar he appeared and disappeared at whim but he was competent he had offered to take her deep into the madre once and hide her from the lawmen when they were being rough with her maria had refused his offer she would not be driven from her children by any lawmen if she ever had to go to the madre she would take rafael and teresa with her then grasshopper neighed again looking to the north where the sleet came from famous shoes saw marias concern and understood it there were many bad men in texas he gave her a cup of boiling coffee just holding the hot cup would make her hands feel better and the coffee would warm her insides i am traveling with pea eye famous shoes said his woman is going to teach me to read his horse is a little slow i was looking for a place to cross the river when i found you who is this man i dont know him maria said he is a friend of the captainyou remember famous shoes said the captain who hung my father maria asked that one famous shoes said now he is looking for joey did you know that why would i be here freezing where the texans could get me if i didnt know that maria said i am on my way to warn joey now you bring me one of the men who is going to kill him why didnt you let me freeze pea eye doesnt know you famous shoes assured her joey is in crow town anyway we didnt go there because if we had one of the bad men might have killed us the coffee made maria feel a lot warmer the tin cup was so hot she had to hold it with a part of her skirt or her hands would have burned when she realized what famous shoes was telling her she grew angry why are you bringing men to kill my son she asked i thought you were my friend i have been to the rio rojo famous shoes said i was looking for my grandfather but his spirit had wandered off i dont know where it lives i was coming to ojinaga to see you i thought you might have some corn then i met pea eye who is my old friend he doesnt know where he is going i dont want him to get sick so i am helping him i dont care if he gets sick i dont want him to kill my son maria said how far away is he he is a few miles north famous shoes said he wanted to sit by the fire and drink more coffee i came on to the river to find a crossing heres the crossingyou found it maria said go on across it and go away and take this killer with you dont be bringing killers to murder my son famous shoes felt irritated he had built up marias fire and made her coffee now she was demanding that he leave while she was talking telling him to leave he remembered something that had almost gone out of his mind while he was traveling seeing the track of mox mox thesnakeyoudonotsee had made his mind too busy to work properly as he was nearing the pass of the north famous shoes had gone to see old goat woman she was a woman who had the power to see ahead to the future maria knew her when her mother had been dying in agua prieta she had gone to see old goat woman to find out how long her mother might live goat woman went to the river and caught frogs and read their guts famous shoes found it strange that the guts of frogs could show the future but he knew it was true old goat woman had been right too many times she lived with her goats in a little dwelling of sticks not far from the river famous shoes always went to see her when he traveled through the pass of the north it was good to stay in contact with people who could see ahead when she had a great need to see far ahead not just a day or a week or a month but years goat woman didnt rely on frogs she killed one of her own goats and read its guts what she had told him on this visit was that marias son would kill maria unless someone killed him soon goat woman had seen this in the guts of a frog and had become so worried that she killed one of her own goats to check the information but the guts of the frog and the guts of the goat agreed marias son would kill her goat woman liked maria she had known and liked marias mother too she did not like the news the guts gave her famous shoes didnt like it either he wasnt even sure he believed it although he knew goat woman had strong powers you might be wrong he suggested we are all wrong sometimes maybe the guts are trying to fool you maybe goat woman said do they ever try to fool you famous shoes asked no goat woman replied but sometimes i get confused and dont see what is plain can anything change the future famous shoes asked he rarely got a chance to talk to goat woman who knew about many things he would like to understand yes the stars goat woman said the stars can change the future but i dont think theyll change it for maria now he was actually with maria who was wet and cold beside the pecos he knew what old goat woman knew and maria didnt although it concerned marias own death she didnt want him to take the killers to her son but if he didnt do it and do it quickly her son might kill her it was a dilemma that made his mind tired usually the sleet freshened him but this morning he did not seem very fresh he didnt know what to do maria was warming up and as she grew warmer she also grew more and more angry she had been grateful to the old man for saving her from freezing but when she discovered that he was leading captain calls deputy she stopped being grateful she wanted the old man to take the deputy far away i want you to go maria said this deputy might show up any time if he sees me here alone he will figure it out and tell the captain the captain will figure it out anyway famous shoes said i cant fool him hes the captain all he does is kill men maybe but you dont need to help him maria said let him catch joey himself if he can all right i will leave famous shoes said very annoyed thank you for your help with the coffee now go away maria said i dont want this man to see me i have to help my son if you are in juarez you should see goat woman famous shoes said he was outraged he had kept the woman from freezing and now she was sending him away all because of a boy who would kill her someday she didnt seem to understand that he was old and had to make a living also he wanted badly to learn about the tracks in books pea eyes woman might teach him if he stayed with pea eye and brought him home but he couldnt say much to maria without revealing what he had heard from old goat woman next time you cross this river you need to build a bigger fire he said then he remembered the tracks near agua prieta thesnakeyoudonotsee is alive he said you need to be careful dont let him get you and burn you thesnakeyoudonotsee maria asked she remembered hearing that there was such a man and that he was evil but she didnt know much about him famous shoes turned back up the river to find pea eye it was a nuisance he had been happy to see maria when he found her soaking wet and freezing but she had been disagreeable and had made him feel confused if he took captain call to joey garza it might save her life but if he took the captain to joey maria would hate him although joey was a bad son and meant his mother no good it was a confusion that he didnt know whether to mention to pea eye he would have to think about it when he found him maria stayed by the fire until she was dry she thought at one point that she saw a rider to the north perhaps it was the man famous shoes was with pea eye she didnt know what to do she thought she might try to slip away quickly on grasshopper but then she lost sight of the manif it had been a man she wasnt quite sure she had seen him perhaps it had only been an antelope the air was still full of sleet and it was hard to see clearly very far no rider appeared so maria wrapped up in her poncho and made her way into the sandhills toward crow town the sleet rattled on the chaparral bushes but soon over the rattling she heard the sound of crows and began to see them sitting on the cold bushes or in the little skinny black mesquite trees the crows cawed at her as she rode grasshopper didnt like it he would have liked to go away from the crows but maria wouldnt let him soon there were crows all around them in the trees and in the air as she got closer to the settlement the wheeling gliding crows seemed thicker than the sleet the settlement when she came to it was just a few bumps on the plain there were several low houses none of them much higher than the hills of sand smoke rose into the air mixing with the sleet rising high with the crows joeys house was easy to find because his black horse grazed behind it hobbled to a long rope there was not much to graze on just a few little sage bushes and a tuft or two of grass the horse lifted its head when it saw grasshopper the two horses had met the last time joey was in ojinaga the black horse neighed and when he did a chubby young mexican woman came out the door when she saw maria she quickly retreated a second later a white woman came out the woman was shivering she wore only a thin housecoat but she waited politely for maria to speak is my son here maria asked she did not dismount joey garza she said in case the woman was stupid and could not think who her son might be joey yes beulah said hes here but he aint awake wake him and tell him his mother is here maria said i have some news he needs to know you can come in i aint going to wake him beulah said he dont like it when people wake him up maria got off grasshopper and pushed into the little house the white woman had a smell it must not be easy to wash in such a place where there was much sand and little water maria thought she did not look like a bad woman the white woman she was not young and she was frightened inside two fat mexican girls sat on a pallet trying to huddle under one blanket there was another room the low door to it was shut but maria pushed it open joey her boy was asleep under many blankets the room was dim she could just see joeys face a young face so young that for a moment she saw him merely as her son the child she had borne the child she loved he was still only a young boy perhaps it was not too late to save him to help him become decent joey wake up you need to leave she said touching his shoulder joey did wake up and the moment he looked at her the hope that had been rising in maria sank again and vanished there was only bottomless cold in joeys eyes this is my room i dont like women in here joey said get out maria felt anger surge up she wanted to deliver the slap that would make him good or at least make him realize he was in danger she had ridden five days and crossed the freezing river for him and all he had for her was a look that was as cold as the black waters of the pecos it was not a thing she could take patientlynot from her own child goddamn you leave maria yelled slapping him get up and leave theyve sent the great killer for you call go down into the madre and go quick or youll be dead you leave joey said dont come where youre not invited and dont hit me again youre a stupid woman youve ridden all this way to tell me what i already knew i know about captain call you dont know about him maria said you just know the name he took my father he took my brother now he will take my son and its because my son is stupid so stupid he thinks he cant die no old gringo will kill me and no old gringo will make me run to the madre either joey replied then youre dead if you think that way maria told him i will go home and tell your brother and sister that you died they love you even though you dont care about them youll tell them a lie then joey said i wont die call will die if he comes here hell die before he even knows that his death is coming maria turned away she went back to the room where the three women waited uneasily she saw that they were all frightened the two fat girls and the tired smelly woman is there any man here he listens to she asked is there anyone who can make him listen john wesley hardin if its anybody beulah said john wesleys killed all those people i think joey likes him but john wesleys crazy i dont care where is he maria asked he never sleeps i guess hes in the saloon beulah said she felt afraid of the mexican woman her eyes were angry when she came in from the storm her dress and her hair had been covered with sleet but she hadnt seemed to care she had walked in and awakened joey which nobody did maybe the woman was his mother maybe she wasnt but in the eyes of the three women she was scary gabriela was so scared she wanted to hide under her blanket marieta was too cold to care she shivered and sniffled not many women came to crow town a woman who appeared out of an ice storm might be a witch woman maria left the house her head was hurting she felt she might be feverish from almost freezing in the black water in her fever she could not control her thoughts she didnt know where captain call was but in her mind he was close so close that he might come and kill joey that very day if she didnt do something quickly she saw smoke coming from the roof of another low lumpy building maybe that was the cantina a row of crows sat on the roof of the building the row went all the way around the low roof now and again a crow would fly up wheel come back to the building and take its place in the row when the crows flapped their wings a little rain of sleet fell from their feathers maria heard a snort and looked around to see a large pig following her the pig was the color of sand she had the pistol that billy williams had insisted she take she took the pistol and pointed it at the pig the pig was not just large it was giant marias hands felt a little warmer she was in a better state to shoot than she had been back when famous shoes showed up the pig snorted again but it didnt charge her she had seen pigs charge people in ojinaga when the pigs were angry for some reason she didnt know whether the great sandy pig was angry or when it might charge her the pig stopped and looked at her but again it didnt charge maria turned and trudged on toward the cantina it was hard to walk the sand seemed to fill the street there were no horses outside the cantina though maria saw a glow under the uneven wooden door perhaps the wild man was there in the cantina the man joey might listen to when she was almost to the cantina she heard the great pig snort again and when she turned it was trotting toward her without thinking she pointed the pistol at the pig and shot she wanted to scare it away and she knew sometimes loud noises frightened pigs when the church bell rang in ojinaga the pigs and goats became nervous for a bit she did not expect to hit the pig with the sleet blowing she had not shot a pistol since benitos time he had enjoyed shooting and would let her shoot with him although he was stingy about bullets and did not want to let a woman use too many of them to marias surprise the big pig slid forward on its snout almost at her feet then it rolled over a great hill of hair and some blood ran out its nose she waited for the pig to get up one of its legs was twitching then it stopped the giant pig was dead the door to the cantina opened and two men stepped out one was skinny and had scabs on his face the other was an older man and he limped both looked taken aback the great pig lay dead and a woman with sleet in her hair stood over it with a pistol in her hand the scabby man was not pleased the older man just looked surprised you killed our pigwhat kind of wild slut are you the scabby man asked im joeys mother maria said if youre his friend i would ask you to tell him to leave and go to the madre captain call is coming i dont know where he is but i think hes close how close wesley hardin asked i dont know his deputy is over by the river maria answered famous shoes is taking him to meet call that old indian ought to be shot wesley hardin said she kilt the devil pig red foot said i cant believe it hundreds of people have shot at that pig now this woman just walks into town and shoots the sonofabitch dead i guess the killer instinct runs in the family wesley hardin said its too damn breezy to stand out here worrying about a dead pig he looked hard at maria she thought he looked crazy he reminded her of old ramon when he was in one of his fits come on inside but ill take the gun wesley hardin said reaching for marias pistol she drew back why do you want my gun she asked i dont like to be inside small buildings with women who shoot pistols thats why wesley hardin said you just killed the local pig you might do the same to me if i get unruly not if youll help my son maria said the man was still reaching for her gun and she still drew back no thanks i live for myself john wesley replied captain call will kill him maria said for all you know he might kill you too no they aint paying him for me theyre just paying him for your boy wesley hardin said calls economical he dont kill just anybody that needs killing he just kills when hes paid then he grew enraged his splotchy face turned red and white its too damn cold to be standing in the wind give me the gun and come in if you want to discuss your son if i come in it will be with my gun maria said the scabby man seemed to lose interest in taking her pistol from her he looked again at the dead pig i wish there was some way we could charge people that want to come and look at this pig you killed he said shivering he kicked the pig a time or two his boots had holes in them maria could see his toe through one of the holes these texans are superstitious he said they think this pig was the devil i could have killed it years ago and i would have too if it had ever bothered me i figured it was more interesting to let it live so people would have something to be scared of maria followed him into the low building no more was said about taking her pistol there seemed to be a thin trail of blood leading into the cantina yet the dead pig lay outside in the sand the cantina smelled of tobacco spit and whiskey the limping man had his boot off the trail of blood had come from his foot the man did not look well he was shaking and his sock was soaked with blood whats wrong with his foot maria asked i stomped it the sonofabitch is a card cheat wesley hardin replied whats the news other than that woodrow call is on his way to crow town thesnakeyoudonotsee is alive maria said famous shoes saw his track oh mox mox hardin said he wont bother me im meaner than he is its bad news for anyone else who crosses his path though hes meaner than most folks maria saw him looking at her as a man looks although she was dirty from her ride she was glad she had kept her gun theres a bed in that corner wesley hardin said pointing come crawl in it with me maria thought she should have known that was what he wanted when he invited her into the cantina killers she had known had not wanted women much their interest was in other things as joeys was she said nothing but she was glad she had her gun youre a fine one hardin said you come in here and kill our best pig and you ask me to help your killer son but you wont crawl in bed with me even though i asked you polite have you got some old punch you bed down with down in mexico maria remembered that billy williams had warned her about crow town it had been foolish for her to bother the killer at all she didnt know why she had thought he might help a dollar and a quarter then wesley hardin asked red can pay you he owes me money if he wants to throw in seventyfive cents for himself he can have the second turn and youll be two dollars richer before you even eat breakfast maria turned and walked out the door the killer gave her a hot look but he didnt follow he was shuffling cards she walked past the dead pig and went to joeys house when she pushed inside her feet and hands were cold although it had only been a short walk the woman who smelled was crying and so were the two girls the door to joeys room was open he was gone and so was his rifle maria ran out of the house hoping he was still in sight maybe he would at least let her ride with him for a while out of the bad town but joey wasnt in sight and neither was grasshopper joey was gone and he had stolen her horse maria felt that she must be the most foolish mother in the world to ride so far in the winter into the place of the texans for such a boy now she was afoot and tired in a town where the men were hard call was coming and thesnakeyoudonotsee was somewhere around maria began to weep at her own folly she knew her son she should never have given him a chance to steal her horse now she was really in trouble she remembered the killers hot look she would have to cross the cold river again to get back home and this time she would have no horse to warm her at night did he say anything when he left she asked the white woman once both of them had stopped crying maybe he just went to hunt antelope she added he didnt say nothing he dont usually say nothing in the morning beulah said i didnt want to make him mad so i didnt ask he gets real mad if you ask yes he thinks somebody crowned him king maria said do you have any food i could take the white woman looked hopeless we dont have no food she said her face was streaked with tears she too had made a mistake in coming to crow town maria thought probably this white woman had made many mistakes now she wasnt young she smelled bad and she was in a bad place with no food it would not be easy for her or for the fat girls either im going to mexico do you want to go home with me maria asked the two girls if the three of them traveled together it might be warmer then she remembered the pig she had killedthere was her food the girls were very young they looked scared we dont have nobody in mexico gabriela said her sister seemed numb she wouldnt speak we dont have nobody here either we dont have nobody do you know anybody with a horse we could borrow maria asked i killed the pig but he is too big i cant drag him i can butcher him but i cant drag him i need a horse for a little while at home she had always done the butchering whether of pigs or of goats none of her husbands were good at it benito wouldnt even try to butcher he hated blood and butchering would have made him sick then in the end he was butchered himself and hung like a carcass his own blood draining ill get reds horse beulah said he dont feed it much i dont know if it can drag a pig then beulah realized what maria had said she had killed the pig she had killed the pig the devil pig she killed the pig beulah told the girls she killed the pig the girls looked stunned they had both feared the pig particularly when they had to go into the bushes the pig watched them it liked their droppings marieta couldnt grasp it she thought the woman must be a witch to be able to kill the great pig maria went with beulah to get the horse she hitched it to a rope tied to the pigs feet and urging the skinny horse dragged the pig slowly to joeys house the horse was afraid of the dead pig and kept shying and flaring its nostrils it would have liked to run but hitched to the pig there was no way for it to run there was no tree to hoist the pig but maria didnt care she wanted the blood it would be easier to get if she hoisted the pig but she couldnt she found a knife in the house she sharpened it on a rock as best she could and let the pigs blood drain into a rusty bucket it was not easy to handle so much blood maria finally found three buckets and filled them all with the pigs blood she took the liver and the sweetbreads and then began to cut the meat into strips the blood was still warm and soon she was covered with it the white woman and the two girls got excited at the thought of so much meat some of the other women in the village heard that the pig was dead and came to watch the butchering two of them were old mexican women whose men had worked for the railroad until they died they lived in crow town because they were too old and too weak to go anywhere but they knew about making jerky and they had better knives than the one maria had found she told them they could have meat for there was far too much to carry on her journey the wind got colder but the women were excited at the thought of the meat also their great enemy the pig was dead and they would eat him they were all covered with blood at one point john wesley hardin came to the place where the butchering was taking place and stood looking at the excited bloody women for a few minutes he said nothing he just looked the womens arms were black with blood as they cut deeper and deeper into the carcass of the great pig the women were so hungry that they sliced bits of liver and sweetbreads and ate them raw maria didnt care she wanted only to get her jerky and start back for ojinaga she missed her children rafael and teresa she knew she would not be able to smoke the jerky very well it would be half raw but it would keep her from starving as she walked home by the end of the morning every woman in crow town was behind joeys house helping maria finish butchering the giant pig all of them carried off meat and then came back and helped maria smoke hers over a little fire they were beaten women none of them young only gabriela and marieta were young most of the women were old within sight of their deaths they had been thrown aside by their men or their men had died leaving them in this bad place too spiritless to move on all of them even the oldest had sold themselves or tried to the men who passed through crow town now they were excited and not just by the meat the pig had frightened them all he had made their dreams bad made them scared when they had to squat in the bushes they had seen the pig eating dead men on hog hill they knew that when they died the pig would eat them too nobody would care enough about them to bury them deep enough and the pig could even root up corpses that were buried deep but now the tables had been turned and it was all thanks to maria she had arrived out of the storm and had killed their enemy the great pig they had wet their arms with his blood eaten raw bites of his liver and waded in his guts which spilled from his belly and spread over the ground when maria opened it an old comanche woman whose husband had been shot by blue duck many years before knew how to strip the guts she sliced the long white pig gut into footlong sections stripping what was in them into a bucket dont eat that there could be people in it parts of people beulah said she had never liked the old comanche woman whose name was naiche old naiche was a tiny wizened woman she stood up to her shins in the pig guts merrily pulling up stretches of gut cutting off sections and stripping the sections into her bucket beulah knew the pig must have parts of people in its intestines it sickened her that old naiche would fill a bucket with the contents of the guts as the women worked the men of the town came in ones and twos to watch the spectacle none of them said anything they stood in the wind watching the bloody women cut meat though she continued to work maria kept one eye on the men they were all watching her and their eyes were hostile she knew she would have to leave crow town that night as soon as she had enough jerky to see her home she was a new woman the men who watched her cut the pig were tired of the women they had if they had any at all their women were worn out except for the two mexican girls they were all women whose hearts had died within them they were broken and they didnt care what men did to them anymore men had used them until they had used them up the women were excited that the pig was dead but their excitement would be brief in the next day or two days or a week they would just be broken women again maria knew the men would be after her soon they would be angry because she had stirred up their women most men didnt like women to be stirred up about a dead pig or about anything life was much easier when women were broken when they didnt dare express a feeling whether happy or sad it was not something to question it was just how men were by the middle of the gray cold afternoon the work was finished there was nothing left of the great feral pig except its hide its hooves and its bones old naiche had even taken its eyes she dropped them into a bucket with the strippings from the guts and hobbled off to her small hovel with them then she came back and got an armful of the sections of gut she had cut the plentitude of guts made old naiche happy it reminded her of the buffalo times long before when she had often waded in piles of guts in the late afternoon as the winter sun was setting the sleet turned to snow maria felt a bitterness growing in her toward joey her son he had sneered at the trouble she had gone to warning him and then he had stolen her horse she had not expected thanks when she journeyed to crow town joey did not thank people for nothing they did made him grateful but she had not supposed he would steal her horse and leave her on foot in such a place in the winter among texans it was a cruel thing it made her wonder if her son wished her dead it was a long way back to ojinaga and there were many perils with grasshopper she stood a better chance without a horse it would be very difficult she might freeze or she might be taken by men who would be rough with her there were horses in crow town maria had seen five or six some of the men who came to watch the butchering were mounted but maria had no money and could not buy a horse if she stole one and they caught her she would be hung that was for sure they would hang her when they caught her if there were no trees they would stretch her between two horses until her neck broke or she strangled she had seen the federales hang men that way they had stretched benitos brother raul between two horses they had pulled so hard that they almost pulled rauls head off a mexican hanging the texans called it although they used it too if they were too far from a tree maria decided to walk that way she could at least hide in the sage she searched joeys room to see if she could find anything useful she thought he might have left some money but there was no money gabriela and marieta tried to stop her from searching for they were scared of joey he dont like nobody to be in his room marieta said hell beat you when he comes back i can beat too maria said all she could find to take was one blanket and a good knife she wrapped all the meat she could carry in a sack while she was packing the women of crow town began to crowd into the house all were wearing what coats they had all carried parcels of meat only old naiche didnt come beulah had put on her coat too marieta and gabriela had not dressed warmly they looked scared beulah spoke for the women we want to go when you go she said we dont want to stay here were all going to die if we stay here you might die harder if you go with me maria warned she did not want to lead the women across the bad land between crow town and mexico the meat would not last she had only three bullets left for her pistol the women did not look strong they would freeze or starve or drown or give up her statement had been the truth dying in crow town would not be good but dying in the borderlands in winter might be worse at least in crow town there would be shelter then she remembered the railroad it was only two days walk south or a little more the women might make it to the railroad then maybe a train would stop for them she had seen two trains she didnt know what made trains stop but she thought that maybe a train would stop for the women if they waved at the men who drove the train it was a hope at least maria could understand that the women did not want to die in crow town it was not a good place the crows flew through the snow or walked in it three sat on the bare ribs of the great pig as the cold deepened the cawing of the crows seemed to grow louder maria felt feverish she would have liked to rest in joeys bed for a day or a night but she was afraid if the men caught her they would not care that she was feverish they might tie her and keep her until she became like the other women in the town her heart might die within her as their hearts had maria couldnt risk that her children needed her even now she worried that billy williams wouldnt take care of them well enough rafael might be growing thin for sometimes he forgot to eat teresa was careless sometimes and burned herself on the stove what if she had burned herself badly who would hold her in the night and help her with the pain i will take you to the railroad if you will try to keep up maria said thats the best i can do i have to leave you at the railroad and go home to my children when the time came to leave marieta and gabriela wept they had no warm clothes they didnt want to go my feet freeze even when im in the house marieta said i dont want to walk in the snow i want to wait for joey gabriela said he dont have no one else to help him joey thinks shes pretty marieta said she was bitter that her sister had been favored she didnt like joey anymore but her feet got very cold just sitting in the house someone had told her that if your feet froze they had to be cut off she was afraid that if she went with the woman her feet would freeze the person who told her what happened to frozen feet was red foot who sometimes visited her he would only pay her a dime but it was a dime at least red foot liked to be behind her she could hear him panting in her ear like a dog he said frozen feet had to be sawed off with a saw me and gabriela we better stay marieta said dont be weak maria said the two girls were just girls not too much older than her own girl she didnt want to leave them to the rough men if she had to take the women she would take the girls too these men will use you till youre sick maria said i will wrap your feet so they wont freeze while the girls sat looking scared she cut up sacks and wrapped their feet in many layers she found an old pair of chaps that had worn thin and used the leather to make tight wrappings around the sacks she didnt think the girls would freeze for the worst cold didnt come with snow when maria was ready all the women looked scared it was dark and the snow was still blowing some of the women wanted to wait until morning but maria wouldnt hear of it do you want a parade she asked angrily she had enough responsibilities without these women balking you know what we are to these men she said look between your legsthats what we are thats why they even let us be alive do you think they will let us all walk off and not do something about it then she thought of old naiche she was indian comanche probably the women had not asked her to go when maria inquired several of the women claimed not to know where old naiche lived finally beulah told her maria went through the snow to the little hovel of dirt and branches where naiche lived the shelter was made of thin mesquite branches bent together at the top there were many spaces between the mesquite limbs but old naiche had covered them with some of the rotten buffalo hides it was a flimsy dwelling so low that maria had to go almost to her hands and knees to get through the opening the wind sang through the small smoky room but naiche didnt seem to mind she sat with her bucketful of strippings and her armful of guts now and then she would dip into the bucket and nibble from the squeezings of the dead pig i dont see well no more naiche said when maria stooped low and came in too much smoke were leaving you should come with us maria said i will take you to the railroad its not a long walk this is not a good place for a woman old naiche shook her head the train dont have no place to take me to she said all my people are dead they are not all dead maria replied billy williams says there are many of your people in the territory the train could take you to them if you will get up and come with me no there are only whites in the world now old naiche said i have all this food you got it for me i want to stay here and eat this food bring it ill help you carry it maria said she knew it was no use trying to save a woman as old as naiche but she wanted to try the women of crow town were too sad even with her eyes half gone from smoke the old comanche woman had more life left in her than any of them she didnt seem discouraged to be living in a small hovel made of mesquite sticks with rotten buffalo hides to cover it and protect her from the cold breath of the norther come try maria said i dont know what will become of you if i leave you here with these men i dont worry about these men naiche said look ill show you what i have she bent and began to dig with her hands by the little fire this fire dont go out she said as she was digging i only let it go out in the summer when it is hot when the norther comes i let the fire burn so my scorpions wont freeze naiche uncovered a pit so near the fire that the glow of the coals lit it maria looked in and saw that the pit was full of scorpions she didnt like scorpions she didnt count but there were many scorpions in naiches little pit and also a few of the long centipedes with the red legs old naiche had made a roof over the pit with little sticks and a badger skin to cover it and keep the scorpions in when they sting me it dont hurt naiche said if men are bad i will go around and put scorpions in their clothes i did it to old tommy because he stole my tobacco when he was drunk i put three scorpions in his pants and they stung him where he is a man old naiche grinned she had few teeth maria too was amused at the old womans vengeance and her cleverness in keeping a pit of scorpions near her fire billy had once told her that the apaches sometimes kept scorpions because they needed their poison are you apache maria asked thinking she had made a mistake about naiches tribe no but i was given to an apache naiche said i lived in the bosque redondo but i didnt like it i ran away run away again maria said i will take you to my home i have two children who are damaged my girl is blind and my boy cannot think too well come to my home and i will take care of you well leave the others at the railroad but you can come to mexico with me but again naiche shook her head my time is coming she said it will come when i finish this food you gave me i do not want to go away and miss it when you miss your time then you cannot rest besides i like the crows naiche added i have one that comes to my house and tells me secrets that is why i know i have to stay here and wait for my time she is up there now my crow maria had no more time she saw that she could not persuade the old woman and she needed to be far from town with the other women when morning came maybe if it was still snowing the men would be too lazy to follow the women that was her hope and her only hope the women she was taking away were ugly dirty and weary but they still had the places between their legs the men wouldnt like losing those places maybe they would pursue them and maybe they wouldnt but maria had to go and go at once i will give you this advice she said to naiche do not put your scorpions on the killer with scabs in his hair he dont care about women he will sting you worse than you sting him old naiche didnt answer she looked into the smoke the smoke that had ruined her eyes again she dipped her hand into the bucket of strippings from the pigs guts maria crept out the snow had stopped which made her fearful she had to hurry and she had to get the women moving several crows sat on top of old naiches hut maria wondered which one was the crow that had told the old woman secrets she wondered but she did not have time to find out the snow had stopped she had to get the women and the two scared girls and go when mox mox and his seven men rode into crow town he made the men ride their horses back and forth over old naiches little brush shelter trampling her to death at first the horses shied and didnt want to crash through the shelter mox mox pointed to a sandhill about one hundred yards away go to the top of it and blindfold them shittin horses he instructed head them for this brush and keep on spurring old naiche heard while the men were blindfolding the horses she tried to crawl out but mox mox was waiting for her with his leaded quirt he quirted her in the face until she gave up she crawled back into her hut and waited for the hooves to bring her darkness soon she heard the horses coming hard the crows began to caw naiche tried to be ready but she had begun to feel regret for not going with maria it was a sharp regret so sharp it made it hard for her to be ready but the horses were coming hard whether or not she was ready naiche clawed open her little pit and dug quickly with one hand into her scorpions and centipedes she raked a handful of them up and shoved them under her blanket perhaps one of them would bite thesnakeyoudonotsee the horses were closer naiche still had scorpions in her hand when they crashed through the branches of mesquite the hooves did not immediately bring her death though they broke both her hips and crushed one hand shes still stirringride again mox mox said the seven men wheeled their horses and rode again and again because they couldnt see the horses were frightened soon the men stopped racing they merely spurred their mounts causing them to jump into the broken branches the rotten buffalo robes were soon kicked away the mesquite branches broken i guess that will teach her hergardt said he was german the largest of the seven men he was also by common consent the dumbest hergardt was so dumb he often put his boots on the wrong feet he was strong and would pull his boots on without looking as easily as most people pull on socks later he would wonder why his feet hurt hergardt rode a big bay horse the other men dismounted and began to pile the broken mesquite limbs into a pyre but hergardt kept riding his horse back and forth over the body of old naiche what will it teach her mox mox asked him looking at the body of the dead woman a hoof had broken her neck i could cook you for a week and it wouldnt make you smart mox mox said being burnt just teaches you that youre burnt mox mox had found hergardt in san francisco when he returned from his years on the sea he had gone to sea to escape goodnight who had pursued him all the way to the great salt lake mox mox knew he could not go back to the southwest for a while goodnight had been too persistent mox mox put out the story of his death at the hands of the ute and went to sea for seven years hergardt was making his living as a wrestler when mox mox docked in san francisco he wrestled all comers for a dollar a bout mox mox began to promote him and soon had the price up to ten dollars a bout although hergardt was far from invincible many smaller quicker men beat him you deserve to be burnt but it wouldnt teach you nothing mox mox observed stop riding over her shes dead its time to light the fire jimmy jimmy cumsa lit the branches he was a cherokee boy from missouri very quick in his movements almost too quick in mox moxs view mox mox liked to have a sense of how his men worked together if there was a fight six of them he could keep up with but jimmy cumsaquick jimmy they called himwas so swift that mox mox could seldom anticipate him he would see jimmy in front of him one minute and the next minute jimmy would be behind him watching you burn people would teach me something mox jimmy said it would teach me not to stay around you too long you been around me for a year what keeps you if you dont like my ways mox mox asked jimmy cumsa didnt answer he was watching the hut burn the old womans thin garments began to burn too he knew it irritated mox mox when he didnt answer a question but jimmy cumsa didnt care he did not belong to mox mox and didnt have to answer questions jimmy was careful of mox mox but he was not afraid of him he had confidence in his own speed as a rider as a runner and as a pistol shot he was not an especially good pistol shot but he was so fast it fooled people scaring many of them into firing wildly or doing something else dumb that would cause them to lose the fight mox mox killed short people because they reminded him of himselfthat was jimmy cumsas theory he killed tall people because he envied them he could be a killer but he could never be tall he could never be blond because he had red hair and he could never look you straight in the eye because one of his eyes was pointed wrong it looked out of his head at an angle mox mox hated being short regretted that smallpox had scarred his face and was sorry that he was not blond but the thing he hated most about himself was his crookedlooking eye his greatest most elaborate cruelties were reserved for people with wellset bright blue eyes when mox mox caught such a person male or female he tended to do the worst things to the eyes if the person with the perfect blue eyes was tall and blond then so much the worse for him or her jimmy cumsa wondered if fire was so hot that even dead people could feel it burning them he had seen corpses twitch while mox mox was burning them it seemed to jimmy that might mean even the dead had some feelings enough feelings that they could respond to the heat of a fire mox mox had probably killed the old comanche woman because she was short she was about the same height as mox mox himself burning flesh smelled sweetthat was a fact soon learned if you rode with mox mox it didnt matter why he had killed the old woman she was definitely dead the flimsy branches of her little hovel didnt make much of a funeral flame she wasnt going to be burned very completely jimmy knew that mox mox didnt seem to be paying much attention to this fire or to the old womans burning most likely that was because she was dead and couldnt scream and plead when people screamed and pleaded mox mox got icy cool he was like the sleet at such times never once had he spared a person he wanted to burn not since jimmy had ridden with him it didnt matter how loudly they pleaded or how much money they offered him peon got off his horse and began to piss into the flames peon was another runt a little taller than mox mox but not much he had grown up in a swamp in mississippi and he slunk along looking furtive and dirty like some old swamp dog the two mexicans were anxious to get the burning over with so they could go to the cantina and drink oteros kept looking at the horizon as if he expected to see a posse coming for him with their hang ropes out oteros was not afraid of mox mox either he was with him because he admired his business sense he had met mox mox in jail in san luis obispo mox mox was about to be hung for killing a boy oteros had very long arms and managed to reach out of his cell with one of his long arms and catch the jailer as the man was walking past with a plate of beans for an old bank robber who was being kept in the jail oteros held firmly to the jailers collar until he could get his pistol and beat his head in mox mox got the jailers keys and the two of them left oteros had been with mox mox ever since i dont like these crows oteros said why did we come here there are too many laws in texas he means lawmen peon said he understood oteros and liked him although oteros was the most violent of the seven men and as likely to kill friend as foe when his temper was up as it often was he thinks there are too many lawmen in texas he repeated in case mox mox missed his point there may be too many lawmen in texas but theres still too many apaches in new mexico mox mox said id rather fight any lawman in the world than some old apache with one eye and a weak bow id kill the lawman but the oneeyed apache would probably kill me you but not me oteros said i have killed many indians and i will kill more if i see any go kill goodnight if you want to kill a tough old wolf mox mox said the sonofabitch chased me a thousand miles and hed do it again if he knew i was alive well hell find out if we come over here and start cooking people jimmy cumsa said we wont be cooking too many until goodnight is dead mox mox said i do want to kill that mexican boy who robbed those trains with the payrolls on them weve robbed three trains and aint took a payroll yet that boys beating us to the money if we could take a payroll we could hire enough men to clean out a state a state jimmy asked you want to kill all the people in a whole state i never knew you had that kind of ambition mox which one would you take if you was to take a state peon asked mox mox had given no detailed thought to the conquest of a state hed merely been reflecting on the army he could raise if he had a million dollars to spend it was rumored in juarez that the garza boy had taken a million dollars in payroll money off the trains he had robbed i might take wyoming mox mox said i could take it and be governor of it then id hang all the dirty sonsabitches i didnt like there wouldnt be a soul left in the state if you hung all the people you didnt like jimmy cumsa said i dont notice that you like too many people mox i dont for a fact and youre getting to be a prime candidate for hanging yourself mox mox said sometimes quick jimmy let a little too much contempt leak into his voice when he spoke to his boss jimmy didnt like very many people himself but he paired up with pedro jones when they hit a town and decided to seek women pedro jones had a yankee father and a mother who came from far down in the indian country below the city of mexico by the ocean pedro carried a seashell with him in his saddlebags at night by the fire he would often sit holding the shell to his ear he liked to listen to the sea for he had grown up by it listening to its faint echo in the shell reminded him of a time when life had not been so harsh pedro had become a criminal by accident at a time when he lived in vera cruz he was very tight with his money and had begun to strangle the whores he went to see in order to save what they cost it seemed to him a reasonable practice there were many many whores in vera cruz and he had only strangled a few and beat in the heads of one or two more he had only killed the last few because of drink but the authorities had not accepted his excuses a whore who was in love with him helped him break out of jail and he went west across mexico and then north into arizona territory where mox mox found him pedro had killed an old woman who wanted to charge him too much for his supper old as she was the authorities still took offense so that pedro was forced to flee along the gila manuel had been in jail with pedro and fled with him when he escaped manuel was a simple horse thief who was too lazy to run as far as it was necessary to run when he stole horses from the gringos he stayed with mox mox and his gang because he didnt like traveling alone he thought mox moxs habit of burning people was repugnant and he always rode off a mile or two and tried to take a nap while the people screamed out their pain but he stayed with the gang because it eliminated the problem of being lazy and getting caught he could make fires and he could cook those were his main jobs with mox mox he was rarely asked to take much part in the killing and had been very reluctant to ride his horse over the hut of the old comanche woman although he had not known the woman personally it seemed to him dangerous to race seven horses at the same time and make them smash a hut even a small one running horses often fell anyway his own brother had his skull broken because a running horse had fallen in a rocky place with him on its back they say joey garza can shoot you from a mile jimmy cumsa said they say he dont miss i dont miss either mox mox said you miss because you dont aimyou just shoot if i hadnt adopted you i imagine youd have been plugged by now lets go find somebody who knows where this wild boys at i want to kill him before he takes any more payrolls away from us then well go get goodnight at the saloon oteros and manuel stayed outside pedro jones went in but came right back out he disliked low rooms peon went in hoping mox mox would buy him whiskey but mox mox didnt mention buying whiskey for anyone hergardt and jimmy cumsa also went inside hergardts head came within an inch of the ceiling when he straightened up a white man with a splotchy face a cripple and an irishman were in the saloon mox mox recognized john wesley hardin at once from photographs he had seen in newspapers seeing him in person was a surprise mox mox hadnt supposed he could walk into a saloon in the sandhills and come upon a famous man aint you hardin he asked feeling that he was addressing a peer mind your own business you crosseyed runt hardin said he had stepped outside and surveyed the gang briefly red foot had limped in and informed him that they were trampling old naiche to death well there goes the last woman he observed to patrick obrien this place has got the curse of doom upon it if i was you and had a business in a place like this id move it wes i just got a load of whiskey in last week patrick pointed out its the wrong time to move mox mox was so startled by john wesley hardins insulting reply that he didnt do a thing he took the other table and told the irishman to bring him whiskey there were only two chairs at his dirty little table and jimmy cumsa took the second chair jimmy was amused by the killers reply to mox mox such talk was music to his ears he had described mox mox exactly a crosseyed runt hergardt was left standing he didnt seem to mind or to notice but john wesley hardin noticed youre too big to be insidego outside and wait he said to hergardt or else sit down youre blocking the light i can scarcely see my cards there aint no chair for me hergardt informed him then sit on the floor you damn german wesley hardin said if you dont get out of my light youll soon be enjoying a few holes in your liver he pulled his revolver out of his belt and laid it on the table despite the insult that had been offered him mox mox found that he admired hardins temerity hardin was the most famous killer in the southwest after all finding a man who would say exactly what he pleased was a novelty and of course hardins reputation was far greater than his own hardin had the habit of killing and he had gone to prison for it and survived untamed mox mox decided to overlook the insult he wanted to get to know wesley hardin but more than that he wanted hardin to accept him as a peer being called a crosseyed runt was nothing new anyway in his years at sea when he was often the smallest man on the ship he had been called worse things the epithet was inaccurate of course his eyes didnt cross one was pointed at an angle to the other people who called him crosseyed were not very observant now be friendly hardin he said ive got seven men here and were after the garza boy as to that seven is not enough hardin said well counting me its eight mox mox said no you have to subtract the mexicans because they undoubtedly cant shoot wesley hardin informed him then you subtract this giant whos blocking my light and the reason you can subtract him is because im about to kill him if he dont sit down i wont stand for dim light i killed a blacksmith on that very spot a few days ago and he wasnt near as tall as this lunkhead and didnt block near as much light sit down gardt dont you hear mr hardin mox mox said going outside would be even better wesley hardin said that way i wouldnt have to look at three hundred pounds of stupidity while im trying to concentrate on my cards ill play you cards if youre shorthanded for a game jimmy cumsa said the man john wesley had a droll habit of speech if he had been offering employment jimmy would have accepted it on the spot there was little conversation to be had out of the present gang although pedro jones became garrulous at certain times i guess you would you goddamn cherokee hardin said or are you choctaw jimmy cumsa just looked at him the man had a surprisingly rough tongue he didnt seem to realize that he was badly outnumbered or else he just didnt care is the garza boy here mox mox asked with a man as unpredictable as john wesley it seemed best to come to the point he might fly off the handle and kill hergardt and gardt was useful when there were heavy things to lift the boy aint and whats more his mother aint either hardin said she came here and killed the big pig that was eating the corpses and then walked out of here with all the cunt except that old thing you just killed with your damn nags why that old comanche woman was too old to pester mox mox said old or not and comanche or not she was the last woman left in crow town and your action was unwelcome wesley hardin said we dont like strangers who trample our women youre a sonofabitch mox mox said respectful as he was of hardin he was beginning to be riled by his tone you must have run wild so long you dont realize you can be killed hardin said ive done been hung twice to the point where i passed out only they cut me down too soon i could be killed by a knife if it was stuck in my liver or my jugular i could be shot by a bullet and if it was thirtycaliber or heavier it would probably do the job and id be dead i could be bit by a snake that was filled with poison spit or i could ride under a lightning bolt or fall down drunk and split my head on a rock he paused but only to peer hard at a card that had come out of the deck he had just been shuffling that ace dont belong in this deck its got six or seven already he said laying the card aside what i doubt is that ill be killed by a damned squint like you or a choctaw boy or this damn ignorant anvil of a german you brought in hardin said maybe you ought to leave the anvil here he added considering hergardt for a moment we need a blacksmith and hes got the heft for it i wont kill him till he thinks it over he added in a charitable tone then youll never kill him because hell never think it over jimmy cumsa said gardt cant think and he couldnt shoe a horse if he had a week he cant even shoe himself mox mox said well if hes useless move him out of the light then hardin said move gardt mox mox said go outside and dig a hole or something aint you the man charlie goodnight chased to utah wesley hardin asked looking at mox mox old charlies still kicking i expect when he hears youre in texas hell come and chase you back to utah again no were going to get him mox mox said i intend to kill the garza boy first because hes costing me money get woodrow call while youre getting wesley hardin said they sent him after joey garza who did mox mox asked surprised the railroad of course hardin replied i expect him to show up any day call wont bother me because theres no money in it but hell probably catch you and hang you properly whos he talking about jimmy cumsa asked an old ranger mox mox said he dont worry me he never caught duck and hell never catch me wesley hardin suddenly sprang up from the table and hit hergardt in the temple with his pistol as hard as he could he hit him accurately hergardt fell right behind jimmy cumsas chair hardin glared at mox mox jimmy cumsa almost pulled his gun but decided at the last second that it might not be a wise move that was like whacking an ox i hope my weapons intact hardin said he was calm again he looked his pistol over and then cocked it and put it back on the table in front of him call never caught duck but he caught me a couple of times back in my feuding days wesley hardin said i was pretty disagreeable in my feuding days then call went off and hung the suggs brothers up in kansas the suggs were as mean as you if not meaner you dont have no idea how mean i am you scabby sonofabitch mox mox said he was tired of insults besides jimmy cumsa was hearing it all he had to speak up or let jimmy think he was afraid of hardin oh you cook some chicken you drag off a train now and then hardin said i expect most of them are just fat yankees you could fry a hundred of them and it wouldnt impress me he seemed amused by mox moxs anger what would impress you jimmy asked he could tell mox mox wasnt going to stand for much more he wanted to ask a few questions before the killing started if it did well youve got three problems hardin said joey garza charlie goodnight and woodrow call take em in any order you like when youve killed any one of the three come back and ill buy you and all your damn mexicans a drink you dont think we can manage it do you jimmy asked no i dont hardin said youre just a bunch of chicken fryers weve been in the papers jimmy said the papers say were the worst gang ever to hit the west he was becoming annoyed himself at john wesley hardins evident lack of respect i guess you want me to bow to you because you got your name in some damn newspaper hardin said i wouldnt give a nickels worth of dogshit for the whole bunch of you and i dont care what it says in the papers if you want to sit here and drink do it quietly maybe i wont have to whack you like i whacked that lunkhead no if we aint wanted well depart mox mox said standing up when i come back ill bring you three heads and then ill expect an apology for your rude behavior mr hardin hardin was studying his cards he didnt look up mox mox waited but wesley hardin seemed to have forgotten their existence why dont we go back in and kill him jimmy cumsa asked when they were outside the horses had all been dumping several piles of horseshit steamed in the dirty snow pedro peon manuel and oteros all looked drunk they had gone to the back of the saloon and helped themselves to some liquor in patrick obriens storeroom each of them had drunk a bottle the way to think about hardin is that hes crazy mox mox said having him alive is like having another weapon he might kill anybody at any time if call wandered in here hardin might kill him for us or he might kill goodnight i thought you wanted to kill goodnight yourself jimmy said id like to but if wesley hardin happens to kill him first i wouldnt shit my pants i thought you wanted to do it yourself jimmy repeated mox mox took his horse and walked off he led his horse behind the saloon and helped himself to two bottles of patrick obriens whiskey patrick came out while he was doing it and held out his hand thats six bottles you owe me for he said your men took four i sell a lot of whiskey out my back door its convenient i guess mox mox said he handed over the money he wanted to stay friendly with the irishman in his experience it was bad policy to offend saloonkeepers the real reason mox mox led his horse behind the saloon was because he needed a place to mount that wouldnt require him to jump for his stirrup in front of the men he found just the thing too a little lump of sand about two feet high usually he managed to mount from the uphill side so he wouldnt have to jump for the stirrup that was the awkward thing about being short he could never forget it if he was mounting out on the flats where there was no uphill side he had to jump for the stirrup whether he liked it or not when he rode back around the saloon all the men were mounted except hergardt who had just crawled out the door he sat in the snow crooning a german song he sometimes sang when he was unhappy some blood ran out of his ear on the side where hardin had hit him get up gardt were off to catch that mexican boy mox mox said hergardt stumbled up but fell flat down again before he could reach his horse manuel and oteros managed to hoist him to his feet but pedro jones and jimmy cumsa had to help in order to get him flopped over his horse hergardt caught his reins but dropped them pedro jones had to lead hergardts horse the mesquite limbs from what had once been old naiches hut were still smoldering as mox mox and the seven men rode out of crow town the crows were cawing and the bitter wind still blew brookshire had attended princeton college for a year he hadnt the head for it and knew he hadnt the head for it but his mother had ambitions for her children she was determined that he become a college man she made him a suit so that he would not look so much like a plain hoboken boy and she scraped and scrimped to save the money to send him they were not rich but his father had a decent job on the railroad he was foreman of the railroad yard in queens it had not been colonel terrys yard not then brookshire had only stayed a few months at princeton college even his mother was forced to accept the sad fact that he didnt have the head for it in later years it was only in her bitterest moments after she discovered that his father like the colonel had a miss cora tucked away in queens that she railed about her sons failure at princeton as he rode up the rio concho with captain call and deputy plunkert brookshire had occasion to remember princeton college and to reflect on it the wind grew colder and what might have been only a soft snow in the east became a sharp sleet that bit at his face like bees in princeton college they had talked a good deal about civilization those who attended princeton college were of course among the civilized the new jersey countryside had been civilized too though brookshire hadnt thought much about the civilized new jersey landscape or civilization in general until he found himself freezing on the rio concho with captain call up to that time civilization had just been a fancy word that preachers and professors and politicians bruited about it wasnt just a word to brookshire anymore it was something he had left and it involved comfortable beds and gas heaters and snug brick buildings to keep out the wind it involved meat that had been sliced by a welltrained butcher and purchased at a butcher shop and cooked by katie his wife now sadly gone leaving him with no one to cook his chops for him nothing that the professors at princeton college would have been prepared to call civilization existed on the rio concho indeed on the cold stretch where they were nothing human existed except themselves at least the old women in chihuahua city staring out of their dusty shawls had been human here there was only the earth the sky and the wind when night came it took them an hour to gather enough scanty brushwood to make a decent fire the night the ice storm hit it was so cold that even captain call didnt pretend to sleep they all huddled by the fire trying to keep it alive at times the wind surged so that it seemed the fire might blow away brookshire had never expected to be this cold and yet he reflected only a month before he had been sweltering in laredo a few weeks ago i was the hottest ive ever been he told the captain now im the coldest it aint ever moderate down here is it deputy plunkert had given up talking every time he opened his mouth the air came in so cold that it made his teeth hurt down to the roots no its not moderate much call said his knee pained him the morning before he had let a mule kick him usually he was quick enough to sidestep such kicks but he hadnt sidestepped this one more worrisome to him was the fact that the joints of his fingers had begun to swell when it got cold for most of his life he had paid no attention to weather weather was just there he never let it interfere with his work or his movements in time the weather would always change but the work couldnt wait now it seemed weather was interfering plenty when the cold struck his wrist joints became swollen and the joints of his fingers even more so it had happened to a lesser degree the winter before and a doctor in amarillo had told him he had arthritis the only remedy the doctor suggested was that he wear a copper bracelet advice call ignored now he wished he had tried it his finger joints were so swollen on the cold mornings that he had an awkward time buttoning his pants or pulling his saddle straps tight knotting the packs onto the mules had ceased to be a simple task with his joints so swollen he tried letting deputy plunkert pack the mules but deputy plunkert could not tie a knot that would hold just the day before they had spotted a mule deer a big doe they needed meat too call yanked his rifle out of its scabbard and tried to get off a shot only to find that the knuckle of his trigger finger had swollen so badly he had to force it through the trigger guard when he finally got his finger on the trigger the doe was two hundred yards away and call missed sitting by the gusting fire with brookshire and the deputy call rubbed the knuckle it had not become any less swollen they still needed meat too they were living on jerky and a few tortillas that were stiff as leather he looked at the knuckle and was shocked by its size he thought he might possibly have a thorn in it mesquite thorns could cause swelling in a joint but he looked closely and could find no sign of a thorn it was worrisome neither brookshire nor the deputy was a particularly good shot he himself was not an exceptional shot but had usually been able to bring down meat when it was vital it occurred to him that he might have to take the trigger guard off his rifle at least he might have to if the intense cold didnt break he could not remember having been so uncomfortable in cold weather though he had spent a winter in montana on the milk river where temperatures of forty below zero were not uncommon well none of us are as young as we used to be brookshire remarked call had never thought much about age charlie goodnight liked to talk about it but call found the talk tedious he was as old as he was like everyone else as long as he could still go when he needed to go age didnt matter much he was still able within reason to do what he had a mind to do but hed had a mind to kill the large doe and he hadnt of course he wasnt an exceptional shot he had missed mule deer before but the fact that he had missed this one just when he had was troubling they were just coming into the home country of the young bandit a boy with a keen eye and a german rifle with a telescope sight getting a knuckle stuck in a trigger guard would not be wise in a contest with joey garza how cold do you have to be to freeze deputy plunkert asked though he hated to open his mouth and let the cold attack the roots of his teeth he had begun to worry constantly about freezing and wanted to ask coming with the captain was the worst mistake of his life if he were to freeze to death on the rio concho it would serve him right but he still didnt want it to happen we wont freeze call said we can squeeze in with the mules if it gets much worse deputy plunkert had a private agony that he had not shared with his traveling companions the day before when they faced the freezing wind he had put on all the clothes he had brought with him he was wearing two pairs of pants and several shirts with so much clothing on and his hands halffrozen anyway it had proven difficult to get himself fully unbuttoned when a call of nature came in the night he thought he was free but when the piss started to flow it turned out that he wasnta good measure of piss went between one pair of pants and the other the cold deepened and the piss froze making a shield of ice along one thigh the weak fire barely warmed his hands it made no impression on the shield of ice shortly after that calamity the yankee brookshire came to his aid by loaning him an extra pair of gloves he had brought along brookshire noticed that the deputy kept dropping his reins because his hands were so cold he couldnt hold them he offered the gloves and the deputy gratefully took them he knew he would be more grateful too for his wife doobies warm body the next time he got to lie beside it are you sorry you came with me mr brookshire call asked he knew the deputy was sorry he had come his every motion and statement made that clear but brookshire was a more complex fellow he had adapted to hardship far more easily than call had expected him to once out of the heat of laredo he had not uttered a word of complaint and he tried to handle his share of the chores efficiently call had come to admire him it could not be easy to go from the comfortable life of the city to what they were experiencing on the rio concho yet it was the deputythe nativewho was feeling worse no i aint sorry brookshire said katies gone now id just as soon be here he could not think of his wife without tearing up though he quickly wiped away the tears when they came this way i feel about as bad outside as i do inside he said its nice to be shut of the colonel for a while too i imagine hes pretty jumpy by now wondering what became of us i hope he aint fired the whole office the thought came to brookshire that if he ever did make it back to brooklyn he might take the train down to princeton college just to walk among the buildings for an afternoon he supposed other princeton men had gone to the west and come back though he didnt know any he couldnt claim to be a princeton man anyway he hadnt had the head for it and had to quit and take a job in an office still he had a sense that he would like to see the place once more to look at the gray buildings and the great trees if he did go it would be because he had managed to survive a place where no one gave a thought to civilization survival was all they had time for and numbers of them failed even at that it would be good to see princeton again after the rio concho if he was fortunate enough to find another wife and marry and have a boy he thought he might want to send him to princeton college if he could marry a smart wife perhaps he would have a boy with the head for princeton college brookshire began to ruminate about his boy and what his name might be he thought he might want to name him woodrow after the captain that of course was a matter that would have to be discussed with his new wife the next morning they came to the rio grande near its banks was a little village call had a distant memory of the place he and gus mccrae had once hung some horse thieves not far from it on the texas side the village was called ojinaga as he remembered he and gus had brought the bodies home other ranger captains considered that foolish for they thought it invited ambush or revenge but he and gus had sometimes done it anyway on the occasions when the village was close the men hung were in most cases the only ones capable of ambush and having the bodies made it easier on the womenfolk call had never expected to return to ojinaga he remembered the bitterness in the eyes of some of the village women but that was a common thing along the border he saw the bitterness whether he was returning bodies or not now life had brought him back to ojinaga as they rode to the well in the center of the little plaza he was surprised to see old billy williams standing outside a small adobe house billy seemed to be sniffing the airit was a scouts habitbut what was more surprising was that he held the hands of two children one was a large boy and the other a girl of ten or twelve who seemed to be blind billy himself didnt appear to be very keen of sight either the large boy had a look that suggested he might not be fully right in the head call turned his horse and rode over to the three people he had never been a great admirer of billy williams but after three hard nights along the cold river it was comforting to come across an old acquaintance why hello billy call said that is you isnt it woodrow where have you been billy asked weve been expecting you for a week that was unwelcome news why would you be expecting me call asked why everybody knows youre after joey billy williams said its the talk of the whole west i wish the whole west would shut up then call said do you know joey garza i know him billy said he saw no point in not admitting it this is his brother and sister he added this is the house he grew up in his mother shes gone oh are these your children call asked surprised by the news he had just been given he had heard that billy had a woman in mexico they aint no billy said im just watching them aint that deputy plunkert from down in laredo yes thats him call said what are you dragging him along for hes worthless billy said i wouldnt hire him to shovel out shit if i had a livery stable full of it i needed a man call replied i was hoping he might turn out to be a fighter no hes just a jailer billy said ive been arrested in laredo quite a few times but always by sheriff jekyll all plunkert does is ladle out the beans they feed you when they feed you this town looks familiar to me call said i think i was here before with gus we hung three horse thieves and brought them home yes to this house billy said you hung marias father and her brother and a brotherinlaw its just as well marias gone she aint forgot in that case i suppose shes gone to warn her son or have you warned him already well i told maria you were coming billy said she thought joey might be in crow town so she left the weather turned cold but she made it to crow town i know that much oh did a crow tell you call asked no famous shoes told me billy said hes waiting in presidio with your man well thats good news call said deputy plunkert can go home now if he wants to id far rather travel with pea while the men were talking teresa listened though she herself was not frightened she could tell that the man frightened people billys voice sounded different when he was talking to this man the mans voice wasnt loud but it was rough teresa felt interestedshe wished the man would stay with them a little while she liked the way the mans voice sounded even if it was rough from time to time she felt the man watching her it was her belief that the air changed when people watched her she wanted to whisper to rafael about the man she wanted to lead rafael amid the sheep to whisper about the strange man who had just come to ojinaga teresa thought the man might be a king from the way he made the air different when he looked at her it was very interesting to her she was glad her mother wasnt home because her mother always made her go in the house when strangers came it pleased her that billy knew the man perhaps he would visit them again in the next days so he could talk to billy if you care for his brother and sister then i guess you must be a friend of joey garzas call said he wanted what information he could get but he had traveled the border a long while and knew better than to try and twist loyalties he felt the little girl was watching him but of course that was wrong thinking she was blind she couldnt watch him but she was an unusually pretty appealing child there was something in her quick expression that was unusual he knew blind children were often very smart and he suspected that this little girl was one of the smart ones to be blind must be a sadness for anyone of course there would be little hope for the girl in such a poor village even though she was clearly going to be a beauty some man might marry her for her looks alone call supposed i know joey billy admitted i knew him when he was a youngster he was likable then i have not seen him much since he took up killing and train robbing i doubt its improved his disposition i expect not call said waiting perhaps billy would let slip something useful or perhaps not joeys smart and hes lived with the indians billy said he outran the apaches and they couldnt track him neither you wont locate joey easy unless he decides to come at you and present a challenge famous shoes can track him if the railroad can afford his fee call said i imagine the old man is still expensive call sat watching the sprightly girl he wished he had a bauble to give her a ribbon or a locket or some such trinket of course she wouldnt be able to see it but she could feel it the boys face was puffy and he drooled a little he made a sound now and then like the sound a goat would make it made call wonder about the mother what could she be to produce a beautiful blind girl an idiot and a killer he only dimly remembered the three men he and gus had hung the border had an abundance of horse thieves then probably it still did he had forgotten many of the ruffians hed had to deal with it seemed an odd turn of the wheel that he should come back after so many years to the very house where he and gus had brought the three bodies it was still very cold and brookshire was anxious to get across the river to see if there were telegrams from his colonel call could not linger too long just in the hope that billy williams would tell him something useful it might be that old billy didnt really know anything useful about the young killer he thought he might try one more question ive heard theres a cave call said its said the garza boy carries everything he steals and hides it in a cave has anyone you know seen it nope billy said he knew he had to be careful in his statements if maria found out he had said something that gave joey away to his pursuer she would drive him out of ojinaga or else kill him i dont think theres no cave he said lying hes taken a passel of stuff call said its got to be somewhere billy didnt answer for all he knew joey could have ten caves olin roy had seen him carry a saddle into the mountains once but that was as close as anyone had ever come to joeys treasure well i expect id better go locate pea eye call said he looked again at the sprightly little girl and turned his horse later teresa took rafael into the sheep herd and told him that an unusual man had come rafael had been there too of course but often he did not know of many things that happened in his presence until teresa told him she stroked her baby chicken and helped rafael suckle one of the sheep who had just lambed and had much milk i think he must have been the king teresa told her brother she wasnt sure what a king did but her mother had read her two storybooks and one of the books had stories about a king i think he must have been the king she said again as rafael sucked the ewe famous shoes had not wanted to go into presidio the hard sheriff will arrest me he told pea eye he thinks i stole a horse it was a long time ago but he will remember weve got to have shells pea eye reminded him if we dont get shells well starve and never find the captain theyd had a hard trip across the pecos country the cold was bitter and the antelope stayed just out of range tempting pea eye to shoot time after time at animals he couldnt hit theyd had no food at all for the last thirty miles youre working for the captain now pea said youre like a deputy doniphan wont arrest no deputy of captain calls but doniphan the hard sheriff came with the oneeared deputy tom johnson and pointed rifles at them in the hardware store doniphan wore a long mustache and carried two handguns besides the rifle the oneeared deputy had a red face from drink his life had not been easy since billy williams shot off his ear people mocked him and doniphan his boss had no sympathy as everyone on the border knew doniphan had been born without sympathy were here waiting for captain call pea eye said when he saw the rifles pointed at them were both deputies weve been hired to help the captain bring in joey garza this indian is a horse thief doniphan said hes escaped me once because of a fire he wont escape me again hes called famous shoes because he walks everywhere pea eye told him he wouldnt steal a horse because he dont use horses the only use hed have for one would be to eat it stealing horses to eat is still stealing horses doniphan said start walking toward the jail i have never stolen a horse in my life pea eye said why are you arresting me because youre with this horse thief the sheriff answered you might be a horse thief too pea eye went along to the jail he felt bad about famous shoes he should have come into the town alone and bought the cartridges he had ignored the old mans advice which was foolish of him almost every time he ignored someones advice whether it was lorenas or mr goodnights or the captains or famous shoes he had cause to regret it doniphan put the two prisoners in separate cells once i hang this old red nigger and ill get to it quick you can go doniphan said i suspect youre a criminal but i cant prove it the next day several people came to the jail and stared at famous shoes doniphan had let everyone know the man had been recaptured he decided to keep the old man on display for a week as a form of publicity his boast was that no criminal escaped him now he had recaptured the one man who had escaped him he decided to hang him publicly as an example normally he would just have taken him out and yanked him up and let him choke normally an old indian with a taste for horseflesh would not have merited a public hanging but famous shoes escape was the only escape there had been from sheriff doniphans jail and he wanted it to be known up and down the border that he had avenged it pea eyes repeated claim that famous shoes worked for captain call merely annoyed doniphan he left the old man without food for two days to show his annoyance when pea eye tried to share his frijoles with him doniphan moved famous shoes a cell away so that pea eye couldnt pass him the food why are you starving him pea eye asked all he done was eat a dead horse and that was years ago he evaded the lawmy law doniphan replied he deserves worse than starving and hell get worse than starving too famous shoes said nothing talking to the hard sheriff was a waste of breath he began to regret having left the madre he knew that his time was near but was sorry that it might be the hard sheriff who put him to death he had hoped to die near the rio rojo even though he had not made contact with the spirit of his grandfather the spirits of many of the kickapoo people were there along the river it would have been a better place to give up his spirit than the jail of the hard sheriff famous shoes was old though he had lived past the time of his people he knew that few men got to choose the place of their going or of their coming either only the wisest old men and women of the tribe were able to determine when or where to accept their deaths only the wise could do that but even with those few wise ones there had to be more than wisdom for wisdom in his view had ever been a downward path luck was better than wisdom while one was alive it was mainly the lucky who got to die in the right time or the right place or so famous shoes felt he himself had been lucky for he had lived in the lands of the mexicans and also the lands of the whites both peoples hated indians yet he had lived a long life his main regret was that he had not kept his last wife she had grown dissatisfied and left him just as he was beginning to appreciate her attentions he missed her sorely for many years and still missed her when he thought about her also he would have liked to know how to read it seemed that his dream of having pea eyes wife teach him would be frustrated the oneeared deputy who didnt hate him as much as the hard sheriff let him have an old piece of newspaper that had the book tracks on it famous shoes tried his best for what he thought might be the last time to make sense of the tracks on the paper but it was no use he lacked instruction and he had to give up every time pea eye mentioned the captain sheriff doniphan got a cold look in his eye and the look in his eye was not very warm to begin with i doubt hell show up and if he does im apt to lock him up too he told pea eye hes just an old bounty hunterhe aint the law hes too old to catch that mexican boy anyway well charlie goodnight dont think so pea eye said he thought that name at least might impress doniphan but the truth seemed to be that nothing impressed doniphan hes another one thats too old doniphan said these old buffalo need to be put out to pasture they wont be catching no more swift bandits and if they come round me ill send em home in fact now that joey garza had become such a soughtafter outlaw sheriff doniphan had developed a plan to catch the young robber himself the boys mother had been in his jail once already although doniphan had been gone at the time delivering a man to the penitentiary now she had gone to crow town to warn her son but she would have to come back sometime and when she came back doniphan meant to arrest her what his deputies had done to her then would seem like childs play compared to what he meant to do to her now next he would find her son and kill him there would be no capture and no trial there would just be a bullet or two or three doniphan didnt suppose it would hurt his reputation to dispatch joey garza in fact it would make it after that every border killer from matamoros to juarez would know that joe doniphan was a sheriff to be reckoned with the people would stop talking about oldtimers like woodrow call and charlie goodnight when it came to modern lawmen joe doniphan would be the first name that came to mind when trouble on the border was being discussed the next time they needed a federal marshal to clean out crow town or any other nest of ruffians his name would likely be at the top of the list sheriff doniphan was in the midst of just such a dream of glory when captain call walked in with a yankee at his heels the oneeared deputy tom johnson saw him coming and quickly stepped in to alert the sheriff i think its old call he said ive never seen the man but i think its him doniphan was startled he had not expected the old man to appear he got up and put on his hat after all the man had been a great ranger once showing him a little respect wouldnt hurt call had seen too many country sheriffs to be much interested in what he heard about sheriff doniphan presidio was a small town in a remote spot on the border few criminals of the first class would have any incentive to pass through it the man had probably harvested his reputation by arresting local thieves or men who got drunk and shot their best friends local law work was mostly of that order when told at the hardware store that doniphan had arrested pea eye and famous shoes call had been irritated but not overly so at least pea eye was there and the old tracker was still with him when he stepped into the jail doniphan held out his hand but call ignored it let those men outyou had no business arresting them call said bluntly they were sent to help me bring in joey garza and you need not have interfered with them sheriff doniphan was surprised that such an old man would take such a sharp tone with him he didnt appreciate it either it was not the kind of talk he was used to hearing in his own jail the yankee looked mild but old call didnt i know who to arrest i reckon doniphan said this indians going to be hung in a few days hes a known horse thief im sure youve hung a good many like him yourself famous shoes has never been known to ride a horse much less steal one call informed him anybody who knows anything about this part of the country knows that pea eye has been my deputy for thirty years and hes never been a lawbreaker he came into town with a criminal and thats breaking the law for me doniphan said irritated by the old mans tone he felt his temper rising who was this old fellow to walk into his jail and start giving orders here call said handing doniphan a telegram this is from the governor of texas i heard you were a stubborn man so i asked mr brookshire to have colonel terry wire the governor i done it as soon as i heard these men were in your jail i done it to save time were provisioned and we need to go theres been another train robbery near san angelo doniphan took the telegram but he felt himself growing angrier he was too angry to read old call had gone around him without even speaking to him doniphan wadded up the telegram unread and tossed it on the floor tom johnson though well aware that his boss was temperamental was appalled they had never received a telegram from the governor before they had never even dreamed of receiving oneat least he hadnt now joe doniphan had received one and wadded it up without even reading it he hastily picked it up and attempted to smooth it out it was from the governor and it ordered sheriff doniphan to release calls men and give him every assistance call watched the sheriff who had grown quite red in the face he had secured the telegram as a matter of correct procedure he knew that local sheriffs were apt to be touchy about their authority call supposed from what he had heard that doniphan was likely to be touchier than most so he had asked brookshire to wire his boss and had used the time it took exchanging telegrams to provision well again he had offered to release deputy plunkert from his duties and again the deputy though half frozen and permanently melancholy had refused to be released now that they were back in texas ted plunkert felt that conditions were sure to improve he resolved to stay with captain call whatever it meant call had not supposed that doniphan would be obdurate enough to defy an order from the governor of texas but it seemed the man was just that stubborn sheriff it is from the governor tom johnson said dont you want to read it no i dont and when i wad something up i want it left wadded up the sheriff said highly irritated with his deputy goddamn the governor and goddamn you the sheriff said addressing himself to call you dont come in here and order me to let criminals out of my own jail they arent criminals and youve overstepped call said let them out ill let your man go the day i hang the indian and ill hang the indian in my own good time sheriff doniphan said call saw a ring of jail keys hanging on a hook near the sheriffs desk he walked over and took the ring and went to the cell where pea eye sat he saw the sheriff draw his gun but paid it no mind he didnt expect the man to shoot after all he had his back to him and there were five witnesses in the room the third key he tried opened the cell then call found the key that freed famous shoes theyre dead men if they step out of them cells doniphan said i dont tolerate escapes brookshire watching from just inside the door felt that the captain might have made a mistake the sheriff didnt seem to be a relenting man in that respect he reminded him of colonel terry the fact that the captain was just ignoring the sheriff made brookshire nervous if the sheriff pulled the trigger everything would change doniphan might shoot them all he might even shoot his own deputy he looked to be a man who acted only for himself as colonel terry did brookshire wondered if the captain had miscalculated if so call exhibited little concern then to brookshires astonishment call flattened the sheriff with a rifle he whacked him right in the neck with a hard swing he hadnt been carrying a rifle though there were several in a gun rack along the wall somehow the captain who usually moved slowly and stiffly had walked right in front of the sheriff ignored his cocked pistol pulled loose a rifle and hit the sheriff with it the minute he struck the blow the captain seemed to change he didnt stop with one blow although doniphan was knocked flat and his pistol went skittering across the floor of the jail call continued to hit the sheriff with the rifle once when the sheriff turned to try and escape the captain knocked him in the ear with his boot so hard that brookshire would not have been surprised if doniphans head had flown off stop captain hes subdued pea eye said though he knew the captain wouldnt stop he rarely went off into such a storm of violence but when he did it was almost impossible to stop him once in ogallala years before the captain had launched himself at a sergeant who was quirting newt before that storm ended the captain had almost killed the man by pounding his head against an anvil gus mccrae had stopped it by roping the captain and pulling him off the bloody sergeant with his horse there was no gus no rope and no horse but pea eye knew the captain had to be stopped somehow or else sheriff doniphan would be dead once the storm of rage took him the captain could no more stop hitting and kicking than a blizzard could stop blowing pea eye saw the captain lift the bloody rifle for what might be a fatal blow and flung himself at callthere was no waiting and no choice help me youve all got to help me pea eye yelled he partially deflected the rifle with his arm as the blow fell that might have killed sheriff doniphan the oneeared deputy tom johnson tried to grab one of the captains arms but was immediately knocked back pea eye concentrated on the rifle trying to keep the captain from splitting doniphans skull with it he managed to hang on to one arm but he knew it wouldnt be for long somebodys got to rope him its the only way pea said looking desperately at the yankee here ride your horse up give me your rope brookshire yelled out the door to deputy plunkert who though taken by surprise immediately spurred his horse up the few steps to the porch of the jail he handed brookshire his rope ill get it on him then you pull brookshire said he was trembling from the shock but he managed to make a loop in the end of the rope he got close enough to the captain to get the loop over one of his feet as call was trying to step free of the fallen sheriff so he could kick him again pull brookshire yelled he had never seen such a killing frenzy take any man merely witnessing the destruction of the sheriff made brookshires breath come short and his heart pound uncomfortably but he knew he had to get the rope on some part of call or the sheriff of presidio would be dead deputy plunkert dallied the rope around his saddle horn and backed his horse along the narrow porch until it grew tight he soon discovered to his amazement that captain call was on the other end he held a bloody rifle in one hand and for a moment looked as if he wanted to club brookshire with it but he didnt he shook pea eye off and then shook the rope off his foot he broke the bloody rifle over the hitch rail and threw the two parts of it into the street call went back inside dragged the bloody unconscious sheriff into the cell where famous shoes had been and locked it he took the big ring of keys outside and threw them into the cistern at the end of the porch when he passed pea eye brookshire and the oneeared deputy each drew back a little as they might if a bear had just approached them when he comes round tell him the next time he points a damn pistol at me hed better shoot call told the oneeared deputy i wont tolerate rude threats of that sort yes sir tom johnson said privately he was not sure sheriff doniphan would come around men had died from much less punishment than the captain had just dished out the sheriffs mouth was leaking blood and not slowly either one whole side of his face seemed to be caved in and his long mustache was just a line of blood call knew that his violent fighting temper had gotten the best of him again but he did not pretend to regret his attack on the sheriff who had pulled a gun and threatened to shoot two valuable men and in defiance of the governors orders too he would have liked to do worse than he had done but hed gotten enough of a grip on himself to refrain from dragging the man out of his cell and finishing him what he did do was pick up the telegram the frightened deputy had dropped he put the telegram on the sheriffs desk remind him that i was following the governors instructions call said read him the telegram yes sir tom johnson said again ill remind him i expect hell listen this time yes if his ears aint burst pea eye said the captain caught one of his ears a pretty good lick were provisioned lets go call said he felt that he had returned to normal but the men were looking at him oddlyall the men but famous shoes who had found a halfeaten plate of beans and was eating them pea eye saw the captain looking at famous shoes in a testy way and thought he had better explain he wasnt allowed no food for two days thats why hes into them beans he said famous shoes could not understand why the foolish white men had kept the captain from killing the hard sheriff it was very foolish in his view the sheriff had been about to shoot them all and he might try it again if he lived famous shoes was not sure the sheriff would live though the captain had dealt him some hard licks mostly to the head the way the captains anger came reminded famous shoes of old kicking bird a comanche chief given to terrible furies when kicking bird went into a rage he was apt to injure anyone near him including members of his own tribe he was a great fighting man but he fought so hard that he lost track of who it was he was fighting and merely killed everyone near him once he had grievously wounded his own brother while in such a rage we need you to help us track this garza boy are you available call asked he noticed there was quite a bit of blood on the floor of the jail the oneeared deputy would have to get out his mop once they left yes famous shoes said you dont have to pay me either pea eyes woman is going to teach me to read that and something to eat will be wages enough this time hired i guess if pea eyes wife agrees call said lets go deputy plunkert who had spurred his horse onto the porch of the jail with no difficulty in response to brookshires plea had great difficulty getting the horse to go back down the steps pea eye finally whacked the animal a time or two and the horse jumped as far out into the street as it could nearly knocking down one of the waiting pack mules when it landed call was composed by this time he wanted to get started and not waste an afternoon the men were all subdued all except famous shoes who was already half a mile ahead of them proceeding at his customary rapid pace brookshire felt so weak that he could barely mount the shock of seeing captain call suddenly hit the sheriff with the rifle and then continue to hit him had been almost too much for his system he felt very tired and once more thought willy of how nice it would be to spend the night in a decent hotel that was not to be though not for a while they had already left presidio behind them the thing that troubled brookshire most was that his memory of the incident was incomplete he had been watching the captain carefully hoping call was not misjudging the sheriffs temper yet somehow his eyes had failed him he didnt see the captain walk from the cells past the sheriff to the rack of rifles whatever happened had happened too fast or else his brain had cut off for a moment or something one minute the captain was releasing famous shoes the next there was the sound of the rifle barrel hitting the sheriff brookshire considered it spooky he couldnt explain it he had no doubt about one thing though colonel terry in his wisdom and he did seem to have wisdom had clearly chosen the right man for the job at hand the garza boy would need more than a german rifle with a telescope sight when the captain caught up with him if the boy was smart he would just surrender and not let himself in for the kind of punishment that had just befallen the unfortunate sheriff doniphan it took the oneeared deputy tom johnson and such townspeople as gathered to help over three hours to fish the jail keys out of the cistern fortunately the hardware store had a big magnet that was used to sort nails and with the aid of the magnet tied to three lariat ropes the keys were finally brought up sheriff joe doniphan was still unconscious when they opened the cell he was conscious only fitfully for the next several days his right jawbone was broken in seven places and his palate damaged he lost all his teeth on that side of his mouth and eventually had to have his other teeth pulled in order to bring his bite into balance also three ribs were broken and one leg the leg was set improperly the local doctor was so worried about the jaw that he made a hurried job of the leg the result being that sheriff doniphan limped for the rest of his life he resigned as sheriff a month after the beating no one including his wife could stand to see his mashedin face he retired to his house and sat in the bedroom most of the day with the shades pulled whittling sticks he didnt whittle them into any shape he just whittled them away the memory of his own inaction at the fatal moment was what haunted the exsheriff most he had been holding a pistol cocked and pointed right at the old man he could have shot him at any moment and justified it on the grounds that call was helping a known criminal escape of course the telegram from the governor was awkward deputy johnson had preserved it for the townspeople to see but doniphan could have argued that he never saw it and had reason to suspect its authenticity the point was he hadnt shot he had let an old man whip him nearly to the point of death with one of his own guns in his own jail in front of five people he hadnt shot he had just stood there it was a failure the former sheriff joe doniphan couldnt live with the next time he lifted a gun to shoot a little less than a year after the beating but long after the pursuit of joey garza had ended it was to put a caliber bullet into his own brain his wife martha was in the kitchen rolling biscuit dough when she heard the gun go off in the bedroom martha was glad doobie plunkert had only gone by the jail to see if there was any news of ted after all sheriff bob jekyll was known to be lazy he didnt care whether doobie had any news of ted or whether ted was alive or dead for that matter he wouldnt walk up the street to her house to bring her news even if he had any doobie knew there probably wasnt any news though there hadnt been a word since the day ted left it seemed to doobie that he had now been gone most of the time since they married she had even begun to forget bits and pieces of her early married life though her early married life had happened less than a year ago it was just that the terrible loneliness she felt now that ted was gone had cut her off from her own good memories doobie knew that when ted finally came home they would be the happiest couple in the world and she would know what to do the next time some old sheriff rode into town and tried to take her husband away next time doobie was determined to fight and she meant to win too next time she wasnt going to let her husband go but chill day after chill day passed with no word from ted at all or of ted and doobie had become a little desperate every day she went to the little post office in the back of the hardware store hoping there would be a letter she knew ted wasnt much for writing since it was all he could do to make a sentence but still he might pass through a town that had a post office and he might be tempted to write her at least a note so she would know he was alive she knew bob jekyll didnt really want her coming around the jail whether ted was on duty or not but the jail was the place news would be most likely to show up the hunger for at least some word of her husband gnawed at doobie so deeply that she couldnt stop showing up at the jail just to peek in and ask sheriff jekyll what he had heard captain call was a famous man surely there would be some news of the captain and his party sometime in the nights doobie began to be prey to even more terrible fears what if ted was lost what if the whole party had starved or been killed by indians she knew there were still wild indians in mexicowhat if they had killed ted in a place where no one would ever even find his body what if she had the baby and it grew up and neither of them ever heard another word about ted plunkert in the whole of their lives doobie tried to make herself stay away from the jail but on days when she was particularly worried or had had a particularly bad night it was hard her feet just seemed to take her in the direction of the jail the one place where there might be news doobie never supposed not for one moment that sheriff jekyll might take this wrong she felt he must know that the one and only reason she pestered him was because she loved her husband so much and was desperate for news everyone in laredo texas knew how much doobie plunkert loved her husband they were the happiest young couple in the community that was common knowledge doobie had seen sheriff jekyll looking at her that way once or twice that way men looked at women it was part of being a woman she supposed men just would look at you that way susanna slack her best friend told her it was merely the way of the world men looked at susanna that way too although she was an older woman doobie hoped that sheriff jekyll and the men of laredo in general might be a little more respectful in their manner of looking once it became obvious that she was enceinte they should not be casting disrespectful looks at a woman who was soon to have a baby when doobie realized that bob jekyll was looking at her that way more intently than usual and was even moving toward her she tried to dart back out the door of the jail to safety but she was a step too slow bob jekyll caught her arm and started dragging her toward a cell with a cot in it the jail was completely empty too there was not a single prisoner not a soul for doobie to cry out to you keep coming herenow shut up bob jekyll said as he dragged doobie toward the cell when doobie opened her mouth to scream bob jekyll punched her so hard it stunned her he had been standing right by the door looking at her with that look when she stepped inside the jailhouse full of hope that there might be some news of ted doobie didnt want to be punched again she was afraid bob jekyll might hit her in the stomach and injure her baby she was inside the cell pinned to the cot before she started fighting again she had never hoped to see any man on earth except her husband with his pants pulled down but sheriff jekyll had his pants down and he was pulling at her drawers doobie tried to claw him but when she did he punched her so hard again that she lost consciousness for a minute when her head cleared a little sheriff jekyll was there doing what only her husband had the right to do doobie gave up then a sorrow came to her as deep as the bone for everything was lost now even her baby was lost sheriff bob jekyll had destroyed her virtue and her future too it wouldnt even matter if ted came back now for he would never forgive her perhaps he would not even believe her when she said she only went to the jail hoping for news of him even if he did come back their happiness was lost doobie became so hopeless that the sheriff grew disgusted with her as soon as he had pleased himself he told her to get out of his jail and stay out he went over to his desk and didnt look at doobie again he hadnt torn her dress only her drawers had been ripped doobie didnt know what his punches had done to her face but at least she could walk the few blocks home dressed respectably one or two people even spoke to her as she hurried up the street doobie managed a good morning to them though it wasnt a good morning what it had turned out to be in the course of a few minutes was the last morning of her life doobie loved ted plunkert with all her heart and would never have done anything to bring dishonor to him the knowledge that she mustnt let dishonor stain their marriage helped her keep a firm resolve she wanted to die as quickly as possible before she weakened she thought about writing ted a note but dismissed that notion at once she would never be able to explain it would be better to let ted think she had just gone crazy from loneliness from missing him she wasnt going to burden her husband with the awful truth doobie couldnt help but cry now she knew how swiftly all the good things of life could be lost her marriage was lost and her baby compared to those griefs the loss of her own physical life seemed minor she only wanted to hurry with dying she didnt want someone to come and interrupt her before she could do what she had to do she ran to her kitchen and quickly dug out the rat poison laredo was overrun with giant brown pack rats that lived under houses and also under the giant piles of prickly pear sometimes the mexicans stuffed the ratholes and set the piles of prickly pear afire once the fire burned down they dug out the rats and ate them doobie thought that was a horrible practice she hated the rats and considered that one of her own duties as a housewife was to keep their little house free of them she spread the rat poison carefully around all the places a rat might get in once in a while a rat would die under the house and she and ted would smell it but mainly the rats ran off to the river to die doobie felt very calm about what she had to do until she started trying to eat the rat poison she got a big spoon and tried to eat it straight down like the oatmeal she sometimes made ted in the mornings but rat poison wouldnt go down like oatmeal and it only made her gag when it got moist it stuck to her teeth and to the roof of her mouth and became very hard to swallow doobie stopped being calm and became frantic what if she failed to die and ted had to come home to a wife who was no longer worthy a wife who had carelessly let her virtue be lost to the lust of sheriff bob jekyll ted plunkert would never get over such a thing doobie knew she mustnt let him know it would be a terrible failure if she let ted find out the truth she thought about hanging herself but that was chancy since she had never been very good at tying knots if she tried to hang herself somebody might find her while she was still alive ted had explained to her that water helped the rat poison work when the rats ate the poison it made them thirsty and they ran off to the river to drink then the water made the poison work and the rats died the minute she remembered what ted had told her doobie took the big can of rat poison and a cup and went out her back door the river was only two streets away she walked toward it swiftly hoping no one would see her or speak to her she made it to the river unobserved and began to stuff poison in her mouth and then drink water then it occurred to her that she could mix the poison with water she began to scoop water into the cup and mix it with poison after that the whole business went more quickly it was working too doobie began to feel a pain inside down in her belly it was as if something with sharp claws was pulling on her guts she cried at the thought that her baby might be feeling the clawing too but she kept scooping poison into the cup and filling it with water she drank and scooped poison and drank it was her way of doing right by ted the worse the clawing hurt the more sure doobie was that she would triumph ted would be sad when he found out that she was dead but he wouldnt have to try to live down the terrible thing that had happened he would get over her death in time but neither of them would ever be able to put right what had happened in the jail doobies hand got shaky she began to spill the poison when she tried to scoop it into her cup some of it spilled into the river it was yellow and it flowed away with the brown water doobie had not been paying attention to anything but drinking the poison but as the clawing got sharper and it felt as if her insides were being ripped by claws and squeezed together at the same time she happened to see a dead rat lying at the edge of the water only a few yards away its mouth was open and she could see its ugly teeth it lay with most of its body in the water and its brown fur was wet maybe the rat had died from eating some of the very poison she was drinking down in just a few minutes doobie hoped she would be as dead as the rat she might roll into the river just as it had she might be wet too when people found her but she didnt want that she didnt want to be found all wet and messy she began to crawl farther from the water the bright sun began to affect her she wanted to hide her eyes from the sun she began to curl up in order to hide her eyes but when she curled up the pain in her gut became unbearable she tried to straighten up again but the pain in her belly was now just as bad no matter how she lay or sat no matter whether she was curled or straight for a second doobie wanted to give up she wanted to run to a doctor and have him give her something to stop the pain but she couldnt run or even stand she began to roll around and had soon rolled back down to the rivers edge one of her feet knocked over the can of rat poison but not much spilled because there wasnt much poison left in the can doobie had eaten or drunk most of what had been in it she didnt feel good at all anymore she didnt feel anything but a clawing needling pain she tried to cry out but the poison gummed in her mouth so that she could only make a weak sound a sound no one passing would even hear doobie continued to make a weak sound no louder than a rats squeak until her voice stopped and she made no sound at all on the coldest night the night of the great ice storm maria thought she and all the women might freeze the fires she made sputtered and blew out the two old mexican women were almost dead anyway maria had to go back and find them one of them had fallen three miles behind the group maria hunted wood and kept the fires going but ice had covered everything and her hands and feet got very cold dont make me go no farther id rather give up and die cherie said her real name wasnt cherie but she was so cold and had stopped using her real name so long ago that it didnt matter what it had been patrick the saloonkeeper had brought her to crow town only to abandon her for another woman she had been there five years and shed had to struggle so hard that she lost her memory of other places the women were convinced that they would all die they didnt believe they would live to reach the railroad and several of them had ceased to care gabriela and marieta were numb their feet so cold they couldnt feel them beulah kept trying to stop maria had to push her and prod her to keep her going they had not even crossed the pecos yet maria kept angling away from it hoping for a warmer day before she had to try to bring the women across she had fixed her mind on saving the women though she didnt know any of them getting them safely to the railroad had become important to her she had taken them out of the town even though she hadnt wanted to at first but she had accepted their need to go and now she felt she must supply the will to keep them traveling despite the bitter cold she herself had often had to search for will in hard times when the men from texas pretended to hang her she had tried to make her will stop so she could die she had wanted to elude them that way again when they were degrading her she would have liked for her will to stop she would have rather not been alive anymore and as she had lost hope with her husbands each in turnexcept for benito she had never lost hope with benito she had sometimes wished in the night that she could just stop breathing and not be there in the morning and have to get out of the bed in hopelessness to deal with the man who was making her hopeless week after week and year after year it was in those times that billy williams had proven himself a true friend he would cajole her over to the cantina make her drink until she felt like dancing or dance until she felt like drinking somehow billy could make her laugh that was a rare thing too for a man to be able to make her laugh with women maria laughed with her children she laughed but rarely did she laugh with a man she only laughed with billy williams the lack of laughter in her life was a thing maria held against men she felt she had the temperament to be a happy woman if she was not interfered with too much she knew that it was her fault that she let men interfere with her yet if she didnt there was nothing or at least there was not enough she wanted a man to lay with except if she wanted a man once she would want him many times she liked to take pleasure from men and liked to give it but when she gave men that pleasure they came to need it and then to resent her because they needed her when that happened the interfering began maria didnt know why men resented the very women who gave them the most pleasure and gave it generously it was foolish very foolish of men to resent the good that came from women still they did thinking of billy williams and all the times he had made her laugh kept marias mind off the icy ground and the sheaths of ice on the mesquite limbs she broke off to keep the fire going she made three fires and kept them all going herself the women were too tired and numb to move she put the women in a little triangle between the fires but it was bitter cold and even three fires were not enough it was too cold and the women were too tired and broken maria knew she had to do something else or the women would give up and begin to die she thought about the things she talked about with the women of her village when they were washing clothes together or cooking for a little fiesta those were times when she and the women were apt to get bawdy and talk about the embarrassments or the rewards of love none of the women huddled between the fires looked as if they had known love recently men might have used them especially the young ones but that was different the women might not be able to remember a time when love had been an exciting thing but maria decided she wanted to make them try it was a long time until dawn and they had nothing but three small sputtering fires to get them through the night there had to be something more maybe she could get the women to tell stories about their lives maybe the memory of times when life had been exciting would make them want to live through the freezing night tell me about your first man maria said she addressed the question to beulah what beulah said she thought she must have heard maria wrong i want to know about your first man maria said then she looked at cherie i want to know about yours too she said my first man was a vaquero he came riding into town and when he got off his horse and walked to the cantina his spurs jingled from the time i heard his spurs i knew i wanted to be his woman oh lord cherie said maria waited marieta and gabriela paid no attention they had not even heard marias words but the oldest woman in the group a thin old woman named maggie showed a spark of interest maggie had been one that maria had to go back for several times once maria had found her kneeling by a little bush she was crouched behind the bush as if she expected it to keep the cold wind from biting her yet maggie had recovered a little she looked at maria with curiosity did you get the vaquero maggie asked yes he was my first husband maria said we had good timesbut then he got mean i still remember the sound of his spurs the first time i saw him when i think of him now its the spurs i remember i was married to a circus man first maggie said mostly he was a juggler he could keep seven barbells up in the air at the same time when he was sober where did you live maria asked boston for a little while maggie said then he took me to new orleans he was going to marry me but he never did them mosquitoes in new orleans was bad id get so i wanted to drown myself rather than be bit by them mosquitoes theyre bad in houston too beulah said its swampy down there in houston jimmy drunk too much to be a juggler maggie said hed drink all night and then the next day hed miss two or three of them barbells maggie chuckled at the memory them barbells are heavy she said i couldnt even juggle two if one was to crack me in the head i wouldnt be able to walk straight for a week you cant go off with men and expect them to marry you beulah said thats the mistake i kept making now here i am an old maid several of the women looked at her when she said it beulah realized that her last remark must have sounded a little odd she smiled at herself well i mean i never married she explained maggie now that she had begun to talk wasnt interested in listening to anyone else jimmy cracked himself in the head so many times that he got where he couldnt walk the tightrope she said he wasnt no tightrope walker anyway but he wanted to be the star of the show i told him to stay off the dern tightrope but he didnt listen to me i started up with a trick rider about that time jimmy found himself a high yellow woman but she had a temper and jimmy didnt want nothing to do with women who had tempers didnt you have a temper maria asked no i was just a girl then maggie said i was all in love and i wanted to do whatever jimmy wanted me to i didnt put up no fight but that high yellow woman did all the women even marieta and gabriela were listening to maggie maria had not expected it to be maggie who talked she thought maggie was too far gone but that proved to be a misjudgment maggie had some spirit left she knew everybody was listening to her and she liked the attention what was the trick rider like maria asked he was just a trick rider maggie said he could stand on his head on a horse with the horse running full speed but he wasnt no good with women i got tired of the circus life and ran off with a smuggler he was my first husband and he took me to sea wed be rollin around in one of them narrow bunks and sometimes wed roll one way and the ship would roll another and wed go sailin right out of that bunk she cackled at her own memory that was forty years ago that i married eddie maggie said im surprised i can still remember him he got caught smuggling niggers and they hung him was it a crime to smuggle niggers cherie asked i thought back then you could buy them and sell them any time you wanted to you could but eddie wasnt buying them maggie said he was smuggling stolen niggers i can still remember them nigger women howlin down in the bottom of that ship eddie and the boys would lash em good trying to get them to shut up when they was coming into port but they would keep on howlin that was how eddie got caught i told him he ought to just smuggle buck niggers the bucks didnt howl as much but eddie never listened to me and he got his neck stretched as a result men dont listen beulah agreed i could have made red foot rich if hed listened to me when we were in the saloon business in dodge i told him it was time to go to deadwood they say nearly everyone who opened a saloon in deadwood in those days got rich theres just more loose money where theres miners but we come to crow town instead she added red heard it was booming but there sure wasnt no boom when we got there maggie was so eager to talk by this time that she could hardly check herself and wait for beulah to shut up the circus was in st louis when eddie got hung maggie said i went up to vicksburg on one boat and then i rode on another boat that had a train on it a train cherie asked why would a train be on a boat she decided the old woman was telling lies and nothing but lies she had thought as much back in crow town too old maggie did nothing but lie cherie didnt resent it particularly maybe the old crone actually believed everything she said anyway listening to her brag about all the men shed had was something to do while they were sitting and freezing it wasnt the whole train it was just the locomotive maggie said they were taking it upriver somewhere i couldnt sleep because i got to worrying that the locomotive would bust loose and sink the boat we got to st louis though and the first person i saw when i got off the boat was jimmy he had almost cut his nose off it was sewed on but it didnt look right and it never did look right after that was it a woman that cut his nose off maria asked she had heard that among the apaches such things occurred no it was the tightrope maggie said jimmy kept trying to walk it but he was wobbly from hitting himself in the head too many times with them barbells he fell off the tightrope and it hit him right under the nose and nearly cut his nose off whats a circus marieta asked she didnt understand the talk of barbells and jugglers did you ever get up to deadwood beulah asked i still have a hankering to go no i worked on a riverboat maggie said i went up and down the river i dont know how many times until i got tired of hearing the water slosh then i married another fool who got hung and then i married ross i was soon wishing theyd hang ross he beat me so bad i couldnt turn over in my own bed ross had fists like bricks how did you get rid of him sally asked sally was about beulahs age she had two big moles just above her upper lip ross stepped on a nail and got blood poisoning and died maggie said it saved me he would have broken every bone in my body if he hadnt stepped on that nail maggie smiled and cackled again she looked like a wicked old woman but she was still alive and she liked to talk i didnt go to rosss funeral i didnt figure i owed ross nothing she said but a few days later i went to the funeral of one of my girlfriends three days later the preacher that preached it came up and asked me to marry him thats how pretty i was when i still had my looks i never knew preachers liked women that much until the reverend jonah got ahold of me they doone got after me too beulah said as maggie and beulah talked on a tiredness began to come to maria she had kept the women going for three days leading them encouraging them going back for them she had gathered most of the frozen wood they burned and she had made the fires she heard maggie talking about her preacher and beulah about hers but maria began to lose the names that went with the stories the sound of the womens voices lulled her it was better to hear women talk even if she was too tired to listen than to have only the silence and the cold maria would have liked to be fresh to tell some of her own stories too but it would have to be another time when they all reached the railroad and were safe marias eyes grew so heavy she could not watch the fire she slumped over and her serape slipped off her shoulders sally who was the closest got up and wrapped the serape back around maria pulling it tight so it would not slip off again she fed the fire a few sticks from a pile maria had gathered maria had come back for sally when sally was freezing and sally didnt want her to sleep cold shes tuckered out maggie said then she went on to tell the women about some of the peculiarities of the reverend jonah the preacher who had loved her in st louis long ago when she still had her looks when lorena got off the train in laredo the first thing she saw was a funeral procession and the first person she spoke to was tinkersley as she stepped out of the little railroad station and stopped to watch the funeral processionit seemed as if everyone in town was following the wagon that had the coffin in ita tiredlooking older man in a slick brown coat looked at her and stopped and looked again why lorie he said could it really be you lorena supposed the mayor must have died she had never seen such a lengthy funeral procession in a town the size of laredo even in ogallala they would have had a hard time getting so many people to march behind a coffin she looked again at the man who had called her by her name he had few teeth and bags hung halfway down his cheeks he wore a sporty hat but it was not new a rat or something had chewed a piece out of the brim lorie its me tinkersley the man said its you aint it tell me its you im lorena im married now lorena said tinkersley ran whores and gambled no doubt he was still running whores and gambling though not so prosperously as he had been when she knew him tinkersley had brought her to south texas when she was a young whore in a san antonio hotel room during a fight he had bitten her on the upper lip leaving a faint scar that she still had now here he was in laredo watching a lengthy funeral procession she saw a familiar light come into his eyes from looking at her she wanted to immediately put it out ive come here to look for my husband hes with captain call or at least i hope he is she said who died her name was doobie plunkert she was well liked in the town tinkersley said i liked her myself although we only met once thats why i lent my whores for the singing i run the whores in this town he went on they wanted a big singing for doobie so i lent them six girls i just kept back two to take care of the customers until the funeral is over lorena saw the whores in a group well behind the coffin hearse with some more churchlylooking women marching just ahead of them right behind the wagon im surprised theyd let whores sing at a proper funeral lorena said was the woman a whore no she was the wife of a deputy sheriff hes gone with old call too like your husband tinkersley said sheriff jekyll raped doobie and she took poison and died its a pity the man could have bought a whore and spared poor mrs plunkert the young woman must have felt hopeless lorena thought she hadnt wanted her husband to find out what happened lorena set down her valise leaving it on the railroad station platform and began to walk along with the funeral tinkersley after a moments hesitation fell in with her lorena didnt try to stop him what tinkersley did didnt matter she supposed it was even rather nice of him to let his whores sing at the funeral he probably charged the church a fee or tried to but at least he let them sing what kind of poison lorena asked well rat poison she drank most of it in water tinkersley said they found her by the river she wasnt quite dead at the time it was the doctor who noticed that her drawers were torn and that somebody had hit her a lick or two they found a little ribbon from her dress in a cell in the jail and thats what nailed the sheriff lorena regretted that the train had come in when it did she would rather not have known about the death of mrs plunkert they had never met of course but lorena had been alone in south texas in rooms that were no more than jails with men who were no different from the sheriff and who were certainly no better she had no way out then and only one way to survive many times it had seemed to her a close bargain in even worse times when she was taken by blue duck and given to the men of ermokes band and then threatened with burning by mox mox she had been reduced to one wish that there was some way to be dead and be dead quickly although the circumstances of mrs plunkerts travail might seem lighter lorena knew they had not seemed at all light to the young woman who had so promptly taken her own life mrs plunkert must have felt that her happiness and her husbands happiness were forfeit anyway she had become hopeless lorena knew enough about hopelessness she did not want to be reminded of it not even a hopelessness experienced by a young woman she had never met what the death of mrs plunkert meant was that hopelessness was always there there was never a way or a time one could be safe from it if pea eye died or one of her children she knew she would have to feel it again lorie you dont know her you aint expected to attend the funeral tinkersley said i want to attend the funeral but id rather you didnt accompany me lorena said but you didnt know the woman tinkersley said he felt a sudden deep need to stay with lorena seeing her had reminded him of the regret he had nursed for years when hed left her and lost her he had even journeyed to the little town of lonesome dove where he heard she worked hoping to get her back but he came too late she had left with the cow herd and the cowboys for montana now through a miracle she had stepped off the train in laredo right in front of him he didnt want to leave her when she told him she didnt want him to accompany her to the funeral he fell back a few steps but he didnt let lorena out of his sight the cemetery was just a plain piece of ground dusty without a bush or a tree to lessen its plainness most of the grave markers were wooden and many of them had tilted over or fallen flat altogether one of the whores the smallest a slip of a girl with curly brown hair had a beautiful soprano voice when she sang amazing grace her voice rose over all the other singers the other five whores and the few churchwomen her voice was clear as the air they sang rock of ages and then will the circle be unbroken three hymns at a funeral was unusual lorena thought yet despite the cutting wind the mourners seemed reluctant to leave when the women finished the last song they looked around wondering if they should sing more it was odd lorena thought that no one was hurrying away the young whore with the beautiful voice finally spoke to one of the churchwomen and the women began to sing theres a home beyond the river the young soprano poured her heart into the song no doubt she had an inkling of how mrs plunkert had felt that at least was lorenas view the girls voice was so strong and pure that it silenced the other singers one by one the other whores and the churchwomen fell silent and the beautiful voice of the whore with the curly hair soared on in lonely lament for the lost life of a woman the young whore had not known and perhaps had not even met when the song ended the mourners turned away from the grave and an old mexican man with a shovel began to push in dirt around the coffin at least she had a right pretty funeral tinkersley said he fell in with lorena as she was hurrying back to the station anxious to secure her valise tinkersley was seeking to make small talk or any talk that would persuade her to allow him to stay with her for a while get away from me tinkersley lorena said you done nothing but hurt me when we was together i dont want you to be walking with me im here to find my husband but i bought you pretty dresses tinkersley protested i took you to the fanciest shop in san antonio so you could sell me for a higher price lorena reminded him get away from me i dont like remembering none of that lorie i was just hoping we could visit tinkersley said i know i done you badly i came back to find you but you were gone north with gus mccrae lorena didnt speak to tinkersley again she just ignored him he walked with her pleading until they were nearly back to the station but lorena didnt say another word she scarcely noticed him in his slick coat nor did she listen to his excuses or his pleas she felt a great longing to be with her husband most men would make excuses all day and all night for their failings but pea never did when pea did something that hurt her feelings he accepted his error and suffered for it until she had to take him in hand and try to coax him and tease him back into a good humor she had to convince him each time that what he had done was only a small error not the unforgivable act he believed it to be marriage was often vexing that was all now with the funeral over she wanted to gather such information about where captain call might be as she could she wanted to catch up with pea and bring him home before one of the bad men in the world did something to hurt him it was not until that night in her small chill room in the drafty hotel that lorenas thoughts returned to the dead woman and the funeral she remembered the young whore who could sing soprano and a deep sadness came with the memory in a building not far away the young whore with the beautiful voice was back being a whore the churchwomen who had spoken to her at the funeral wouldnt allow themselves to speak to her in their daytoday lives she was just one of tinkersleys whores as lorena herself had been once the only thing that was true in the four hymns the girl had sung was the music itself lorena thought neither the whore nor the dead woman over whose grave shed sung had received any grace at all to draw upon nor did they have any rock to stand on nor any circle to shelter or protect them as to the home beyond the river lorena didnt know she just wanted to find her husband and bring her children back from nebraska she wanted the six humans she was responsible for to be back again in their home where she could watch over them at the telegraph office in the late afternoon she had been given one good piece of information by the elderly fellow who worked the telegraph several telegrams had poured in for captain call instructing him to hurry to san angelo joey garza had struck there only the week before the next morning at breakfastshe was the only woman in the small hotel dining room lorena happened to overhear a conversation that sent her heart leaping two texas rangers were at a table talking and she heard the name call mentioned the rangers had looked at her hard when they walked in and saw her alone in the dining room but lorena had not sent her children away and traveled so far to be balked by hard looks from lawmen she got up and went over to their table excuse me i heard you mention captain call she said my husband is his deputy id be grateful if youd give me any news of the group the men looked surprised the larger one rattled his spoon in his coffee cup he was uncomfortable talking to women in public places dont know much maam he said finally call nearly killed a sheriff in presidio they dont know yet whether the man will live call was getting his deputy out of jail and just went wild he got his deputy and an old indian he uses to track down bandits thats my husband he oughtnt to have been in jail hes never broken the law lorena said well you dont have to break much law out in joe doniphans part of the country the large ranger said hed arrest you for spittin if he didnt like your looks i guess captain call didnt like his looks the other ranger said thank you i appreciate the news lorena said politely she went back to her table in a happier frame of mind pea was alive and with the captain she didnt like the captain but he was able enough he would protect pea until she found him when the two rangers left the room they didnt look at lorena so hard they even stopped for a moment and tipped their hats the evening of the second day as the party traveled east from presidio call brookshire the two deputies and famous shoes climbed out of the maravilla canyon just at dusk and made a camp the winter sun was filling the canyon behind them with red light that old man who kills bears is coming with his dogs famous shoes remarked i saw his track on the salt fork of the brazos but then he was going north i did not expect him to be coming this way if its ben lily he dont ask nobodys opinion when he changes directions pea eye said twice the old bear hunter had turned up at their farmhouse on the red river on his way to kill cougars in the palo duro canyon he had killed the last bears in the palo duro years before but there were many cougars and from time to time ben lily rested from his lifelong bear hunt and killed cougars for a while instead ill feed him but i wont feed his dogs call said it dont take that many dogs to run lions and i doubt theres any bears left in texas for him to run hes killed them all a few minutes later they heard the baying of six or seven dogs in the still silent night it was hard to tell how far away ben lily and his dog pack might be he is like me no horse famous shoes said i doubt he can finish off the lions in the time he has left he is an old man whos this brookshire asked he had never heard of the person they were talking about though that fact was not particularly odd six months ago he had scarcely even heard of texas and could not have named one living texan now he knew several texans in person and several more by reputation hes a hunter he dont do nothing else pea eye said i dont guess he ever has done nothing else they say he hunted all the bears out of louisiana and arkansas before he come here deputy plunkert said since leaving presidio the deputy had been in a lighter mood they were on their way to san angelo which was not that long a distance from laredo if they were successful and captured the garza boy promptly he might be on his way home within two weeks just being north of the border made him feel a lot better about life once he got home he meant to plan his life so that he never had to enter mexico again if necessary he and doobie would move north to san antonio or even austin to avoid the possibility that anything would require him to cross the border again as the winter night deepened and the halfmoon rose they heard the baying of ben lilys dogs coming closer if the man travels so much maybe hell know something brookshire suggested hes coming from the east and the last robbery was east unless theres been one we dont know about no he wont know anything he only pays attention to bears and lions call said humans dont interest him if he was on the track of a bear or cougar and a train was being robbed right in front of him i doubt hed even stop to look many times over the years call had encountered the hunter but on no occasion had he gotten any cooperation from him ben lily expected to get information not give it he had no use for civilizations nor for society nor individuals and was even impatient with his dogs all he liked to do was kill bears he only hunted lions to pass the time or to earn a little money now and then from ranchers who wanted lions or wolves cleaned off their ranches toward midnight the horses and mules began to snort and whinny they pulled at their picket ropes call got up and went to quiet the animals and when he had them calm he walked east about a mile meaning to intercept the dogs ben lily usually traveled with a pack of eight or ten and eight or ten dogs running into camp might spook the horses so badly that one or two might injure themselves call had only a sidearm with him he did not expect trouble ben lilys dogs were usually shy of humans since they rarely saw any other than the old hunter himself calls hands were aching he wished he had a little whiskey although he had never been a drinker really augustus his old partner had been the drinker but in the last few winters particularly if he happened to be at home in his shack on the goodnight ranch call had taken to using a glass or two of whiskey in order to help him sleep a doctor in amarillo had assured him that a glass or two would be medicinal even with the whiskey he frequently awoke as early as two am and had little to do but pace around the cabin until dawn came the next whiskey to be had was at judge roy beans saloon three days away call had not yet decided whether to pay the judge a visit he wasnt quite as uncooperative as ben lilynobody was as uncooperative as ben lilybut he ran him a close race roy bean was cranky and in his conversation he never strayed far from the subject of money on the other hand little that occurred on the border escaped his attention a visit to roy bean would take them out of their way the train had been robbed near san angelo but of course the garza boy had time to be back in mexico or perhaps back in crow town depending on which way he had felt inclined to go the next train stopped by the boy might be leaving saltillo or tucumcari or almost anywhere while call was thinking of roy bean and his harsh tongue the dogs began to bay again this time they sounded farther away than they had the last time they howled perhaps they were running ahead of the old hunter on the spoor of a lion and maybe the lion had doubled back just as call was settling down to enjoy his solitudehe still liked to separate himself from the camp for an hour or two at nightfamous shoes came walking through the moonlight call felt a little irritated he needed his solitary hours they helped him clear his head and think through the next few days of whatever campaign he was waging why wouldnt the old indian stay put call slept little but famous shoes who was older slept even less now those dogs are going east famous shoes said i think they must be chasing a mule deer no they would have run it down by now if it was a mule deer call said that many dogs will run a mule deer to death pretty quick famous shoes ignored the correction which he thought invalid it could well be a large wellfed mule deer who was not ready to die just because ben lily had come along with his dogs the mule deer might have had a long start too but famous shoes saw no point in arguing with the captain call did not accept argument from his men or from anyone they could be after those two wolves whose tracks i saw this morning he replied the dogs might be running those wolves famous shoes had just stopped speaking when they heard the sound of gunshots coming from the direction where they had last heard the dogs there were many gunshots in the indian days call had been competent at counting gunshots for it was a way of estimating the enemys strength but he was out of practice he would have guessed that about forty shots were fired in a lull they heard the yelping of one of the dogs it had been wounded in the gunfight probably there were four or five more gunshots scattered and then silence somebody shot those dogs thats what i think famous shoes said he was a little agitated the flurry of shots had been an unwelcome surprise it took several men to shoot that many dogs so rapidly but what kind of men would shoot dogs in the middle of the night listen a minute call said they could have been shooting at whatever the dogs were chasing if thats it they werent ben lilys dogs ben lily travels alone and shoots a rifle what we heard were mainly pistol shots they listened for fifteen minutes there were no more gunshots and no dogs howled they probably shot the dogs id like to know why call said lets go to camp when call got back to camp all three men were sound asleep probably that was because the weather had warmed up for the first time they werent so freezing cold call expected no better of brookshire or deputy plunkert but he was irritated with pea eye it was a small lapse but a lapse nonetheless as long as he and pea eye had been camping together they had consulted about night dutieswho would sleep first who would sleep second never before no matter how tired he might be had pea eye just gone to sleep without discussing these arrangements of course call had lapsed himself by leaving the camp without assigning a watch but he had done that often through the years and when he did it pea eye always stayed awake until he returned it wasnt like pea eye going to sleep in dangerous country it made call wonder if urging pea eye to leave his family and join him had really been wise he had done it from habit pea eye was the last of his men and one of the few people call trusted it had seemed natural to call on him and it had disturbed him when pea eye refused to come now he found that having him along disturbed him almost as much pea eye wasnt behaving like himself it might be because he was no longer the ranger that call had known and counted on for so long he was a farmer and a husband with the habits of a farmer and a husband rather than the habits of a fighting man probably pea eye had been right in deciding to stay with his family loyalty had made him change his mind but foolishly and too late if he wasnt going to be able to be the competent ranger he had been then staying home was the better choice pea eye woke up the minute captain call reentered the camp and immediately realized that he had been derelict oh dern i dropped off he said i intended to stand watch well famous shoes was up and so was i call said somebody just shot ben lilys dog pack if them dogs weve been hearing really belonged to ben lily if they werent id like to know who would be running in these parts with eight or ten dogs pea eye felt such embarrassment at having gone to sleep that he scarcely attended to what the captain was saying he had no intention of going to sleep when the captain left the camp the captain always left the camp for an hour or two in the evening when he returned the two of them would work out watch duties for what remained of the night pea eye usually stood the first watch but this evening he had simply gone to sleep the captain didnt mention it he had even been polite enough to change the subject but pea eye knew he would remember it the very fact that he hadnt been reprimanded made pea eye feel at a loss in fact he had been feeling at a loss from the moment the captain led them out of presidio pea eye should have been feeling fine with famous shoes help he had been able to connect with the captain with only a minimum of travel the garza boy was probably east of them now the whole job might be over soon and he could go right home back to lorie and the children but pea eye didnt feel fine he felt awkward maybe he had irritated the captain too much by refusing to go with him initially maybe the captain as he got older was becoming even harder to please at no time had he been easy to please but whatever it was there was a difference in the way he and the captain were and it made pea eye all the more homesick he felt he had been foolish after all to leave home the captain had promptly recruited another deputy and he had the yankee brookshire as well the yankee seemed to be fairly competent he had made the campfires both nights and had done it well the other deputy was no good at packing horses or mules but was handy enough at unpacking them there was not much for pea eye to do standing watch was one area where his experience would have been useful but he had gone right off to sleep and hadnt even heard the shots that killed ben lilys dogs if they were ben lilys dogs all this made pea eye feel gloomy he felt that he had stopped knowing how to be useful he often felt that way at home too lorie was as good at what she did as the captain was at what he did pea eye wasnt as good as either one of them at anything it made him wonder why the captain had wanted him along in the first place call was sufficiently alarmed by the sound of so much gunfire that he woke brookshire and deputy plunkert he also put out the fire in the brilliant darkness on the long plain even a speck of fire as small as theirs could be spotted by an experienced eye from many miles away as many miles at least as an experienced ear could hear a dog bark call could sometimes distinguish calibers of weapons if the firing was slow but the men who shot the dogs hadnt been firing slow the forty shots had been fired in a minute or two call thought he heard six or seven guns but that was a guess there could have been ten or more or there could have been only three or four famous shoes had not returned to camp the man seldom waited for instructions and he was apt to rove all night when he was on a scout wheres our indian brookshire asked he had taken a liking to the old man although he wasnt exactly businesslike when he noticed that brookshire had a book or two in his baggage famous shoes had started pestering him to teach him to read the old man seemed to think it was something he could start doing immediately if only he were given the right clues famous shoes had even insisted that brookshire dismount so he could show the yankee a number of animal tracks and identify them he seemed to think that brookshire ought to be able to instruct him in reading just as quickly when brookshire attempted to explain that the two things werent the same famous shoes became irritated then brookshire made the mistake of mentioning sentences famous shoes immediately started asking him to explain what sentences were brookshire felt sure that he knew what a sentence was but he found it damnably difficult to explain the sentence to the old indian he liked the old man though it astonished him that a man famous shoes age could travel faster on foot than the rest of them traveled horseback he stayed ahead of them all day moving at his strange little trot the four of them watched the rest of the night but there was no more shooting about dawn call thought he heard something a kind of cry or keening but he couldnt figure out what might be making it could it be an eagle he asked pea eye they say eagles scream but ive never heard one pea eye heard the sound only faintly he had no idea what it was before it was fully light call had them headed toward the east what about famous shoes brookshire asked shouldnt we wait for him hes a tracker we dont have to wait for him call said hell find us famous shoes did find them about an hour later he was down in a little ravine and he had ben lily with him the old hunter was shaggy filthy and mad it was the manburner famous shoes said as he trotted up out of the ravine he has seven men with him he burnt my best dog ben lily said kilt all nine of them and burnt one alive thats what we heard i guess call said thats the sound a dog makes when its being burned alive he wanted to burn me ben lily said i hid in a snake den his men shot my dogs they roped old flop and burnt him not to eat though famous shoes said you can seethe dog is a little ways ahead ben lily sat on a rock unkempt and bewildered call offered to let him ride one of the pack horses if he wanted to come with them but the old man didnt even answer he sat on the rock shaking his head and mumbling i think hes gone loco famous shoes said quietly to call hes always been loco call said now hes old and hes lost his dogs if i were him id quit but i aint him call went over to the old hunter who seemed stunned by the calamity that had befallen him in the night he held an old winchester apart from two cartridge belts he seemed to have no equipment ben lily was reputed to be an exceptional shot exceptional enough to have killed more than two thousand bears and an unreckoned number of mountain lions call remembered him as having keen mean eyes this morning his eyes seemed vague he burnt old flop ben lily said old flop was my best dog youre lucky he didnt burn you mr lily call said youd better follow along with us for a day or two until we know where he is and where hes going next time you might not make it to the snake den the old man shook his head he wore a ragged cap which looked as if it had been made from a wolf skin he kept putting it on and then taking it back off im going to santa fe he said i got to get some new dogs you wont need them if mox mox catches you call said you better come with us until we stop him i got to get some dogs ben lily repeated i cant run no bears or tree no lions without some dogs i cant take you against your will mr lily but youd be wiser to come with us call said this mans not your ordinary killer hes the manburner ben lily paid no attention he was looking to the southwest toward the distant mountains his eyes seemed blurred and tired but call supposed they might clear quickly enough if he had a lion or better yet a bear in his sights them mountains are full of lions but there aint no bear he said i be going on to wyoming i guess theres bear up there in wyoming he stood up and looked around as if surprised to see that he was among people and not dogs that killer kilt my dogs he repeated i best go to santa fe his eyes turned to the northwest he stared at the distances you could go with us to roy beans call suggested he usually has a few dogs no i dont like bean ben lily said his dogs are just hounds one mean lion could run them all off i wont hunt with dogs that run from lions be careful then call said but the old man either didnt hear him or didnt care to respond he put his winchester on his shoulder and climbed out of the ravine heading north though he seemed stiff in his movements he kept moving north and was soon out of sight brookshire couldnt get used to the way people behaved in the west the old man had no blanket or kit of any kind no doubt he had matches somewhere about his person but otherwise he was setting out to walk hundreds of miles in the wintertime with nothing but a gun and two cartridge belts and in country where there were at least two deadly killers on the loose he just hunts brookshire asked yes all his life call said i never heard of him doing anything else if he was born today hed have to do something else deputy plunkert said there wouldnt be enough varmints to satisfy him ive never even seen a wild bear the circus come once and it had a little bear but it was tame youre right call said mr lilys worked himself out of a job where bears are concerned unless he heads for alaska call felt some sadness as he watched ben lily disappear into the sage and the distance his rifle on his shoulder it was unlikely that he would ever see the old man again call had never liked him really the two of them had probably not exchanged a hundred words in all their various brief meetings over the years ben lily would talk of nothing except what he was hunting at the time and call hunted only for practical purposes and had nothing to say about it but ben lily was one of the old ones of the west ben lily and goodnight and roy bean and a few others none of them were particularly likable although charles goodnight had become friendlier than call had ever expected him to be but all of them and those like them who had fallengus mccrae and old kit carson the bent brothers shanghai pierce and captain marcyhad been part of the adventure gus mccrae had declared the adventure over before the hat creek outfit had ever crossed the yellowstone a few days after he said it he had gone off adventuring and been killed gus had been both right and wrong the exploring part of the adventure had ended but not the settling part and settling in the time of the comanche and the cheyenne and the apache had plenty of adventure in it now the settling had happened ben lily and goodnight and roy bean and he supposed himselffor he too had become one of the old ones of the westwere just echoes of what had been when lily fell and goodnight and bean and himself there wouldnt even be echoes just memories call mounted up feeling that he had begun to miss ben lily a man he had never liked yet a time or two in his life he had even missed enemies kicking bird the comanche chief was one missing gus mccrae a lifelong friend was one thing missing ben lily was something else again it made call feel that he had outlived his time something he had never expected to do now he had begun to listen for echoes an unhealthy form of distraction when there were still men in the country who burned people and dogs it was an unhappy thought but soon it might be that the bad men the wes hardins and the mox moxes would be all that was left of the west as it had been the bad men in the end were the ones who wouldnt settle a few miles farther on famous shoes showed them the burned dog it was largepart mastiff call reckoned its four feet had been tied together and its mouth wired shut the fire hadnt been hot enough to consume the animal but it had been thoroughly seared even its teeth were black brookshire looked at the dog got off his horse and threw up deputy plunkert took one quick look and rode on by he stopped fifty yards farther on but kept his back to the group pea eye looked and felt more than ever at a loss he had seen far worse sights than a burned dog in his days with the rangers and he knew men did bad things to other men that was an old lesson learned and learned well in the indian wars pea eye realized that he was just tired of it tired of such sights and such memories he had been feeling tired since hed had to help pull captain call off sheriff doniphan pea eye didnt want to see the captain beat a person to within an inch of his life even if the person deserved it as the sheriff had he didnt want to see burnt dogs or burnt people or people with bad gunshot wounds in the belly or any of that what he wanted to see was lorena his wife nursing their baby at the breakfast table he wanted to see his three little boys and his big girl clarie his big girl that all the boys were already wanting to court he wanted to hold his wife in his arms not bury corpses of people killed by outlaws it was time for all that to be over it should have already been over at least where he was concerned he had never had the appetite for it and now he really didnt have the time for it either he had different work to do famous shoes studied the tracks for a while and call dismounted and took a look too the tracks went easteight men and two extra horses they dont hurry famous shoes remarked no i guess they wouldnt call said if they hurried they might miss something mox mox wants to burn he felt uncertain as to how to proceed the killers were within twentyfive miles of them probably and there were eight of them if mox mox would take the time to stop and burn ben lilys dog then killing was probably their main object though no doubt they would rob too when the opportunity arose calls instinct was to go after mox mox at once it wasnt the job he had been hired to do but mox mox was between him and the job he had been hired to do besides the eight killers were a danger to anyone they encountered wherever they were if they had the leisure to burn a dog they were not expecting either resistance or pursuit call was traveling with a largely untried troop though pea eye would probably fight well enough when the time camehe always hadbut the others might just get in the way brookshire had indulged in a good deal of target practice on the trip he was a fair shot at stationary targets but of course he had never shot at a living target much less one that could shoot back at him deputy plunkert was also a question mark by his own admission he had scarcely left laredo in his whole life what he would do in a running fight was anybodys guess get himself killed probably the manburner has a big man with him famous shoes said he had found a track that was as deep as any track he had ever seen his horse is tired from carrying him thats good big men make easy targets call said once we shoot the big one well only have seven to worry about we wont be so badly outnumbered brookshire felt that the clock of his life had run backward to the time of the war the sight of the burned dog did it in the war the sight of dead horses some of them scorched some with their stomachs burst open or their innards spilled upset him more than seeing the bodies of men he didnt know why they upset him more they just did in the time he had traveled with the captain brookshire had thought often about their quarry joey garza joey had killed and in fact he killed often but he killed with a bullet it scared him to think of joey crouched behind a rock somewhere looking at him through a telescope sight ready to end his life with a bullet still it was a bullet katie dying of her sickness probably suffered more than he would suffer if joey garza did kill him but the man who had burned the dog this mox mox was different joey was a killer mox mox must be a maniac brookshire had observed captain call over a fair stretch of time and had much confidence in his abilities the man was a little stiff in the morning but he kept going he had no tendency to recklessness that brookshire could detect he consulted brookshire fully when there were decisions to be made brookshire had confidence in the captains ability to locate and subdue joey garza he thought call could do it and do it handily but mox mox was a maniac and he had seven men with him he wasnt interested in killing with bullets either what he was doing went beyond stopped trains passengers who lost their valuables and colonel terrys profits the thought of joey garza left brookshire scared but the thought of mox mox left him terrified call knew he had a ticklish decision to make he could keep the men with him try to catch up with mox mox and hit him in force such as the force was or he could go alone and hope to ambush mox mox and the men himself the fact that he would be one against eight didnt disturb him much very few men could fight effectively and of the eight there might be only one who was formidable blue duck had been formidable but from what call could remember of the goodnight trouble mox mox had merely been mean no one seemed to think much of his abilities as a killer he had led goodnight a merry chase and had eluded him but in that instance he had a weeks start the main problem in attacking mox mox and his men alone was to determine which one had the ability that was the man to kill first his only source of information at the moment was famous shoes the old tracker had walked off to the east and was squatting on his heels smoking call loped out to where he rested it was time to decide hes got a giant with him you said call remarked who else has he got three mexicans who spur their horses too much famous shoes said their horses jump when they spur them the manburner himself is small he makes little tracks when he is burning something thats three mexicans the giant and the manburner call said thats five what about the other three theres a cherokee famous shoes said he has the best horse and his horse is not tired what makes you think hes cherokee call asked because i know him famous shoes said i tracked him once before he stole a woman that quanah parker wanted to marry his name is jimmy cumsa he is very quick i tracked him two years ago and he is still riding the same horse he takes good care of his horse i think he is a better killer than the manburner if you tracked him why didnt quanah get him call asked i dont know famous shoes said i tracked him to taos pueblo but quanah had to go somewhere on a train for many days i think he went to see the president when he came back he was too busy to go get jimmy cumsa that leaves two call said i dont know where the last two come from famous shoes admitted one rides a pacing horsehe is not a good rider and his horse is not strong the other man is small he rides a little ways apart maybe the manburner doesnt like him too much the other men came and joined them brookshire looked sick deputy plunkert looked scared pea eye was calm enough but it was clear to call that the mans heart wasnt in what he was doing call decided not to leave the men when the time came to strike mox mox he would leave them but he wanted them to be in a more protected place before he left if he sent them alone to roy beans with famous shoes to guide them they might make it and they might not even if they traveled by night they would be vulnerable ben lily had been traveling by night and he had still lost his dogs and nearly his life well go to beans call said well find out what he knows then i may separate from you for a few days and see what i can do about these killers they started at once but all morning call felt torn he felt he should break off and go while he was so close to the killers but he feared for the men they were all grown men and he should let them fend for themselves hed often had to leave men in dangerous situations this time though he didnt feel he should leave them he didnt want to come back and find them burnt like ben lilys dog brookshire was relieved when the captain said he would stay with them looking around him he could see nothing but an endless distance it seemed that the west just kept opening around him into greater and ever greater distances when he thought the horizons could get no farther away he awoke to horizons that were yet farther brookshire had a compass but he didnt use it captain call was his compass without him brookshire doubted that he could find the will to keep himself going across the empty country toward the dim horizon he would simply stop at some point he would just stop and sit down and wait to be dead also he had seen the burnt dog if the captain left them it wouldnt be simply a matter of keeping going of pursuing the long horizons until they yielded up a town a place where there might be a hotel and a train it was no longer just the emptiness and the blowingaway feeling that brookshire had to fearnot anymore the manburner was there probably he was within the vast rim of horizon that encircled them at that very moment brookshire felt deeply grateful to the captain for staying with them he had come to feel that he might not mind dying so much if dying just meant a bullet but brookshire had seen ben lilys dog he did not want to die as the dog had died he did not want to be burnt that indian owes me a nickelif hes on your payroll fork it over roy bean said before call and his party had even dismounted he was sitting in the weak winter sunlight outside his saloon wrapped in a buffalo robe he had a cocked pistol in one hand and a rifle across his lap the rifle barrel stuck out from under the robe a shotgun was propped against the wall of the saloon within easy reach what sort of drink would only cost a nickel call inquired he dont owe me for a drink he owes me for some lotion the judge said he come up lame one time and i let him rub some lotion on his foot and forgot to charge him for it it was a fine lotion it cures all ills except a weak pecker call gave roy bean the nickel until he was paid his full bill whatever it might be there would be little chance that he would dispense much information i stepped on a little cactus with thorns like the snakes tooth famous shoes said he gave me some of his lotion and i am still walking i will pay the nickel although i dont have it with me right now brookshires boss will pay the nickel call said not surprised that the first thing they received at the jersey lily saloon was a bill of several years standing put it in your ledger brookshire call said im sure your colonel will be glad to contribute a nickel to the man who kept our tracker healthy brookshire had lost interest in the ledger and had not kept it current although they had made substantial purchases in presidio he had on one or two occasions even torn pages out of it and used them to help get the campfires started somewhere along the rio concho he had stopped feeling that he lived in a world where ledgers mattered colonel terry still belonged to that world and would always belong to it the colonel like the old judge would be quick to demand his nickel even his penny but brookshire had passed beyond the world of ledgers into a world of space and wind of icy nights and brilliant stars of men who killed with bullets and men who burned dogs in order to keep his accounts at night brookshire would usually have had to thaw out the ink and then thaw out his fingers sufficiently to be able to write it was hard to see the lines on a ledger by the light of a small campfire and it was hard to be correct in ones penmanship when ones fingers were frozen the colonel was a stickler for good penmanship too he didnt like to squint or puzzle over entries when he was examining a ledger and he had said so many times now looking back into mexico from the front of judge beans saloon the colonels strictures no longer seemed to matter brookshire had other disciplines to concern himself with such as making campfires that would last the night without wasting wood captain call was as strict about campfires as the colonel was about penmanship are you expecting a war party call asked the judge you seem to be thoroughly armed i expect perdition always have the judge replied i keep this building at my back and several guns handy in case perdition arrives in a form thats susceptible to bullets i expect it will come in the disease form though im susceptible to diseases and you cant shoot a goddamn disease if this is still a saloon wed like whiskey call said weve had a cool ride they had scarcely left the canyon before another norther had sung in behind them the cold cut them badly although they rode with their backs to the wind the judge reluctantly took them inside the saloon once settled warmly into his buffalo robe he hated to be disturbed most conversations even in the coldest weather were conducted outside with him speaking from inside his robe the saloon had only one table and it was so tilted on its crooked legs that a drink placed on the uphill side would quickly slide to the downhill side and off onto the floor unless the drinker kept a grip on his glass call bought whiskey for everyone only pea eye refrained lorena was very severe with him in the matter of drink in his lonely cowboy days in montana he had taken to drinking for an hour or two every evening once married he continued the practice for a while from nervousness but lorena soon put her foot down since the day she had put her foot down pea eye had very few drinks norther or no norther he did take a beer though fortunately judge bean had a few famous shoes requested tequilathe judge also had plenty of that substanceand drank almost a pint as if he were drinking water deputy plunkert fell asleep just as the judge was refilling his whiskey glass it promptly slid toward the edge of the table but the judge himself caught it at the last minute ill pour this back in the bottle until your man wakes up roy bean said the judge had quick crafty eyes rumor had always placed him on the wrong side of the law call had not been the only one surprised when roy bean assumed his judgeship to be fair though no one seemed to quite know what laws the new judge had broken some thought he smuggled gold for powerful mexicans others thought he stole gold from the same mexicans call thought the gold rumors were probably exaggerations for one thing roy bean lived a long way from anyplace where gold could be used or deposited and gold was heavy to call roy bean had more the manner of a skillful gambler becoming a judge in a region where few people had much fondness for the law was in itself a gamble i hope you catch the garza boy next week roy bean said this week wouldnt be too soon neither ill catch him but i doubt it will be this week call said the last train he robbed was near san angelo and i imagine he kept traveling well have to see if famous shoes can pick up his track there are very few competent marksmen in this part of the country roy bean said this boy is a competent marksman and hes affecting my profits the truth is my profits are way down he added glumly oh hows that call asked the garza boy shoots people who might come here and drink the judge replied theres other problems too i used to be able to sit outside and concentrate on business matters without having to worry that somebody a mile away on a hill might plug me while im concentrating theres no hill within a mile of you and half a mile would be a more likely distance for a rifle shot anyway call said no rifle ive ever seen will shoot accurately much farther than half a mile yes but you aint a competent marksman yourself and you dont know everything roy bean said sharply charlie goodnight has always thought he knew everything and so did your damn partner and so do you well ive known a few fine shots call replied mildly ive never known you to worry about killers before there are safer places to live than along this border if youre the sort to let killers disturb your naps i have weathered a number of killers but i resent mexican boys with rifles that can shoot that far roy bean said if you catch him for me ill hang him in a wink that boy aint the only reason you ought to start napping indoors with your door locked call said have you heard of mox mox yes wes hardin said he was around roy bean said whos he singed now ben lilys best dog call replied not flop roy bean said visibly startled why would the sonofabitch burn a dog why would he burn a person call asked because he likes to thats why did he get ben the judge asked no but they killed every dog he had call said im thinking of going after him first before he causes any more harm go get him roy bean said leave these men here they look like they need to thaw out ill cut the whiskey to half price while theyre visiting with me guarding you you mean call thought but he didnt say it mox mox has seven men with him call remarked hardin says the cherokee boy is the only one with any fight roy bean said take a slow aim and eliminate him first that would be my advice quick jimmy famous shoes said yes hardin said he had a rapid way about him roy bean said i didnt know you were friends with john wesley hardin call said i aintnobody is roy bean replied he come down here to see if i had a whore joey garzas ma went to crow town and walked off with all the women hardin got restless for a whore and came to see me when call asked last week bean said he says crow towns emptied out since the women left joey garzas mother went to crow town and took the women call said took them and went where with them she wasnt home when we came through ojinaga billy williams was looking after her other children she has a pretty little girl but the child is blind i aint met the woman but i expect shes a beauty roy bean said billys been in love with her most of his life but she wont bend olin roys partial to her too but she wont have olin neither i would have thought huerta or somebody would have finished olin by now call said dabbling in mexican finance is chancy work call remembered the little blind girl with the quick expresion standing with billy williams he rarely noticed children but he not only remembered the blind girl he could picture her vividly in his mind he wondered about the mother few women would be bold enough to go to crow town this woman had not only gone she had led the women of the community away she had produced the blind girl the idiot boy and joey and if bean was to be believed had captured and held the affections of billy williams and olin roy two men who had not been noted for the constancy of their attachments olin was a smuggler who spoke good spanish and billy williams was more or less a roving drunk still some women seemed to be able to get holds on the most unlikely men pea eye for example had never seemed to be the marrying kind he had never sought out women that call could remember when they were in towns but here was pea eye married and happily so it seemed i dont understand the business about the women call said she just rode into town and rode out with them nope bean said she rode in on a spotted pony but joey stole it and left her afoot she and the women walked out i met her on the road when she was almost there famous shoes remarked she got very cold in the sleet storm crossing the pecos i built her a fire but she was angry with me and wouldnt let me stay did she know you were working for me call asked yes and she dont want you to kill joey famous shoes said she dont want me to track him for you i didnt know you knew her call said her name is maria famous shoes said she saved my life the first time the hard sheriff wanted to hang me she was too angry when i met her this time he repeated i built the fire and left her hes an ungrateful son if he stole her horse and left her afoot in a place like crow town call said not many women would ride into crow town or cross the dern pecos either pea eye said not when its icy id call that brave well the boy is her son call said even if he stole her horse you cant expect her to want him dead i dont know the womanshe can like it or lump it roy bean said her sons a thieving murdering lawbreaker you better go catch him and plow mox mox under too if you have the time this is your jurisdiction judge call reminded him i was just hired to catch joey garza what id like to know is where his mother took the women wesley said she took em to the railroad roy bean said he was upset he said he would have shot her on sight if hed known she was going to take away the whores where is hardin while were talking about killers call asked no ideahe left roy bean said i aint his butler the judge had produced one bottle of brandy and asked an inordinate price for it but brookshire bought it anyway he drank it until the edges of the little room became blurred which didnt take long now the captain was talking about yet another killer a famous one this time even in brooklyn there were people who had heard of john wesley hardin brookshire kept drinking the brandy he drank until he could hardly see the captain who was sitting not two feet from him deputy plunkert was snoring the warmth of the room had put him right to sleep it seemed to brookshire that they were traveling in circles every curve took them farther from civilization and produced another killer the whole thing had started with a train robbery now it involved three men who among them had killed the equivalent of a company of soldiers killers were multiplying whereas captain call wasnt there was still only one of him they say the garza boy has a cave full of valuables down in mexico roy bean said they say he takes everything he steals and hides it there i expect thats a rumor call said its nice to think about though bean said if i could find myself a cave full of treasure i could retire from the bench and move to england and if i was in england i could watch miss lily langtry perform on the stage every night of the week call paid no more attention to judge bean the only interesting information he possessed came from john wesley hardin and it concerned joey garzas mother if there was a way to find joey it probably involved the mother not the cave sooner or later joey might come home the fact that he had stolen his mothers horse might not mean much mothers had been known to overlook worse behavior than that joey might decide to bring the pony back someday he knew he was being chased and might want his mother to hide him soon all the company was asleep except for pea eye famous shoes had drunk a second pint of tequila he curled up under the table and slept soundly brookshire was out his head fallen into his arms deputy plunkert was snoring soundly his head tipped so far to one side that his hat had fallen off pea whod had only one beer seemed a little glum but he was not drunk the smelly old judge had taken his buffalo robe and gone back outside call motioned to pea eye and the two of them went out into the cold air im going to split off call said i hate to do it but weve got two different threats to deal with and i dont think theyll line themselves up like dominoes and wait for us to knock them over hed had a feeling that the captain might be about to leave it always made pea anxious when the captain left to perform some task alone when the captain wasnt around things were apt to go wrong several horses might turn up lame at the same time or a man might develop pleurisy or the hunters might be unable to bring in any game i guess it will upset brookshire pea eye said it was easy to see that brookshire set great store by the captains judgment yes i expect so call said but hes a grown man and he knows how to make a fire youll have to watch that you dont fall asleep on guard duty he added mildly the others havent had your experience you dont want to let anybody slip up on you not with the manburner on the loose pea eye said where do you want us to go go back to where we were only circle down into mexico call said youll be safer at least from mox mox that village just across from presidio is where joey garzas mother lives i think thats where well catch him what if he gets there before you do pea eye asked wait call said circle south of the village and camp on the rio concho about half a day away ill find you that dont sound too hard pea eye said but the melancholy wouldnt leave him it only got stronger the captain was going one way and sending him another it was a sign of trust that the captain would leave him in charge of the men there was nothing exceptional about splitting up a company either that had happened many times in the old days this is not the end of the world lorena often told him when she was trying to boost his spirits after some quarrel or mistake its not the end of the world pea just pick up and keep going pea eye felt that lorena didnt understand how much their fights or his mistakes saddened him she would get busy with the children or start studying her schoolwork and the quarrel would go out of her mind she would become cheerful again so quickly that it would make pea eye feel a little lonely hurts didnt go out of his mind that quickly particularly if he was the cause of them they seemed to settle in his throat like gravel in a chickens craw often his feelings of absence or confusion would linger so long in his breast while lorena and the children went on with their lives moving around him as if he wasnt there that pea eye had a hard time feeling he was in their lives at all he would begin to feel he was just some stranger who happened to be staying where his family lived often too it would not be until the next day when some child jumped in his lap or came to him with a problem that he would recover a sense of being connected to them as the captain went about preparing to leavethey had bought a couple of extra rifles in presidio and the captain took one of them and a good supply of ammunitionpea eye felt the same sadness tightening his throat that he felt at home when lorena tried to assure him that his world wasnt coming to an end lorena could say that to him all she liked but her saying it didnt take away pea eyes feelings that the world might be coming to an end anyway as he grew older he felt more keenly how hard it was to know anyone lorena and the captain in turn let him stay with them and share their lives but lorena and the captain were complete in a way that he wasnt and being complete they didnt realize how partial he felt he was not as good as they were not as smart and not as strong they might know him but he felt he would never be much good at knowing them often in bed at night listening to lorena breathe and feeling her body warming his tears would come to his eyes from the sense that he didnt know his lorena he didnt and he never would he felt grateful though that she was letting him stay with her and glad that they had the children and the farm but it didnt mean that the world wasnt coming to an end or that it wouldnt pea eye didnt attempt to tell the captain how he felt though the captain was preparing to leave and he didnt linger when he had someplace to go ill meet you on the other side of the river call said if i dont have too much aggravation with mox mox i wouldnt think id be gone much more than a week dont neglect any killers roy bean admonished he was swaddled in his buffalo robe the cocked pistol still in his hand you oughtnt to leave that pistol cocked pea eye said as they watched the captain lope away to the east you might have a bad dream and jerk and shoot your knee off it might rain whores out of the sky too but i doubt it roy bean said joey garza watched captain calls departure through a telescope he had taken off the train from san angelo the telescope had belonged to an old man with stringy gray hair who protested so much when joey took it that joey shot him he had not intended to kill anybody when he stopped the train hed only wanted to add to his treasures if the old man had surrendered the telescope peacefully joey wouldnt have killed him the old man claimed to be a teacher he said he taught about the stars and needed the telescope in order to study the stars he was bound for fort davis where the stars were easier to see or so he said he offered to give joey all his money if joey would leave him the telescope you see i cant get another not in these parts the man said i had to send to england for this one joey thought he was just a disagreeable old man so he shot him and took the telescope and the money too apart from two or three good watches the telescope was the only thing on that particular train that joey felt was worth stealing he hoped that by going east closer to the cities of the texans he would find better things on the trains he robbed but if san angelo was any example this theory was no good the train mainly held cowboys who were being sent to some large ranch none of the cowboys had anything of value sometimes joey took fine spurs but the spurs these cowboys wore were of no interest even their saddles were poor so he took the telescope and the little stand that it rested on killed the old man and left that night he used the telescope to look at the stars he had to admit that the old man had been telling the truth the telescope brought the stars much closer when joey pointed it at the moon the results were even better he could see what seemed to be mountains on the moon the surface of the moon looked a little like the country where the apaches had taken him it was pretty bare the best use of the telescope though was to look at men he concealed his mothers spotted pony in a gully before pointing the telescope at roy beans door by adjusting it a little he could see with great clarity he saw the famous captain call come out with his tall friend and get ready to leave he saw the captain take an extra rifle and even saw that judge roy bean kept his pistol cocked it annoyed joey that the captain left his men behind there were four of them three were still inside if they stayed he would have to kill them before he could hang the judge but he didnt want to kill them while the famous bounty hunter captain call was close enough to hear the shots it meant waiting which joey hated he wanted to hang the judge and then follow captain call and shoot him once call was dead he intended to go to ojinaga and steal his brother and sister it bothered him that his mother gave them so much attention he meant to steal them and give them to the manburner if he could find him if the manburner wanted to burn them that was fine with joey they were damaged anyway too damaged to deserve all the attention his mother gave them they were merely the products of her whoring stealing them would show her what he felt about her low behavior if the manburner had no interest in burning them joey meant to take them deep into mexico and give them away to someone who wanted two slaves he would take them so far away that his mother would never find them and if he could find no one who wanted them for slaves he might take them to his cave and throw them off the cliff behind it to his relief the men captain call left at the saloon didnt stay long the tall man went back inside and got them there were two more white men and old famous shoes the two white men looked drunk one of them was so drunk that he had difficulty mounting but eventually they got started famous shoes led them across the river and took them north probably the captain had sent them to catch him when he came home if that was the plan it was silly he might not go home and even if he did white men who were so drunk they couldnt mount their horses were not going to catch him he could ride in and steal his brother and sister while they were in the cantina getting drunk again they would never see him or even know he had been there of course famous shoes might find his tracks and track him joey decided he had better kill famous shoes at some point the old man was the last tracker in mexico capable of tracking him to his cave it would be best to kill him soon before some gringo hired him to find the cave joey knew that the cave was becoming a legend among the gringos soon men would begin to hunt for it but the cave was deep in the mountains up a canyon where horses couldnt go with famous shoes dead the treasure in his cave would be safe for years when captain call and the men had been gone a few hours joey got out his rifle and looked through the telescope at judge roy bean the old man had gone inside and got himself a bottle of whiskey he sat with his back to the building holding his pistol in his lap the whiskey bottle he set on a little rock beside his chair there was a shotgun propped against the wall and a rifle under the buffalo robe the old man had brought some kind of newspaper out of the saloon and was reading it in the fading sunlight it was a large newspaper when the judge held it up to read all joey could see was his legs joey leveled the rifle and shot judge roy bean right through the newspaper low down a belly shot roy bean leapt up and began to fire his rifle wildly as much at the sky as at anything in particular joey shot him in the shoulder so he would not be able to shoot the rifle well and then he shot him in the leg causing him to crumple the old man tried to crawl over to the shotgun propped against the wall but as he reached for it joey shot him in the arm joey was surprised that the old man struggled so after being shot in the belly he was plainly a tough old man but that would only make matters worse for him joey got on his mothers spotted pony and rode up to the saloon he could see the rifle and the shotgun but he couldnt see the pistol joey thought the pistol was probably under the newspaper the judge had been reading when he shot him in the belly the wind was blowing the newspaper away several pages were stuck on prickly pear piles between the saloon and the river roy bean managed to prop up against the wall of the saloon he had his pistol but when he pointed it at joey and tried to shoot the pistol didnt fire the old man was breathing heavily he tried again to shoot the pistol but again the pistol didnt fire the trigger wouldnt pull joey had his own pistol out and was ready to shoot but he didnt want to kill roy bean with a gun if he could avoid it he had other plans roy bean grew so irritated with his pistol that he started hitting it against the wall the joke was on him he knew he had kept the pistol on cock for so long that it had rusted tight it seemed to him that it had been on cock for ten years or morefoolish behavior now the young mexican had him he was bellyshot had a broken shoulder a ruined leg and a smashed arm he couldnt move well enough to get inside his saloon where he had a good stabbing knife the young mexican rode right up to him and made a loop in a rawhide rope you arrogant pup do you plan to hang me go away roy bean said im the one that hangs people around here im the law west of the pecos or aint you heard you damn cub the next moment he was choking so badly he couldnt talk before he even realized the boy was moving joey garza had slipped off his horse flipped the rawhide noose around his neck and jerked it so tight it almost crushed his adams apple roy bean felt a burning anger at woodrow call who could have stayed put with his men for a day or two and given joey garza time to pass on by the boy had outsmarted captain call and now look but the pain in his throat grew so severe that it cut off his anger along with his breath joey got back on his spotted pony and roy bean found himself being pulled up toward the roof of his own saloon the boy had flipped the rawhide rope over the chimney and was backing his horse away pulling the judge slowly upward when his feet left the ground he twisted slightly trying to get a hand under the rawhide rope but the rawhide was unforgiving he felt scalding bile flood his throat roy bean struggled and twisted he felt that if he could just get one breath he might yet struggle out of the noose and live but joey garza slowly backed his horse pulling roy bean higher pulling the noose tighter the rawhide was like steel roy bean twisted again he thought he might crawl up on the roof and get free but he only had one hand his lungs burned badly the air seemed like black water calls man had been right about the pistolhe shouldnt have kept it on cock all those years the mexican boy backed the horse another step pulling him so high that his head mashed against a roof beam that protruded from his wall black water flooded the world where the air should have been when the old mans kicking and twisting began to slow joey got down and carefully gathered up the pages of his newspaper the wind had scattered them badly but joey took his time and got them all there was a bullet hole through the paper and the prickly pear had torn it a little but it was all there joey folded it carefully and put it in his saddlebags there was a picture in it of a lady who wore many jewels maybe someday he would stop a train with a lady on it who had jewels he could take to his cave then he went inside the saloon and looked around hoping old bean owned something worth stealing the old man was still kicking and twistingonce or twice joey heard him thump against the wall there was not much in the saloon though the only thing he found that he considered worth taking was a silver picture frame the frame sat on a whiskey box by the old mans bed the woman whose photograph was in the picture frame seemed to joey to be the same woman whose photograph was in the newspaper the one whose jewels he wanted to study but the light in the little room was dim he wasnt sure he took the picture with him there was nothing in the saloon except cases of whiskey a knife hung on a peg inside the door but it was an old knife its blade had been sharpened so many times that it was as thin as the moon when the moon was only a sliver joey took the knife and used it to cut open roy beans clothes the old man was dead he hung just beside his own doorway joey wanted to see where his first bullet had gone in it had struck just below the navel the old man had been tough as a javelina joey decided not many men would struggle that hard after being shot below the navel before leaving to take up the trail of captain call joey stood up in the saddle and crawled onto the low roof in order to snub the rawhide rope more securely to the chimney he wanted to make sure that judge roy bean would be hanging by his own door when the next traveler showed up at the jersey lily saloon hoping for a drink charles goodnight sat until past midnight studying the fire in his kitchen fireplace winter was always severe on the plains but this winter was unusually severe it drizzled and then froze drizzled and then froze by christmastime there had been three big snows which was rare the cowboys rode long days trying to keep the cattle from drifting too far from his range goodnight himself was in the saddle fifteen hours a day most days his wife mary was gone visiting a sister otherwise he would have been chided for working too hard with mary gone the kitchen was about as much of the house as he needed to use there was a cookstove as well as the fireplace but he rarely cooked himself now and then he singed a beefsteak and ate it with strong coffee muley his ranch cook had a kitchen in the big bunkhouse where the cowhands ate muley like many ranch cooks was intolerant of suggestion or restriction every once in a while when goodnight took a meal with his cowboys he was in the habit of speaking his mind but if goodnight made a habit of eating with his ranch hands too often and putting in his two cents about the food a habit that visibly annoyed muley the result would be that goodnight would rise up someday and fire muley for insubordination it would be a severe aggravation if he had to fire him adequate ranch cooks were at a premium in the panhandle he would have to go to amarillo if not farther to find a replacement the fire in the little kitchen fireplace gutted and blew as the wind sang over the chimney northers had been almost constant for the past month day after day the plains would be coated with a thin sheet of ice as a result of the freezing drizzle goodnight rarely slept more than three hours a night the bulk of the night he spent in the kitchen drinking strong coffee figuring a little and thinking when mary was home she slept her eight hours like a log if she woke at all it was usually to complain that he was burning too much kerosene in the lamp i cant figure in the dark he told her often pointing to his account books nor in broad daylight either mary said figuring aint your strong point charlie if all youre going to do is think then turn off that lamp and sit in the dark and think you dont need light to think by do you often he obeyed rather than quarrel it was dangerous to quarrel with mary when she was sleepy if the quarrel got too vigorous she might wake up in which case she would press the quarrel all through the next day she was capable of pressing one for a week or more if she was aggravated enough such quarrels were a great waste of energy and a good reason for spending as much of life as possible on horseback once a quarrel broke out it was like a prairie fire neither reason nor patience could extinguish it mainly it had to be left to burn itself out many times he had thought such a quarrel burned out only to have it flare up again as a result of some chance remark and consume another hundred acres of his time but mary wasnt there to complain about his extravagant waste of kerosene this time no one was there in rummaging through his desk that afternoon looking for a hardware bill that he had evidently mislaid he came across an old brand book dating from the days long before when he and his partner oliver loving had first ranched in colorado perusing it now in the kitchen with the fire guttering and the wind singing was a chastening experience testament to the uncertainties of the cattle business and of human existence as well not only was his old partner oliver loving dead but so were a large majority of the cattlemen and trail bosses whose brands were recorded in his book those who werent dead had mostly gone bust in the cattle business they were farming now or selling hardware in the small towns scattered about what had once been the great open range many of them had been good and able men competent resourceful and good companions on the trail but they hadnt lasted some got busted up by halfbroken horses some drowned in foolish impatient attempts to cross unfordable rivers others had taken sick and quickly and quietly expired perhaps they worked in the rain and sleet too long the next day they had a sniffle the sniffle became pneumonia and they died the book contained over four hundred brands as he turned through its pages goodnight kept a little tally of those brands that were still active used by the same cattlemen who had used them during the traildriving days he found only eight brands whose owners were still alive and in the cattle business those were the toughest of the tough or the luckiest of the lucky goodnight knew himself to be among the luckiest of the lucky he had fought indians for over twenty years and never received a scratch bullets had killed men fighting at his very elbow but no bullet had ever struck him he had taken herds across almost one hundred waterless miles and not starved he had raced to turn stampedes in pitch darkness over broken country on unreliable horses and had not once fallen or been thrown he had been in barrooms and other crowded situations with outlaws who would shoot you if they didnt like the way you removed your hat yet he had removed his hat pretty much as he pleased and had never been shot he knew he was fortunate not merely because none of his own blood had ever been spilled in battle but because he himself had spilled only a minimum considering the circumstances under which he had to operate he had killed three comanches and one kiowa and hung three determined horse thieves a modest tally by the standards that had prevailed on the frontier in his youth a man like woodrow call a lawman most of his life had far more on his conscience when it came to taking life than he himself had it was call mainly that goodnight had on his mind as he sat in the kitchen by the little fireplace that night after consuming his lightly singed beefsteak he had taken his rifle from behind the door and cleaned it he did the same with a colt he had carried daily until a year or two before when the spread of the settlements had made such a frontier artifact unnecessary unless one was on a trip goodnight knew that it had mainly been the fact that he was there on his ranch with his wife and cowhands that had encouraged the first trickle of settlements into the panhandle thereafter the trickle had increased soon the trickle grew until there were towns and villages and sufficient law that sidearms gradually ceased to be a part of everyday dress all his cowboys still wore pistols of course they claimed they kept them to use on snakes but in fact few of them could shoot well enough with a pistol to hit a rattlesnake in under ten shots at pointblank range the cowboys wore the guns from wilness goodnight supposed they wanted to feel that they were living in a west that was still wild it was harmless nostalgia for the most part as long as they didnt injure themselves or the livestock he put no strictures on their use of firearms but the panhandle was no longer the wild west not by a long shot the cowboys could play and posture all they wanted to adjusting their holsters and practicing fast draws the fact was they were herdsmen not gunfighters and it would be colossal bad luck if their herding ever brought them inffcontact with a real killer of the sort that had once been common in the west if any of his cowboys were that unlucky they would certainly be killed roping and branding and riding pitching horses was no preparation for dealing with deadly men goodnight had cleaned the rifle and oiled up the pistol restlessly with a troubled mind he could not get lorena the young schoolteacher out of his thoughts she had left to find her husband and her husband at goodnights own insistent urgings had left first to go to the assistance of captain call goodnight had a nagging feeling about the whole businessit nagged him so severely that he had scarcely slept for three nights if mary had been home she would have been having conniptions at the thought of all the kerosene he was burning in the kitchen lamp the fact was there still were deadly men in the west and there was a vast space in which they could operate the country between the pecos and the gila was still mostly nomansland its emptiness made it a magnet for killers and at least two of some determination were operating there right now mox mox was probably only a paltry bandit with a few horse thieves for companions but he was the man who had piled brush on four cowboys and burned them to death near pueblo colorado and he had been ready to do the same to lorena the garza boy didnt seem to be as morbid or afflicted with the need to burn but he too was a deadly killer who executed his victims at random and without remorse goodnight felt oppressed by his own thoughts he had made a serious mistake when he hectored pea eye at the blacksmiths in quitaque he had been too blunt and had acted as if things had to be as they had been in the past lorena did not stay a whore no more did her husband have to stay a texas ranger except for the meeting at the blacksmiths these two people both a credit to their little community would be at home with their children the husband farming the wife teaching school and what was most important they would both be safe now they were far from safe they were in the great emptiness of the pecos country where mox mox and the garza boy were too perhaps woodrow call would eliminate the outlaws he had eliminated a good number some of them formidable in his day but he couldnt be everywhere and he couldnt work miracles he was one man trying to find two killers in a big country goodnight had supposed that he was past having to take up the gun he hadnt had a serious encounter with an outlaw in twenty years he had thought that sort of conflict behind him certainly mary thought it behind him if she had been home he would not have been able to clean the rifle without a debate probably vigorous mary believed in professionals cattlemen ought to raise cattle bankers ought to handle money lawmen ought to deal with outlaws and wives ought to run their households without interference from the men but mary wasnt home and anyhow although he had often let mary slow him she had never stopped him not when he felt he had a task that he should do no and god and his lightning bolts dont stop you either charlie mary had observed once when he was about to leave for colorado in uncertain weather the weather was uncertain again but goodnight had never let weather interfere with him no one who worked on the plains could afford to bend to weather if they hoped to accomplish anything at four am goodnight strapped on his pistol put his rifle back in its saddle scabbard and went to the lots to catch his horse it was sleeting again dawn was nearly three hours away but he was restless he had decided to go and was soon saddled and ready there was a light on in the bunkhouse kitchen muley for all his flaws at least wasnt lazy he was in the kitchen arms white with flour making biscuits for the cowboys all of whom were still asleep except his yawning foreman willie bascom who was sitting up in his bunk trying to pull on his stiff boots breakfast aint ready i just got up muley said the minute goodnight stepped in the door fry some bacon i have to leave and i hate to travel on an empty stomach goodnight said i hope that wont interrupt your schedule too much i usually fry the bacon last but i guess youre the boss muley said i was the last time i wrote you a paycheck goodnight said goodnight poured his own coffee since muley hadnt offered to the bacon was soon crackling and spitting grease willie bascom came over and accepted a cup of coffee he had his boots on but did not look happy to be up i didnt think we was branding till tomorrow he said i guess i lost shut of a day no youre branding tomorrow goodnight said i hate to desert but its just the branding you can handle it yourself dont see why not willie bascom said whats taking you off in a sleet storm muley asked another habit he shared with many ranch cooks was inquisitiveness it was not so much that he didnt mind his own business he just didnt recognize that there was any business that wasnt his im going on a wolf hunt goodnight said he finished his bacon and his coffee cowboys were just beginning to crawl out of their bunks these biscuits will be ready in another few minutes muley said you might as well wait and eat a fewyou cant see to shoot a wolf when its this dark anyway no ill have to do without the biscuits goodnight said despite the weather he was impatient to leave he had saddled his best horse a big roan named lacey the horses coat steamed as the snow melted on it he had his pistol on muley remarked once goodnight left thats the last time ill offer him biscuits if hes always going to be in such a hurry its been five years since ive seen him wear his pistol willie bascom said by the time the cowboys finished their breakfast goodnight was many miles to the south the sleet had gotten heavier but he didnt notice he had too much on his mind by the time maria reached ojinaga her feet were badly cut from the icy stony ground since leaving the railroad maria had walked without shoes the train took the seven women east the conductor was reluctant but not so reluctant that he would leave seven women to die in the cold by then marias shoes were gone the wet snow and icy weather cracked them she cut up the bag she had carried the jerky in and wrapped her feet in the sacking but the sacking was thin and wore out within a few miles from then on maria was barefoot she went slowly avoiding cactus trying not to cut herself on rocks or ice her food gave out when she was three days from the river since leaving the railroad she had not seen a single human being the conductor had offered to take her to fort worth what did one more woman matter he told her she was a fool to try to walk to mexico in such weather mox mox had taken two children from a ranch near comstock he could be anywhere any day he might appear with his men and catch her speculation was that he had already burned the children a boy of nine and a girl of six if he caught maria she could expect a hard death the conductor grew irritated with the woman when he saw that she wasnt going to take his advice maria merely looked at him without expression when he offered to take her on the train he didnt like sullen women who was she that she could turn down free passage to fort worth my children dont live in fort worthi would just have to come back maria said she wanted to be polite after all the man had accepted the seven women youve got no shoes the conductor pointed out despite rough travel the mexican woman was goodlooking once she was on the warm train and had some food in her she might become friendlier perhaps she could be persuaded to show her gratitude for what he was doing for her friends youve got no shoes the conductor said again he felt like dragging her onto the train it would be a kindness in the end it might save her life no but i have feet maria said she saw how he was looking at hermen were always men she had intended to ask for a little food but when she saw the conductors look she turned and walked away from the train men were always menshe would have to find food elsewhere but she found no food only the sight of the mountains gave her the strength to keep walking her children were west of the mountains crossing the maravilla canyon was very hard though she had to crawl up the far side the day before maria got home she saw three cowboys in the distance she hid in the sagebrush until they were out of sight they belonged to the big ranch perhaps they would remember her if so it might be hard she was too tired and too weak to be worried with cowboys if they were too hard on her she might forget her children and die she still wanted to take her children to the doctors so that rafaels mind and teresas eyes might be fixed it seemed a big thing to hope for though she was tired and hungry alone and with no money even if she got home she would have no money but it was only her hope for her children however farfetched that hope might seem that kept her will strong and gave her strength to keep putting her torn swollen feet on the hard ground rafael and teresa had no one but her to think ahead for them to consider how their lives might be if she could take them to the great doctors who knew how to cure eyes and fix minds finally maria saw the curve of the river she crossed well below presidio she did not want the hard sheriff to find her just as she was almost home teresa heard her mothers footsteps and went running to her though the chickens squawked loudly at such an interruption rafael stumbled after his sister carrying a young goat he had taken as a pet while maria was still holding her children in the road billy came out and told her that captain call had destroyed the hard sheriff beating him with a rifle thats right billy williams said joe doniphans done for hes had to quit you can walk right through the middle of presidio and not a soul will bother you did you see call maria asked i reckon i did billy said call and a yankee and a deputy from laredo came riding up the concho and stopped right at this house maria saw that her children were healthy teresas hair had not been brushed well and rafaels shirt was not as clean as she would make it when she washed his clothes but they were healthy billy had done a good job maria smiled at him to show that she was not without gratitude since leaving the railroad she had been thinking bad thoughts about men she had left her children with this man and he had cared for them well although she had never been with him in the bed whatever his disappointments he had been decent and he had cared for her children it was a thing she would not forget she meant to try and help billy a little once she was rested he was an old man he drank too much he didnt keep himself clean and he was not very well now though she felt frightened for joey captain call had found her village and even her house did famous shoes bring him here she asked the old tracker was not to be trusted he liked money too much nope never got this far billy said famous shoes and another deputy were in joe doniphans jail when call showed up joe wouldnt let em out he pulled a gun on call and thats when call started whipping him with the rifle barrel did you tell call anything about joey maria asked suspiciously when it came to joey she trusted no one no why would i billy asked do you take me for a lawman im sorry maria said lets go in the house i need to heat some water and i need to eat billy and teresa made her soup she took a little but she felt feverish and did not take much the next day billy killed a baby goatnot rafaels petand fed her some of the tender meat marias fever got worse though for more than a week she tossed with it too weak to get out of her bed billy and teresa cared for her giving her a little soup and bathing her face with cool rags marias mind flew around while the fever burned or chilled her she saw joey hanging from the rock where benito had died in a dream benito came to her as a baby and tried to suck her breast she dreamed about captain call beating the hard sheriff with a rifleonly the hard sheriff changed into joey it was joey who the captain beat when the fever broke and maria could look clearly at the world again billy williams was asleep on the dirt floor by her bed he had a bottle of whiskey beside him but had drunk only a little the bottle had fallen over and whiskey was seeping out billy slept with his mouth open to maria he seemed older than he had seemed when she took the fever he looked gray as if he had no blood it was a chilly morning when maria got up she covered billy williams with the serape she had been using for herself mother a man came and looked at me teresa said she was glad that her mother was out of bed what kind of man maria asked a gringohe is the one who is hunting joey teresa said i could feel him looking at me again maria felt frightened call had destroyed the hard sheriff he was hunting her son what business did he have coming to her house and looking at her daughter go in the house if he comes back maria said dont let him look at you he is a bad man he wants to kill joey dont ever let him look at you he said i was pretty teresa said he didnt do anything bad he was rightyou are pretty maria said she hugged her daughter they sat in a chair by the table rafael came in with his pet goat and sang the goat a little song maria held her daughter in her arms for a long time someday teresa would be a woman but maria didnt want that time to be soon she held her daughter tightly rafael sat down by marias chair holding his goat in his lap maria stroked his hair then she held teresa tightly teresa liked it when her mother held her close in her warm arms maria wished that this could be their life forever just herself and her children sitting in her warm kitchen together if such a time could be the whole of life then life could be happiness if teresa could remain a child in her arms then teresa would never know the deep sorrows of womanhood sorrows as deep as the cold water in the village well she sniffed her daughters neck teresa still smelled like a child she did not smell like a woman yet rafael had stopped changing unless she could find a doctor to fix his mind rafael would always be a boy he would not know many of the sorrows of men but teresa was growing only her eyes were arrested teresa had heard captain calls compliment and remembered it she would not always fit in marias arms and she would not always smell like a little girl maria meant to hold her as long as she could joey might be evil he might be lost rafael might always be young in his mind but teresa was whole she lacked only sight someday she would escape from her mothers arms and walk out in her beauty into the world of sorrows maria didnt want it to be soon call had a sense that someone was behind him but if so it was someone smart after two days the sense was so strong that call doubled back twice if it was the garza boy call might surprise him even if he didnt surprise him he could probably strike his track and determine whether the boy was alone in the course of four days travel he doubled back three more times but he didnt surprise joey garza and he struck no track yet the sense that someone was behind him wouldnt leave him it became a conviction though none of his maneuvers produced the slightest evidence of a pursuer anyone following him would have had to be on horseback and horses left tracks but there were no tracks if it was the garza boy then he was a formidable plainsman in the cold night call rode a circle hoping to glimpse a campfire but there was no campfire either it was vexing because it made him distrust his own instincts maybe he had slipped a notch as a tracker or maybe he had just begun to imagine things never before had he followed his instincts and come up totally empty all he could do was travel cautiously at night he made no fires he slept little and kept his horse saddled and the bridle reins in his hand when he lay down during the day he kept as much space around him as possible he tried to stay a mile or more from any cover that might shelter a killer with a fine rifle and a telescope sight he whirled his horse often hoping to catch a flash of reflection on a spur or a bridle bit but he saw no reflections he was alone yet he knew he wasnt then it occurred to him that perhaps the boy wasnt on horseback perhaps he was a runner like famous shoes or some of the celebrated apaches if so he was bold indeed few men of experience would voluntarily put themselves afoot in such country in the wintertime few would be able to do without fire to rest by in the freezing night calls own hands ached terribly in the mornings three days passed without his even unsaddling his horse he was afraid he might not be able to pull the saddle straps tight again with his sore hands when the horse grazed he walked with him one night he napped on his feet leaning against the horse for warmth he took the trigger guards off both rifles his knuckles were too swollen to fit through them on the fifth day he crossed the trail of mox mox and his men they were traveling toward fort stockton the trail was freshthe gang had just passed in fact to the northwest call did see a flash as the sun struck some piece of equipment call checked the loads in both rifles and took his extra colt out of the saddlebags it was midafternoon he turned northwest on the easily followed track of the killers he put his horse into a lope debating with himself about the timing of his ambush he could try to overtake them that day his mount was fresh enough if he could kill mox mox and the cherokee the others might run but he needed good light to shoot by and he also needed to be close he was not shooting a german rifle with a telescope sight he was confident of his marksmanship but only if the range and the light were favorable if he attacked at night as gus had once attacked blue ducks camp it would all be guesswork and anyhow he had never been as reckless on the attack as gus mccrae within an hour it became apparent that catching up with the gang would be no trouble they were idling along call soon had to drop back and veer west of them to lessen the danger of being observed he decided then to try to close the gap and hit them as they made camp they didnt know he was following them and might not immediately set a guard the outlaws were even lazier than call judged them to be at first it was only a little past midafternoon when they made camp call walked his horse for the last three miles as he approached he was one against eight and he wanted to be as meticulous as possible in what he had to do he could not expect to thunder in and kill eight men or even cripple them sufficiently to remove them as a threat above all he had to try to kill the fighter jimmy cumsa first as call cautiously moved foot by foot to within two hundred yards of the camp he heard a child scream it was a rude surprisemox mox must have taken a child from some farm or ranch in his marauding the outlaws had not even made a campfire yet surely they couldnt be burning the child but the child continued to scream as call crept closer the childs screams rang in calls ears echoing other screams heard years before on one of his first forays against hostile indians when he was a young ranger the troop had surprised a little cluster of comanche on the washita they recovered two young white captives both girls just before the rangers raced down on the camp one of the little girls screamed an old comanche woman was beating her with a stick call shot the old woman the only female he ever killed in his years of battle the little girls had lost their minds from the cold and the beatings the one the old woman was beating recovered and married the other one was never right when call got close enough to look over a low ridge down into the camp where the child was screaming he saw that mox mox had two children a boy and a girl they were bound together by a short length of chain mox mox was quirting the boy savagely whipping him in the face the little girl seemed too terrified to even whimper but the boy screamed every time the quirt struck him call looked first for jimmy cumsa but saw at once that he had no clean shot at himthe cherokee was among the horses preparing to hobble them for the night the three mexicans the giant and a small man were standing idle easy targets but the giant was standing between call and mox mox watching him quirt the child the eighth man call couldnt immediately see which worried him call had never seen a man beat a child so savagely what the old comanche woman on the washita had done to the young girl was merely rough compared to the whipping he was witnessing call felt he had to act quickly otherwise mox mox might whip the boys eyes out or even kill him with the quirt there was no time to plan he had to shoot if he wanted to save the childs eyesight and possibly his life he could not shoot the cherokee first or the manburner either he had to act if he hoped to save the little boys vision call shot the giant man first hoping he would fall clear and give him a clean shot at mox mox but the giant staggered leaving mox mox mostly hidden calf went ahead risked one shot and hit him but mox mox did not fall even before he could lever a third shot he heard horses racing away and knew that jimmy cumsa was escaping the cherokee had taken two horses and was hanging between them call couldnt see him at all he shot again at mox mox and hit him in the shoulder then mox mox too was among the horses the three mexicans and the small man were running for their rifles which had been propped against their saddles they were slow perhaps drunk call shot all four of them and put them down not for good probably but down mox mox couldnt ride as well as jimmy cumsa even without a broken shoulder he could not have handled animals well enough to hang between two horses but he managed to do the next best thing which was to spook all the horses and raise a dust call snapped a shot at one of the horses jimmy cumsa was escaping with the horse went down but the cherokee didnt go down with it he switched to the other horse and struggled into the saddle call shot again but by then the range was long and the bullet kicked up dust one of the fallen mexicans was trying to run to his horse but his horse was carrying mox mox away call shot the mexican again and then threw one more shot at mox mox he could scarcely see him for the dust but he thought he hit him in the leg the big man was stirring so call shot him again what nagged him was the eighth manwhere could he be almost as the question registered in his mind he saw a man trying to pull up his pants a good distance beyond the camp he had been shitting and was trying to get his pants up so he could run away when call saw him he was a long way from camp but call took a slow aim and brought him down mox mox and jimmy cumsa were far out of range but still going maybe they would keep running but there was also a chance they would return and make a fight of it it would depend on how badly mox mox was wounded and whether he was disposed to fight jimmy cumsa had run from quanah parker probably he would run again but that was not a certainty call reloaded took both rifles stuck one in his belt andwitha pistol in one hand and a rifle in the other leading his horsehe had to hold the bridle reins in his teethcame down into the camp of the six men down only the last one the one who had been shitting was dead when a little later call walked out and turned him over he found a boy in his late teens with black teeth the other men he had to dispatch with his pistol which he did quickly he was not in a position to take prisoners much less to nurse wounded outlaws who would only recover to be hung if they recovered at all call had no difficulty freeing the children the short chain that held them was only fastened with wire the little boy was still moaning his face ran blood call washed the blood away with water from one of the dead mens canteens one of the boys eyes had swollen shut probably from being hit with the tip of the quirt the eye itself did not appear to be hurt and the other eye was not damaged the cuts on the boys face were deep but he was young and he would recover the little girl grabbed calls leg and clung to it so tightly he had to pull her arms loose in order to lift her up want ma she said want ma the little boy had stopped moaning he seemed numb he looked at call with his one open eye gratefully though he said hed whip my eyes out the boy said he said hed burn marcie hes gonehe wont put your eyes out and he wont burn your sister can you stand up the boy stood up he was shaky from the shock of the violence and probably from lack of proper food but he could walk the horse call shot was on its feet again it stood pawing the ground about a hundred yards away it was saddled if it was not too badly injured it might do for the children call was keenly conscious that he needed to move and move at once the ridge that had provided his cover before the fight would provide the same cover for the garza boy who if he was following would undoubtedly have heard the shooting all joey garza would have to do would be to crawl up behind the ridge and shoot he wouldnt need his telescope sight call and the children were within easy range stay a minute i need to catch this horse so we can go call told the children he left them standing together the little girl tried to run after him but the boy grabbed her arm and pulled her back call caught the wounded horse easily and was relieved to see that its wound wasnt crippling the wound was in the neck it was bleeding profusely but he could stop the bleeding and the horse could carry the two children fort stockton was not more than forty miles away mister have you got a biscuit the boy asked when call returned leading the horse me and marcie aint had no food that squinteye wouldnt give us none call rummaged quickly in the dead mens kit and found some jerky and a few stiff tortillas he gave them to the children this is all i can do for now call said we have to leave here can you ride a horse i guess i can the boy said with some pride pa got me brownie when i was three and im nine now his wounds were still running blood the whole front of his shirt was stained with it but that could be attended to later when they were safe we have to move call said we aint safe here the man who quirted you might come back why didnt you kill him mister the boy asked i triedi hit him call said i wish youd kilt him the boy said he said hed burn marcie call gathered up serapes from the dead men he wrapped the children well against the cold and put them on the wounded horse probably neither of the children had been warm in days the little girl shivered so badly that call thought he might have to tie her to the horse but he didnt it wouldnt do to have her tied to a horse if there was another fight he took several blankets and what food he could find at the last minute he discovered a piece of antelope haunch wrapped in some sacking that was lucky he cut off two pieces and gave them to the children to gnaw as they rode he decided to lead the wounded horse with mox mox and jimmy cumsa somewhere ahead of him perhaps waiting in ambush and with joey garza behind him if it was joey garza behind him he needed as much control over the animals as he could get whats your name call asked the boy before he mounted bob the boy said bobby fant why son is jasper your pa call asked jasper fant thats our pa howd you know his name mister the boy asked his wounds had stopped bleeding and had crusted over call had packed some sand in the wound in the horses neck and it was no longer bleeding so badly your pa worked for me once call said we went to montana together i didnt even know he had married last i heard of him he was in nebraska nope we live out by comstock now the boy said say are you captain call he asked his eyes widening he even got the swollen eye open in his amazement yes im captain call call replied pa always talks about you the boy said he said if anyone ever took us hed get you to find us even if it was indians that got us well its your good luck that i did find you call said you hold on to your sister and dont let her fall off we may have to ride all night bob he said theres a town we can get to tomorrow if we dont stop once we get there youll both be safe and i can send you home to your ma and pa want ma the little girl said again want ma youll have her call said despite being wrapped in two serapes the little girl was still shivering chilled through by the long cold call supposed dont let her fall he said again to the boy oh i dont guess marcie will fall off shes got her own pony back home the boy said call took the lead rope and headed immediately into the widest space he could find well away from the ridges he was glad that fort stockton was no farther than it was it was bitter weather and the children had gone through a brutal experience they might sicken yet and probably would he wanted to get them to a place where there were warm houses and a proper doctor they seemed to him to be remarkably plucky children that was even more remarkable in view of the fact that their father was jasper fant a man who complained constantly about his ills real or imagined he had been a hat creek cowboy and had made the drive to montana his main terror was of drowning but it took only a sniffle to bring out jaspers complaints night fell and captain call kept riding he stopped now and then to check on the wound in the horses neck the little girl had gone to sleep propped against her brothers chest bobby the boy was wide awake were gonna keep going call told him gnaw on that meat and give your sister some if she wakes up my hands are freezing off the boy said i wish it wasnt so cold keep your hands under the blanket call said i cant stop and make a fire mox mox might find us that squinti wish youd kilt him bobby said well i didnt but i might yet call said call rode on trying to knot an old bandanna around his neck to protect it from the cutting wind the little gun battle had been badly handled he knew bobby fant was right to reproach him for not killing mox mox the boys screams had caused him to rush what he ought not to have rushed it would have been wiser to let the boy endure the whipping for another few seconds the large man might have moved out of the way and given him a clear shot at mox mox he might even have had a clear shot at jimmy cumsa if he had waited a minute more to start firing as it was he had rushed and the result of his rushing was that he had killed the six incompetents and let the two really dangerous men escape it was foolish behavior he had rescued the children but he hadnt removed the threat he should have kept his mind on the prime object which was to kill mox mox jimmy cumsa might be deadly but he hadnt been leading the pack and he didnt quirt children for his amusement another truth just as discouraging was that he had not shot well only the boy who had been caught with his pants down had been killed cleanly with one shot and that was probably luck all the others had required two or more bullets it was poor shooting and yet hed had all the advantages not a shot had been fired at him he had been shooting from less than fifty yards distance and he had taken the men completely by surprise call blamed his swollen knuckles also he wasnt as sure of his eyesight as he had been if the men had been better fighters he would have been in trouble if mox mox and jimmy cumsa had taken cover instead of running the outcome of the struggle might have been different call often picked over battles in his mind there were few fixed rules once men started shooting at one another with deadly intent strategies and plans were usually forgotten men acted and reacted according to their instincts experience didnt always tell veterans of many battles made wild inexplicable mistakes even men who remained perfectly calm in battle did things that they could not make sense of later if they survived to rehash the battle but right or wrong it was done at least he had jasper fants children and they would survive if he could get them to a warm place soon enough as call rode on the cold grew more intense his mind returned again and again to the shooting it troubled him that he had shot so poorly augustus mccrae given similar advantages would probably have killed all the men with a pistol before the night ended the children got so cold that call had to stop and risk a fire he could barely gather sticks with his stiff fingers the childrens feet were so cold that call knew he was risking frostbite if he didnt do something fortunately there was enough scrubby brush that he soon had adequate wood he made two fires and put the freezing children between them the crusted blood on the boys face was icy he had been plucky when first rescued but had gone into a kind of shock and couldnt speak the little girl was so cold she was past whimpering call built up the fires and kept them flaming as the children slept he himself hunkered near the flames only a few minutes at a time it was so cold that he doubted any killer would be vigorous enough to take advantage of them but he couldnt be sure and he didnt want to get too warm himself when he hunkered by the fire fatigue began to suck at him a deep fatigue he was accustomed to sleeping in snatches squatting leaning against a horse he had even slept riding if the country was flat and the horse reliable in the indianfighting days he had tried to acquire the abilities and the endurance of his foes he wanted to be able to do anything a comanche could do or an apache gus had scoffed at the notion he said no white man could live as an indian could or travel as fast or subsist on as little probably gus had been right about that and if he hadnt been as able as the best of the indians when he was young there was little hope that he could compete with one now joey garza was mexican not indian but many mexicans were part indian and there was a rumor that the garza boy had lived with the mountain apaches for several years the cold might not affect him once it would not have affected call either with things so uncertain it wouldnt do to give way to fatigue or to nap too long by the campfire he might wake up to discover that his throat had just been cut in the morning the frost was so heavy that call had to scrape ice off the saddles the children were so cold they couldnt eat he decided that he had better tie them to the horse though there was a band of red on the eastern horizon the sun was soon blanketed by heavy clouds and the cold remained intense the wounded horse was stiffit could barely move and not rapidly fortunately when they had been riding an hour call saw a few plumes of smoke to the northwest clear in the freezing air the smoke was coming from the chimneys of fort stockton a little later he saw more smoke on the eastern horizon this smoke moved westward and it came from a train call couldnt see the train but he knew the railroad was there for nothing else would be moving under a plume of smoke the wounded horse slowed to a walk and then to a slower walk a little before midday the horse stopped it could go no farther by then the town was no more than five miles away call left the horse perhaps it would walk on in under its own power once it had rested for a day he put the children on his horse only to have his horse come up lame a mile or two farther on a needlelike sliver of ice had cut its hoof but the town was not far the little girl had recovered a little and now and then asked for her mother bobby fant his face a horror of frozen cuts had not spoken all day call took his time walking the lame horse slowly he didnt want to have to carry the children or abandon his guns and equipment when they were only two miles from the town they came upon two sheepmen butchering sheep to sell in fort stockton dern whered you folks spring from the older sheepman said when he saw call leading the lame horse with two children on it from far enough away that wed appreciate a ride to somewhere these young ones can warm themselves call said wed more than appreciate it he added wed pay a good fare if youd take us in your wagon the rest of the way to town mister you dont have to pay us nothingwe was about to haul these carcasses in anyway the younger sheepman said they were shaggy men in great buffalo coats and they had three huge dogs with them it had been the barking of the dogs that led call to the wagon there were no grazing sheep visible though just six bloody carcasses piled up in the wagon call chose to walk behind the wagon leading his lame horse the young sheepman said there was a rooming house on the main street in town it aint fancy but its got beds he said who done that to that boys face bobby fants face had gotten worse during the night it was swollen and some of the cuts still leaked blood most of which froze on his cheeks a man named mox mox done it call said i shot him but i dont think i killed him somebody ought to kill the sonofabitch then the older man said ive seen rough stuff out here on the baldies but ive never seen nothing like thatnot done to a child call carried bobby fant into the little frame rooming house the young sheepman got off the wagon for a minute and carried the girl who was whimpering for her mother a woman stood just inside the door looking out at them through the pane of glass call could just see her she was blond the young sheepherder brought the little girl in first by the time call eased through the door with bobby fant the woman had already taken the little girl in her arms and was whispering to her call couldnt hear what the woman was whispering the fact that the blond woman had appeared so suddenly behind the pane of glass startled him a little the woman looked familiar he thought for a moment she might be the childrens mother jasper fants wife though he hadnt even known jasper fant had a wife until yesterday and how the woman could have anticipated them and got to fort stockton was a mystery when the woman saw bobby fants face she drew in her breath mox mox done that didnt he captain she asked touching the boys cuts gently with her fingers did you kill him captain well i hit him call said i doubt it was mortal but it might slow him enough that i can catch him bring the boy to my room the woman said i just got off the train and was about to have a bath ive got hot water waiting ill put them both in the bathtub itll warm them quicker then i can wash those cuts the woman started up the stairs with the little girl call thanked the young sheepman and began to climb the stairs carrying bobby fant the moment he stepped into the warm rooming house he had begun to feel tired so tired that it was a strain even to carry the child up one flight of stairs he was wondering in his fatigue how the woman had known who he wasand how she knew about mox mox it was not until the blond woman paused at the top of the stairs and looked down at him the little girl in her arms that call realized who she was she was not the childrens mother she was pea eyes wife my lord youll have to excuse me he said embarrassed i didnt recognize you call could not quite remember when he had last seen lorena in nebraska it seemed to him she had been a young woman then of course many years had passed and she would have to be older but the fact that she was so much older that he hadnt recognized her left him feeling at a loss you dont need to be embarrassed lorena said you kept mox mox from burning these children and you brought them out thats enough he carried the boy into her room where indeed a bath was steaming put him on the bed lorena said just put him on the bed ill take care of these youngsters you better go get a little rest yourself yes im weary call said in fact he felt so weary that he could hardly carry the child across the small room im mighty surprised to see you he added he felt that he ought to say more but he didnt know quite what i came looking for my husband lorena said i was hoping youd have him with you i dont but i know where he is captain call said he aint far the womans face brightened when he said it he went downstairs and got a room key though later he was unable to remember getting a key or even going to the room when he woke up fully clothed on a bed many hours later it was worry about his horse that caused him to wake he had forgotten the horse completely once he entered the rooming house and had just left it standing in the street he looked out the window but could see nothing it was pitchdark he wondered if anyone had done anything about his horse lorena didnt leave the children all day except to walk down the street and find a doctor who could treat bobbys face fortunately there was no damage to either eye the boy could see fine but some of the cuts on his cheeks were so deep that the doctor told her he would probably always bear the scars lorena was not sleeping much and did not expect to sleep much until she knew that mox mox was dead the sight of bobby fants face was enough to keep her awake it reminded her too vividly of the little boy who had not been lucky enough to be rescued the boy mox mox had burned in her place that boys death cries still echoed in her mind and she remembered the deep grinding fear she had felt as she waited for it to happen to her the fear had been so nearly unbearable that it made the other things the men did to her seem a small business she had trained herself over the years not to remember that fear if she dwelt on it even for an hour it paralyzed her and made it difficult for her to do her schoolwork or be a wife or even do her motherly chores when she looked out the door of the rooming house and saw captain call coming she had been shocked at how decrepit he looked pea eye had mentioned casually that the captain wasnt quite as spry as he had been but the comment hadnt prepared her for how the man actually looked lorena had not seen call since the morning long before when he had left clara allens house with gus mccraes body the man had not been young when he rode off that morning but neither had he been the old man who walked stiffly into the rooming house in fort stockton of course her daughter clarie was fifteen years old and calls departure from claras on his trip back to texas with guss body had occurred two years before she married pea she had not seen captain call in nearly twenty years she should have been prepared for him to be old she just hadnt supposed he would look so stiff and worn out of course he had traveled a long distance with two children in the bitter cold he had probably been traveling since the day pea eye had refused to go with him younger men than captain call would have been tired the day after he arrived with the children call was too tired even to go downstairs he knocked timidly on lorenas door and asked if she could request the lady who owned the rooming house to bring him some food he also asked if lorena would inquire about his horse had it been stabled and fed lorena got him food and was able to assure him that the local sheriff had taken charge of his mount the lameness wasnt serious and the horse would be ready to travel in a few days call seemed reassured he considered it a serious lapse that he had forgotten to stable his own horse it was so warm i guess i fainted he said i dont recall going to bed i dont usually forget to stable my horse you saved two children lorena pointed out again theres people here who arent busy that can take care of your horse well its my horse call said i have always looked after my own mounts my sevenyearold can unsaddle a horse and feed it as well as you can captain lorena said but my sevenyearold couldnt save two children from mox mox call took the pointhe didnt mention the horse again for fear of irritating lorena but he didnt forget the lapse either it took him a day and a half to feel refreshed enough to walk down to the livery stable and inspect the horse himself he felt he ought to get moving for none of the work he had set out to do had been accomplished mox mox wasnt dead or if he was no one had found him and he was no closer to catching joey garza than he had been when he left amarillo brookshire would be having fits about the delay and his boss colonel terry was probably having worse fits on the third day jasper fant arrived with his wife to take his stolen children home to calls surprise jasper had grown bald he had also grown a belly his wife was a small woman of the wiry type her name was may both parents gasped when they saw their sons face the wiry little mother held her children and sobbed jasper turned a violent red why the damned killer why did he do it captain jasper asked lorena stood with call watching the little girl clung to her mothers neck so tightly that the woman couldnt speak jasper and may had been on a train for two days they had left as soon as the telegram came telling them that their children were alive a few hours later the little family got on the train to go home may tried to thank call but broke into such sobs of gratitude that she couldnt get the words out jasper grasped his hand and held it until call was afraid theyd miss their train although they were standing two steps from it i hope you kill that squint mister bobby fant said as his father was helping him onto the train many thanks captain jasper said we wont none of us ever forget what youve done me and may we wont forget it if youre ever down in comstock i hope youll stop and make a meal with us i will call said glad that the train was leaving he couldnt get over how bald jasper was earlier in the traildriving days the man had been somewhat vain about his hair theyre lucky lorena said as she and the captain were walking back to the hotel when blue duck had me mox mox wanted to burn me blue duck wouldnt let himhe wanted me for bait but mox mox caught a boy somewhere and he burned him in my place why i never knew that call said gus never told meim surprised he kept it from me i didnt tell gus lorena said i didnt tell my husband either i told mr goodnight just before i left to come on this trip he was the first person to hear about it and youre the second you told charlie goodnight call said amazed did he come around and ask thats right lorena said he came around and asked when can we go to my husband hes in presidio or hes near there call said theres no train and not much of a road well have to go horseback call fell silent he knew that lorena had every right to go to her husband traveling the distance she had traveled already and riding a train when two notorious train robbers were on the loose and every train liable to being stopped showed unusual courage call was happy to relent and let lorena take pea home the mans heart wasnt in law work anymore if it was law work they were doing it was better that he quit lawing for good and take care of his wife and children and his farm captain i hope you dont doubt that i can ride lorena said seeing the man hesitate i rode all the way to nebraska with that cow herd you and gus drove and i lived with clara allen for three years on her horse ranch i can ride and ill keep up the cold dont discourage me i want to go to my husband if youre going to presidio i want to go with you oh it aint the riding or the cold call said im told you drive a buggy every day to teach schoolcharlie goodnight told me that he admires you riding to presidio wont be much colder than driving your buggy to school in the panhandle what is it then lorena asked i can leave now im packed what is it as she asked the question the sheriff of fort stockton the fellow who had stabled calls horse saw them and practically ran toward them captain did you get the news he asked why no i guess not call said what news joey garza killed judge roy bean the skinny sheriff said he gutshot him and then strung him up to his own chimney hung him thats the news when call asked maybe a week ago about the sheriff said nobody knows exactly because nobody was there when it happened i was there about then but i left call said pea eye and brookshire and deputy plunkert were there too but they left night after i did a sheepherder found him the sheriff said came by to get a bottle of whiskey and there the man hung right by the door of his own saloon that boy must have been watching call said he must be clever at hiding i looked and i didnt see him the sheepherders are all scared now the sheriff said theyre bringing their sheep closer to the towns i dont know what good that will do them call said they could run their sheep right here in the main street and hed still kill them if hes that good at hiding are you sure my husband left lorena asked the fear that had been with her for weeks rose up in her throat again well he was saddled and ready when i rode off call said brookshire was drunk and deputy plunkert and famous shoes were napping but i imagine they leftyour sheepherder didnt find but one body did he nope just one the sheriff said just old bean he was a tough old rooster but i guess hes cawed his last caw i want to go captain lorena said i dont want my husband shot somewhere out in the wastes there might not even be a sheepherder to find him i sent them into mexico so theyd be safe call explained i think the garza boy came this way i think he followed me but i could never catch him at it hes a damn clever boy to ambush bean like that thats the end of judge roy bean i guess the sheriff said he felt slightly at a loss he was hoping the great ranger would want to talk it over or perhaps ask his opinion about the best way to catch joey garza he and his deputy jerry brown had figured out just how to do it but the old ranger and the blond woman scarcely blinked at his news im much obliged to you for looking after my horse call said then the two of them turned and walked back down the street to the skinny sheriff old call seemed stiff and far too slow to catch a swift young bandit such as joey garza that was a job in the sheriffs view for much younger men men about the age of himself and his deputy jerry brown call didnt speak as they were walking back to the rooming house the fear was in lorenas throat not merely for pea eyes life but fear that the captain wasnt going to take her with him captain i can ride lorena repeated i can ride day and night if i have to i did it when we trailed those cattle and i can do it now maam that was not my objection call said id like you to come call meant it too lorena had come a long way at some risk she deserved to get to see her husband and as soon as possible the bond of a husband and a wife was one he had never had and didnt understand but he could tell both from lorenas behavior and from pea eyes that it was a strong bond he had come to admire lorena for the quick way she took charge of jaspers children she had given them excellent care also he wouldnt mind the company in this instance traveling alone had always suited him it was only this winter that it had come to suit him less he was rather sorry that he had left mr brookshire behind he had come to like mr brookshire what is your objection then if you have one lorena asked i dont know that i can protect youthats it call said i let the garza boy slip right by me and kill roy bean then i let mox mox get away thats two poor performances in a row i just dont know that i can protect you to his surprise lorena took his arm as they walked down the street did you hear me call asked fearing that he had not stressed the risk quite enough i heard you captain lorena said i need to go find my husband hes the one you ought to be protecting help me pick out a good horse and lets go lorenas look was determined and her step determined too what she said startled call but by the time she walked him past the saloon and the hardware store he had come to see that she was right lorena had been taken by blue duck and held two weeks but she had survived and recovered more than that she had educated herself and was rearing a family but pea eye had depended on him and gus until the time when he came to depend on lorena herself pea was able enough when he was given clear orders but only when he was given clear orders no doubt lorena was well aware of that characteristic too pea eye was not accustomed to acting alone it was doubtful that he could have found his way to presidio so promptly if he had been without the help of famous shoes call picked out a strong mare for lorena and bought her an adequate saddle an hour later the two of them rode out of fort stockton the strong wind at their backs the skinny sheriff and his deputy jerry brown stood in the empty windy street and watched them leave the skinny sheriff was a little disappointed the old ranger had not been friendly at all now where are they going deputy brown asked why i dont know jerrytheyre headed south the sheriff said i didnt ask them their route and they didnt mention much we dont get women that pretty in this town not often jerry brown said i aint seen one that pretty since i come out here and i been out here six years i wish shed stayed a little longer why the sheriff asked surprised that his deputy was being so forward you dont even know the woman no but i might have met her in a store or somewhere jerry brown said i might have got to say hello to her at least im a bachelor he added though the sheriff knew that but soon the ranger and the pretty woman were swallowed up by the great blue distance to the south and deputy jerry brown who was a bachelor went back into the jail and spent the windy morning playing solitaire part iii marias children dont go off and leave me here you goddamn cherokee rascal mox mox said he wanted to kill jimmy cumsa and wanted to kill him badly but he had no weapon and was sorely wounded to boot in the scramble to get away from call his pistol had fallen out of its holster he had been flopped over his horse and somehow the gun got jerked loose mox mox bled and bled and coughed and coughed as they ran he was shot in the lung which he knew was bad every cough caused a pain like needles sticking in him then jimmy cumsa rode up beside him and took his rifle the scabbard had mox moxs blood all over it but jimmy took the rifle and scabbard anyway mox mox had no pistol and was too weak to stop jimmy mox mox rode on as far as he could he only had the one horse but when the herd spooked jimmy had managed to keep three horses ahead of him he had four mounts he could run a long way let me switch jimi need a fresher horse mox mox said as his horse began to tire but jimmy cumsa didnt answer or offer him a fresh horse either finally his mount faltered trying to climb out of a gully they had ridden some twenty miles the horse stumbled back to the bottom of the gully and stood there shaking it was dusk mox mox could barely see jimmy cumsa who was in the process of shifting his saddle to one of the extra horses the big sorrel that had belonged to oteros mox mox slid carefully to the ground he coughed and the needles stuck him he was trying to get matches out of his saddlebags when jimmy cumsa came over and started to help him mox mox took a step or two back then staggered and sat down build a fire jimmyits chill he said but again jimmy didnt answer and he wasnt helping either he simply transferred mox moxs saddlebags with the matches in them and a little food and ammunition to another horse build a fire mox mox said again well freeze if you dont build a fire nope no more fires for you mox jimmy cumsa said why not whats wrong with you mox mox asked not near as much as is wrong with you jimmy cumsa said i aint shot in the lung and i aint dying youre both mox building you a fire would be a waste of matches and i aint got the time to waste on a man thats dying anyway i aint dying im just shot mox mox said ill live if i can get warm hellfire will warm you mox jimmy cumsa said mounting oteross big horse youll cook plenty warm down in hell like all those people that you put the brush on and burned mox mox realized then that jimmy cumsa meant it he was not going to help him he was going to leave him there to die with a bleeding lung and no matches in weather that was bitter i should have killed you long ago you cherokee dog mox mox said i should have shot you in your goddamn sleep you wouldnt have got me even in my sleep jimmy cumsa said i could be sound asleep or drunk and still be quicker than you thats why im called quick jimmy you damn snake get off and make me a fire mox mox said i aint the snake jimmy cumsa said youre the one they call thesnakeyoudonotsee only old call seen you he didnt get much of a shot but he still killed you i aint dead im just shot goddamn you mox mox said again make me a damn fire or leave me the matches if youre in such a goddamn hurry ill make my own fire i am in a hurry jimmy said i want to be a long way from here when the sun comes up mox that old man might still be coming he killed seven of the eight of us unless black tooth got away which i doubt he aint coming hes got those children mox mox said well i dont believe ill take the chance jimmy cumsa said if he does come hell find you frozen or else bled out i never thought a man that old could beat you mox but i guess i was wrong mox mox knew that his only chance was to rush jimmy cumsa grab his gun or grab the reins of one of the other horsesgrab anything that might help him survive there must be brush in the gully that he could find and make enough of a fire to keep himself alive even if he had to crawl he staggered up and tried to make a run at the horses if he could just get one fresh horse he might make it but the needles in his lungs were sharper than ever and he couldnt control his legs he ran a few steps but fell before he got near a horse when he finally did get to a horse it was the one jimmy cumsa had just run for twenty miles it was as useless as his own mox mox had a small knife in his belt the one he used to cut meat it was his only weapon he managed to get it out with luck he might stick jimmy and cut him badly enough that he would fall off his mount but when he lunged with his knife at where he thought the cherokee was jimmy cumsa wasnt there he had taken the reins of the extra horses and ridden out of the gully mox mox wanted to slash him to death for his treachery but there was no one to slash he could hear the clatter of the horses as jimmy cumsa loped away but in a moment the sound grew faint and in a few more minutes there was no sound at all except his own breathing in the sudden stillness the sound of his own breathing shocked him his breath bubbled as a cow or a sheep or a buffalo bubbled with its last breath mox mox felt a bitter rage an old man had come out of nowhere and shot him and all his men except jimmy cumsa and now jimmy had deserted him left him to bleed to death or freeze in a gully how dare the old fool if hed only had a moment to turn and fight he could have rallied the men and caught woodrow call and burned him he could have shot him or stabbed him or quirted him to death old call had just been lucky to get in such a shot it was jimmy cumsas fault for messing with the horses when he should have been standing guard none of the men in fact had been alert it served them right that they were all deadall except jimmy the one who had ridden off and left him to die mox mox crawled to where his horse stood caught the stirrup in his hand and pulled himself to his feet his only chance was to mount and make the horse keep going maybe there was a house somewhere that he could get to someplace where there were matches so he could build a fire a fire would save him he had built wonderful fires over the years fires hot enough to warm him on the coldest nights hot enough to burn anyone he had on hand to burn if he could just get to a place where he could make a fire a wonderful warm fire the bubbling in his breath might stop and he would get better and live he pulled himself up slowly and managed with great difficulty to get himself into the saddle but when he tried to spur his horse out of the gully the horse refused to move he jerked when he was spurred but only took a step or two and then stood there quivering again mox mox wouldnt stand for it even his horse wouldnt obey him he still had the small knife in his hand in his rage he began to stab the horse as hard as he could he stabbed him in the neck and slashed at his shoulders then he stabbed him in the flankhe would make the animal go where he wanted it to go he slashed at the horses flank until the animal finally bolted and tried to flounder up the sides of the gully but the sides of the gully were too steep in the dark the horse lost its footing and fell rolling over mox mox as it slid back to the bottom of the gully mox mox slid after it and as he did the horse kicked at him catching him hard in the leg when mox mox tried to stand he heard his leg crack he tried to stand up but the leg wouldnt support him in his bitterness and rage at calls good luck and his own defeat mox mox hadnt fully felt the cold but with his leg cracked and his breath bubbling he could scarcely move soon the savage wind began to bite mox mox began to think of cutting himself in order to feel the warmth of his own blood but when he put the knife down for a moment and tried to ease himself into a more comfortable sitting position the knife slid down the slope out of his reach he eased down a little ways himself but he couldnt find the knife the blood seeping out of his chest began to freeze on his shirt when he put his hand on his side his blood was cold he wanted a fire but there was no fire and no way to make one the coyotes began to yip in the cold distance mox mox listened he thought he heard horses coming from far away he listened as hard as he could maybe quick jimmy had been teasing him he was known to be a teaser maybe jimmy would come back and build him a good crackling fire even if the horseman was old call come to get him the man might at least build him a fire and keep him alive through the night mox mox listened hard once or twice he thought he heard the horses in the cold distance but mainly it was just the coyotes yipping the wind died it was cloudless and very cold mox mox reached again for the knife better to cut himself than to freeze to death but he still couldnt find the knife and when he reached for it he began to slide and then to roll over he rolled to the bottom of the gully there was not even a bush to crawl behind the two exhausted horses had walked away it might have been his own horse whose hoofbeats he had heard there was no warmth anywhereonly the yipping of the coyotes and the yellow of the shining stars mexico was colder on the second trip than it had been on the first brookshire thought and it had been sufficiently cold the first time every night he felt nervous about shutting his eyes for fear that hed freeze in his sleep they made roaring fireshe soon used the last of his ledger books even burning the covers getting the fires startedbut the fires didnt warm the ground and the ground was where he had to lay himself down to sleep the captains departure had shocked brookshire badly that and the fact that they had been ordered back into mexico on the vague hope that joey garza would show up at his mothers house they had already been to his mothers house and the young bandit hadnt been home if the plan was to lie in wait for him then they might as well have waited for him when they were there the first time now captain call the one man in the whole of the west that brookshire had confidence in wasnt even with them often in his life when he had failed to restrain his taste for brandy things had slipped off course now it had happened again things were twisting farther and ever farther off course it seemed to him the old indian seemed irritated at having to make a long detour into mexico to get back to the village he trotted so far ahead of them during the cold days that brookshire more than once concluded that they had been abandoned colonel terry was going to think it a very odd way of proceeding the colonel had only wanted one bandit apprehended and quickly he was going to be mighty aggravated that so much time had passed without results normally brookshire would have been in a sweat at the thought of the colonels aggravation but it was impossible to sweat when it was as cold as it was and anyway colonel terry who usually entered brookshires thoughts at least once every five minutes now entered them less and less often when he did enter them he did so less vividly colonel terry had become mainly a memory from a different life brookshire didnt know whether he would ever return to that life or ever see the colonel again he rode along obediently though he tried to keep himself in order and not let the blowingaway feeling seize him too strongly there was not much else he could do they were in mexico and keeping up with famous shoes was task enough for the moment vegetation was sparse and by midafternoon brookshire would begin to be nervous about finding enough firewood to keep a good fire going through the night he tried to keep the location of substantial bushes and trees firmly in mind so he could return to them and make a fire out of them if he needed to deputy plunkert had been deeply upset when pea eye told him they were going back into mexico it was the one thing he had never intended to let happen and yet when the moment came to resign and go home he rode numbly back across the rio grande behind pea eye and brookshire and old famous shoes deputy plunkert looked down the river when he was in the middle of it laredo was down there and doobie was down there if he just turned left and followed the winding stream he could not miss getting home the river would lead him right to it if some mexican didnt kill him first that was the catch though to get home by way of the river meant going straight through the vicinities where he was most unpopular even on the texas side of the river there were places where he was rather unpopular tired as he was ted plunkert didnt feel up to coping with his own unpopularity it was better to remain a part of the captains expedition once the bad outlaws were finished caught and hung the captain had promised to send him home on a train the thought of the comfort to come was enough to keep him going pea eye had no interest in mexico but he didnt fear it the captain had given him clear orders and all he had to do was follow them in order to follow them all he had to do was keep up with famous shoes the old man was unusually irritable but he hadnt deserted them yet even if he deserted them pea eye felt confident that he had enough ability to tell east from west he could find his way back to the river and eventually get where he had been told to go the third night as they were making their campfire behind a little spur of rock famous shoes came walking in from one of his swings through the country ahead olin is coming he said he was about to make camp when i found him i told him we already had a camp so he is coming here pea eye only vaguely remembered olin roy once in a while long before accident had thrown him into the same vicinity as the ranger troop he camped with them now and then pea eye could not recall olins occupation if he had one not every traveler did have an occupation and a good many of those who had one wouldnt reveal it all he remembered about the man was that he was very large has he lost any weight he asked famous shoes the way he was back then a horse could hardly carry him all day he weighs too much for his horses famous shoes said he is easy to track though when olin roy rode into camp he didnt look very impressive to deputy plunkert or to brookshire either i thank you he said formally when brookshire offered him a cup of coffee after that he merely sat by the fire in his old greasy clothes saying little the weathers cold aint it pea eye said rather at a loss as to how to address the big man it could be colderive seen it colder olin said he regretted letting famous shoes tempt him into making camp with the travelers they were pleasant enough and generous with their coffee but on the whole he felt he did better camping alone the necessity of making conversation didnt arise since no conversation was required when he camped by himself making conversation with perfect strangers was to olin an irksome task pea eye wasnt a perfect stranger of course but neither was he someone olin felt he could easily talk to the only two people in the world he could talk to easily were maria and billy williams and even when alone with maria he rarely said that much he usually just sat and listened as maria talked or he watched her brush her little girls hair at such times he wished that life was different and that he could marry maria and be a settled man it was not possible of coursemaria had no interestbut if matters had been different olin felt he would have been a happier man there was no one who touched him as deeply as maria though he had never been her husband or a member of her family and had not had the pleasure of watching her with her children as a steady thing been anyplace special pea eye asked the captain had appointed him the leader of the group which made him more or less the host and as host he felt he ought to try to prompt at least a little conversation well piedras negras olin said ive heard that was a rough town deputy plunkert said no it aint olin replied of course wesley hardins there now any town he unsaddles his horse in is rough but he just came for whores i imagine hell move on soon why we heard he was in crow town brookshire said he was but maria took the whores and left olin said thats when hardin left he likes places where theres whores after that conversation lagged brookshire couldnt think of a thing to say he was wondering if the fire would last the night olin thought the group was rather odd in his years of travel mostly in mexico he had grown used to having odd groups turn upenglishmen or germans prospectors gunrunners schemers of various kinds but this group was woodrow calls posse it seemed they were the men who were after joey garza they seemed like harmless fellows and it was difficult to believe that any of them were gifted manhunters the yankee mostly shivered pea eye was an old ranger who should have retired from the business long ago the other man olin didnt know he had introduced himself briefly but had mumbled his name so low that olin didnt catch it even with old famous shoes to track for them there was little likelihood they would ever get within fifty miles of joey garza and if they did it would only be worse for them joey had a cold nature there was no accounting for it either his mother was generous and warm but wherever he got it joey had a cold nature if the men did happen to stumble on him joey would make quick work of them whats the news from down the river then deputy plunkert asked it seemed to him that he had been gone from his home for years he suddenly had a hunger to hear the news from laredo the large man had been down the river as far as piedras negras and perhaps he had heard something from laredo a bank robbery or a lynching might have occurred since he left or a store might have burned down or one or two of the older more famous ranchers might have died i didnt stay in negras long enough to gossip olin said having hardin in town makes me uneasy he dont look like much but hes a wild one any news from laredo deputy plunkert said thats where i hail from yes they put that damn sheriff jekyll in his own jail olin said i hope they hang the rascal theres no excuse for forcing a woman bob jekylls in our jail ted plunkert said very startled id say thats news the first part of olins comment had startled him so much that he hadnt quite taken in the second part the thought of bob jekyll locked in their jail was so astonishing that he hadnt yet started thinking about the nature of his crime i guess some little gal came in asking about her husband and the damned scoundrel forced her olin said he had seen an apache girl forced once during the indian times and the sight had sickened him over the years whenever he thought of it it sickened him he knew that maria had suffered something like that about the time that joey started killing from time to time he considered going to texas and taking vengeance on her attackers the men who used the apache girl had shot her when they were through maria hadnt been shot at least but the thought of her suffering troubled him whenever he remembered it maria was the only woman he had tender feelings for she should be exempt from such abuse and if he did encounter the cowboys who attacked her he planned to take their lives suddenly deputy plunkert got a bad feeling a woman asking about her husband he repeated who but doobie of all the young women in laredo would go to bob jekyll to ask about her husband do you recall her name he asked of course there were other young women in laredo other husbands might have strayed in fact husbands strayed fairly often most of them just got drunk and fell in a ditch to sleep it off maybe it was another woman with a stray husband who bob jekyll had forced why no olin said i dont recall hearing her name the poor thing took rat poison and died theyre trying the sheriff for murder but i doubt hell hang myself oh lord ted plunkert said something gripped him more powerful than the cold the fear that it had been doobie he had been bob jekylls deputy until hed quit and gone off with captain call who but the deputys wife would be going to the jail to inquire she died he asked in a weaker tone to everyones amazement deputy plunkert suddenly sprang up and went stumbling over to the horses he looked like a crazy man it was my wife i fear it was her he said and then he mounted and went racing off in the darkness to the south now thats bad luck brookshire said i believe i saw his wife as we were leaving laredo she was a pert young thing ted oughtnt to run his horse at night not in this rough country pea eye said theres bluffs down the river that a horse could go right off i always despised that sheriff olin said they heard the clatter of the deputys horse receding to the south olin felt embarrassed inadvertently he had informed a man that his wife was dead he more and more regretted letting famous shoes talk him into joining the camp now he had been the bearer of tragic news if he had just gone on and made his own camp the poor deputy would still be in ignorance of the fact that he no longer had a wife boy he wished he had made his own camp and built his own fire he did not like to cause trouble and yet he just did why thats the devil brookshire said they could scarcely hear the deputys horse what did the man think he was going to do run the horse all the way to laredo it was hundreds of miles to laredo and what could he do when he got there the poor young woman was no doubt long since buried then brookshire remembered that katie his own wife was dead of course her death had been normal she had taken sick and died there had been no abuse and no rat poison but still his own wife was gone and like deputy plunkert he would be returning to nothing if he returned the cold wind was blowing it was always blowing brookshire began to get a worse feeling even than the blowingaway feeling it struck him that the expedition was cursed he had lost his wife while on the trip and now the same thing had happened to the young deputy who should never have been hired in the first place all deputy plunkert had done was ride pointlessly around texas and mexico while his young wife was despairing and dying the search for joey garza was being pressed at a high price and they hadnt come anywhere near the bandit yet now they were in mexico and captain call was in texas all that was being accomplished was that the wives were dying he knew pea eye had a wife toowhen would the messenger appear to tell him that his wife was dead pea eyes wife was a schoolteacher he recalled what if the manburner eluded captain call as joey garza had and burned up pea eyes wife along with some of the schoolchildren brookshire remembered all his happy years with katie and began to sob ordinarily he didnt cry in front of people but this time as when he first received the news about katie he couldnt help it sobs shook his shoulders it embarrassed pea eye and olin but brookshire didnt care he couldnt stop he was freezing his wife was dead and now the deputys wife was dead he was in a cold place in a strange forbidding country hunting a bandit how could it all have happened he was an accountant in brooklyn somehow a chain of events had got started and now the events were less and less sensible less and less like events that should be occurring in his life for a week or two he had enjoyed the adventure he had even flourished he mastered new skills such as building fires but the pleasure had all ended once he got the telegram informing him of katies death now it was all cold fatigue and pain where would it lead brookshire remembered his first impression of captain call he had felt that the man was too old for the mission he was charged with he had looked too old that first morning in amarillo brookshire had quickly gained confidence in the captain but now it was beginning to seem that his confidence had been misplaced and that his first impression had been accurate the captain had pursued no clear plan he had let himself be distracted by another killer they had ridden through mexico and then through texas without coming even within a hundred miles of joey garza as far as he knew it didnt add up and colonel terry would be quick to point out how erratically things had been managed but there was more at work than just cold and inconvenience and tactical mistakes at home behind them the wives were dying how far is it back he asked he felt that he was in the grip of a sickness of some kind he was in a place where nothing was rational and civilized as it had been in princeton college or as it was in brooklyn he was in a place where people killed regularly where killing was a daytoday part of life of course there were killings in brooklyn but very few in texas and mexico killing seemed to be almost constant brookshire had the feeling that he might go crazy if he didnt get back to a place and a form of life that were more familiar back where pea eye asked he saw that the man was upset deputy plunkerts departure had startled them all it was terribly bad luck that deputy plunkert had to receive such news when he was hundreds of miles from home the fact that it was rat poison that had killed his wife not to mention what had happened with the sheriff were facts that pea knew must be hard to bear if anything like that happened to lorena he himself would start racing off in the night ready to shoot the first man he saw but he was not in a position to take mr brookshire back to anywhere they had to go on to presidio where the captain expected them to be that was a clear order i expect well get to presidio in about three days if we dont have trouble he said brookshire didnt answer he scooted closer to the fire and sat with his hands held over the flames he was shivering and crying famous shoes didnt enter into the white mens talk he was beginning to tire of white men something that had happened often in his life they pursued their business in strange ways and got upset about things he didnt grasp he had begun to doubt that he would stay with pea eye long enough to find his wife he would like to learn about the tracks in books but he was old and the white mens habits were boring now one of the men had run off into the night like a crazy thing there were only two white men left if he tracked joey garza for these two men joey would immediately kill them both famous shoes thought he might tell his friend pea eye that his wife could teach him about the little tracks in the spring when he went traveling on the rio rojo famous shoes didnt think joey was in mexico and he was getting bored he thought he might leave in a day or two and go back to the madre eagles were more interesting than white men it would be more interesting to go home and watch the eagles for a while goodnight was coming across the sand through the sandhills when he saw a solitary rider coming from the south crow town was fifteen miles to the west he could see a speckling of crows in the sky when he looked toward the winter sunset coming across this particular stretch of country awakened quite a few memories until he noticed the rider goodnight had been lost in revery for he was crossing his own trail the trail he and his old partner oliver loving had laid out many years before in fact he was on the exact spot where they had rested the cattle on the second afternoon of their ninetymile waterless drive a horse had died inexplicably while they were resting he had cut into the horse in an effort to determine what had killed it but his work was to no avail the horse had just died goodnight had not expected to be crossing the trail so many years after oliver lovings death and at dusk on a cold winter night to boot but so it was if the rider he glimpsed was headed for crow town he was likely to be the sort of man it would behoove a person to avoid on the other hand once you started avoiding people you were apt to lose a lot of time even in the remote stretches along the pecos river a surprising number of people were apt to turn up decisions as to whether or not to go around a particular traveler needed to be made almost constantly going around people had never been goodnights practice and he decided he was too old to change it was nearly dark and the weather bleak he was almost upon the man before he could make out much about him when the rider was only thirty yards away goodnight saw that it was john wesley hardin a second later hardin hailed him why charlie dammit youre out late hardin said out late and far from home goodnight admitted he himself had never had any difficulty with wesley hardin but hardin was a nervous man who was known to kill from whim it wouldnt do to get too jocular with him if you didnt manage the jocularity to suit john wesley he might flare up and yank out a gun are you still in the cattle business hardin asked yep goodnight said still in it why thought you might want to switch to the crow business hardin said in a whinny of a laugh theres a lot of fine crows around here and theyre going cheap the best crow in crow town wouldnt sell for more than a penny in fact im looking for woodrow call goodnight said any news of him yes and im the only man thats got it hardin said i ought to charge you for it charlie since ive got a monopoly but being as its you its free woodrow call done for mox mox now thats news all right goodnight said are you sure sure as daylight hardin said i went down to piedras negras to whore because the garza boys mother took the women out of crow town im coming from mexico and im heading for denver i believe i can do better in colorado than im doing in texas where is mox mox goodnight asked i want to see his body im surprised youd doubt my word charlie hardin said with a touch of irritation i dont doubt it john goodnight said but i am determined to see the mans body he burnt four of my cowboys on the purgatory river and i want to be sure its him so i can stop chasing him in my head well the sonofabitch froze to death in a gully about a hundred miles south of here hardin said call killed all but one of his men about twenty miles farther on all of them were laying there dead except that quick cherokee boy him and mox mox made a run for it but mox mox was shot in the lights he played out and froze i expect the cherokee is still running let him run goodnight said call done a good days work no he done a sloppy days work john wesley said hes lucky he got the six men down shooting as bad as he was he knocked them over but they were still kicking and if any one of themd had any fight theyd have got him he had to finish them off with his pistol which is a disgrace if youre in good range and have a decent rifle to shoot the fact that he gave mox mox a mortal wound makes it a good days work in my opinion goodnight said mox mox was just a mean bandit charlie hardin said i wouldnt call him a man of talent the sonofabitch should have been a cook since he liked fires so much i could have killed him in a blink and all his men too i wonder where that cherokee boy has run to he added that cherokee boy is quick and he aint wasteful he didnt leave mox mox even so much as a match id appreciate it if youd direct me to that gully goodnight said id like to see the body before some varmint drags it off backtrack me for two days and youll run right into it charlie hardin replied it aint more than twentyfive miles south of the railroad goodnight was anxious to get going he had been thinking about his old partner oliver loving a man he had cared for greatly and with whom he had camped on the very spot where he was conversing with john wesley hardin oliver loving a fine cattleman had been dead for many years john wesley hardin a pure killer and a man who respected no one was still alive and still brash it was not justice it was just life well ill be going goodnight said much obliged for the news once ive seen whats left of the manburner i guess ill go home captain call done the job i ought to have done ten years ago he done it but he was lucky hardin said if you see him tell him that for me it might have been luck and it might have been preparation goodnight said call was always known for his careful preparation hardin laughed his whinny of a laugh again he can prepare till doomsday what he needs to do is shoot a little better hardin said he was just fighting louts if he thinks he can saunter up to the garza boy and be that lucky then he ought to retire the garza boy will pick him off before call even knows hes there have you met this boy goodnight asked he didnt necessarily believe what hardin was saying on the other hand what he was saying couldnt be lightly disregarded wesley hardin had been in several penitentiaries and undoubtedly knew something about killers why yes he showed up in crow town hardin said that was before the whores left i found him rather standoffish i started to kill him but then i decided it was the wrong day for hostilities why goodnight asked well it just was hardin replied ive got to the age where i dont tempt fate at least i dont if im drunk and i was drunk he cackled lit a cheap cigar and left goodnight looked around hardin was the kind of fellow who prompted you to watch your back but all he saw was a quick arc of red hardin had thrown the cheap cigar away two days later goodnight found the gully and inspected the remains which were a little scattered by that time the buzzards had helped him locate the correct gully in a country where there were many hardin had been right the manburner was dead there was also a dead horse a few hundred yards from where mox mox lay run to death goodnight felt sure mox mox wore a noticeable beltthe belt buckle had a red stone of some kind set in it goodnight took the belt and put it in his saddlebags when he next ran into call he planned to give him the belt if mox mox had run far enough to ride a horse to death call might not even know that he had killed him the belt ought to convince him then since he had ridden that far to see one body he rode another twenty miles to the camp where the battle had taken place he didnt have to search either he could see buzzards the whole way goodnight had surveyed many battle sites he could usually figure out what had gone on and what mistakes had been made from looking at the scattered cartridges the lost hats and the dead bodies in this case he dismounted and inspected the area carefully he was forced to conclude that john wesley hardin had been correct in his assessment woodrow call had been lucky probably only his willingness to keep pumping in bullets while his opponents were confused had saved him there was cover within a few steps of the campsite if one or two of the men had had any presence of mind they could have quickly dug in and made a fight of it they had horses too a couple of them could have flanked call and cut him off they hadnt though and that was that looking around goodnight found something surprisinga small rag doll such as a little girl might have mox mox must have had captives and was probably going to indulge in his favorite pastime but call had killed him in time and had probably taken the children to safety goodnight debated going to look for captain call what john wesley hardin had to say about the abilities of the garza boy weighed on his mind but after a time he decided to let it be mox mox not joey garza had burned his cowhands he himself was not a manhunter and he had a ranch to run woodrow call was the manhunter he had accepted the job let him do it if he couldnt some posse would eventually besides goodnight had been brooding during the whole ride about the insolence of muley his ranch cook he had decided to go home and fire the man even if it did mean a trip to amarillo and an irksome search goodnight didnt like leaving men unburied that had never been his practice unless the fight was so hot that he couldnt afford to stop and attend to the civilities he buried the scraps of mox mox the meanness was gone now and just bones and flesh remained goodnight unstrapped his little shovel and did the same for the six dead men then he turned back north toward the quitaque it was time to hang up the rifle the manburner was dead in the fight with mox mox call had somehow wrenched his neck it began to pain him badly as he rode south with lorena at times it was as if his nerves were on fire and he had to grit his teeth against the pain as they rode he could hardly turn his head to the right at all and he had to be cautious about turning it to the left or a streak of fire shot up from his shoulder blade almost to his ear its just a nuisance call said when lorena asked whether he was well she could see the strain in his face we should have bought some liniment when we had the chance lorena said pea eyes always getting sore in his back he cant lift hay like he once could call could not rid himself of the conviction that they were being followed he had no evidence but he could not relax every time he turned his head to scan the horizon behind them the pain shot up his neck on the evening of the third day they met a small horse herd being driven north by two cowboys one of the cowboys a tall fellow named roy malone had a drooping mustache that reminded call of dish boggett the excellent hat creek cowboy who was now selling hardware in lincoln new mexico by coincidence the horse herd was bound for the chisum ranch not far from lincoln youre welcome to stop the night with us call told roy malone but the cowboy shook his head you dont stop for the whole night if you work for mr chisum roy said he likes things to happen prompt if not a little sooner call would have been relieved to have some help as it was he stood watch himself most of the night lorena proved a competent traveling companion they had bacon and coffee acquired in fort stockton and she had coffee made and bacon fried not long after they made camp in the morning she cooked them a bite of breakfast before first light that cowboy reminded me an awful lot of dish call said as they ate id like to see dish sometime i never expected him to go in the hardware business i wonder if he married lorena said dish had been in love with her once he had stayed in love for several years it was a love she couldnt return thoughshe just couldnt some traveler told her that dish had taken a sledgehammer and used it to smash a heavy barrel of horseshoe nails in his surprise and disappointment when the news reached him that she had married pea eye the traveler said that people in lincoln were worried that dish would lose his mind from disappointment even though by that time she hadnt so much as seen him in over three years lorena didnt know what had kept her so stiff with dish she had just got stiff for a time in nebraska he had brought her flowers and given her little presents but it hadnt changed anything then she fell in love with pea eye who would never have ventured to choose a present for her or pick her a flower either i guess i should have left pea eye at home call said after they ate then you wouldnt have had to make this long trip it wont matter once i get him back lorena said the way she said it made call wish they could hurry along a little faster or that pea eye would get wind that his wife was coming and ride to meet them he felt he had run a miserable expedition so far it was the most ineffective of his life three families had been inconvenienced with as yet no progress at all in the matter of joey garza rumor in fort stockton had it that joey had gone back to coahuila but no one really had the details and call didnt know how much credit to give the rumor now he regretted that he had taken brookshire with him or deputy plunkert either colonel terry would rightly be incensed at the long wait and the absence of results brookshire had lost his wife while on the trip and pea eye had lost time from his farming lorena had to take leave from her schoolteaching when they got to presidio he meant to send everyone home from that point on he would hunt joey garza alone call wished his neck would ease up he had rarely felt a pain more intense than the fire that shot up his neck if he moved his head a little too quickly he also wished the cold would abate in the morning his hands were so swollen that he had increasing trouble doing the packing lorena saddled her mount and was ready to go before he could complete his chores when they got ready to start call noticed two horses standing a fair distance to the northwest of their camp i wonder if those cowboys lost some horses he said if they did therell be trouble when they get to john chisums hes the kind of man who counts his horses and he expects a full count he finished his coffee lorena was about done with her packing their breaths made clouds of steam it was hard to see the knots they had to tie to secure their duffle i think ill just ride out and check the brands on those horses call said i dont know why those men would let those horses stray they seemed like competent men he put his horse into a short lope before going a quarter of a mile he surprised two mule deer a doe with a fawn they had been bedded down but jumped up and scampered off in the clear air he had misjudged the distance to the horses a bit they were farther from camp than he thought while call was watching the mule deer his horse shied at a badger that waddled out from behind a sage bush practically at the horses feet the horse crowhopped a time or two just enough to cause call to lose a stirrup he had the horse almost calmed down and was searching for the stirrup with his foot when the first bullet struck him low in the chest careless he thought too careless and now im shot he whirled his mount and yanked his rifle from the saddle scabbard but his hands were so stiff with cold that he dropped the weapon just as he did a second bullet smashed his knee and evidently went through and wounded his horse for the horse squealed and began to buck a third shot hit his arm call was trying to hang on he couldnt afford to be thrown not with the bullets coming so fast and so accurately they seemed to him to be coming from under one of the stray horses careless he thought again hes shooting from under the horse and i rode right out to him then he lost his seat and was thrown hard in the direction of the rifle he had dropped fortunately he was able to reach the rifle he had to work the lever with one hand but as soon as he could sit up he began to fire in the direction of the horses one of them raced away but the other stood exactly where it had been hobbled probably so the rifleman could shoot from underneath it hidden by the sage there was a final shotit brought down calls horse all he could do then was wait in the hope that the killer would be foolhardy enough to come and try and finish him off after the shot that killed his horse there was not a sound from the northwest call knew he would have to try and staunch his bleeding soon he had been hit three times and the bullets were heavy caliber his left arm and right leg were smashed for good the arm was practically shot off when he looked at his knee he saw bone fragments through the hole in his pants the first wound the one in the chest was bleeding more than it should if he didnt staunch it soon he might faint and if he fainted he was lost and probably lorena too call raked up a little sand and covered the chest wound with it pulling aside his shirt the sandy poultice quickly grew muddy with blood but it was the only way he had of staunching the blood flow he kept raking sand and patting it onto his chest he raised up only high enough to see that the hobbled horse was still there any higher he couldnt risk he felt a deep shame when he thought of lorena back at the camp alone she would have heard the shots and he hoped that she would run there were ranches to the south perhaps she could survive long enough to reach one of them if the killer didnt strike her too he had brought her with him and then failed to protect herthe very thing he had mentioned and the very thing he had feared now he himself might be dying the chest wound probably involved a lung he could feel the bullet like a nut inside him when he coughed call knew he should not have let the killer know that hed got his riflethat was another mistake now there was little hope that the killer joey garza probably would expose himself at all and even if he was reckless and let himself be seen call knew it would only be luck if he could hit him shooting onehanded he had botched the matter completely everything was his fault he had known in his gut that someone was following them someone so clever that unending vigilance was essential but the fact that the cowboys had apparently lost two horses a normal thing had distracted him to such an extent that he had just ridden out casually as he would have under normal circumstances to have a look now a clever boy shooting from under a hobbled horse had done what all the fighters he had engaged with over four decadeskicking bird the comanche the kiowa pedro flores and outlaws of all description both mexican and americanhad failed to do he was hit and hit soundly probably only the fact that his horse was restive caused the first bullet to miss his heart it hadnt missed it by much at that if it had missed it perhaps it was his hearts blood he was pumping out once before he had been hit by a bullet that bullet was fired by an apache as call was about to cross the pecos river with gus mccraes body on the long trek back from miles city montana where gus had died but that bullet had merely lodged in his side and had touched no vital organs it was a nuisance mainly it pained him at times but call didnt regard it as a serious wound and had never bothered to have it cut out the apache had shot from a considerable distance too the bullet had been almost spent when it hit him it didnt stop him from crossing the river or from burying gus mccrae where he had wanted to be buried now call knew he was so badly hit that he would be lucky to live he didnt expect that he would live and didnt care really if he could only kill joey garza before he died he felt that he had to kill him it was the only way to provide any measure of safety for lorena and not just lorena either there was pea eye and brookshire and deputy plunkert to think of the ease with which joey garza if it was the young bandit had drawn him in range and the consistency of the shooting was a shock shooting from under a horse was an old old trick the indians had done it routinely call reproached himself bitterly for carelessness for assuming the horses were strays but he knew that he could reproach himself for a year and not alter the truth which was that someone joey garza most likely had outsmarted him easily and shot him probably mortally what made the failure worse was that the burden of his error would be visited upon people who had depended on him it would be visited on lorena and probably on pea eye and brookshire and deputy plunkert too call remembered mox mox and the cherokee killer jimmy cumsa he considered the possibility that they had lured him out of camp perhaps it was jimmy cumsa who had shot from under the tethered horse but call didnt think so mox mox was like most outlaws careless and lazy he had made camp in a place that laid him open to easy ambush he had posted no guard nothing he had done had been smart or well planned crouched behind a sage bush one arm and one leg useless call felt a desperate need to slay his murderer before he died he felt the wound in his chest it seemed to him the bleeding was slowing he might have an hourhe might have morebut he doubted he had much more he didnt think his opponent was mox mox or the cherokee either they ran and he imagined they would keep running but someone had followed him and waited while he was in fort stockton and then had picked up the trail when he and lorena left town it was the sense that he was being followed that caused the terrible ache in his neck call was sure of that never before in his life had he been unable to backtrack and surprise a pursuer rarely had he encountered an outlaw with the patience to wait outside a town for three days in bitter cold until his prey took to the trail most outlaws acted on impulse they rarely planned and when they did plan the slightest hitch was likely to cause them to abandon their plans many an innocent citizen had fallen because some bank robber saw a deputy sheriff approaching as the robbery was in progress usually the robber started shooting rarely was the deputy the one killed old ladies chatting with a teller got killed or merchants who picked a bad time to make a deposit got killed call knew that successful bandits had their reputations inflated by rumor the press helped bandits get names for themselves people in small towns who were bored most of their lives thought bandits were colorful the newspapers printed the gossip and pretty soon everyone on the frontier would get the notion that a certain bandit was invincible when in fact few of them were particularly able or more than moderately smart but the person who had put three bullets in him in less than five seconds was exceptional call knew his first mistake had been a reluctance to believe that the garza boy actually might be exceptional he had assumed that his was just another case of inflated reputation he had only begun to suspect differently when he hadnt been able to catch joey garza following him call had known it when the boy had ridden up almost before he was out of sight and killed roy bean yet he hadnt acted on his knowledge he had eaten lorenas bacon drunk her coffee and loped out to check the brands on two horses as if joey garza was any other killer he had failed in vigilance and now he was paying for his failure that had always been the way of the frontier if you failed in vigilance you usually died rarely would the frontier permit a lapse as serious as the one he had just made call considered that he had always been able to draw on more will than most men possessed he could keep riding longer and keep fighting harder than any man he had worked with he had never considered himself brilliant and as a rider or a shot he was only average but he could keep going in situations where others had to stop he had never quit a fight and the fight he was in now demanded just that persistence of him he might be dying but he couldnt quit until he had killed his killer if he failed all his effort would have been futile and the lives of people who trusted him deeply would in all likelihood be forfeit call risked sitting up for a second to see if he could catch a glimpse of the rifleman the hobbled horse was exactly where it had been but call saw no onenot a movement not a hat not a glint of sun on a rifle barrel he flattened himself on his belly and began to push the rifle ahead of him he wished he could simply cut off the useless arm and the useless leg the leg was the worsthe didnt look at his knee but he knew it must be nothing but bone fragments the pain was beginning and when he moved sharp points of bone tore at what flesh was left the arm he didnt feel he pulled himself along on his one good elbow for a while he pushed the rifle ahead of him but he soon abandoned the rifle and took out his pistol instead if he got a shot at joey garza it would likely be at close range if it wasnt at close range he would probably miss anyway particularly if he tried to shoot a rifle with one hand every few minutes call raised up his vision annoyed him he couldnt see sharply he could see the horse but not the shooter it angered him his eyesight was no longer adequate to the work he had tried to do no doubt gus mccrae or charles goodnight men renowned for the sharpness of their vision would have seen the boy under the horse while still safely out of rifle range either one of them could have seen that the horse was hobbled and have avoided the bullets he had tried spectacles but found them irritating and he had not provided himself with any for the trip that little neglect was another reason he was shot and dying call kept on crawling the hobbled horse had been some two hundred yards away when the shots came call wiggled for nearly half the distance the pain in his leg growing more terrible with every movement he left a trail of blood on the sand and on the sage bushes as he crawled but he began to grow weak and he began to feel lightheaded he saw that he wasnt going to make it to the hobbled horse he wouldnt last that long besides the boy might not even be there he might have been so confident of the wounds he had given that he had simply slipped away call felt his strength failing he had crawled a long way but he was still just half the distance to the horse and had still not caught one glimpse of human movement he decided to tempt the boy if the boy was there he would show himself maybe the boy would want to laugh at him taunt him shoot him again if so call might be lucky enough to get off two or three pistol shots if he was very lucky he might put the boy down it was a gamble of course he had never shot especially well with the pistol and the garza boy would not likely be such a fool as to come close so far the garza boy had been no sort of fool at all but it was a chancehis only chance in another few minutes he might pass out already he had lost so much blood that his hand was unsteady call wished he had kept pushing the rifle it would make a fair crutch something to support him when he stood up but he had foolishly left it he would just have to teeter as best he could and hope the garza boy would be amused enough to expose himself very carefully call got into a sitting position he had his pistol on cock he got his good leg under him and rested a minute when he tried to take a deep breath to steady himself he coughed again he felt the first bullet like a nut in his chest but he gathered himself wiped the sweat out of his eyes with his good arm wiped the blood off the gun with his shirttail and slowly eased up the hobbled horse was still hobbled call could see nothing beneath it then he heard a movement to his left and shot three times at the sound it had sounded like a human footstepjoey garza had probably been sneaking up to finish him but to his immediate bitter disappointment call saw that it was only the mule deer he had scared earlier he had shot the big doe she bucked a few times and ran off the fawn bounding after her through the sage call knew it was no good it was a failure a botch joey garza had left he might have already found lorena and killed her perhaps joey wouldnt bother with her after all he had killed the bounty hunter and there would be no one to interfere with his robbing for a while perhaps the clever boy would just ride away but it was clear that all the options belonged to joey garza call couldnt see him couldnt find him couldnt affect his actions he eased back down he had begun to feel the dangling arm as well as the shattered leg he lay flat concealing the pistol under his bloody shirttail if the boy did happen to ride by to inspect the body call might yet get off a shot but he didnt expect this to happen his head was swimming he was so light in the head that he felt he was off the ground he seemed to be somewhere between the sagebrush and the moving clouds he tried to keep his eyes open he felt dreamy and tried to fight the feeling he kept telling himself that any moment he might look up and see the garza boy standing over him or looking down at him from horseback he had to try to stay alert but his eyelids wouldnt obey they kept closing at first for only a fraction of a second but then it seemed to call that despite himself he was floating away into the world behind his eyelids they wouldnt stay open they wouldnt in the world behind his eyelids everything was white when lorena heard the shooting she quickly took her pistol out of her bag in presidio captain call had given her one of his rifles she took that too if we get separated youd have a gun you might kill an antelope or a deer with he had said ive never killed a big animal lorena had replied id rather we didnt get separated now they were separated lorena had trouble getting the heavy rifle out of its scabbard she finally had to take the scabbard off the saddle to do it she took the pistol and the rifle and crawled quickly into a thick clump of chaparral near the camp the thorns were sharp and she got scratched in several places but she didnt care she clutched the guns and pushed on into the very center of the chaparral if the shooter was mox mox and he had killed captain call she meant to kill herself or else fight so hard that mox mox would have to kill her to get her out of the brush she didnt intend to be mox moxs prisoner again not even if it meant losing the life she wanted to devote to her children clara and pea eye would have to raise the children she would not live to let mox mox smear grease in her eyes again lorena crouched in the brush listening the pistol in her hand after the first several rifle shots there was a long silence she could only endure it she didnt dare come out of her hiding place although she knew it would be no hiding place at all to the killers if they came for her then she heard three smaller reports pistol shots she supposed crouching she remembered the night gus had rescued her from blue duck and ermoke she remembered the shooting and how she had hoped she would die somehow if gus was killed she felt that terrible feeling again if captain call had fallen and left her to mox mox she wanted to die she wanted to have it over her hope was that she would have the strength to shoot herself she would have to not think too much of her children she would have to let them pass in her mind to clara and pea but the cold hours passed and lorena heard nothing and saw nothing there was not a movement anywhere she twisted around and around in the thorny chaparral hoping to catch a glimpse of the men who might be coming so she could prepare but no men came lorena waited hours four or more judging by the weak sun finally she began to be a little less frightened the terror that had tightened her chest and made it hard even to breathe began to loosen it might be that no one was coming it might be that captain call had killed mox mox or the garza boy or whoever had been there if he hadnt someone would have come she kept looking in the direction captain call had taken she knew he must be injured or dead otherwise he would have returned she began to feel that she should go look for him but it was midafternoon and the sun was dropping in its arc before she could conquer her fear sufficiently to crawl out of the chaparral the thorns had made her feel at least a little bit safe she was reluctant to leave them but she knew she had to if captain call was dead it was time to know it then she would have to try and go on alone she knew where the rio grande was that morning captain call had said they would be there in two more days she thought she could survive two days and find her way if no one caught her when she stood up she could see one of the stray horses it had not moved from where it had been that morning though the other horse was gone she mounted and rode toward the horse her pistol in her hand it took her only a few minutes to cover the distance to the stray horse the first thing she saw as she came near the stray was a dead horse it was captain calls lying not far from it was a dead mule deer as lorena approached a fawn bounded away then she saw the captains rifle there was blood on the sand near it and a bloody trail leading toward the stray horse lorena dismounted and followed the trail of blood pistol in hand when she found the captain lying flat on his back behind a sage bush a pistol lying near she thought he was dead blood had pooled beneath him some of it seeping out of a wound in his chest the rest was from a smashed arm and smashed leg she thought he was dead she had better leave him and try to get to the river and find pea eye but when she knelt by the captain she saw his eyelids flutter he opened his eyes and his hand came up as if he were about to fire a gun at her only he had no gun in his hand the pistol lay not a foot away beside his mangled leg call saw that it was the woman pea eyes wife her face had collected itself out of the whiteness he lay in she had a horse behind her he had almost shot at her thinking she was joey garzait was lucky he had lost hold of his gun he got me you go on he whispered who got youwas it mox mox no call said mox mox would have come to burn me it was the boy i never saw a trace of him then he fainted his voice had been a feeble whisper yet he wasnt dead how he had lived with such wounds and such a loss of blood was a mystery though lorena knew that people did survive the most terrible wounds all the time gus mccrae could have survived if only he would have allowed his legs to be taken off lorena had felt angry for years that gus would not allow that as if she would have stopped loving him because he had no legs now the same violence or worse had been done to the captain if he lived at all he would probably have to lose the leg and the arm lorena didnt know how she could move him without killing him yet she had to move him or else build a fire where he was when night came he would freeze in his own blood if he had no fire also his horse was dead and they had brought no pack animals he would have to ride her horse if he lived then she remembered the stray horse still standing a hundred yards or so away maybe the stray was tame enough that she could ride him then the captain could have her horse if she could get him on it she took the bridle off calls dead horse and walked out to the stray the horse a buckskin whinnied when she approached she saw that he was hobbled no wonder he had stood there all day she slipped the bridle on and the horse let her lead him back to where the captain lay then lorena went back to their camp and moved it she had been mostly packed anyway there was just the coffeepot and the skillet and a few other things she had waited in the chaparral too long and now it was too late to move the captain the best thing she could do for him was to build a big fire and try to get a little coffee in him if she kept him warm he might live through the night lorena spent the last hour of sunlight gathering wood she wanted to keep the fire hot until morning the captain whispered now and then but so low that lorena couldnt hear what he was saying he was still bleeding she didnt expect him to live his hands twitched but otherwise he scarcely moved at times the captain lay so still that lorena thought he was gone she would have to put her hand on his breast to determine that he was still breathing the only water she had was in the four canteens and there was no creek or river near where they had camped lorena knew she ought to wash the captains wounds but she was fearful of using up the water if she couldnt move him for several days they would need it if she left him to go look for water she might be unable to find her way backshe might only make their situation worse she decided finally to sacrifice one canteen she boiled water in the coffeepot and very carefully opened the captains shirt and cleaned the wound in his chest the arm and the leg were more difficult for she had to cut his shirtsleeve and pants leg away every time she moved the wounded limbs even a little the captain moaned once when she was a little too rough with the leg he cried out it was no wonder either his knee was nothing but splinters of bone and the arm was not much better still lorena knew that it was the wound in his chest that threatened his life the wound leaked only a little blood now but a large bullet was somewhere in the captain near his heart and that was bad once in the night call woke he had supposed lorena was gone but then he saw her putting sticks on the fire you ought to go on he said again you can make the river pea eye aint far from the river just follow the rio concho into mexico for half a day youll find him captain i cant ride off and leave you to die lorena said if you die ill gobut not until then foolish call whispered i might linger for a week i cant get well id be obliged if youd go am i such poor company lorena said trying to josh a little his breathing was labored and she didnt expect he would live youve got a family i dont call whispered you need to quit talking and rest lorena said that was easy advice to take call found that just lifting his tongue to make words was heavy work it was as hard as lifting the side of a wagon to fix a busted wheel a few words just whispers and he had to rest in the night the sky cleared and the cold grew more bitter just before first light lorena used the last of her wood she could hear the captain breathing there was a rasp in his breath she had to walk a long way to find an armful of frozen sticks for a moment she thought she was lost but luckily it was still dark enough that she caught a flash of her own fire she made it back to camp and fed the fire holding her cold hands over it despite the good fire the captain was shivering lorena managed to pull and tug until she got the saddle free of his dead mount she wanted the saddle blanket they had only three blankets and she put all of them on the captain placing the heavy saddle blanket over them she had to keep arranging the blankets because the captain became restive when he shifted he cried out from the pain in his arm and leg lorena knew she had to choose from between lesser evils she could try to get the captain on a horse and take him with her or she had to leave and hope she could find a town and get back with help before he died probably he would die in either event from moving or from staying he was not a large man in the years since she had last seen him he had become older and smaller she was sure he hadnt been so small when she had known him before her marriage she felt sure she could lift him onto a horse but whether the movement would kill him she didnt know when it warmed a little she would have to make her choice she tried to feed call a little coffee with a spoon but he was shivering so that most of the coffee spilled onto his shirt you need to take a little itll warm you she said but call was unconscious he didnt respond lorena decided then to take him with her if she could get him on a horse while he was unconscious the pain might not be so sharp a few buzzards were circling in the cold sky attracted by the dead horse and the dead deer lorenas horse was an old black plug named blackie the captain had chosen a solid mount for her one that would not act up and throw her some cold morning she saddled blackie and walked him over to the dead horse the frost was so intense that the dead horse didnt smell not yet the corpse would make a good stepladder she decided it was the only one available to her she didnt want to give herself time to think about the task too much she didnt want to waver when she lifted the captain she was shocked by how little he weighed clarie her fifteenyearold far outweighed him she had been tussling with clarie not long before they left home and had tried to lift her off the ground it was all she could do to lift her daughter and carry her a few steps captain call wasnt as heavy as clarie not nearly it seemed absurd to her that this man old and small was still the man they sent after the meanest killers they should have found a younger manhunter long since and captain call should have been living a safer life that was wisdom come too late though as she was carrying him to the horse the captain woke he looked at the ground as if surprised that a woman was carrying him but his eyes were not focusing for he was in great pain captain do you think you can ride lorena asked i caught that other horseill put you on blackie call blinked the world was hazy he saw the black horse standing by the dead horse lorena was carrying him as if he weighed nothing the fact was his weight had dropped in the last few years but not being on his own feet startled him it made him wonder if he was still himself he had always had his own feet on the ground to be carried even the few steps to the horse was like floating he felt he was floating into another life a life so different from his old one that he wondered if he would even have the same name i aint been carried since my ma carried me i guess he whispered lorena got his good foot in the stirrup call pulled up with her help but when he swung his bad leg over the saddle he yelled out then he vomited and fainted at least he was on the horse lorena thought he was unconscious she cut his lariat into sections with the big bowie knife he kept in his saddlebags and then she tied him on the buckskin stray was jumpy when she first mounted but she walked him until he settled down captain call was alive but only just she didnt want any jumpy horses causing his death she led blackie and led him slowly she hoped call would come to from time to time to direct her if she strayed off course call did awaken several times during the day but he was too weak to speak the pain in his leg was so intense that he could not hang on to consciousness for more than a few minutes lorena checked on him frequently she was hoping for directions but calls whispers were incoherent he muttered a name but she didnt catch it lorena stopped well before dark she wanted plenty of time to gather firewood they stopped by a little creek with a trickle of water in it she wanted to heat water and try again to wash the captains wounds he had wet himself during the long day horseback she knew she could never manage to change his pants with the shattered knee but she could at least put him by the fire and dry him the wound in his chest was still leaking blood she cleaned that and then cleaned off the saddle it was a bloody smelly mess lorena gathered an abundance of firewood and drank several cups of strong coffee she gave the captain some and he came awake enough to drink it gratefully all they had was bacon lorena fried some but the captain only ate two bites dillard he whispered it was the name he had been muttering all day but it meant nothing to lorena dillard brawley call said he was the barber in lonesome dove well i never used a barber in lonesome dove lorena said i guess i never met him a centipede got in his pants and ruined his leg call whispered gus and me tied him to a table and cut his leg off we had tohe would have died of blood poisoning if we hadnt you have to do the same you have to cut my leg off no lorena said that town cant be more than two more days therell be a doctor there to tend to your leg in his haze during the ride call remembered gus mccraes wounded legs and how they looked before he died both guss legs had turned black and guss wound had been nowhere near as bad as his during the day a great clot of blood had formed on calls splintered knee the bullet had hit just below the knee but had gone upward and wrecked the kneecap lorena had tried to wash the clot but it looked so bad that she had concentrated on doing the other wounds first the bone fragments were like needles then she remembered the onelegged man in lonesome dove he had come in the bar sometimes he had a hoarse voice was dillard the man with the hoarse voice she asked call nodded he ruined his voice screaming when we took the leg off call whispered we thought hed faint but he never fainted he just screamed his voice away lorena concentrated on washing the wounded arm she hoped the captain would forget about the leg though she knew the pain must be too great to allow for forgetfulness she was not squeamish clara had sometimes been in demand as a midwife and lorena had gone with her to help she had also helped castrate horses when the ranch was shorthanded and she had helped birth foals as well as babies she had felt the pains of childbirth five times herself and she didnt faint at the sight of blood even a lot of blood she had seen injuries some of them horrible she had once bandaged the arm of a farmer who had been mangled in a haying machine and she had several times cut fish hooks out of her own children but she didnt want to have to be the one to remove captain calls leg better to travel night and day until they reached a settlement where there was a qualified doctor the knee looked so bad that she was even indecisive about cleaning it still there was gus and his death to remember the clot on the captains knee was black lorena thought about it until her mind went numb she tipped over by the hot fire and slept a little in the morning when she awoke the captain was looking at her out of feverish eyes lorena looked at the leg and then looked away you might bleed to death she said i didnt yet call whispered i aint handsome like gus ive got no women to lose if i have to be onelegged i will i want to live to kill that boy lorena felt a flush of disgust the man was all but dead and might be dead before a day passed or even an hour he could barely whisper and his arm was ruined he had a bullet in his chest that made his breath sound like a snore yet he still wanted to kill the sympathy lorena had felt for him in his pain went away not all of it but much of it you ought to think of a better reason to live than killing a boy lorena said if killing is the only reason you can think of to live then you might as well die call was surprised by the anger in lorenas voice lorena was surprised by it herself it came from memories and from times long past from things she had felt about gus and things she had felt about jake spoon the very man before her captain call the man with the ruined arm and leg and the deep chest wound had himself hung jake spoon his friend if gus mccrae hadnt killed to save her she would have died alone at the hands of cruel men long years before she would have had no husband no children no pupils killing was part of the life they had all lived on the frontier guss killings had saved her but lorena still felt a bitterness and an anger not so much at the old hurt man laying by the campfire as at the brutal way of life in the place they lived she and clara sometimes daydreamed of making a trip to england together to see civilization they meant to visit shakespeares birthplace and to see a play they had amused themselves in the nebraska evenings by imagining what they would say if they happened to meet mr browning on the street or mr carlyle yet here she was not with clara in a theater or a nice hotel in london but on a bleak prairie with not even one house within a hundred miles caring for an old killer who wanted her to cut his ruined leg off so he could get well and kill again she had studied and educated herself but she had not escaped when she looked around and saw where she was and remembered why she was therebecause this man had taken her kind husband to help him kill a train robbershe felt a deeper anger still im tired of it lorena said im tired of it captain you oughtnt to have taken my husband hes not a killer you and gus were the killers i loved gus mccrae but not like i love my husband our children love him and need him you oughtnt to have taken him from us call was sorry he had said anything better to have stayed quiet until he died lorena was risking her life to help him and pea eye was risking his life too and yet he had angered her there was justice in what she said too he shouldnt have taken her husband he had taken him and wasted weeks of his time and put his life in jeopardy and for nothing the garza boy is a killer he whispered i dont care lorena said theres killers and killers and killers out here my husbands got nothing to do with that you should have let him be call remembered the fury clara allen had directed at him in nebraska as he was leaving her ranch with augustuss body to bring it back to texas now another woman and one who was putting herself to great trouble to save him was just as angry if not angrier he didnt know what the flaw was in his speech or in himself that brought up such anger in women but the fury was up in lorena he saw it in her eyes in the way her nostrils flared in the stiff way she held herself you remember what i was captain lorena said i was a whore two dollars was all i costa dollar on sunday i dont know how many men bought me i expect if you brought them all here theyd about fill this desert i expect theyd nearly make an army call remembered well enough gus and jake and dish and many men in lonesome dove had visited lorena in those days cowboys rode fifty miles out of their way to visit lorena but im not a whore now lorena said im a married woman im a mother i teach school i didnt stay what i wascan you understand that i didnt stay what i was clara cared for me and she showed me a better way call didnt know what was wrong lorena had clenched her fist and if he had been well she might have hit him but the garza boy was a killer and a deadly one he killed frequently and without pity so far as call knew he had been hired to stop the boys killing that was his job getting well in order to do what he had been hired to do seemed a reason to live though when he took stock of his actual condition he knew it was unlikely that he would ever go on the hunt for a killer again he probably wouldnt live anywaywhy was the woman so angry ill cut your leg off lorena said ill cut it off now if you die then youll have been killed by a killer like yourself but if you live you oughtnt to stay a killer i didnt stay a whore in her anger she thought she could just take the big knife and cut the ruined leg off but when she actually prepared for the task she cooled quickly call was feverish and barely conscious when he saw lorena take the knife he wondered in a dim faraway state of mind if he should have made the request he and gus together had a time getting dillard brawleys leg off and theyd had a saw a knife wouldnt cut bone if the joint was shattered as it seemed to be she might cut there but she would have to nick the knife blade first to make a kind of saw hit the knife on a rock hit hard call said weakly you need to nick it a little so itll saw once youve nicked it sharpen it he added in a whisper theres a whetstone in my saddlebags lorena found the whetstone she hit the knife blade hard against a rock again and again finally she made a few small nicks along the blade then she sharpened the big knife for several minutes captain call had his eyes closed lorena hoped he was unconscious she filled the coffeepot with water and heated it then she poured the water over his knee until most of the black clot was gone she knew she had to cut at the joint and she wanted to see as clearly as she could captain i oughtnt to do this lorena said i dont know how to take a leg off if i die itll be the bullet that killed me not the knife call whispered it wont be none of your fault thats how you feel maybe lorena replied im the one that will be doing the cutting if this dont work ill be questioning my judgment for a long time time and again in her marriage lorena had watched pea eye put off decisions he would hem and haw and lean one way and then another and try to weigh the pros of a given matter against the cons usually he would keep on weighing the pros and cons for several weeks or even months until one day lorena would have had enough of his procrastination she would whirl and make the decision herself annoyed that she hadnt gone on and made it weeks before she was at such a point with the captain he was only just barely alive his leg was ruined either she had to carry him on and hope she found a doctor before he died or she had to cut without speaking to call again she made her decisionshed cut she grasped his thigh with her left hand to hold it steady and she cut call moaned he was too weak to manage a scream he was in a hazy hot state he moaned twice and then boiling red water seemed to settle over him lorena was glad he was unconscious she didnt want him looking at her with his feverish eyes while she labored to remove his leg it was labor too the hardest apart from childbirth that she had ever done in no time it seemed she had blood to her elbows the knife became slippery so slippery that lorena had to wipe off the handle several times the flesh cut but the bone was unyielding she sawed and sawed but it seemed that she was only scraping the bone the captain was bleeding heavily again and it seemed to lorena that he must be almost drained he might be bleeding to death even as she cut lorena became desperate she began to saw with both hands bearing down on the knife as hard as she could blood ran so thick that she couldnt see the groove where she had the knife her arms were weary up to the shoulders from pressing and sawing once when she paused just a moment the captain rolled over she had to turn him back and then wash the blood out and find the cut in the bone she began to hate the blood it was everywhereon her on her dress on the captains shirt it made the knife so slippery she couldnt hold it in the groove she wanted to take a rock and smash the leg off somehow her shoulders ached and a pain shot down her back from the effort of bearing down on the knife she remembered clara and how she had worked when they were pulling a foal out of a young mare claras arms would be red to the shoulder from reaching into the mare to turn the foal she would go home bloody from her shoulders down but she never quit and she rarely lost a foal lorena knew she couldnt quit either she had started and she had to finish she sawed on and on though she had little hope that she would succeed or that the captain would live then lorena realized she was sawing dirt it was dirt as soaked with blood as she and the captain were but it was dirt the leg was off lorena was so exhausted that she couldnt move she knew she would have to tear up a dress to make a bandage for it was all she had but she was too weak to move she didnt know what to do with the severed leg she had cut it off but she didnt want to touch it or even look at it she didnt want to bury it or be near it what she had done had been too hard it had brought her so close to death that the thought of death was comforting she had known that feeling beforelife could be so harsh that the thought of death seemed to offer the only comfort it wasnt good to be so close to death because death might suck you in she got to her feet finally and walked away a few steps to be farther from the captain she felt she wanted to be away from him and away from what she had done she walked some distance from the fire and sat down on a large rock she was covered with the captains blood she didnt know if he was even alive and she would soon have to go find out but for a moment she needed to stay apart for if she didnt she might lose her mind she had come so close to death that she had forgotten everything else forgotten that she was a married woman with children to raise she had to stay apart to remember who she was and what her life was she had to remember her children and her husband she had to pull back from the place of blood and killing lorena sat for nearly an hour feeling empty she knew the captain might be dying bleeding to death as she satbut she could not do a thing about it she had done what the man had asked most of her life she had struggled to do what some man asked but she was through with that she could do no more only pea eye her husband didnt ask her for things she had to strain to do pea eye never asked for anything sometimes it irritated her that he asked for so little but when she calmed down some what she felt was a great longing to see pea her husband she needed to see him once she found him then she could rest when lorena stood up again she found that she had hardly any strength in her legs it was hard even to walk back to the campfire but she did captain call was still alive and still unconscious she didnt want to touch the severed leg she pushed it away with a stick tore up her spare dress and bandaged calls wound as best she could then she saddled the horses and packed the few things there were to pack she went to the little creek and filled all the canteens moving very slowly she seemed to have no strength getting the captain on the horse was going to be hard she began to wish he would just die so she wouldnt have to bother lifting him was very hard but the captain roused a little once he was in the saddle he steadied himself though he didnt speak and didnt seem to know where he was lorena was not sure he even realized she had cut off his leg the leg lay by the smoldering campfire where lorena had pushed it captain calls boot was still on it lorena started to mention the boot but what good was a boot if you didnt have the leg she felt wrong probably she should bury the leg but she was too tired too tired to bury it or even to mention it she barely had the strength to tie the duffle to her saddle pulling herself into the saddle was hard when she reached over to take blackies reins she felt a great urge just to put her head down on the horses neck and go to sleep we go south call barely whispered he saw that lorena was exhausted he felt a throbbing pain but it was less sharp than it had been captain i left your leg lorena said as they were starting captain call didnt hear and didnt answer the morning after deputy plunkert ran away in his grief famous shoes who had been squatting by the fire napping a little heard the approach of a stumbling horse olin roy had risen early and departed olin had never been one to stay in camp very long brookshire was already awake even though he was very tired the cold was so intense that he generally huddled by the fire in the hours before dawn sitting up was more rel than laying on the cold ground pea eye is a good sleeper famous shoes observed i dont think he would hear a bear if one came along why there aint bears here are there brookshire asked the captain didnt mention bears when we came through here before in the madre where i live there are many bears famous shoes said there are not too many bears left along the river but there are still enough that a bear could come along if one came along it would eat pea eye before he woke up he added brookshire was glad he had several guns with him if a bear came into camp he supposed he could hit it the range would not be a problem i think that horse i hear has something wrong with it famous shoes said its just stumbling along he got up and disappeared into the darkness brookshire had heard one or two faint sounds but he couldnt identify them if the old indian thought they were made by a stumbling horse he was probably right famous shoes was back almost immediately leading deputy plunkerts horse which was indeed crippled and without its saddle and bridle its right shoulder seemed to be broken and a rear leg was injured as well when famous shoes tried to inspect its rear leg the horse squealed in pain the squeal woke up pea eye who had been dreaming that it was saturday afternoon at home lorena had been giving the boys their haircuts all the boys hated having their hair cut they considered it unfair that they should have to have their hair cut so often since clarie their big sister could let her hair grow as long as she liked nonetheless lorena insisted on cutting the boys hair every other saturday afternoon she had ordered special hair clippers from a catalogue and had a special pair of scissors that she used to give haircuts with the boys all complained that the clippers pinched them cruelly but lorena ignored their complaints after she finished with the boys lorena would cut his hair although the clippers did occasionally pinch a little pea eye didnt mind lorenas haircuts at all he liked the touch of his wifes cool hands as she smoothed his hair and brushed it he had a tendency to cowlicks lorena could never correct them but she would often take several minutes at the end of each haircut smoothing the remains of the cowlicks with her cool hands trying to make him look presentable or at least acceptable in case they felt like making the fifteenmile trip to church on sunday morning pea eye would go into a happy reverie while lorena cut his hair he knew he was very lucky to have such a considerate and affectionate wife one who would take time from her many chores to cut his hair and try to make it look good he knew he didnt really look very goodhe never hadit was all that much more a miracle that lorena chose to give him such loving attention he didnt know why she did and he never allowed himself to expect it to continue yet through the years as the children grew it seemed that it did continue it was so nice to see lorena and the boys even in a dream that pea eye was reluctant to wake up and face the day it was very pleasant to be with his family in his dream of saturday afternoon he could even see the clippings of brown hairthe boys had brown hairall over the kitchen floor lorena would sweep up the hair cuttings as soon as she finished the haircuts if she saw a particularly fetching lock from one of her sons though she might keep it and put it in her album of family memories why it aint too different from taking scalps pea eye had observed once when he noticed lorie saving a lock of georgies hair it is too different lorena said then to his horror she burst into tears i just want a few curls of hair from my menfolks she said in a shaking voice id have it to remember you all by in case something happened to any of you she cried hard and pea eye felt miserable then she stopped crying at least that was over he thought he regretted his careless remark about the scalps things happen to people dont you understand that lorena said and began crying again harder than ever still despite that painful memory one of the many that had been caused by his slips of the tongue it was hard to leave the peaceful dream of home and haircutting to come back to the cold world of mexico deputy plunkerts horse was back in camp badly crippled but where was deputy plunkert i think his horse fell famous shoes said it has blood on its head i think it fell and hit a rock sure enough the horse had a cut place on its head could you backtrack this horse pea eye asked ted plunkert might be hurt i think you should kill this horseit cant walk any further famous shoes said we can eat him then he left he was gone several hours his absence made brookshire nervous morning became noon and then midafternoon they were just sitting and waiting and brookshire hated waiting at least when they were moving he could convince himself that they were following a plan it was the captains plan on a daytoday and hourto hour basis it might seem pointless but there was always at least the hope that the captain might know what he was doing he might yet catch joey garza or kill him thus ending the threat after all brookshire had seen with his own eyes how quickly captain call had ended the threat of sheriff joe doniphan it had only taken him a few seconds once he got to it the few seconds that it would take him to end the career of joey garza might arrive just as unexpectedly the hands of the clock would keep turning and one day the captain and joey garza would finally be in the same place then when that moment arrived joey garza would be dead or captured and colonel terry could get a good nights sleep or at least start worrying about something else brookshire had never witnessed anything as violent as what captain call had done to the sheriff he had seen the results of such violence during the war but he had not actually seen the violence happen i wish famous shoes would get back pea eye said he had already shot the crippled horse but he didnt butcher it they still had bacon and a little venison from a small buck he had shot he didnt feel he had to be reduced to eating horsemeat not yet there were only two hours of sunlight left when famous shoes returned though he rarely seemed to show the effects of travel this time he did when he returned he wasnt trotting he was walking he had a belt in his hand which he handed to pea eye it was deputy plunkerts belt that horse ran off a bluff he said if the moon had been shining he might have seen where he was going but it was dark how about ted pea eye asked he is dead famous shoes said i buried him i only had my knife to dig with or i would have been back sooner good lord he fell that far pea eye said it must have been a high bluff no the fall only broke his hip famous shoes said some vaqueros came along and shot him and took his clothes i found this belt though i think they dropped it though the fire was blazing brookshire felt cold a man who had been with them for weeks who had been sitting around this very campfire on the night before was now dead he had run off in grief over the cruel death of his wife and now was dead himself of a circumstance almost as cruel he had a broken hip and yet they shot him brookshire said who would shoot a man with a broken hip i think they were just vaqueros famous shoes said again they were probably poor their horses werent shod there were four of them i didnt recognize their tracks i think they were just vaqueros from the south they probably wanted his guns and his saddle i dont know if he was willing to give them up he shot one time with his riflehere is the empty cartridge they killed him and took his clothes then they went south all his clothes brookshire asked both famous shoes and pea eye looked at him as if he had asked a very foolish question we ought to get a ways along tonight pea eye said those vaqueros might decide they want some more horses and guns they might come back famous shoes was annoyed by his friends ignorance hadnt he just said that the vaqueros had gone south he had tracked them for two miles to make sure we can camp anywhere he said those vaqueros are gone brookshire didnt mention the deputys clothes again but he had his own viewand his view was that he preferred to imagine the deputys dead body fully clothed the man had come on a trip for nothing lost his wife in cruel circumstances and then had been murdered himself in circumstances just as cruel deputy plunkert had been a skinny fellow and it was cold of course a dead man would not feel the cold but brookshire still didnt like to think of that skinny white body laying naked in the cold night in his mind he dressed deputy plunkert in the clothes he had been wearing when he rode sobbing out of the camp pea eye and famous shoes were men of the west and no doubt they were used to such harsh sights but brookshire an accountant from brooklyn was not joey was surprised and a little disappointed at how easily captain call had let himself be shot he was still testing the range of the german rifle and he had thought the captain might be a man he should try to kill from the limits of the rifles range he had followed call from the day he left old beans within an hour of hanging the judge joey was on calls trail and never lost it he didnt come too close to the man though he held about ten miles back even so it was soon apparent that call knew he was being followed from tracks joey saw that he doubled back several times both day and night hoping to surprise him or at least pick up his tracks if call had doubled back a few miles farther he would have picked up joeys tracks of courseno one could travel and leave no tracks at all the captain only doubled back some five or six miles he was after mox mox and his seven men and evidently felt that he had no more time to spare for the one man who was following him if it was one man joey thought it impressive that the old man sensed he was being followed call had tried four times to pick up signs of his pursuer it showed that he wasnt a fool joey was hanging far back on the day call attacked mox mox joey heard the shooting but from very far away and faint it could have been hunters shooting but he followed and then inspected the little battle site it was evident that captain call was not an especially good shot on the other hand he had attacked eight men and killed six of them also he had wounded at least one of the men who had escaped he was not a particularly good shot but he was willing to fight and he fought successfully when he left the scene of the fight joey decided to follow mox mox rather than call it was evident that call was going to fort stockton his trail could be picked up a little later but joey only had to track mox mox about three hours before he came upon his corpse laying in a gully not far from a dead horse probably old call didnt even know he had killed the manburner but he had killed him mox mox would not be burning rafael and teresa joey would have to find another way to dispose of his brother and sister if he couldnt find a rich man who would buy them for slavesa rich man might consider them too damaged to make good slaveshe could take them to the mountains near his cave and leave them for the bears or the big gray lobo wolves or he could simply push them off a cliff he meant to kill them one way or another then his mother would know what he thought of her whoring she would have to give him all her attention she would wash his clothes and make them soft and cook him tasty meals when he was in ojinaga first though captain call had to be killed he was old but he could fight he was to be respected as john wesley hardin was to be respected the captain and the gunman were both men who didnt hesitate to kill before joey hung old bean he had run into a vaquero from chihuahua who told him that call had beaten the hard sheriff doniphan almost to death with a rifle all the vaqueros on both sides of the river had lived in fear of the hard sheriff he had been severe with everyone he ever caught yet call had easily beaten doniphan call was a man to be approached with attention and skill joey lingered outside fort stockton for three days waiting for the captain to leave he was afraid call might take the train and escape he didnt know whether he should risk robbing a train with captain call on it he would not be able to keep the man in sight but to lose sight of him would mean taking a large risk with most lawmen joey thought he could rob the train anyway and depend upon his own quickness but with captain call quickness might not be the most important thing then captain call had left town with the woman it surprised joey greatly that old call would need a woman when people talked about captain call women were never mentioned joey had supposed call was a man like himself one who didnt need women and who didnt like whores that the woman was a whore like his mother joey had no doubt he would have liked it better if captain call had continued to travel alone then he would have felt that he was stalking an equal but no man who went with whores could be his equal then the cowboys with the herd of horses appeared and joey changed his plans he had been thinking of shooting the captain from a very long range but he thought the horses might help him get a little closer he stole two horses from the cowboys in the night and hobbled one of them near the captains camp the apache had often fired from beneath horses he had heard that there were comanche so skillful in approach they could even fire from beneath the bellies of antelope or deer he didnt believe that anyone even a comanche could get close enough to an antelope to fire from beneath its belly even if an apache wore the skin of an antelope and imitated its movements the antelope would smell the man beneath the skin and run off some deer though were stupid with deer it might be possible joey had expected much more caution from captain call than the old man had exercised he had been willing to risk a long shot he was afraid if he waited too long one of the cowboys might come back looking for the missing horses and muddle his plan but the captain merely rode out carelessly not noticing that one of the horses didnt move a man who had hunted men all his life should know the difference between a hobbled horse and one that was loose but the captain had loped out within easy range perhaps his eyesight was failing him it had been annoying that the lawmans horse was highstepping and trying to pitch joey thought that his first shot was a little off because of the jumpy horse it was not off much though probably it would be mortal then he shot call in the leg and in the arm and killed his horse the big bullets would ruin the arm and the leg even if the chest shot didnt kill the old man outright he would bleed to death or starve joey had no interest in the woman he watched with the spyglass as she crawled into the chaparral carrying the pistol and the rifle probably she thought he would come and try to whore with her or she may have thought that the captain had been shot by a gang of men in which case she had good reason to be cautious joey didnt think much about the woman she could stay in the chaparral until she starved for all he cared his only concern was call he moved around with his spyglass until he could see the body and he saw at once that the ranger wasnt quite dead his foot moved from time to time once he raised his good arm joey saw he had a pistol in his good hand and that made joey feel good the old man was still wanting to kill him he hoped joey would come to rob his body so he could shoot at close range but joey had no intention of coming any closer than he was the captain looked poor and there was little likelihood that he owned anything worth taking to the cave joey could easily have come in closer and shot at him again he would not have needed to come into pistol range or even close to pistol range to end the captains life but he didnt want to shoot again he wanted the man to die from the first bullet almost all his kills had been made with one shot still if the old man somehow managed to live it might be better it might only enhance joeys reputation after all the captain had hunted him for more than a month and had never even seen him if call survived he would be a cripple his leg would probably have to be cut off and his arm too everyone who saw him would know what it meant joey garza had beaten the most famous manhunter in the west beaten him and left him a cripple it would be obvious to all who saw the old man that it was joeys choice that call lived a man so injured would be easily killed better to let him live as a warning to other men who might be tempted to hunt him for bounty he had destroyed call as easily as call had destroyed sheriff doniphan four shots one for the horseand the old king of the border had been cut down and made a cripple captain call would no longer be a threat to even the most ignorant careless outlaw he would never again be thought capable of challenging anyone as able as joey garza joey decided to wait through the night to see if call lived until morning he saw the woman come out of the chaparral and go to the place where call lay he watched her move camp he watched her gather firewood she was blond her hair came loose as she was bending to gather firewood and she let it stay loose joey watched her closely through the spyglass at one point she squatted to relieve herself joey felt a disgust and stopped looking she was just like his mothershe was only a beast a whore the next morning he watched the woman lift the captain onto the black horse she was a strong woman when she came to catch the hobbled horse joey was only a hundred yards away but the woman didnt sense him he followed them all day expecting call to die at any moment but when afternoon came and the woman made camp the old man was still alive in the morning joey watched the woman cut off calls leg he was surprised that a woman would attempt such a bloody task with only a big bowie knife of course his mother had always butchered the sheep and the goats they ate and she even butchered pigs when they had pigs she didnt mind being bloody and neither did the blond woman who was cutting off calls leg joey watched it all through his spyglass old call was tough he lost blood and then more blood and yet he didnt die when joey had hacked off benitos arms and legs he had been unprepared for the spurting blood he had turned his face away and struck with the heavy machete later he had thrown away all his clothes and snuck naked into his house he didnt want to wear clothes that had blood on them he couldnt let his mother wash the clothes she might understand then that the blood had come from her husband joey didnt think the blond woman was going to be able to take calls leg off she was tiring and he could see her chest heaving she stopped at times to rest but she always returned to the task finally when joey had concluded that she wasnt going to succeed she got through the bone and the leg came off then the woman walked away from the camp and sat on a rock to rest for a second joey was tempted to shoot herit would be a test for captain call to see if he could survive with only one leg and no one to help him but joey didnt shoot her he watched her mount the buckskin horse and saw her ride away leading the horse that captain call was slumped on it was a strange thing to see a whore strong enough to cut a mans leg off joey watched them go and then put his spyglass back in its leather case he imagined captain call would die somewhere on the trail to the south now he had to go to mexico and kill calls men they had come after him in his own country and he meant to see that such effrontery cost them their lives after he killed them he thought he might go to ojinaga though he didnt intend to let anyone in the village see him when he got there once he got home it would be rafaels and teresas turns to die he thought he might steal a horse and then tie them on the horse he could take them to his cave for a while to tease them the idea of throwing his brother and sister off a cliff had begun to appeal to him he would take them to his cave and see how he felt about it then the day after lorena amputated his leg captain call developed a fever so high that lorena felt sure he would die she had nursed five children through many fevers but in the very young fevers came and went like clouds in the skies as the children grew older high fevers were more serious captain call was an old man and he was burning up even lorena couldnt remember georgie having fevers that felt as hot to the touch as calls and georgie was prone to blazing fevers call soon became incoherent he mumbled slumped over blackies neck the leg bled but not much lorena had used the last of her extra clothing for bandages and she had no more cloth to make bandages with she had no medicines with which to treat the fever if call died he died all she could do was keep pressing on hoping to come to the river lorena knew she was going in the right direction she could tell that from the sun but she was in a big country where she had never been before and she didnt know how to aim for the town it could not be a very large town the country rolled so that she knew she might not be able to see presidio unless she spotted it from the top of a ridge captain call had said it was on the rio grande that was all she knew she stopped twice and tried to get the captain to wake up and look around if he could only glance around he would probably figure out where they were and correct her if she was off course he had mentioned that he had been over the country many times but captain call was lost in fever more lost even than lorena was in the vast country she would have to keep going as she was going and hope to know which direction to turn when she came to the river they endured another cold night lorena was too tired to gather enough wood to see them through the night the fire died well before dawn she piled the heavy saddle blanket and all but one of the smaller blankets on the captain but it was not enough to keep him from shivering and shivering looking at him so old and frail and sick caused lorena to feel pity but also puzzlement what kept the man alive why didnt he just die the big bullet was still in him close to his heart his leg was gone and the wound had not been treated if it got infected he would surely die his arm was also terrible she wasnt going to try to cut it off she wasnt up to another amputation any of the three wounds might prove mortal yet the man still breathed he burned with fever he couldnt talk and couldnt see yet he breathed even if she wrestled him onto his horse and got him to presidio and they found a doctor what could the doctor do and what would there be left for him if he did live he couldnt hunt men anymore he wasnt a rancher he didnt farm he had lived all his life by the gun and now no one would ever want him for his fighting abilities again better that he diedhe wouldnt have this suffering and he wouldnt have to live as an old cripple call had done what gus mccrae wouldnt do he had given up his leg in order to keep his life for years lorena had wished gus had chosen to live to live anyhow and she had been angry with him because he hadnt but now seeing call she wasnt so sure riding over the barren ridges leading the horse with the sick feverish diminished man on it toward a destination she didnt know if she could even locate made lorena feel doubtful gus might have taken the sensible option after all he was the smartest man she had ever known gus mccrae he had a fine soaring imagination gus had not been able to put his imaginings in writing as mr dickens and mr browning could but he could speak them and he had spoken them to lorena in the months they had been together gus had been himselfa full man hed had his flaws and lorena knew them he was selfish at times past believing as selfish as pea eye was unselfish gus knew himself he knew how he wanted to be and he had chosen in the critical hour not to accept being less perhaps after all augustus mccrae had been right but that was something lorena could never know not for herself and not for gus if gus had lived he would probably have married clara and if he had married clara lorena would have had to take her heartbreak and go away with it she could not have lived around their happiness she might never have taken up her studies and never have been friends with claras girls she would have left with her sorrow she would never have married pea eye and would not have had her children she would have drifted off been an unhappy woman and gone back to whoring probably by now she would be dead of discouragement she would not have killed herself but she would have found her way out of an existence that without gus clara claras girls or pea eye would have become too heavy to carry the next morning she saw the ribbon of river shining far ahead but she saw no town she had found the rio grande but where was she north or south of the town and the rio concho she didnt know when she tried to nudge call out of his delirium she failed again he couldnt see for his eyes were hot with fever lorena crossed the river she remembered that call had said pea eye was half a day to the south he had mentioned an old scout named billy williams who was staying in a little village in mexico the old scout might tell her the way or even lead her call had told her about billy williams before she cut his leg off he must have known that he would be useless to her even if he lived lorena crossed the river and looked both ways there was nothing to see in either direction but the gray land she had hoped for a spiral of smoke or an adobe hut but there was nothing the choice was a coin toss lorena had to choose between two emptinesses she chose to go north for no better reason than that she was righthanded for six hours she led the captains horse north feeling more and more despairing more and more convinced that she had made the wrong choice she became seriously frightened she had eaten the last of the bacon that morning and had only enough coffee for two more camps if she didnt find a settlement or a dwelling soon she would wear out and give up her nerves had not recovered from the amputation and she was exhausted but unable to sleep she could not get warm no matter how close to the fire she slept and she had troubling dreams about her children when she did sleep they were vague dreams and she could not remember them clearly but in all of them her children were under threat laurie was sick or a horse was running away with clarie or georgie had fallen down a well lorena stuck close to the riverbank if she wandered off and lost the river it would probably be the end toward evening as the weak sun began to sink she thought she saw a movement near the river there was a little rapid and just above it she thought she saw a brown rock move she had been nodding in her fatigue perhaps even dreaming brown rocks didnt move when lorena rode a little closer she saw that an old mexican woman sat by the river just above the little rapid she was wrapped in a brown serape and looked from a distance like a rock but she was a woman call was slumped over his horses neck unconscious i have seen that man before the old woman said he was in our village who cut off his leg i did lorena said i had to he is the famous texas ranger he killed marias father the old woman said he killed her brother too that was a long time ago when my children lived with me he was a lawman lorena said i need food and i need a doctor he has a bullet in him i need to find a doctor who will take it out there is no doctor in our village the old woman told her the butcher might take the bullet outhis name is gordo but he is lazy i dont know if he would want to help a gringo maria can do many things she might take the bullet out but this lawman killed her father and killed her brother maria may not be willing to help him ill have to take the chance lorena said im out of food where is your village go on the way you are going it isnt far the old woman replied lorena wondered why the old woman had chosen to sit by the river the dark was coming but she was making no move to go home lorena thought she might be sick and she felt she should offer to help her if youre tired you can ride my horse lorena said to her i can walk if the village isnt too far no i want to stay here tonight the old woman said my children live here if you listen you will hear their voices lorena did listen but all she heard was the splashing of the water in the little rapid she decided the old woman must be crazy she rode on another mile and soon saw the village the setting sun shone on it there were only some eight or ten small buildings but after days of seeing nothing but the gray land the sight of even one building would have been welcome it was welcome to the horses too they were hungry both of them tried to speed up but lorena held them back she was afraid that a faster pace might jar the captain and cause worse bleeding as she rode into the village a few goats walked out to meet her bleating she saw a large boy and a small slight girl standing with the goats both children were barefooted despite the cold the little girl was very pretty but she moved oddly holding her head to the side like a bird lorena was only a few feet away from them when she realized that the little girl was listening not looking she was blind behind the children in the doorway of a small house lorena saw a woman with a butcher knife in one handprobably she had been cutting meat for supper a tall older man with a slight limp came out and stood beside the woman he looked american perhaps he was the scout call had mentioned the one who might take her to find her husband she stopped and the woman and the tall man came out to greet her i have a wounded man lorena said to them i need help if theres a doctor here id appreciate it if someone would find him this man has a bullet in him that needs to come out billy williams took the reins of calls horse he was shocked at how the man looked he had seen many wounded men but could not recall seeing anyone still breathing who was in worse shape than call was in its woodrow call billy said to maria somebodys about finished him maria had the knife in her hand she walked up to the horse and looked at call for years when she was younger and the sting of her fathers and her brothers deaths had been sharper maria had promised herself that she would kill captain call if she ever got the opportunity now the opportunity was an arms length away they were planning to kill a goat and billy williams had just sharpened the butcher knife maria hadnt spokenbilly always grew nervous when maria didnt speak her angers matured in silence then they came boiling up but maria didnt raise the knife and she didnt strike she looked at the blond woman on the other horse it was easy to see that the woman had come a long way for she looked cold and she looked tired she looked as exhausted as maria had felt when she got back from crow town get down she said to the woman come into my house and eat maria looked only briefly at the man tied to the black horse he was an old man and so wounded that he was only just barely alive though he bore the name of the man who had killed her father and her brother maria knew he was no longer that man the one she had wanted to kill she had wanted to kill him in his power because he had used his power wrongly she wanted him to know that he could not simply kill people good people and be excused but the man who had wielded the power and done the killing was not the old sick man on the black horse to stab him now would be pointlessfor she would not be stabbing the captain call she had hated for so long but only the clothes and the fleshy wrappings of that man she began to untie the knots that held him to the horse the knots were slick with his blood take him in she said to billy put a blanket down by the fire and put him on it i want to look at his wounds billy cut the bloody knots and lifted call off the horse call moaned when his wounded arm bumped against the saddle horn teresa came over and stood beside billy as he lifted call is that the man who was here before teresa asked i hear him breatheis he sick yes hes sick maria said she was unsaddling calls horse tell rafael to drive the goats to the pen we dont want the wolves getting them lorena was stiff she hadnt yet dismounted she was trying to adjust to the fact that she had actually found the village she had stopped believing that she would find any settlement anyplace with people in it get down maria told her billy will take care of your horse you need to wash and you need to eat lorena eased off the horse ive come a long distance she said im tired who cut his leg off maria asked not until billy lifted call down did she notice the missing leg i did lorena responded it was that or let him die no wonder you are tired maria said come into my house and rest it was a small house there was a table with a lamp on it two plain chairs and some blankets spread on the dirt floor but it was a house so warm inside that before lorena had been there five minutes she began to nod the large boy brought in a bowl full of cold water for her from the well lorena splashed it on her face trying to wake up she saw maria bending over call the old scout was there too they cut his shirt off and examined the wound in his chest then they looked at his arm you should have cut the arm off too maria told her when lorena squatted beside her i was just too tired lorena answered it was just too much cutting you have a pretty daughter she added the little blind girl was ladling food out of a pot the girl moved around the house lightly like a moth thank you maria said well i aint going in after that bullet billy williams said that bullet is lodged in a bad place whoever takes it out needs to know what hes doing and i dont theres no doctor here lorena asked just the butcher and hes a butcher maria said who shot this man joey garza i guess lorena said neither of us ever saw who it was the man shot from under a horse captain call said he thought it was joey garza though maria was silent her son would be very famous now he had brought down the great manhunter all the girls on the border would want him though that would make little difference to joey he didnt like girls but joey had avenged her father and her brother he had crippled their killer and there was no need for her to do more she could even help the old man a little though she knew she was not skillful enough to remove the bullet from his chest she could probably cut off his arm if the butcher couldnt be persuaded to do it or they could send across the river for the doctor in presidio he didnt like coming to mexicothe people were too poor to pay him but he might come to treat captain call he was a famous ranger not a poor mexican do you know joey garza lorena asked she had seen the woman stiffen a little when she said the name he is my son maria said lorena thought she must have misheard surely she hadnt carried captain call for three days across the wastes only to bring him to the house of the boy who had tried to kill him i am joeys mother but i am not like him maria said she saw that lorena was frightened you need to rest she added there is a bed in the other room you can sleep without worrying we will take care of your friend we are not going to kill him if i had meant to kill him i would not have brought him into my house lorena was so tired that she wasnt thinking or even hearing very well she had to sleep soon no matter what happened to captain call teresa take her maria said lorena followed the little blind girl into the other room i cleaned your bed the little girl said when you wake up i will tell you a story why thank you lorena said i like stories then she stretched out on the low bed do you have any children teresa asked as lorena stretched her stiff limbs five i have five lorena said then in a blink she went to sleep teresa sat on the bed beside her for a few minutes she had ladled up some posole but she knew the woman hadnt eaten any you didnt eat your posole wake up she said touching the woman but the woman didnt wake up teresa sat on the bed listening to the woman breathe she was thinking about the story she would tell her when she woke up it would be a story about the big spider that lived by their well sometimes she would put her hand on the ground and let the spider crawl over it the spider never bit her though a scorpion had bitten her once she could hardly wait for the woman to wake up so she could tell her the story about the spider when he robbed the train outside san angelo joey made a discovery what he discovered was that it was more interesting to him to frighten people than to kill them he had made the passengers stand outside for an hour after he robbed them he told them he would be watching through his spyglass and he assured them he would kill the first one who moved before the hour was up the people stood in terror for a long time he had taken their watches and he told them to look at the sun and mark the hour by its movements but the people stood in the cold for almost three hours before any of them dared to move they were afraid of being shot in the end joey didnt shoot any of them through the spyglass he could see that the people were shiveringfrom fear not from cold two of the men wet themselves they were too afraid of his bullets even to move behind a bush watching the passengers tremble was more satisfying than killing them none of them were people of importance and there was no distinction to be gained from killing people of no importance making people dead was easy but it was no longer interesting to him wounding captain call so badly and so easily was a triumph joey knew he would never be likely to equal but he would never need to equal it so potent was the reputation of the man he had wounded even if he never shot another person or robbed another train his reputation would grow and grow along the border and all through the west he had ended the career of the most famous manhunter of all people would still be talking about joey garza when he was an old man even if he never killed or robbed again he planned to kill again though and quickly he wanted to shoot captain calls three deputies they were probably too inept to be a nuisance but joey wanted it known that he had wiped out captain calls whole party that would build his reputation even higher joey followed the blond woman all the way to ojinaga from time to time he took out his spyglass and trained it on the horse carrying captain call he expected to see that the old man had died but every time he looked he saw movement somehow the old man still lived when he saw the woman lead the horse upriver toward the village he let her go and rode off a few miles into mexico where he made camp he meant to travel up the rio concho and locate the deputies the next morning a little before midday he found their camp they were almost a days ride inside mexico and they seemed simply to be waiting they were probably waiting for captain call they didnt know what had befallen him joey was surprised to see that there were now only two deputies and old famous shoes he saw no reason to kill the old man probably the third deputy had met with an accident of some sort joey studied the camp for a while with his spyglass trying to decide on a method of attack that would provoke the utmost fear after giving it some thought he decided to shoot the horses and the two pack animals first maybe he could scare the men out into the desert if he frightened them badly enough he might not even have to shoot them he could simply chase them into the desert shooting now and then to scare them farther away from the river when he had them exposed and lost he could simply go away and leave them to freeze or starve to death joey decided to wait until the next morning captain call would not be coming to their rescue unless famous shoes happened to be wandering around tracking some animal no one would know he was there his shots would come as a complete surprise the next morning joeys first shot killed a pack mule just as brookshire was trying to extract some coffee from one of the saddlebags the mule fell in brookshires direction knocking him back several feet and causing him to spill the coffee before he could scramble to his feet a second shot killed the other pack mule pea eye had been frying bacon a third shot kicked the frying pan into the air causing sizzling grease to burn his hands and wrists he got to his feet and began to run to his horse only to have a fourth shot kill the horse before he could even grasp the bridle reins brookshires big horse was the only mount left but before pea eye could step over his own horse which was down but still kicking brookshires mount was knocked to its knees it scrambled up and was shot again pea eye was in agony from the pain of the sizzling bacon grease but he knew he had to run for cover or he would be dead and past worrying about a little thing like burned hands run he yelled to brookshire who sat amid the spilled coffee looking dazed get a gun and run to cover as he said it pea eye realized he didnt have a gun himself he had taken his pistol off because the scabbard was rubbing his hip raw and his rifle was propped against his saddle the pistol was closer so he turned and grabbed it brookshire had picked up the big shotgun and was stuffing shells into his pocket no get a rifle we need rifles pea eye yelled brookshire just looked addled pea eye decided to try for his own rifle so he ran back and grabbed it then he turned and headed down into the riverbed soon he heard brookshire stumbling after him pea eye ran for a hundred yards or more then stopped and waited for brookshire to catch up he listened but he could hear nothing other than brookshire as he stumbled on the rocky ground reckon its him pea eye asked when brookshire caught up reckon its the garza boy i dont know who it is brookshire said the dying mule had slammed into him knocking the breath out of him he had somehow grabbed the shotgun and made it into the riverbed without having quite regained his breath he stopped by pea eye and gasped for air he realized he had not made a good choice in taking the shotgun carrying it was like carrying a small cannon but he couldnt immediately spot his rifle or his pistols and he didnt want to just stand there with a killer shooting mules and horses to death on either side of him a little creek cut into the rio concho not far from where they stood it too was dry but its steep walls were pocked offering better cover than they had in the riverbed as pea eye led brookshire into the narrow creek a memory flashed back to him of the time long ago in montana when he and the wounded gus mccrae had hidden in a creek while they attempted to fight off the blood indians of course this creek was dry and that creek had water in it and hed had to eventually swim out at night past the indians and walk a long way naked to find the herd and bring the captain back to where gus was without the deepwalled creek the indians would have had them a creek had saved him once and perhaps the dry little mexican creek would save him this time pea eye took off his hat and crawled up the creek bank to a spot that allowed him to look over the plain he saw nothing the only movement on the whole vast plain was a hawk dipping to strike a quail then pea eye remembered famous shoes the old man hadnt been around when the shooting started there was nothing unusual about that though famous shoes was rarely there in the mornings he went off in the darkness to take a walk or track bobcats or badgers or anything else whose track he struck he would just show up again later on in the morning if they were traveling famous shoes would just step out from behind a bush or appear out of a gully and fall in with them sometimes he would mention interesting tracks he had seen other times he wouldnt say a word all day now though they needed him pea eye himself had never been in that part of mexico before and though brookshire had come down the rio concho with captain call he had no eye for landmarks and would be lost without expert help all i know is that if we follow this river to the rio grande well come to the village where joey garzas mother lives brookshire said he had caught his breath and his big shotgun was loaded he had only managed to collect four shells he had no idea what he and pea eye were going to do i wish the captain would show up pea eye said often in the past when he and some of the men found themselves in a predicament the captain had showed up and had taken matters in hand now though it was just himself and brookshire and an indian who might appear again or might not their horses were dead and likewise their pack animals if they survived they would have to walk out on foot the rio grande was at least three days away probably more they could go back to camp when it grew too dark for the killer to shoot and provision themselves from the packs they possessed adequate food and lots of ammunition also they were right in the rio concho unless the killer forced them out of the river there was not much danger that they would get lost and starve still pea eye felt nervous but more than that he felt scared when the shooting had started hed done what he always did when shooting started he had taken cover being shot at was always a shock and it was not something he had ever gotten used to it took a while for the shock to subside sufficiently to allow him to think sometimes it took a week or more for the shock to subside but in this instance he wasnt with a troop of rangers and he didnt have a week in which to calm his nerves and take stock of the situation why did he shoot the horses and mules he asked brookshire that was a question that had nagged him even as he was running up the riverbed why didnt he just shoot us he asked we was standing in plain sight except for that big nag of yours he killed all the animals with one bullet apiece he could have shot us just as easy as he could shoot a mule it dont make sense nothing makes any sense brookshire said this whole trip hasnt made any sense the captain ought to have caught this boy by now hes taking much too much time if its the garza boy shooting at us then the captain ought to be here maybe it aint the garza boy though he added maybe its the vaqueros who killed ted plunkert maybe they came back to get more plunder no pea eye said it was just one gun and one shooter and i never caught a glimpse of him if it was vaqueros there would have been three or four of them and they would just have rode in blazing away they wouldnt have shot the horses either they would have tried to shoot us then theyd have been two horses and two mules richer maybe he was trying to shoot us brookshire suggested maybe he just missed and hit the horses nope he hit what he aimed at pea eye said he wanted to put us afoot and he done it what i dont know is why brookshire felt dull he had felt dreadfully frightened when the bullets started hitting the horses and while he was running he had felt scared he had expected a bullet to strike him at every step but no bullet had struck him down and now he just felt dull over the course of the trip he had gradually stopped being interested in his own fate he knew he had made a great error in coming to texas he understood little enough of life as it was lived in brooklyn but he could make nothing at all of life as it was lived in texas or at least as it was lived by captain call and those associated with him they had gone from somewhere to nowhere accomplishing nothing along the way except the loss of deputy plunkert all he had expected of the morning was a piece of bacon and a big cup of coffee why some maniac would suddenly shoot the very mule that carried the coffee and the other mule and the two horses as well was beyond him it made no sense at all but it was in keeping with everything else that had happened since his arrival in texas captain call who seemed the most rational and most methodical of men and who was the most experienced manhunter in the west had done nothing that made clear sense from the time they had left amarillo together the garza boy was still free to do whatever he chose to do including shooting mules and horses if indeed he was the shooter the only exceptional thing call had done on the whole trip was beat a sheriff nearly to death admittedly catching one quick boy in a vast country was a difficult task but then that was the captains work his lifes work really if he couldnt accomplish it in this instance then he should have resigned brookshire no longer believed as pea eye seemed to that the captain was still in control of events he didnt believe that he would simply show up in the right place at the right time and end the career of joey garza while the captain had been looking for him in mexico joey had robbed a train in texas now that the captain was in texas somewhere joey was in mexico shooting the mule that carried the coffee it was a botch when colonel terry heard about it he would be angry and in this instance justifiably so brookshire had almost stopped caring whether he lived or died the cold had frozen the will to live right out of him katie his excellent wife was dead in the past weeks hed had time to remember all the ways in which katie had been an excellent wife he was losing his ability to imagine brooklyn and the office and the good chops katie had cooked him and the cat and the cozy house what he had feared that first morning on the windy station platform in amarillo had actually happened he had blown away into a dry creek in mexicocold every night cold every day wind all the time sand in the food sand in the coffee no houses and no coziness of any kind he had blown away now he was so tired that the long struggle upwind back to where he had once been back to who he had once been no longer seemed worth it let the young killer walk up and finish him maybe he would get off a shot with his eightgauge but he didnt expect to eliminate joey garza as easily as old bolivar had eliminated their unfortunate mule what do we do next he asked pea eye though he didnt really expect pea eye to know but they had to do something next or were they just going to stand in a drafty creek bed all day well wait for dark and go back and get our supplies pea eye said so they didthey stood in the dry drafty creek bed all day when they werent standing they squatted pea eye wanted to wait until full dark to go back to camp and secure food and ammunition it was the longest dullest coldest wait of brookshires entire life it was cloudy and he did not even have the distraction of watching the sun move across the sky there was no distraction at all and famous shoes hadnt come back from wherever he had gone thats a little worrisome pea eye said id hate to be out here in mexico without our tracker even if we have the river to show us the way well aint the river enough brookshire asked its enough unless he flushes us out of it pea eye said i just got the feeling that he wants us to run i dont know why though when full dark came they went to the camp where they found nothingonly the four dead animals everything had been removed the extra guns the frying pan and coffeepot the saddles the packs the blankets everything there were no matches no knives nothing brookshire stepped on a spoon that had been dropped in the ashes of the fire the horse killer apparently hadnt noticed it but it was the only thing he hadnt noticed brookshire gave it to pea eye who stuck it in his shirt pocket though they had no food that could be eaten with a spoon no food that could be eaten period with or without utensils when pea eye saw that the camp had been cleaned out his fear came back more strongly any bandit would loot a camp and take what appealed to him some would take guns and some would take provisions and some might take a saddle or a nice blanket but in his experience bandits rarely took everything bandits had to keep on the move they didnt want to be burdened with things they didnt need or want this bandit had taken everything though and not because he wanted it their gear was unexceptional he had taken it because he didnt want them to have it he wanted to be sure that they were cold and hungry dont you even have a match pea eye asked brookshire occasionally smoked a pipe brookshire thought he might have a match or two in his shirt pocket but in fact he didnt i guess i used the last one this morning he said i had already smoked a pipe before the man shot the mule its going to be cold pea eye said all we can do is get out of the wind and hunker down we could walk brookshire suggested were going to have to walk anyway why not start tonight at least itll keep us warm well we could pea eye said i never liked traveling at night but i guess it would warm us up they had scarcely left the edge of the camp before a shot rang out it hit a rock not far from brookshires foot and whined away into the darkness another shot followed pea eye heard it clip a bush near his elbow he stopped as did brookshire they were too startled and frightened to say a word their assailant was watching them or listening or both the slaps of the shots had been fairly close the horse killer was probably within fifty yards of them wed best go back to the riverbed pea eye said no let him come and kill us brookshire said hes going to anyway he knows right where we are i guess hes listening hes got our ammunition and food hes just playing with us now we dont have a chance and he knows it ive spent nothing but cold nights since i got to texas ill be damned if i want to spend another cold night squatting on my heels just to get shot in the morning he can shoot me now and spare me the shivering no brookshire dont give up pea eye said come back to the riverbed with me were armed still while were alive theres a chance theres two of us and just one of him we might beat him yet or the captain might show up in the morning and scare him off what if hes already killed the captain brookshire asked i expect he has myself the captains five days late and you said he was never late he aint usually pea eye admitted the thought that the captain might be dead had occurred to him too but he did his best to push that thought away people had thought the captain was most likely dead many times during the indian wars he himself had feared it on a number of occasions and yet the captain had always appeared if they didnt give up the captain might yet appear again lets go to the creek pea eye said try it one more night brookshire if we go to him hell shoot us but if we go back he might let us go go back where brookshire asked theres nothing back that way except chihuahua city and wed starve long before we got to chihuahua city id rather be shot than starve and id even rather be shot than shiver all night im tired of this shivering and ill tell joey garza so if i see him ill tell colonel terry something too if i make it back to the office joey garza can rob all the trains he wants to ned brookshire is resigning i may never hold another job with the railroad but ill be damned if ill wander around mexico any longer freezing to death brookshire meant it too he had blown away but he wasnt a hat he could try to walk back if he didnt make it so be it the whole adventure had been a terrible mistake katie had died while he was on it captain call the manhunter everyone said was infallible had been plenty fallible in this instance brookshire saw no reason to suffer passively anymore he felt sure he could walk three days even without food he could make it to the village by the river then he was going to rent a buggy and drive somewhere and catch a train one that would take him to new orleans or chicago and then home he had seen the great west and he didnt like it there were plenty of accountants in new yorkcolonel terry would have no trouble finding a man to replace him perhaps next time the colonel would know to keep accountants where they belonged in the office with the ledgers pea eye knew he ought to knock brookshire out with a gun barrel and make an effort to save him the captain might show up at any time joey garza might lose interest in the game and ride off brookshire just wait one more night pea eye said theres two of us we might beat him the captain might come one of us might get off a lucky shot wed do better sticking together just wait one more night i appreciate the thought brookshire said but ive waited and waited and now im going killer or no killer i can follow this river as well as the next man i guess maybe ill get through if i dont get through all i ask is that you send my love to my sister on impulse he grasped pea eyes hand and shook it hard well i dont know your sister pea eye said i wouldnt know how to get word to her her names matilda morris and she lives in avon connectiut brookshire said i regret that i had no time to write her before i left colonel terry wanted me on the next train and that was that he cocked both barrels of the big shotgun and walked past pea eye out of the camp pea eye didnt hit himknocking men out was a tricky business he might misjudge the lick and hit too hard in which case he would just cause unnecessary suffering he couldnt bring himself to do it brookshire went boldly out of camp he walked along at a good pace trying to maintain a staunch attitude sometimes in brooklyn if he was on the streets late and had to walk past bullies or louts he found that the best method was just to walk along boldly and not give the bullies or louts the time of day perhaps the same method would work with this garza boy if it was the garza boy who had killed their animals he did wish he were walking along the orderly streets of brooklyn with solid brick houses on either side of him just thinking of the solid brick houses of brooklyn caused him to be seized by a moment of almost overwhelming longing to be back in his own place once more if he could be in his own place he felt that life would swing into firm shape in no time even without his dear katie brookshire had to choke down his longing though he was in mexico not brooklyn he kept walking at a fast clip if attacked he planned to give a good account of himself and try to at least injure his assailant but when brookshire walking smartly along heard the click of a hammer it was just behind his head close enough that whoever held the pistol could have stuck it in his hip pocket one more mistake on my part brookshire thought he whirled and saw the boy standing an arms length away his pistol pointed at brookshires face brookshire knew he had no chance to swing up the big shotgun and he was so numbed by his own folly that he didnt even try at least ive seen your face he said joey garza didnt answer he pulled the trigger instead one shot did it he liked to be economical when pea eye heard the pistol shot he knew the battle was over for mr brookshire he turned and hurried back to the little creek with the steep walls the little creek was the only place that offered him any protection there had been no blast from the big shotgun the garza boy was unscratched pea eye knew he would have to fight him alone he stayed in the creek for an hour then snuck back to camp and with his pocketknife began to cut strips of horsemeat off the haunch of brookshires horse he knew he might be in for a long siege in montana he had walked nearly one hundred miles with only a few berries to eat he didnt intend to get that hungry again there was no need to either with four dead animals right there he sliced and sliced with his little knife before he went back to the creek he had almost a weeks supply of horsemeat stuffed into his shirt if he had to walk out and make a long detour at least he would have food pea eye wanted to last and he meant to last he had lorena and his five young children to think of he could not just hand himself up for slaughter as brookshire had his chances might be slim but for the sake of his family he had to fight the deadly boy as hard as he could as the cold hours passed pea eye had a terrible longing to be with lorena and his children one more time he wished they could all be together in their kitchen talking he imagined lorena with her coffee cup and himself with his clarie would have brought in the milk the boys would be in their chairs a little sleepy probably and laurie would be in her cradle which he could rock with his foot pea eye wanted badly to tell them all how sorry he was that he had left them he wanted them to know how much he regretted putting captain call first and not them it had been a terrible wrong he wanted them to know that never again would he put any duty before his duty to them to lorena and his children he felt a great sadness at not being able to let his family know what he was feeling if he was killed they would never know how much he loved them and missed them they would never know what he was feeling at this moment in his sadness at not being able to say to his family what he so badly needed to say to them pea eye began to cry he didnt know how he could have persuaded himself to leave them and yet he had if only it was himself having to pay for his mistake he could have lived with it and died with it but the bitterest knowledge was that his wife and children would be the ones having to pay for his error no doubt they were paying already and had been paying since the day he left the farm the thought he found hardest to bear was that they might never know how much he loved them or how keenly how terribly he missed them he had left them though and he could not undo that fact all he could do was clutch his rifle and hope that somehow he could prevail when the killer came he had never risen higher than a corporal in his years with the rangers he knew he wasnt smart or an exceptional fighter like the captain or like gus mccrae but in this last fight he had to be better than he had been he had to fight well he had to for his familys sake the long night passed slowly pea eye was shivering in a cold dawn when he saw famous shoes coming along the creek is brookshire dead he asked when famous shoes arrived yes joey shot him famous shoes said whens he coming to kill me then pea eye asked he says if you will give him your boots he will let you go famous shoes said he doesnt think you will follow him without your boots pea eye considered that a poor dodge he didnt entirely trust famous shoes anyway the old mans services had always been for sale to the highest bidder pea eye did not intend to give up his footgear why didnt he kill you pea eye asked famous shoes he doesnt want to kill me i am too old famous shoes said captain call is in ojinaga but joey shot his leg off he thinks the captain might die it was your woman who brought him to ojinaga lorena pea eye said severely startled are you sure it is your woman she has blond hair famous shoes said she cut the captains leg off joey saw it then she brought the captain to ojinaga well i swear pea eye said i wonder whos got the children he was so surprised by the news that he almost forgot the danger of the moment joey wants me to bring him your boots famous shoes reminded him if the rascal wants my boots let him come and get them pea eye said the knowledge that his wife was less than a days ride away filled him with hope if he could outfight the killer he could look on lorenas face again it was a chance he meant to use every ounce of fight he had in him to beat the killer and get back to his wife long ago gus mccrae had teased the rangers by calculating how much fight each man had in him as if fight could be measured like oats or some substance that could be placed on a scale call now hes about ninetyeight percent fight gus had said take away the fight and hed be so weak he couldnt mount his horse but thats unusual im only about forty percent fight myself pea i expect youre about twelve percent or so and old deets about fifteen twelve percent didnt sound like much to pea but he resolved to use every oat of it to struggle past the killer and get to the river where lorena was if she was there it was because she had come to get him and take him home she must have traveled all that way just to bring him home it was amazing to pea eye that lorena would go to all that trouble just for him but since she had he meant to see that she hadnt wasted her traveling where is joey garza he asked famous shoes he is by the concho famous shoes said if you go toward the village i think he will kill you if you go the other way he might let you go i reckon ill go where my wife is pea eye said if she was home safe i might run but if shes here in mexico i guess ill fight the rascal can i borrow your knife famous shoes asked i want to cut myself some of that horsemeat im going to walk to the madre and i want to take some food pea eye lent him the knife in a few minutes famous shoes returned and gave him back the knife he had a few strips of horsemeat tucked under his belt pea eye felt the blade of his knife and saw that it was a little dull he took a thin whetstone out of his pocket and began to sharpen the pocketknife as he was sharpening it a thought struck him brookshire had walked off with the big eightgauge shotgun it was an ugly weapon and no one but an inexperienced yankee would have considered bringing it on a long expedition joey garza was known to prefer pretty guns and the eightgauge was anything but pretty maybe he had neglected to take the shotgun from brookshire maybe he had just let it lay did you see that big shotgun pea eye asked famous shoes did joey gather it up or is it still there joey didnt take it its there famous shoes said he only took the mans watch pea eye wanted the shotgun he didnt trust his rifle that much and he knew he was inept with a pistol but with an eightgauge shotgun if joey garza was fool enough to come in range he ought to be able to pepper him at least whose side are you on he asked famous shoes mine or his i am going to the madre famous shoes said joey might change his mind and kill me if i stay here i dont know what he will do all pea eye could think of was the big shotgun in his mind it had become the thing that might save him he needed to figure out a way to get it without getting shot he couldnt forget his wife she was not far away and he had to get to her joey garza was the one thing in his way pea eye sat down and took his boots off take my boots he said handing them over to famous shoes tell him im going away famous shoes didnt believe pea eye he took the boots but he felt nervous you dont want to go away he said you like your woman too much to go away thats right pea eye said i oughtnt to have left her and now ive got to try and get back to her if joey kills you can i have your knife famous shoes asked pea eye gave it to him its yours one way or the other he said then he dug in his pocket and came out with a gold piece he knew famous shoes was greedy it was a fivedollar gold piece it might tempt him this is yours he said when youre walking back to joey stop a moment where brookshires body is i need to know where to run to to pick up that big shotgun just stop a moment look down like youre looking at a track famous shoes felt a little disquieted pea eye didnt know joey and didnt realize how coolly and easily he killed famous shoes thought that pea eye liked his woman too much so much that he might get killed trying to return to her no one killed as easily as joey garza probably pea eye was being foolish but famous shoes could not wait around all morning discussing the matter he had to get to the madre i will take him these boots he said if i come to the rio rojo in the spring i will come and see you if your woman is alive maybe she will teach me about the tracks in books i expect shell be glad to pea eye said thats what she does she teaches school he let the old man get a fiftyyard lead and then began to follow him up the riverbed the rocks were sharp but pea eye kept following famous shoes passed where the camp had been buzzards had begun to circle and a few were watching from the dry trees famous shoes went on he thought pea eye was foolish to challenge joey garza the mans liking for his wife was so strong that it had destroyed his reason famous shoes expected that joey garza would kill pea eye long before pea eye got to the big shotgun but he had taken the gold piece when he came to brookshires body he stopped and bent over it for a moment as if looking at a track though there were no fresh tracks near the body he paused and then went on carrying the boots joey was not far and joey was watching before he had gone two more steps he heard pea eye running behind him even though he was running in his stocking feet pea eye made a lot of noise he was running toward the dead man a moment later famous shoes saw joey stand up when joey stood up pea eye began to shoot at him with his rifle joey garza looked startled he had not expected to be charged by the old deputy he didnt have his rifle it was on the horse but he had his pistol and he leveled it at pea eye and began to shoot famous shoes saw that at least two of joeys bullets hit pea eyebut pea eye was still running and he was almost to brookshires corpse joey shot at pea eye again but this time he missed he became nervouswhy hadnt the old man fallen he knew he had hit him solidly twice but still he ran joey shot twice more but both times he missed pea eye ran as he had never run before he fired as he ran he wished he could fly so as to get to the big gun faster he felt that he was running to lorena and his children he saw joey shooting but he didnt feel the bullets when they struck him he ran as fast as he could he fired the rifle but only in hopes of distracting the young killer mainly he ran his eyes fixed on the spot where famous shoes had paused only at the last moment with pea eye still coming did joey remember the big shotgun he had left it with the body and the old ranger was almost there the fact that he had made such a simple stupid error unnerved joey he shot once more but only hit the running man in the foot the running man was very close and he should not have missed him yet he had missed him joey could not understand his own error he had left a loaded gun by a corpse it was a big ugly gun not worth keeping but he should not have left it his pistol was empty all he could do was flee as he turned to run for his horse he saw the old deputy drop his rifle and scoop up the big gun then the heavy shot cut his back and he stumbled and fell he sprang up and kept running but he saw over his shoulder that the old man was still running toward him holding the big shotgun joey was leaping for his horse when pea eye shot again this time the heavy bullets ripped his legs in his pain he almost went over his horse but just managed to hang in the saddle he looked back and saw that the deputy had turned and picked up his rifle there was no time to free the mauser the deputy might kill his horse if he didnt flee he ducked onto the far side of his horse and put the horse into a run pea eyes shot hit the cantle of the saddle before pea eye could aim again joey was racing away through the sage soon he was out of range he clung to the safe side of his horse expecting that the deputy would shoot again and that his horse would fall but the deputy didnt shoot again joey was bleeding from his shoulders to his heels but he clawed himself back into the saddle and hung on pea eye went back and dug in brookshires pockets he found the other two eightgauge shells he trusted the big gun a lot more than he trusted his rifle or his pistol he knew he had hit the garza boy with both barrels it might not have been at a killing range but it had probably damaged the young killer severely pellet wounds worked slow but they worked and all the boys wounds were on his backside joey would not be able to dig the pellets out himself pea eye sat down to rest a moment he was not far from brookshires corpse as he rested famous shoes approached and handed him back his boots take these boots he said you hit joey pretty good i dont think hell need them pea eye was experiencing a kind of disbelief in the course of events that he had just passed through he was alive moreover he had hit the garza boy twice with blasts of eightgauge pellets and the boy had run he had driven off a prominent killer the boy had shot at him six times with a revolver and hadnt killed him he might yet see his wifes face and hold his children on his lap why he was supposed to be a dead shot pea eye said he missed me three times and one shot hit my dern toes i dont need this knife famous shoes said handing pea eye back his pocketknife joey left his knife by his blanket and his is better pea eye stuck his finger into the wound at his hip it was the deepest of his wounds it might be that his hip was broken but the wound wasnt going to be fatal the wound in his shoulder wasnt serious pea eye looked at his foot and noticed that he had lost two toes pea eye looked at the body of ned brookshire he remembered that the sister he was supposed to send his love to was named matilda morris she lived in a town called avon but he had forgotten the name of the state it was one of the yankee states he felt sure lorena would help him look it up she would have to write the letter too of course he didnt imagine shed object mr brookshire had been the wrong man for the job he had been sent to do but he had been a very decent man yankee or not it seemed sad to pea eye that mr brookshire would not get to know that joey garza was wounded and on the run the long job might soon be finished his colonel would get to know but not brookshire himself he should have stayed in camp but if he had stayed pea eye would not have been the one using the big shotgun i reckon i owe my life to brookshire mainly pea eye said holding his finger in the deep wound in his hip after all he bought the shotgun i may take joeys blanket too famous shoes said the doctor from presidio did not want to cross the river and operate on someone in a mexican womans house if word got out that he was treating mexicans he was sure to lose business but when billy williams told him that woodrow call was the patient he finally agreed to make the trip call was in a fever of delirium when billy and the doctor arrived he had been in and out of the delirium for two days in his dream the little blind girl teresa was leading his horse down into the palo duro canyon the drop was almost sheer but the little blind girl picked her way down the cliff and the horse didnt stumble well the captain smashed joe doniphan but now hes smashed himself the doctor said when he looked at call ill take the arm first then if he lives well go after the bullet under his heart the doctor looked at maria sternly its too dark in this kitchen he said go borrow some lanterns maria said nothing she knew the doctor scorned her when she went to borrow a lamp from gordo the butcher the butcher looked at her with similar scorn why dont you just kill the old gringo the butcher asked remember what he was i remember what he was maria said joey ended that i cant kill a sick man in my home you should never have brought him into your house the butcher said he was a large man and he had always coveted maria he had fathered twelve children but his wife had died recently the butcher kept looking at maria but he gave her the lamp maria decided that she would ask billy williams to return it the butcher and two of his friends had tried to catch her by the river when she was younger she had seen them coming and escaped on her horse she did not intend to let him catch her now while the arm was coming off lorena began to feel faint she was helping hold call down and she was afraid for a few minutes that she would have to leave the room but she was needed maria and billy together were not strong enough for the task in the bedroom teresa heard the old man moan he moaned like the cows moaned when they were being slaughtered teresa hoped the old man wouldnt die he had told her that her name was pretty and that she was pretty too his moans woke rafael who began to moan too from fear strange sounds frightened rafael but not teresa she knew that lorena was helping her mother and billy hold the old man she had told lorena her story about the spider and lorena in turn had told her a story about a rabbit teresa wanted lorena to stay with them so they could exchange more stories she heard her mothers hard breathing and lorenas and billys once she heard the old man cry out let me up but the hard breathing continued they did not let him up when the doctor finished call was unconscious and scarcely breathing the doctor decided not to try for the bullet near the heart he knew that if he cut any more the old man would probably die hes lived this long i reckon hell keep on living the doctor said if he does die at least he killed the manburner first whats that lorena said captain call killed mox mox yep old charlie goodnight seen the corpse himself the doctor said didnt you know no lorena said i dont think the captain knows either he told me he hit him but i dont think he knows that the man died oh he died as dead as anybody old charlie seen the corpse the doctor said you keep the bandages fresh and see that theyre clean he told maria sternly before he left the doctors unexpected news made lorena feel such relief that she had to go to a chair and sit her legs felt weak in her most terrible nightmares mox mox had one of her boys and was piling brush on him that danger had passed for her and for all the parents in the west her husband might be in danger still but he wouldnt be burned she was glad she had worked so hard to save the captain he had not caught marias son but he had stopped the manburner we dont hear enough news over here billy williams said well have to tell the captain when he comes to ill tell him lorena said hell want to knowit might help him get better i wonder why a man would want to burn up people like that billy williams said lorena remembered mox mox she had seen the excitement in his eyes when he quirted someone or prepared for a burning she knew why he liked to burn people but she didnt tell that to billy williams lorena was sitting in the kitchen with maria watching teresa play with a white chick when an old indian man she had met a time or two before came to marias door that man will be hungry maria said when she saw famous shoes at her door whenever he comes to my house he is hungry i have to make him some food this time he built me a fire when i was freezing on the pecos do you have any menudo famous shoes asked as soon as he came to where the women sat there is none today the doctor has just been here maria said i will catch a chicken and cook it for you if you want to wait maria saw that famous shoes carried a blanket joey had used on his horse the last time he was in ojinaga that looks like joeys blanket maria said have you seen him yes pea eye shot him famous shoes said he shot him with the big shotgun joey ran off i dont know if he will live he was shot pretty good pea eye shot him wheres my husband lorena asked jumping up it was a day of two miracles captain call had killed mox mox and pea eye had wounded joey garza then it struck her that maybe there was only one miracle maybe joey had killed pea eye before escaping your husband is wounded famous shoes told lorena on a horse it will take you a day to go to him i dont think he is wounded too bad but he was shot in the hip he cant walk good he has the big shotgun though i dont think joey will go back and bother him im going now ill take him a horse lorena said ill take the buckskin and ill lead blackie pea eye can ride blackie back here wait for daylight ill send billy with you maria told lorena hell find your husband lorena felt awkwardit was her own husband who had wounded and maybe even killed marias son but before lorena could even thank her for offering help maria had gone out the door to catch the chicken she had promised famous shoes maria stood in the darkness for a while feeling a mixture of fear sorrow and shame she wondered where her son was and what condition he might be in she had come to like lorena in large part because of the kind interest she had shown teresa and rafael she had asked lorena to wait and had offered billy as a guide because she knew joey was out there somewhere shotgun wounds rarely killed and if joey was not mortally wounded he would just be angry he would make short work of lorena even with billy along it would not be a very safe trip only three mornings earlier maria had discovered from teresa that joey had been to their village he had caught teresa near the field and told her that he would return soon and take her and rafael away he told her he would take them to a high cliff in the mountains and throw them off teresa had no fear of the world nor of her brother she thought joey was telling her a scary story merely to tease her maria knew that what joey had told teresa was not just a story she had gone in and told billy williams not to let the children wander to the field again she told him not to drink whiskey and to keep his weapons handy she also told him why she was so concerned for she knew her son meant what he had said joey had always been jealous of his brother and sister once he had put spiders in teresas bed and had also put a small rattlesnake in rafaels blankets but the spiders had not bitten teresa and the little snake had crawled away without biting anyone if joey said he would throw rafael and teresa off a cliff then he would try to do it joey was clever as evil people sometimes were maria knew she would have to be very watchful to forestall her son she didnt want to kill him she could not bear the sorrow that would fill her if she had to kill her own child but she meant to frighten him joey had seen her call up her rage and he knew her rage was no small thing but she would have to be very watchful always joey was sly only teresa had known when he was near the village he had come and gone undetected and had only revealed his presence to his blind sister but the message he had given to teresa was for his mother not his sister he wanted maria to know that he meant to harm his brother and sister when maria heard that joey had been wounded she wondered why she could not wish him dead some lawman would kill him sooner or later why not let it end why was the bond so strong that it was a kind of torture joey hated her though she did not know why she had done nothing to deserve her own childs hatred maria had given up trying to understand the hatreds joey felt his hate was just there as fire is there as blood is there or desire or sorrow or sadness or death for her the fact that joey hated her was one more painful sorrow like teresas blindness or like rafaels poor sheeps mind but what if joey was mortally wounded if he brought his wounds to her she would try to heal them even though the lawman who had been hired to kill him and the woman whose husband had wounded him were both in her house joey was still her child in the morning watching lorena ride off with billy williams ahead of her maria wondered what the two travelers would find famous shoes said joey had shot the deputy three times lorena might ride up the harsh river only to find that the husband she had come so far to save was already dead at times maria wondered if life would be so full of sadness had she been born in some other place too much of the sadness of the world seemed to pass through ojinaga which after all was only a very small village in cities there must be more sadness because there were so many more people she wondered how the people in cities could bear the weight of all the pain around them i want to give him some frijoles he needs to eat teresa said who maria asked your goat no teresa replied annoyed i dont feed my goat frijoles i mean the old man i want to feed him hes very sick i dont think he will eat maria said call had awakened only once since the operation he was very weak and had shown no interest in food but maria was surprised a little later to see her blind daughter sitting by captain calls bed feeding him tiny bites of frijoles with a spoon i wish your husband had kilt joey on the spot billy williams said as he guided lorena up the rio concho he had led a safe life for the past few years and he had forgotten the feel of danger but he felt it that morning as they rode through the gray country leading two extra horses one for pea eye and one for mr brookshires corpse call had awakened as they were getting ready to leave lorena told him that he had killed mox mox but the captain didnt seem to be able to take in the information who was it he asked most of the names in his head were vague he knew he ought to be clearer but he could not make his head sort out the names his brain was a jumble of memories and he could not sort them out although once in a while one name would come clear brookshire was one name that came clear when lorena told him that brookshire was dead call felt such sadness that tears rolled out of his eyes in his years as a ranger he had rarely cried at death though he saw much of it but he could not stop himself from weeping about mr brookshire and he whispered a request about the body he wanted it brought back so brookshire could be buried decently brookshire had died for the railroad and the railroad ought to pay to bring him home to brooklyn the place he ought not to have left it was my mistakes that led to it call whispered weakly i let him come but i didnt protect him and pea eye couldnt i guess that pea eye and not himself had been the one to wound joey garza was another thing that churned in his brain and would not settle itself clearly pea eye had always been a corporal now he was a hero though he might not be alive to know it he himself had failed but pea eye had succeeded or nearly he had paid a price but he had succeeded it was strange knowledge at moments he was proud of pea for he had gone a long way toward finishing the job that call had started pea hadnt wanted to undertake it and had been sent into danger with inadequate instructions and very little support yet he had prevailed call tried to imagine the fight but his brain wasnt working well enough three or four times as lorena and billy williams were getting ready to leave call forgot about pea eye entirely and asked them where they were going then he remembered brookshire and he cried again lorena knelt by the bed where call lay and tried patiently to explain about mox mox but the captain couldnt grasp it she mentioned charles goodnight and call remembered him but he could not get his mind around mox mox the indian said joey was badly wounded maybe he died lorena said to billy williams no joey aint dead or i wouldnt be this jumpy billy williams said i dont get jumpy for nothing joeys here somewhere and hes got his rifle we better use what cover we can find lorena wasnt frightened she wanted only to find her husband no killer was going to stop her now pea eye wasnt far away by the next day she would have him back in ojinaga safe famous shoes had assured her several times that pea eyes wounds werent mortal still she wanted to hurry she didnt want to arrive and find that the wounds had been more serious than the old indian thought she wanted to hurry and she grew impatient with billy williams who zigzagged from ridge to ridge and bush to bush billy spent too much time looking around when what they needed to do was hurry billy knew lorena was impatient and he couldnt blame her but maria had put her in his care and when maria entrusted him with something or someone he tried to do his best to carry the task through responsibly maria was not a woman who trusted lightly billy knew she had not had reason to trust in view of the course her life had taken whenever she did repose trust in him whether it involved watching her children or looking out for livestock on days when she was washing he tried to do his best he meant to bring lorena back alive and her husband too that meant watching as best he could for joey garza worse than his apprehensions for lorena and himself was the fear that joey would slip around them and strike at maria in their absence he would probably strike at her by taking one of her children as he had threatened to do one of the children or both of them he might even attack his mother joey had always been devilish but he had not always been what he had now become i dont know why joey went so bad billy said to lorena as they rode i guess he just went bad and then got worse when billy williams talked to her about joey garza lorenas only thoughts were of maria the mother and how terrible the knowledge must be that her child had turned out a killer lorena could muster no interest in the young outlaw he had almost killed the captain and had wounded her husband the world was full of mean people trying to explain why they were mean was a waste of time better to accept it and guard against it in her years as a whore it had been brought home to her over and over again in varied and painful ways just how mean some men were some were only mean enough to hit but plenty were mean enough to do worse things it was not a long road from a beating to a killing in her view she had known several men who had taken that road the sooner all of them were dead the better place the world would be but it wasnt her husbands job to bring them to justice not anymore pea eye was crouched in the creek when he heard the horses coming he was nervous it might be the vaqueros who had killed ted plunkert in which case he would be easy pickings his hip was paining him terribly and he couldnt walk running him to ground would be an easy thing he cocked the big shotgun got out his pistol and put his rifle near at hand of course the horses had been rather far away perhaps they would pass him by but he had to be ready in case they didnt famous shoes had promised to go tell lorena where he was but famous shoes was not entirely to be counted on when he drove off joey garza pea eye had felt elated the odds looked good that he would live to see his wife and children again but in the long nights and long days his confidence had slowly ebbed he could scarcely move and he had lost considerable blood he had nothing to bandage himself with and no way to go toward lorena he could only wait and hope and as he waited feeling weaker by the hour his hope began to fail he tried to hold upafter all he was alive and he had driven off the young banditbut despite himself deep fears assailed him it might be that in leaving home to come with the captain he had made a mistake that was too serious to correct he had left his family and the penalty for that might be a bitter end he might have to die without speaking to them again his deepest wish was to be able to make his feelings into words words that could travel across the distances into the minds of his wife and his children he wanted them to know his regret if there was some way they could know how he felt then dying would not be as bad but he couldnt do that the regret was with him and the distances were real and they were great pea eye pulled a piece of horsemeat out of his shirt and began to gnaw on it several times in the days since famous shoes left he had begun to give up and then had pulled himself back from giving up he must not give up lorena would expect better of him than that it was hard to choke the dry horsemeat down but he had to try he had to take what nourishment he could to give himself the best chance if there was another fight pea put the strip of horsemeat down for a moment in order to ease himself a little farther back against the creek bank his hip pained him so that he dreaded any movement the horses had come quite near he only heard two their slow hoofbeats gave him the feeling that he was being hunted he had the shotgun tilted upward when he tried to sit up straighter his hip hurt so badly that he passed out for a few seconds he had done that once before on his long walk in montana he had passed out from hunger and fatigue even as he kept walking as he walked he had the sense that deets the black cowboy had come back from the dead to guide him this time though he was not walkinghe was only hoping to sit up straighter so as to get off a good shot at whoever approached in case they were enemies he took one hand off the gun for a second to pick up the piece of horsemeat and put it back in his shirt it was no time to be eating but he didnt want to waste the food either listening hard pea determined that there were four horses coming not two that was a bad sign and it frightened him he got the strong sense that the horsemen were hunters and that he was the hunted then before he could even stick the meat back inside his shirt he saw lorena his wife standing not ten feet from him it was a miracleit was as if the sky had opened up and dropped her into the little creek it was lorena not a ghost it was his wife why honey you found me he said he rarely called lorena by such sweet names only on her birthday sometimes or maybe christmas lorena walked over and took the heavy gun from pea eyes hand would you take this she said handing the gun to billy williams who was only a step behind her you came all this way and found me and its winter too pea said to her astonished as he always was that lorena cared to bother with him lorena had paused in the creek a moment watching pea eye before he saw her the big gun was cocked and she was afraid that if she startled him he might accidentally shoot her pea looked bad one side of his face was caked with blood though probably he had just scratched himself with a bloody hand he looked very thin and his face was twisted in pain the bad hip wound hurt him with every movement she could see but here was her husband and he was alive why wouldnt iwere married lorena replied then she took the awful piece of meat out of his hand knelt close to him being careful not to bump his bad hip and took him into her arms it was the luckiest thing in her life that she found him in time the children would not be without him and neither would she were taking you home pea lorena said there wont be no more of this fighting not for you no im done with it somebody else will have to do it pea eye replied joey rode back almost to ojinaga before he stopped to hide his wounds had begun to hurt and he knew they would only hurt worse unless he could find someone to dig out the shot he could not do it himself for all his wounds were on his back and legs he had pellets in his neck and pellets all the way to his calves he had carefully cleaned out the deputies camp there might be medicine in the saddlebags but he had had to abandon it all when the old deputy came running at him with the big shotgun joey hated the old deputy it was absurd that a man so old would attack him he should have shot him and the other deputy long before with his rifle when they had been traveling on the plain he could have done it easily and he should have killing their animals scaring them and trying to drive them into the desert to starve had all been foolish actions he should have just killed them but he had never supposed that one of them would be crazy enough to charge him even the great captain call himself had not charged him neither had he supposed that he himself would be so stupid as to overlook a loaded gun during all his months as a robber he had been careful and had made no mistakes the fact that he made no mistakes added to his reputation it terrified people they thought of joey garza as the bandit who made no mistakes but then he had made one and a bad one the old deputy had looked a fool and he had looked incompetent but he had not been a fool or incompetent the shotgun had been the deputys only chance and he had remembered it and used it the pellets making poison in his blood were his payment for being foolish he had underestimated the old man the apaches rarely underestimated anyone they knew that any living man might be dangerous if desperate enough joey felt rage at the deputy but he also felt rage at himself three or four more steps and the lawman would have killed him outright he might still die if his wounds were not treated and cleaned but he was alive and if he lived he meant to return and kill the old deputy and famous shoes too thinking over the battle he remembered that famous shoes had stopped right by the body where the gun lay he had shown the old man right where to run otherwise joey would have had ample time to get his rifle and kill the old fool probably the deputy had paid him well for everyone knew that famous shoes liked money before he went back to finish the old lawman joey had to get his wounds cleaned he wanted his mother to do it when she had done it and he was safe from infection he would show her what she was worth by taking his brother and sister he would not have time to take them to the cave and throw them off the cliff they would receive a quicker death he might drown them or kill them with rocks then he would go back and finish off the old deputy and famous shoes as well joey was watching his mothers house when billy williams and the blond woman rode away it surprised him that the blond woman had come to his mothers house and that she was still there she must have brought the old ranger to his mother joey saw billy lead the blond woman and two extra horses up the river he had just ridden down they were going to get the old deputy no doubt of that famous shoes had already told him that the blond woman belonged to the deputy he didnt know why they were taking an extra horse though the old deputy might be dead joey knew he had hit him at least twice but if he was alive he could only ride one horse he watched through his spyglass joey could have followed billy williams and the woman and killed them but he didnt his wounds hurt too much his back and legs felt as if they had been skinned he knew his mother would have to cut his clothes off for they were stuck to him from all the bleeding joey saw his mother come out of the house to watch billy and the blond woman leave he watched it all through his spyglass from a mile away he saw that famous shoes was there as well for he came out of the house carrying a blanket that joey had left in his camp when joey saw the blanket he grew angrier and angrier he had never liked it when people took his things and he had certainly not made famous shoes a gift of his blanket the old indian had simply taken it perhaps he believed that joey would soon die from the shotgun wounds joey had known the old man all his life and had neither liked him nor disliked him the old indian was crazy he came and went walking all over the place for no reason often he disappeared into the madre when joey had been a prisoner of the apaches famous shoes had sometimes come to their camp the apaches thought he was crazy too otherwise they would have killed him they didnt like kickapoo famous shoes had finally decided to hurry home to the madre he had told billy williams just where to find the wounded man he had no more business in ojinaga or any town for that matter he wanted to go to the high mountains where he could track the great eagles with his eyes once when he was young he had trapped an eagle killed it and eaten its eyes hoping the vision of the eagles would be his in tracking he needed to see things so small that his human eyes couldnt find them he thought the eagles eyes might help but the effort was a disappointment his eyes did not improve and worse the meal made him sick but he forgave the eagles it was not their fault that he had been foolish enough to hope that he could see with their eyes he liked to sit on rocks and watch the eagles swoop far down out of sight into the shadows of the deep valleys to catch what they wanted to eat famous shoes left ojinaga at a good trot for he wanted to hurry home to the madre but he had not gone far before he saw a familiar track in front of him it was the track of joey garzas horse famous shoes immediately turned north he wanted to go as far around joey garza as possible joey might have changed his mind and he might be in the mood to kill him now he had gone only a few miles north when to his dismay the track of joeys horse appeared in front of him again joey too was going north famous shoes thought he had made a mistake in leaving ojinaga so soon he immediately turned and started back for the village joey was evidently not as badly wounded as he had supposed it would be better to stay in the village for a few days until joey left or died but he had gone only a mile back toward the village when he saw the track of joeys horse in front of him once more famous shoes didnt think the horse was wandering loose and just appearing in front of him every time he turned once joey had let him look briefly through the great eye he carried with him the spyglass the great eye was even stronger than the eyes of eagles with it famous shoes could see all the signs he had been hoping to see when he trapped the eagle but joey had only let him look for a moment and then he tied the great eye back on his saddle if pea eye had managed to kill joey famous shoes meant to ask him if he could have the great eye it would help him in his work that hadnt happened though now joey was angry and the young killer was stalking him famous shoes saw no point in walking any farther if he was going to be killed he might as well rest he had done a great deal of walking since he had left for the rio rojo there was no point in turning again since joey would just turn too and appear ahead of him it had been a mistake to take his blanket for joey might resent it but famous shoes had seen the blast from the big shotgun knock joey off his feet and he had seen the second blast hit him when he jumped for his horse famous shoes didnt think a man could live long with so much lead in him lead was bad for the blood joey was young and strong and he might yet die but so far he was lasting famous shoes was sitting on joeys blanket singing the kickapoo death song when joey appeared on his horse from the front joey looked well but when he dismounted famous shoes saw that the boys whole back was raw much of his shirt had been driven into his body from the impact of the pellets pea eye had shot him pretty good just as famous shoes had thought the lead would soon poison joeys blood unless he got it out it might already be too late but joey had his pistol in his hand and famous shoes kept singing it was his bad luck that the pellets were not killing joey more quickly it meant that he himself would have to die he saw no point in holding a conversation with the young mexican it was better just to sing he thought an eagle might come and take his song to the madre for him famous shoes sang loudly for he wanted the eagles to hear him if there were any around joey walked close to him and held his pistol to the old indians head get off my blanket he said and give me back my knife famous shoes moved off the blanket but he kept singing he took joeys knife from his belt and handed it to him he looked to the sky to see if any eagles were coming but he saw no eagles he thought of asking joey if he could look through the great eye one more time he thought if he looked through it he might see where his spirit would be going when joey shot him but joey did not like to lend his things and he was not in any mood to allow famous shoes a few minutes with the great eye famous shoes sang his death song loudly he wanted to send his spirit far away on the sound he had been in the valley of echoes once in the country of the utes and he knew that sound could travel far and live on in echoes even after the person or the animal who made the sound was dead he had once seen ben lily shoot a bear the bear had not been shot well and its cries traveled far away as it was dying famous shoes wanted his spirit to float high on his song perhaps an eagle would pass and hear it and take it to the madre as famous shoes was waiting for the bullet singing proudly joey garza turned away and got back on his horse he had come to famous shoes with a cold face the face of a boy who could kill and not think about it but once he got his blanket and his knife joeys face changed he tied the blanket back on his saddle and got on his horse he turned his horse toward ojinaga and didnt speak again famous shoes was so startled that he went on singing he sang until joey was out of sight he found it hard to stop singing his death song for he had already turned loose of his spirit and sent it away it was hard to have to recall it and go on living his spirit was far above him and it was reluctant to come back joey had been about to pull the trigger but he had changed his mind it was quite puzzling joey killed as easily as he himself walked yet in this case he had changed his mind and had simply ridden off famous shoes stopped singing finally but he did not get up for a while he had to wait for his spirit to come back it came slowly like a bird fluttering down when his spirit was back with him famous shoes stood upbut he did not turn toward the madre he followed joeys track which went toward ojinaga he knew it was not safe after all joey might change his mind again his cold mood might return when he remembered that famous shoes had signaled pea eye where the big shotgun was the shotgun that had driven lead and cloth into joeys body sickening his blood but famous shoes was curious he wanted to know what joey was doing and he wanted another look through the great eye if he followed and waited he might get to see through the great eye again joey headed toward ojinaga and his mother for he wanted to make her take the pellets out of his body he felt sick so sick that he had lost interest in killing the old indian the wounds were like fire they were making him feel so bad that he had lost his pride in killing joey had never expected to be injured himself certainly not by an old man who could scarcely shoot a rifle he felt such weakness in his body that he had difficulty mounting his horse he could not waste his strength killing crazy old men once his mother had cleaned his wounds and he was well again he would dispose of rafael and teresa then he would have his pride back no more would he overlook loaded guns he would no longer make mistakes he thought he might go back near the city of mexico and rob more trains it would be nice to take some silver and some jewels back to his cave soon after lorena and billy williams left the village the shoemaker came for maria his name was jorge and he had a very young wifetoo young maria thought her name was negra her parents were rough people they had married negra to jorge when she was only twelve now barely thirteen she was with child and her time had come jorge urged maria to come to his wife quickly negra had already been in labor for more than a day maria had been to their home six times to check on her already it was her practice to check often when a child was coming she did not like surprises although she often got them there was no way of knowing how a birth would go until it happenedbirth and death were alike in that way it was not a day when maria wanted to leave her children with luck billy williams would be back that night or the next morning with the wounded man maria wanted to stay near rafael and teresa in case joey came the shoemakers house was not far but it was not her house and joey was quick in his evil there was no one in the village that maria could trust now that billy was gone captain call was feverish and he mumbled words that made no sense sometimes he was conscious but he was too weak to even lift his head when he had to relieve himself maria and lorena had taken turns assisting him he tried to fight them off with his one hand but they helped him anyway directing his water into a jug maria would have to do it herself now that lorena was gone and call would accept all other attentions only from teresa but call could not help her guard against joey for he was too weak and in too much pain if joey came while she was helping negra in her labor joey would probably finish off the captainwith a knife with a rifle butt with anything handy maria she is screamingim scared jorge said maria got ready to go negra was only one year older than teresa and she was small in the hips it would not be an easy birth and if maria was not skillful both negra and her child might die maria felt a deep uneasiness she could not refuse to help a child have a child just because she was worried about joey negras baby was there and joey was not she had to go but she was very worried she took her sharp knife with her when she went and she made rafael and teresa go with her rafael drove his goats the short distance to the shoemakers little house teresa was very reluctant to leave call i want to stay with the old man she said to her mother she had taken a great liking to captain call and he to her teresa was the only one who could get him to eat in his few moments of lucidity teresa would sit by him for hours whispering stories in his ear and bathing his face with a wet rag to cool his fever you cant stay with him not now maria said you have to stay near me we will be back this afternoon i hope then you can be with the old man but he might die if i leave teresa said i am his nurse but im negras nurse and we have to go now maria said bring your chickens dont worry about the old man he will be here when we get back before she left maria took a cowbell their cow had died and she had not been able to afford to replace her when they all got to the shoemakers house maria put the bell around rafaels neck it was a little awkward the bell was for a cow not for a boy but maria didnt know what else to do stay where i can hear the bell she told them both if your brother joey comes ring the bell and run to me do not let him catch you whatever you do rafael took a few steps amid the goats and the bell tinkled he began to moan rafael was easily frightened for anything out of the ordinary upset him a bell around his neck was out of the ordinary and it made him feel anxious i dont want you to be too long teresa told her mother i want to go back to see senor call he is my friend he was not your grandfathers friend maria told her but right away she regretted saying it teresa knew nothing of those troubles and besides bringing call into the house had been marias decision she had not expected teresa or anyone to make friends with him but teresa often did things maria would not have expected her to do teresa found a little storybook of joeys and pretended to read it although she could not see she made up her own story while holding the book i like senor calldo not talk bad about him teresa warned im not talking about him im talking about joey maria said she caught her daughters face in her hands and brought it close to hers often that was the only way to get teresas attention when she was being willful only when she felt her mothers breath on her face would teresa heed her i have to help negra have her baby maria said i want you to be careful and if joey comes you run your brother doesnt make jokes im afraid he will hurt you if he comes i will run away from him if he comes teresa told her mother casually as if she could not imagine such a thing happening to her run but make rafael ring the bell maria told her daughter make it ring loud and i will come dont forget but she was afraid that teresa would forget teresa wasnt afraid of her big brother rafael was afraid but rafael might not be able to remember to ring the bell if he became frightened some days rafael could not remember anything at all while maria was talking to teresa negra screamed the scream poured out of the little hut into the empty streets of the quiet town gordo the butcher heard it he had just butchered a pig and was hauling it up so he could gut it the pig had screamed too when he hit it in the head to kill it the butcher had been drunk the night before forwith his wife dead he was lonely he drank often and in the mornings his work was not always precise gordo had not struck well and the pig screamed when he hit it and when he cut its throat he had not noticed before that the wild scream of a dying pig was so much like that of a woman in labor maria cant you come jorge begged negra is dying he came out of the little house shaking his face was tortured with worry maria had seen many husbands in such pain they did not know that their wives were not really dying though sometimes the husbands were rightthe wives did die and their babies too maria knew she could not delay any longer she had to do her work but she could not make her worry go away it was six hours before the baby came negra had been in labor a long time and marias fear was that the young girl would become too weak to help the girls small unprepared body would have to force the baby out without help from the mothers will already negras will was almost exhausted maria had to sit with her patiently soothing her and coaxing her to rest between pains negra was terrified of the pain she thought she must be dying maria soothed her and explained to her that it was the necessary pain of childbirth soon you will have a fine baby maria told her the water finally broke and maria became hopeful the baby was turned properly and did not seem to be too large she had sent jorge away she did the work with two women old sisters who had made their lives together they were crafty old women and greedy each wanted to outlive the other so as to get the others possessions they had seen many children born and were indifferent to negras pain from time to time they smoked tobacco in little cigarettes they rolled themselves soon the floor of the little room was littered with cigarette papers the old women had dropped but they knew the business of birth and helped efficiently when the pains came their names were juana and josia some people thought they were twins for they looked very much alike but each denied being the others twin and each claimed to be the younger sister she was two when i was born juana claimed she is a liar she will go to hell josia said she was already three when i was born maria didnt particularly like the old sisters they were rude to one another often having loud harsh arguments just when the young mothers needed quiet but they were the only ones she could find who knew what to do during difficult births and so she called them in they looked at life with skeptical eyes which sometimes irritated maria she felt she knew as well as any woman that life was a thing of sadness but it was not all sadness and there were times for hope and one time for hope was when a baby was being born maria herself always began to have hopes for the babies she birthed as soon as she saw them perhaps as they grew they would be lucky have health find good women or men to marry rise above poverty and be spared disease and loss few were spared but each time when the baby was in her arms and the moment of peace came maria let her hopes rise she smiled at the little child and bathed it in warm water she wanted to welcome it to life perhaps it would be one of the lucky ones so it was when negras baby finally cameit was a boy maria was tired but she liked the look of the little male child he cried with spirit the spirit of life maria smiled at him and whispered to him he was to be named jorge too after his father he was a fine boy and maria could not help smiling at him the mother was asleep too tired to need her smiles the little boy wiggled and cried and maria took him outside to show him to his father the tortured look left jorges face and he looked at his son with surprise the surprise men so often showed when they saw that a living human had been created from the actions of loveactions they had taken long before and perhaps had forgotten this is a good boy i like the way he wiggles he will give you lots of trouble when he grows up and can walk maria told him then as she was about to take the baby back inside so the old women could cleanse him of the birthing blood maria looked around for her children several times during lulls in the labor she had gone out to speak to them briefly they sat with the goats between the shoemakers house and the butchers shed while the butcher was butchering the pig marias children were just sitting its cold i want to go back to senor call teresa said each time she was sullen as she often was if her mother denied her her way you can come in where i am only sit in the kitchen maria told her no i dont want to sit in that kitchen i would rather be cold teresa replied then the crisis arrived and maria forgot about the children once when negra was screaming she heard the cowbell and was reassured she had to concentrate on what she was doing and she could not listen every moment for a cowbell when the little room rang with the full screams that came with a birth now though with little jorge safely born she turned to look for teresa and rafael and didnt see them the goats were still there but not her children she ran to where the goats were scattering them in her fear then she saw the cowbell lying in the dirt joey had taken it off rafaelwhy hadnt she known he would fear chilled maria so that she almost dropped the baby she ran with him to jorge and thrust the baby into his hands take him to the sisters she said did you see joey nohow do i hold him jorge asked maria had no time to instruct the new father he would have figure out for himself how to hold his son she ran to the butcher who had taken the pigs hooves and ears and was putting them in a sack most of the pig had been cut up parts were heaped on a bloody table and other parts were piled on strips of sacking did you see joey maria asked you are bloodier than i am and ive butchered a pig gordo told her he was a little disgusted with the woman for she had blood all over her arms still she was shapely and she was his neighbor when she cleaned herself up he thought he might go visit her perhaps taking her a little sausage he might ask her to make him menudo or some other tasty dish no joey wasnt here he told her maria knew betterjoey had been there she had to have help and there was only gordo the butcher he was here hes taken my children maria said to him come and bring a gun dont wait in the desperate hope that teresa had disobeyed her and taken rafael home maria ran to her house she had her knife in her hand call was laying outside the back door when she got there he had hobbled out using a chair for a crutch and he had a pistol near him but the chair was too short to be a good crutch and he had fallen again he was lying on his back his leg was bleeding and his eyes were open did he come maria asked he camei cant do anything call said i cant do anything he said again he was so weak that she could barely hear him whisper and it was surprising that he could even have hobbled the few steps he had maria felt fear shaking her more powerful than any fear she had felt in her life she did not have time to move captain call back to bed she grabbed his pistol what did he say senor maria asked did he say anything no call said he came in and looked at me and left hes wounded not wounded enough i have to take your gun maria told him call lay in helplessness he had wanted to kill the boy but he had no strength and no way the boy had simply looked at him insolently for a moment and left he was not a large boy but he had a cold look call had rolled off the bed pulled himself up with the chair and found his pistol but it was no good he was too weak and he soon fell the world was swimming and he couldnt see well he could not make himself rise and even if he had risen it would have done no good joey garza was gone call was helpless and he had failed again maria felt helpless too because she didnt know where to look for her children joey could not have gone too far since it had only been a short time that she last looked out and had seen rafael sitting amid his goats but where had he gone if he had put the children on a horse she would have no chance of catching them she could not track a horse and no one in the village could either joey might take her children far away where she could never follow or find them she ran to the cantina two vaqueros were there drinking perhaps one of them had seen something but the two vaqueros were very drunk they looked at maria with disgust as gordo the butcher had go wash yourself you stink one vaquero said maria raised the gun at him it was the wrong moment for a man to tell her she was not clean enough when they wanted her she was always clean enough even if it was the time of the month when she was bleeding she didnt shoot the vaquero though she didnt have time she just pointed the gun at him and saw his eyes widen at the thought that he might be shot by a filthy dirty woman then she ran outside as she ran she heard a high moaning bleat from the direction of the river it was a sound like a sheep makes when it is dying she had heard it many times when the butcher was killing sheep but it was not a sheep she heard this timeit was rafael who had lived with the sheep and made the cries they made the boys in the village often taunted him for it they called him sheep boy and they told him his father had been a ram when too much fear seized rafael his moan became the screaming bleat that maria now heard maria ran toward the sound she remembered that long ago joey had sometimes tricked rafael into playing a drowning game he would persuade rafael to put his head underwater to watch the fish then joey would jump on his head and try to drown him only the fact that rafael was strong had kept joey from succeeding maybe that was what he was trying to do drown his brother and sister maybe he was too weak from his wounds to take them all the way to the cliff where he had said he would kill them maria fired the pistol in the air for she wanted to make joey think men were coming she wanted to do anything to get him to stop so that she could get there before he killed rafael she heard the bleating again and kept running toward the sound feeling a terrible fear teresa was the weaker child and might already be dead killed by her brother joey joey might realize that rafael was too strong to drown and he might stab him or shoot him before she could find them maria had two fears one that she might not arrive in time to save her children and two that the warp of her life might have forced her to the moment when she would have to kill her evil son her sweetest most beguiling dreams were dreams in which joey was good again as he had been when he was just a little boy but then she would awaken to heartache and discouragement so profound that it made her limbs heavy for joey was no longer a little boy and he was no longer good even in her discouragement she had the wish that it would be someone else not her who met joey in battle and defeated him now the two fears came together in her and she carried them both as she ran she had the gun and the knife if only someone else would comethe butcher jorge the drunken vaqueros anyone but maria looked behind her as she ran and there was no one coming guided by rafaels high bleating call maria ran through the thin mesquite until she came to the river near the spot where old estela sat to listen to her dead children joey had pulled rafael and teresa into the deepest part of the river rafael was soaked but he was alive when maria got to the river joey was holding teresas head under in the deep water but teresa was not dead joey had tied her thin legs with a rawhide rope but teresas legs were still thrashing rafaels head was bleeding joey had beaten him trying to knock him out so he could drown him but rafael had been too strong maria shot the gun again twice she did not shoot at joey she just wanted him to stop his back was to her when she came up and she saw that his wounds were bad when he turned to confront her he looked pale but he did not release his sisterhe held her as if she were a large slick fish maria saw teresa get her head up and gulp at the air and felt a moment of pride at how hard her girl was struggling for her life then joey shoved her under again but teresa only wiggled harder her body looked like that of a struggling fish under the water maria saw old estela sitting on the other bank watching she was listening for her own children and did not seem to care that two of marias children were being drowned before her eyes maria went into the water and shot again the bullet hit a rock and whined away let her go maria yelled at her son who are you to be killing your own sister joey turned his head toward maria briefly and gave her that cold look he had the look that made her feel she was not there maria had always hated that look she was his mother and she was there but not to joeys eyeshe kept trying to get a better grip on his wiggling sister drowning teresa was what interested him not the fact that his mother was threatening him with a gun joey was glad his mother had come he wanted her to see what he was doing catching rafael and teresa had been easy he had tied them up and thrown them on his horse while the shoemakers wife was screaming it was irritating that rafaels skull was so thick that even three blows with a rock had not weakened him enough that joey could drown him joey had hobbled rafaels feet he could finish him later he was annoyed with his sister too he had not supposed that she was so strong or could struggle so hard despite all he could do she kept getting her head up gulping air he could not get a good enough grip on her neck to keep her under because of his wounds he was not strong enough for the task he was trying to do joey was not at all surprised that his mother had come she had been working with the woman in childbirth and she was as bloody as a wounded animal the fact that she had old calls pistol didnt worry him his mother wouldnt shoot him and even if she tried she would miss when the drowning was over he would make her take the pellets out once that was done he would get his strength and his pride back and would go near the city of mexico and rob some trains with rich people on them his mother had doctored old call for he had seen the old ranger in bed in her house joey had started to kill him but had felt the same indifference he felt when he let famous shoes live it would be wasting a death to kill such a worthless old person who could take pride in killing such old halfdead people it was better to do what he was doing avenge himself on the bloody woman who stood there pointing a pistol at him maria shot one more time it hit the water near joey but he didnt even look up she had stopped expecting to scare her son she shot in hopes that someone would hear and come to see what the shooting was about even if the drunken vaqueros came it might be enough then joey might stop but joey didnt stop he had managed to get teresas body between his legs and he tightened his legs and used both hands to shove his sisters head under the water maria waded into the water and struck joey high on the shoulder with her knife joey screamedthe wounds on his back were sore he turned to his mother with a look of hatred maria struck again high on his other shoulder she only wanted to cut joey enough so he would let teresa go when joey turned again teresa wiggled free and sucked in air she kept wiggling until she was out of reach joey grabbed for her but teresa was quicker even with her feet tied she was as quick as a fish joey took a few steps toward her but teresa was already yards away in the water she was quicker than he was in fury joey turned on maria and drew his own knife he would kill rafael with the knife and then chase down teresa maria saw where her sons eyes were pointed she put herself between joey and rafael she still held her knife but she didnt want to stab her son again the wounds she had given him were light and were meant to distract him not hurt him she could help him recover and live she would do ittake out the pellets of heavy shot wash his wounds nurse him if only he would relent he must relent though she would not give him her other children his brother and sister stop this maria cried youre hurt youre weak stop this killing come home with me and let me wash you ill feed you and ill hide you until you are well wash yourself whore joey said in his cold tone his eyes were like sleet maria held her knife high joey would not stop he would not become her good son again all she could do now was protect rafael joeys cold look made maria want to give up her son should not look at her with his look of sleetit was a poor return for the care she had given and the love she had borne but it was joeys look and she could not change him she had to give up that way she could protect rafael and teresa and she would protect them no matter what she had to do when joey came close maria raised the knife and tried to cut his arm anyplace to slow him but not kill him she saw joeys knife but didnt feel it strikenot the first time not the second not the third leave your brother alone she screamed leave him alone dont hurt your brother joey was trying to push his mother out of the way so he could grab his brothers hair when the bullet struck him he turned his head at the shot maria turned too they saw gordo the butcher standing on the riverbank with his old carbine dont kill her you rascal gordo yelled dont kill heri might want to marry her across the river teresa crawled into the shallows and old estela hobbled over and helped her out of the water teresa was very frightened her mother had been right joey was bad she was worried for she heard shots and she could not see where is my mother she asked the old woman old estelas eyes were dim and she couldnt see the far bank of the river she is over there old estela said i think i hear her talking to my children joey fell backward into the water maria cut rafael free and the two of them began to drag joey to the bank where the butcher stood with his gun before maria could get out of the river she fell too she fell across her sons legs and the river began to swirl her blood away gordo carried maria home she was awake but he saw where she had been stabbed and knew she would not live it angered him for he had already begun to think of her as his wife and was looking forward to laying with her she had eluded him when she was a girl and now she was going to elude him again by dying it was an aggravation such an aggravation that he refused to bring her devil of a sons body to her hes dead gordo maria said bring him home the butcher ignored her he also refused to lift captain call and bring him back inside the house he put maria on the bed and as he went out he spat on call later the two drunken vaqueros came to marias house and they too spat on him one wanted to put a rope around the old mans neck and drag him to death but the other vaquero argued that it would be better just to let the old man die he was too famous if they put a rope on him the texans might find out about it and hunt them down teresa picked her way back across the cold river in fear she was afraid her brother might catch her again and put her head in the cold swirling river and let it suck her breath away twice when he held her teresa had feared that the river was going to suck all her breath away but her brother didnt take her she waded through the cold water stepping on slick rocks teresa knew the path through the mesquites and was soon home rafael was inside moaning when teresa felt his head she found that it was wet and sticky her mother lay on the bed where senor call had been where is he did he leave teresa asked concerned her mother had promised that senor call would be there when she returned home he is outside her mother told her in a voice that was very weak joey hurt me and gordo would not help me go find jorge and ask him to come he can move senor call back inside ask the old sisters if they would come to me the old sisters and jorge came jorge put call inside on a blanket teresa fixed some frijoles but only rafael ate a little her mother didnt want any and senor call was not speaking his mind had gone to sleep as it often did teresa began to be afraid for her mother she heard her mothers breath and it was as weak as senor calls she was worried that they might both die she was also afraid that joey might come back and get her and rafael she knew now that joey was bad and she was very afraid having the water suck her breath had left her with a deep fear maria felt her daughters fear in the trembling of her small hands dont be afraid she said joeys dead you are safe billy will come soon and take care of us the old sisters will stay until he comes to help when the vaqueros realized that joey garza was dead and that gordo a stupid butcher had killed him they became bitter they had had the chance to kill him too but the bloody woman had pointed a gun at them and prevented them from having the glory of killing the young bandit in their bitterness they drank a lot of tequila and convinced themselves that they had shot joey garza the butcher had only assisted they found joeys body in the river and shot it a few more times then put a rope on it and dragged it through the village streets in other places one would believe that a greasy butcher had killed the famous young killer with a rusty carbine but in mexico and texas the people would think it was two fearless vaqueros who had risked their lives to rid the country of a scourge their fame would grow there would be songs about them only in ojinaga would anyone even suppose that a village butcher had anything to do with it the vaqueros left joeys body outside the cantina and went to presidio to spread the news they wanted to find someone to take their picture with the corpse jorge and his brother brought joeys body to his mother his body was filthy and dirty and coated with dust from being dragged by the two vaqueros maria begged the old sisters to heat water and help her clean her son she wanted his body to be clean and she wanted him dressed in clean clothes clothes that she had washed herself hes my good boy again please make him nice she asked the old sisters but the old sisters smoked and sulked and ignored her they knew the dead boy was of the devilto touch him might be to catch corruption maria was weak but she was determined that her sons body would be clean get out she cried at the old sisters go roll your cigarettes someplace else she made teresa heat water when it was hot she bathed the wounds on rafaels scalp working very slowly then she had teresa and rafael help her move to where joey lay teresa brought her a knife and with it maria cut off joeys clothes she was very weak and she had to stop often to rest jorge came in for a minute and helped maria clean joeys body he was very grateful to maria for his wife was alive and he had a fine son he didnt know why maria was still alive she had three deep wounds in her chest and the blood seeped through her dress mama youre bleeding teresa said i feel it on my hands maria youre hurt jorge said thinking she might not realize how badly she was wounded i want to put clean clothes on my son maria said i want to do it now she ignored their fears the fears of her child and of the shoemaker she felt very weak but she wanted her sons body to be clean she was not strong enough to dress him though and jorge did not like to touch dead bodies jorge began to shake and tremble at the thought of what he was doing he wanted to be home looking at his fine son he didnt like moving joeys stiffening limbs in order to get him into clothes they got the shirt on him but that was the best they could do maria just cover him jorge told her before he left maria had to stop with the shirt for she was too weak to do more she asked teresa to get a blanket and they covered joey maria wept and wept for her sons lost life teresa felt her mothers tears with her fingers and tried to comfort her but for maria there was no comfort she had tried to be a good mother but she had not been able to make her son a good person joey had been killed while trying to murder his own brother and sister that he had killed her didnt matter so much his life had killed her already his life and her life her mistakes had been too many and too profound though she didnt know exactly when the mistakes had been made or what they were she had gotten up every morning and made food and washed clothes and seen that her children were clean she had tried to teach them good behavior but still it had led to teresas blindness and rafaels poor mind and the moment in the river when she had had to turn the knife on her own child it was too hardmaria wanted peace she wanted to have all the pains and worries bleed quickly away and to go into a sleep beyond dreams beyond the need to be awake and wash and cook while knowing every day that so much was wrong when joey was covered maria crawled back to her blanket stopping several times to rest she saw old call watching her that was another strange trick of lifethat she should be dying in her own house in a room with the man who had killed her father and her brother the children had run outside for a moment they couldnt stand to hear the weakness in her voice and they wanted to be away from the fear that their mother might die they hid among the goats while rafael tried to find the nanny goat he sometimes suckled but he was too confused he could not find her call saw maria crawling on the floor dragging herself back to her blanket he didnt know what had occurred but he saw that the woman was badly injured he remembered that the cold boy had come into the room and had looked at him insolently maria did not like having the old man in her house taking him in had been another mistake if she met her father and her brother on the other side they would be stern and unforgiving but call was kind to teresa and perhaps if he lived he would be a friend to her several townspeople came to see joeys body maria lay on her blanket and did not speak she could not afford to waste what strength she had left teresa and rafael came back and sat with her one child on either side they were silent and afraid maria hoped that billy would return soon this time she needed him to hurry back with lorena it was for lorena that she waited in pain and in life maria was a mother she had two children alive two damaged children she hoped lorena would be kind enough to take them there was no one in the village to take them for the village was too poor no one would want to feed them or keep them clean or wash their clothes teresa was pretty men would soon find her and degrade her rafael would be teased and tormented he would go hungry for his blind sister would not be strong enough to protect him for them maria held herself in life teresa brought her posole but she could not eat she saw teresa feeding old call and heard her whispering to him long hours passed maria grew more and more tired until she was so weak she despaired she was about to ask old call if he would make the request to lorena for her would he ask lorena if she would take her children she knew it was a serious request to ask another woman to raise her children lorena had five of her own and it might be that her husband was dead but maria had no one else to ask she was about to tell rafael to pull her over nearer to call when she heard the horses coming to the house then billy williams stood in the doorway lorena stood behind him he came and knelt by maria maria felt grateful to fortune that she had billy williams to assist her he had come back when he promised he had many failings but he also had fidelitynow he had brought her the person she most needed the woman who might help her children after her death when she could not mother them anymore it was important that he had come back when he said he wouldit was the best thing a man had ever done for her why mary you aint dyin are you billy asked he was stricken in the heart he touched marias face it was cold he had only left for a little more than a day and now this go get drunk now billy maria whispered to him but dont forget my children please talk about me when you see them give them your memories tell them how i danced and laughed when i was young and pretty mary youre still young and pretty billy williams told her it took his breath away to think that after all these years maria was going he would be lost he wouldnt know what to do maria raised up and gave him a kiss and tugged at his hair for a moment he still had the long hair of the mountain man go on billy go get drunk maria whispered again oh mary billy sighed he wanted to talk morehe wanted to say things he had never said to her but marias eyes were tired and sad you go on obey me maria told him quietly but in a tone that he knew better than to argue with well didnt i always he asked lorena wanted the old man to go she saw the dying woman looking at her and she knew what maria wanted to ask she wanted the old man to go yet maybe he had been to maria what pea eye was to her it was not her place to rush him in his last moments with his love billy williams rose looked at maria once more and stumbled outside lorena knelt and felt marias pulse it was barely there that the woman was alive at all was a wonder but then it was a wonder that call still lived pea eye was outside tied to his horse and in great pain she wanted to lift him down and bring him in but she had to hear marias request first would you take them maria asked with a movement of her head first toward rafael and then toward teresa yes ill take them lorena said firmly she wanted to relieve the womans deep doubt maria had made the request she herself would have had to make to clara if things had gone differently and she might not have even gotten to speak itshe might have had to trust that clara would receive it in her heart and respond ive got my husband back now and ill take them i expect we can take care of all the children that come along lorena told her she meant it too she was firm she had pea eye back and together they could take care of all the children that came along maria smiled she looked at rafael and put her trembling hand on teresas face ive got to get my husband in hes hurt ill be right back lorena said softly she found billy williams outside crying i just went off for two days he choked and now this it was the wrong two days but you couldnt know that lorena said help me get pea off will you hes hurting they lifted pea eye down carried him into the small house and put him down beside call theres not too many more places left to lay sick people or dead people in this house billy williams mumbled there were joey and maria call and now pea eye lorena went to maria and saw that she was gone the counts even now she said quietly to billy its two thats sick and two thats dead oh mary billy said when he looked at her he sat down on the floor and put his head in his arms lorena made pea eye as comfortable as she could he was unconscious but he would live on the ride back despite his pain pea talked and talked asking questions about their children the fact that his children were in nebraska kept slipping from his tired mind finally to satisfy him lorena made up little stories about the children and what they were doing then when she had made her husband as comfortable as she could make him lorena went back across the small room covered maria and sat with her two new children the little girl who had no sight and the large boy with the empty mind in the morning the vaqueros came back with a photographer they had found in presidio they wanted to have their pictures taken with the famous bandit they had killed they had drunk tequila all night telling stories about the great battle theyd had with the young killer they had forgotten the butcher and the mother entirely in their minds there had been a great gun battle by the rio grande and the famous bandit had finally fallen to their guns billy williams had obeyed marias last order he drank all night sitting outside the room where maria lay but the whiskey hadnt touched him and when the vaqueros came straggling up from the river with the photographer and his heavy camera loaded on a donkeyhe planned to take many pictures and sell them to the yankee magazines and make his fortune billy williams went into a deadly rage you goddamn goat ropers had better leave he yelled grabbing his rifle the vaqueros were startled into immediate sobriety by the wild look in the old mountain mans eyes billy williams began to fire his rifle and the vaqueros felt the bullets whiz past them like angry bees causing them to flee the photographer a small man from missouri named mullins fled toobut he could not persuade the donkey to flee george mullins stopped fifty yards away and watched billy williams cut the cameras off the donkey and hack them to kindling with an axe george mullins had invested every cent he had in the world in those cameras he had even borrowed money to buy the latest equipmentbut in a moment he was bankrupt there would be no sales to yankee magazines and there would be no fortune george mullins had ridden across the river feeling like a coming man he walked back to texas owning nothing but a donkey all day people filed out of the countryside like ants from mexico and from texas hoping for a look at joey garzas body but billy williams drove them all off he fired his gun over their heads or skipped bullets off the dust at their feet go away you goddamn buzzards he growled at the few who dared to come within hearing distance the people feared to challenge him but they were frustrated the body of the famous young killer lay almost in sight and they wanted to see it they wanted to tell their children that they had seen the corpse of joey garza they hated the old fountain man he was crazy what right did he have to turn them away when they had come long distances to look at a famous corpse he didnt own the body they ought to lock up the old bastard one disgruntled spectator complained he expressed the general view but no one came to lock up billy olin roy arrived out of deep mexico in time to help billy dig the two graves olin was silent and sad for he too had loved maria the old sisters came and dressed marias body but they would not touch joey lorena finished the cleaning that maria in her weakness had begun pea eye watched with famous shoes who had arrived in the night while billy williams sat drinking the wounds in joeys back were terrible and olin and billy both believed they would have killed joey in time why he was just a young boy pea eye remarked it always surprised him how ordinary famous outlaws turned out to be once you saw them dead people talked about them so much that you came to expect them to be giants but they werent they were just men of ordinary size if not smaller why claries bigger than he was pea eye said all that chasing and all that pain and death and the boy who caused it hadnt been as big as his own fifteenyearold he had pretty hands didnt he lorena said she felt sad and low all billy williamss yelling and shooting made her nervous she could not forget marias anguished eyes what a terrible grief to have a child go bad and never be able to correct it or even know why it happened she wondered how she would live if one of her sons came to hate her as joey had seemed to hate maria it was not a direction lorena wanted to allow her mind to go she didnt want such darkness in her thoughts for she had the living to tend to she busied herself caring for pea eye captain call and the two children she thought of maria and her bad son as little as possible there was no knowing why such things happened lorena had good sons and she knew now how very lucky she was to have an evil child come from her own womb would be too hard to bear lorena didnt want to think about it when pea eyes mind cleared and he had a good look at the captain he was shocked call was almost helpless he let the little blind girl feed him but otherwise he simply lay on his pallet barely moving of course he could barely move without assistance he only had one leg and one arm and could not button or unbutton himself you have to help him make water lorena told pea eye he hates for me to do it but if somebody dont help him hell wet his pallet watch him and help him we dont have any bedding to spare why captain if there was many more people as bunged up as you and me theyd have to build a crutch factory in the panhandle i guess pea eye said he was trying to make conversation with the silent man he thought of the part about the crutch factory as a little joke but lorena glared at him when he said it and captain call did not reply he just stared upward later pea eye felt bad about having made the remark he didnt know why he had even made it it just popped out though his hip pained him a good deal pea eye could not help but feel good his wife had found him and they were together again he wouldnt have to lose her and he would see his children soon lorena was going to wire clara to send them home when the time came for them all to go north the sullen doctor from presidio had been persuaded to come and set pea eyes hip but only because lorena had gone to presidio herself and refused to take no for an answer she had waited sternly in the doctors office until he saddled a horse and came back with her he said pea would be walking without a crutch in two months just in time for planting his shoulder was already almost healed and the two toes joey shot off he could do without mox mox and joey garza were dead but he himself had survived he had also learned his lesson and learned it well he would never leave his family again whyd you have to say that about the crutch factory lorena whispered to him that night the remark had startled her pea eye had never made a joke in his lifewhy that one at that time hell never forgive you for saying it and i dont blame him she went on youre just hurt pea in two months youll be as good as new but the captain is crippled for life hes crippled for life you better just shut up about crutch factories she whispered later with unusual vehemence pea eye came to feel that his chance remark was the worst thing he had ever said in his life his main hope was that the captain would just forget it but the captain said so little to anyone that it was hard to know what he was remembering or forgetting the captain just lay there he only fought when pea eye tried to help him relieve himself struggling with his one weak hand his struggles unnerved pea eye so much that he did a poor job the first time and he made a mess this incompetence annoyed lorena to the point that she ignored the captains objections and helped him herself after that youll have to learn to do things for him pea lorena said hes helpless hell have to live with us for a while i guess i told maria id take her children and weve got them to think about too were both going to have all we can do you better make up your mind to start helping captain call you have to help him now whether he likes it or not you know the man you worked for him most of your life he dont like it when i help him i dont know whether he just dont like me or whether its because im a woman or because i was what i was once i dont know but were going to have all we can do both of us and the captain ought to be your responsibility why that little blind girl takes care of him pretty well herself pea said indeed teresas attentiveness and the captains acceptance of it surprised him he had never known the captain to cotton to a child he had never even come to visit their children and he and lorena had five teresa brought the captain his food and sat by him and fed him she brought a rag and washed his face when he finished if he wanted to turn on his side he let teresa help him often she whispered to him and the captain responded though in a voice so low that pea eye could not pick up the words the little girl was quick as a lizard she could be across the room and out the door in a flash and pea eye never saw her bump into anything maria and joey were buried in the two graves billy and olin had dug many people came not for maria but so they could say they had seen joey garza buried billy and lorena went across the river and got the coffins plain pine boxes they tried to find mullins the photographer and return his donkey but mullins was drunk somewhere and could not be located the collapse of his prospects proved too much for him billy williams was a little abashed it had all been the vaqueros fault not the photographers but they could not spend all day looking for a drunken photographer so they took the donkey back to mexico the old sisters and a few local women came to the burial but very few men showed up gordo the butcher walked by sullenly and went home he was still angry with maria for being dead and thus unavailable for marriage there ought to be singing lorena said she knew pea eye couldnt sing and billy and olin were unknown quantities when it came to hymn singing she remembered the songs in laredo during the burial of the deputys young wife she had learned from pea that the deputy was dead now too it made her want to go live in a country where not so much blood was spilled she remembered how the whore with the curly hair had poured her heart into the song for the young woman as if she had known how the deputys wife must have felt to want to take her own life though not confident of her own voice lorena resolved to sing alone if necessary she began theres a home beyond the riverafter all the river was right there in sightand to her surprise olin roy joined her he had a fine baritone voice he sang so well that a few of the gawkers from presidio were moved to join in that night dark feelings burdened lorena she could not get marias horrible end to leave her mind she tried to sleep but could not she lay beside pea eye on the pallet and began to shake the feeling came over her that had made her want to die when blue duck took her and when mox mox prepared to burn her evil men or evil circumstances would come and prove stronger than all the good in her life she had her husband back and would soon have her children with her but in her fear she could not help feeling that the reprieve was only temporary clara allen herself had watched all three of her sons die two of marias children had afflictions and the one who had been whole and beautiful was evil he had murdered many men and in the end had even murdered the woman who had carried him in her womb lorena couldnt control her fear for it came from places too deep and too real from what she had known and what she had seen she and her family were safe but only for a time her children were still young and disease could take them her boys were still small one of them could be a joey she didnt expect it but maria probably hadnt expected it either when joey had been the age of georgie or ben the fear made lorena restless she got up then lay down again the room was too small to walk in she could hear pea eyes breathing and the captains and rafaels the large boy snored in his sleep billy williams and olin roy were outside drinking and smoking in her restlessness lorena went out she had never drunk much whiskey but she wanted something that would dull her feelingthe feeling that there was no safety and that nothing could prevent things happening to her or her loved ones things that were even worse than what had already happened she knew she was lucky for she was healthy she wasnt dead none of her children were sick and her husbands wounds would heal but it was only temporary her luck the next mox mox might find her or the next plague or a storm or a fire or a war maria had been a kind woman but her fate had been far from kindher fate had been hard and her end terrible it was a warning but a warning for a condition which had no cure or of a threat that there was no guarding against lorena put on pea eyes coat and stepped out into the cold night the two men sat a little distance from the house they had made a small campfire and were staring into it passing a bottle back and forth lorena walked out to the fire both men saw lorena coming and felt uneasy she had been courteous to both of them and had made billy williams an ally forever because of her kindness to maria maria would have died even harder had she not known that lorena would take care of her children billy and olin had roamed the border country for most of their lives and both of them remembered lorena from other days when she had been a beautiful young whore in lonesome dove both had visited her olin roy remembered the frenchman xavier wanz who had loved lorena so feverishly that he burned his own saloon and himself with it in his grief when lorena went north with the hat creek outfit neither had supposed they would encounter the woman so much later in life married to the gangly pea eye she was heavier and her fresh beauty had been worn away by life but she was the same woman she was respectable and competent by any standard she had amputated woodrow calls leg and brought him to safety across more than a hundred miles of desert few men would have been equal to that task now she was walking toward their campfire in her husbands big coat in the heat of action and the sadness of the last days neither man had thought much about their earlier brief connection with lorena but now they wondered separately if she would remember that they had been among her many customers long ago could you spare me a little of your liquor gentlemen lorena asked im feeling chill here maamweve got a fresh bottle billy said handing it to her this one aint been slobbered on lorena took the full bottle and drank the whiskey burned her throat but she sat down by the campfire tucked the coat around her and drank anyway pea eyes coat was a heavy gray capote with a hood for rough weather lorena pulled the hood over her head and drank the men had fallen silent which annoyed her a little it irritated her that men were so uneasy in her company most of the time she had been courteous to these menwhy had they immediately stopped talking when she arrived even pea eye was sometimes ill at ease in her company for no reason she could understand she was doing exactly the same thing as the men sitting by a campfire drinking whiskey why wouldnt they talk i dont mean to impose lorena said to them you dont have to choke off your conversation just because im here we wasnt saying much anyway billy williams told her we was just chatting about mary tell me about her lorena said i didnt have time to get to know her very well she was married four times billy williams said three of her husbands got killed and the other one run off i never cared much for any of them myself but it was mary who took them as husbands not me then joey went bad he added was she ever happy lorena asked mary yes we used to dance a lot billy williams remembered i guess you both cared for her lorena said seems like you did or you wouldnt be here didnt either of you want to marry her oh i did billy williams said she wouldnt have me but we got along anyway olin roy remained silent his disappointments in regard to maria were too deep to voice were any of her husbands good to her lorena wondered the two men were silent they had known little of what went on in marias marriages when she was with roberto sanchez her face had often been bruised apparently he was rough though maria had never mentioned it to either of them carlos garza had been a vaquero off in the cow camps with other vaqueros juan castro had been cheap besides her midwifing maria had done cleaning for white people across the river when she was married to him benito had merely been lazy he seemed to have no malice in him but was maria ever happy both could remember her smile and the sound of her laughter and the look on her face when she was pleased as well as when she was displeased but was maria ever happy it was a hard question she had her children billy replied she was good to her children lorena asked no more questions she felt she had been foolish to inquire the two men were probably decent as men went both had clearly been devoted to maria else why would they be here reluctant to leave her grave but how the woman had felt when she closed the doors of her house at night and was alone with one of her husbands and her children was not something that men could be expected to know what maria had felt in the years of her womanhood was lost who would know what feelings she had struggled with as she lost four husbands and raised her children how could men decent or not know what made a woman happy or unhappy she herself had known little happiness until she had persuaded pea eye to accept her why she felt she might be happy with pea instead ofwith any of the other men who had sought her hand in the years after gus mccraes death was elusive too lorena had thought shed known what drew her to pea eye once but now sitting by the campfire in mexico she found she couldnt recover her own reckonings in the matter she had been right though for she had known great happiness with pea eye and their children probably there was no explaining any of it probably it had been mostly luck the night grew colder and the stars shone even more sharply in the deep inky sky lorena drank most of the bottle of whiskey she knew that she would feel like her head was cracking in the morning but she didnt care the restlessness she felt had to be conquered the deep fear inside her had to be dulled she needed the fire of the whiskey and the numbness that finally came even with the whiskey in her lorena could not stop thinking of maria she wished shed had more time with her time not so filled with violence and pain there had been no time for the talk of women when there had been so many injured to attend to then maria had become one of the injured herself shed had to save her strength for her final request marias eyes at the end haunted lorena she wanted to forget marias eyes but she also wanted to know what maria knew and what she had felt she wished the two of them could have had even one talk about their lives she wished it very much but that wish could not be granted the white line of dawn began to show in the east across the river soon lorena knew she would have to go in drunk or not rested or not and start tending to the injured and the children it was too late for the knowledge she craved she would never know much about maria that chancean important onehad been lost forever the line of white to the east widened and the lower stars began to fade in that direction only a few steps beyond where the goats were sleeping maria sanchez lay buried not far from the rio grande in a narrow grave calls greatest embarrassment was that he could not stand up and walk outside to relieve himself for a time he had no crutch and would have been too weak to use one even if one had been available he had to make water in a jug and often was too weak even to do that properly he had only his left hand and his finger joints were still swollen so badly with arthritis that he couldnt work his own buttons mostly pea eye helped him but if pea eye was sleeping or had hobbled outside with marias children lorena came and assisted him matteroffactly ignoring his embarrassment and shame she did it quickly as she might have dipped water out of a bucket we dont have the bedding to spare captain she said once it was her only comment on the matter at such times call wanted to take out his pocketknife and cut his own throat but someone had taken his pocketknife and even if he had had it he doubted he could have made a clean job of it with only his left hand to use call spoke only to the little blind girl teresa she insisted on caring for him and he accepted her help although sometimes her girlish chatter tired him she was very helpful to him also she was a young child and blind she could not see his stumps or the black bruise that covered most of his chest where the bullet was that the doctor had not been bold enough to remove call wished the man had made an attempt perhaps then he would have died at least teresa couldnt see him and she hadnt known him as he had been she sat by him and fed him and while she fed him told him little stories about spiders and rabbits her speech was like a birdsong quick and light hearing her voice was calls only pleasure he never reproached teresa or sent her away even when he was weary or hot with pain in the mornings he waited patiently for her as soon as she awoke teresa would come over and put her cool hand on calls forehead to see how bad his fever was from the moment joey garzas three bullets struck calls only escape from pain had been unconsciousness he clung to sleep but his dozings became shorter and shorter on the day he was wounded he had wanted to live he wanted to finish the job he had been hired to do he had never left a job unfinished in his life remaining himself remaining who he was meant finishing the job he had undertaken but as captain call floated in and out of fever and hallucination the first thought that filtered into his consciousness each time he awoke was a sense of irrevocable failurea failure that could never be redeemed he could not finish the job would never finish or even undertake such a job again he had failed and was beyond making the failure good he deeply regretted not doing exactly what gus mccrae had done letting the wounds finish him his wounds had finished him as the man he had been he clung to a form of life but a worthless form he had never enjoyed letting people wait on him he had always saddled his own horse and unsaddled it too but now people waited on him all day teresa brought him food and spooned it into his mouth lorena changed his bandages pea eye crippled himself nonetheless had two hands and helped him into a clean shirt and fresh pants when the time came to change call could not clear his mind sufficiently to bring what had happened into a clear sequence or even to remember it all he inquired about brookshire and was told that his body had been taken to the undertakers in presidio the day lorena and billy had gone to procure the coffins for maria sanchez and her son it was still there awaiting instructions no one had had time to inform colonel terry of all that had occurred some days call understood that he had killed mox mox at other times he thought charles goodnight had killed himat least goodnight had been mentioned in connection with the death he could not get the facts of deputy plunkerts demise straight in his mind nor was it quite clear to him how brookshire had died the confusion only made his sense of failure worse two men who should never have been with him in the first place who had been cajoled incoming by calls own misjudgments were now dead it was a sorry thing calls one consolation was that pea eye had wounded joey garza and had finished the job he had been hired to do he didnt understand about maria or the butcher thoughwhat did the butcher have to do with anything but he did grasp that joey had killed his mother and that the feebleminded boy and the little blind girl would be going with them to the panhandle when he was able to travel when that would be no one seemed to know call continued to be very weak it was a long trip to the railroad and the trip would have to be made in a wagon the doctor didnt think call was up to it yet lorena didnt either i carried him this far and kept him alive lorena said i want him to survive the trip back well just have to wait until hes stronger one day lorena went to presidio and came back with three crutches one was for pea eye the other two were for call call could only look at the crutches he was just at the point where he could sit up without growing faint sitting up made it easier for teresa to feed him he couldnt use a crutch not yet pea eye used his immediately he pulled himself up and crutched his way around the room pea eye seemed to be feeling fine it was known throughout the border country that pea eye had fired the shots that stopped joey garza the doctor had let it be known that the shotgun wounds would have killed joey in time the butcher had happened to finish him but pea eye had made possible what the butcher had done pea eye was a hero on both sides of the river lorena saw captain call looking sadly at the crutches the old man scarcely spoke all day except to the little blind girl lorena had ceased to be certain that she had done the old man any favor by working so hard to save him she had only saved him for grief it seemed he was an old man with no prospects it was clear that he would prefer to be dead he just didnt know how to be youll get stronger captain lorena said youll be using these crutches as good as pea eye one of these days i doubt it call said he didnt want the crutches how could a man on crutches mount a horse later though call realized that he had no need to mount a horse and nowhere to go on one if he did mount it teresa was telling him one of her spider stories when the realization struck him sometimes for a minute or two teresa would draw call into one of her stories he would begin to be interested in the spider or the lizard or the rabbit teresa was talking about it was only a brief relief from thinking about his failure but even a brief relief was welcome he lived or at least he breathed yet he had no idea what his life would be listening to teresas stories was better than thinking about the disgrace of his failed attempt to catch joey garza or about the two pointless deaths or about the indignity of the future pea eye had said he could come and live on the farm with himself and lorena and their children call didnt want it yet he had to live somewhere i doubt i could be much help he said when pea eye made the offer pea eye doubted it too but he didnt voice his doubts you dont have to be captainnot for a while pea eye told him famous shoes stayed in ojinaga for a week he wanted the great eye which was still tied to joey garzas saddle the saddle was in a small shed behind marias house billy williams kept an eye on the shed for he was afraid that people would try to steal anything they could find that had belonged to joey joey was a famous bandit people would be looking for souvenirs famous shoes wanted the great eye badly he knew that such an instrument which allowed one to study the plains on the moon must be very valuable yet he had done considerable tracking for the white men and had only been paid the five dollars that pea eye gave him that came under a different account in famous shoes reckoning pea eye had given him the five dollars to show him where the big shotgun lay the wages they owed him for tracking had not been paid captain call was sick his mind was not on the debt no ones mind was on the debt except his own billy williams was grieving for maria and he drank too much whiskey olin roy had left billy williamss eyesight was failing probably he would want to keep the great eye for himself if it was called to his attention the old indian waited several days trying to decide who he should approach about the great eye he was tempted to steal it but white men sometimes became crazy when things they werent using were stolen from them they might follow him and shoot him the saddle had belonged to joey marias son and both of them were dead the great eye belonged to no one as far as famous shoes could see taking it would not be stealing still he did not want to do anything that would make the white men crazy captain call did not want to talk to anyone except the little blind girl he had never liked famous shoes anyway and would find reasons to deny him the great eye if he was asked he would say it was worth too much or that famous shoes didnt have that much wages coming one day famous shoes decided to approach pea eye who was outside mending a stirrup i want to go to the madre and visit the eagles famous shoes told him if you dont want to pay me my wages in money i will take the great eye instead the great what pea eye asked the great eye that joey used famous shoes replied it is tied to his saddle oh that old spyglass pea eye said nobodys using iti sure dont want to drag that thing around i guess you can just have it if thats what you want famous shoes could scarcely believe his good fortune billy williams was at the cantina lorena had gone to the river with rafael and teresa to wash clothes he went at once to the little shed and took the great eye captain call had his eyes shut and he breathed hard like a sick calf white men had the habit of staying alive too long in famous shoes opinion captain call ought to send his spirit on now it was time for him to visit the other place he might find his leg and his arm if he went there without delay famous shoes left for the madre carrying the great eye now he would be able to see as well as the eagles now he could track them through the sky pea eye was through with his crutch before the captain attempted to use his for the first time call was so sad that it was hard to be around him lorena finally cleaned out the little room that had been marias and made him a bed in there too much had to be done in the other room she had to cook and clean tend to the two children feed billy and pea and the captainwhen the captain would eat having to walk around the silent suffering old man every time she needed to do something was beginning to get on lorenas nerves when they got him home to the farm pea would have to build him a room of some kind away from the house with two more children in their home there would have to be some expansion anyway lorena accepted that they would have to care for callhe had no one elsebut she didnt want him sitting in her kitchen hour after hour every day looking as if he hated life it would be bad for her children and her own nerves couldnt take it she ran a happy household usually she was not going to dampen her childrens liveliness because of captain calls grief once she installed him in marias bedroom things were better teresa became his sole attendant she didnt like for anyone but herself to go into calls room and call didnt welcome others either pea eye would come in once in a while and attempt to talk to him but call scarcely responded the events of the past weeks were twisted in his mind like a rope that had not been coiled properly he wanted to remember things clearly to backtrack through the pursuit of joey garza until he located the moment of failure but the effort was discouraging he had followed up the available clues and deployed his resources in what seemed like an intelligent way perhaps he should not have let himself be distracted by mox mox if he hadnt though jasper fants two children would have died and others as well very likely by most reckonings mox mox was worse than joey garza had been what it came down to call concluded was this on the morning when he was injured his eyesight had failed him he hadnt once suspected that the buckskin horse was hobbled he ought to have been alert to that possibility but all he had seen were two horses grazing his eyes had simply failed him horses moved differently when they were hobbled earlier in his life his eyes would have detected the difference as it was they hadnt he should have had spectacles but it had never occurred to him that his vision had fallen off so he had always trusted his senses and had not expected any of them to fail him to reflect that a cheap pair of spectacles might have prevented the loss of his arm and his leg was bitter knowledge and he could not stop himself from brooding about it his eyes had cost him himself that was how he came to view it because of his untrustworthy eyes he had been reduced to what he was now a man with two crutches a man who could not mount a horse some days all the captain did was wait for teresa when she was with him he sometimes stopped thinking about his mistakes teresa would be outside with the goats and the chickens and would come back to him with news of their activities the old hen with the broken beak had caught a large lizard one of the little goats had stepped in a hole and a snake had bitten it now they were waiting to see if the kid would live or die rafael was upset and they listened to his moaning through calls little window do you think it will die teresa asked him she had brought him his coffee probably it will if it was small call said if it dies i hope it will see my mother teresa said she is with the dead my mother will take care of rafaels goat i expect she will call replied it was almost another month before captain call became strong enough to travel the rough wagon road to fort stockton pea eye was in a fever of impatience to get home to his children in all his years with the captain he had never known him to be sick of course he realized that being shot three times with a highpowered rifle would set a person back considerably he had been shot himself and knew what it was to feel poorly but he was so accustomed to seeing the captain well and hardy that it was difficult for him to accept the fact that call simply would not become hardy again pea eye asked lorena so often when she thought the captain would be ready to travel that she finally lost her temper stop asking me that she snapped you ask me that five or six times a day and ive been telling you five or six times a day that i dont know i dont have any idea when he can travel all you have to do is look at him to know hes not able yet when that will change i dont know i wont ask no more if i can help it honey pea eye replied meekly youd better help it lorena told him the thought of taking the old ruined man into her household worried her more and more teresa cared for him almost entirely call made it clear that he didnt welcome anyone elses help her boys were no respecters of others wishes though they had always been curious about captain call and they were not likely to be easily shut out they would have to build call a room of his own but where the money would come from lorena didnt know rafael had been more affected by marias death than the little girl seemed to be lorena had taken a liking to rafael and he to her every morning he would milk his goats and bring the milk in a little pot for lorena often she noticed rafael peeking into marias old room looking for his mother she would see him searching for her outside amid the goats and chickens and the few sheep sometimes he would search by the river where maria had gone to wash their clothes it made lorena sad to see the boy looking so forlornly for his mother he was a large boy but sweet his main problem was that he could not attend to himself very well he was always spilling things on his clothes or sitting down in puddles or forgetting to button his buttons in the mornings my mother isnt by the river teresa told lorena she is among the dead rafael doesnt understand where the dead live i dont understand that too well myself lorena said i know theyre somewhere you cant see them later she felt bad about the remark she had made it to a little girl who had never seen her mother i dream of my mother teresa said i dream she is with me and my rooster billy williams drove them to fort stockton when call was finally strong enough to make the trip billy knew a bartender in presidio who owned a wagon he didnt need he persuaded the bartender to lend it for the journey promising to bring it back loaded with cases of whiskey you ought to come with us to the panhandle pea eye told him he and billy had become fast friends during the period of calls convalescence come to the panhandle ill make a farmer out of you pea eye said nope i imagine id miss old mex billy replied gordo the butcher was annoyed when the wagon pulled away lorena had allowed rafael to bring two goats teresa had her rooster and three hens gordo didnt care how many goats and chickens the gringos took away he was annoyed because they took the little blind girl she was almost as pretty as her mother had been and soon she would be old enough to marry of course she was blind she might be a poor housekeeper and she might not cook well but he could cook for himself and cooking and housekeeping were not the only things to consider the butcher thought he might have liked to marry the girl if the gringos hadnt taken her away call hardly spoke during the wagon ride to fort stockton he held on to the side of the wagon with his one hand the bullet in his chest still pained him and it pained him even more when he was jostled as he was when they crossed the many gullies along the way now and then they met travelers cowboys mostly call dreaded such meetings he dreaded being seen at all fortunately though the travelers werent much interested in him they were far more interested in pea eye his victory over joey garza was the biggest thing to happen on the border since the mexican war and none of the cowboys were old enough to remember the mexican war pea eye felt embarrassed by all the attention he was getting what made his embarrassment even worse was that he was getting that attention right in front of the captain pea eye had always been just a corporalit was the captain who had killed mox mox and six of his men he didnt feel right being a hero not with the captain sitting right there in the same wagon the captain didnt seem to mind though he didnt even appear to be listening most of the time but pea eye was still embarrassed mox mox was worse than joey pea eye told lorena yes he was worse lorena agreed she started to tell her husband that she had been mox moxs captive but she caught herself that had happened before pea eye was her husband he didnt need to know about it they rolled into fort stockton beside the railroad when they came to the dusty oneroom station they saw a private car sitting by itself on the track i wonder what swell came in that lorena said they soon found out the stationmaster emerged from the little building with a short whitehaired man with a curling mustache and a quick restless walk the two came right out to meet the wagon though by the time they got there the whitehaired man was twenty yards in front of the stationmaster im colonel terry ive come to look for brookshirewhy aint he with you the whitehaired man said to pea eye he started with you i know that much because i ordered him to colonel terry said before pea eye could think of a nice way to inform him that mr brookshire was dead it was a foolish order call said the colonels manner irritated him lately call had used his voice so seldom that what he said came out raspy whats that who are you sir the colonel asked im woodrow call the captain replied your mans dead mrs parker brought the body out at considerable risk to herself mr brookshires at an undertakers in presidio well his sisters been raising hell trying to get us to find himso much hell that i came here myself the colonel said did the man do his duty i reckon he did pea eye said i wouldnt be here driving this wagon if he hadnt bought that big shotgun if he did his duty then his sister will get the pension the colonel told them it was a foolish order call repeated brookshire was no fighting man and he should not have been sent to chase bandits he looked at the colonel and noticed a detail that had escaped him at first the colonels empty right sleeve was pinned neatly to his coat now hold on calli sent brookshire to keep the accounts colonel terry said you were the man sent to catch the bandit and from the looks of you you made a botch of it pea eye nearly dropped the reins never in his life had he heard anyone speak so bluntly to the captain to his amazement captain call smiled thats accurate call said i made a botch of it but mr parker is an able man and he finished the job for you grateful colonel terry said glancing up at pea eye briefly his custom did not run to extended compliments if brookshire did his job wheres the ledgers he asked call didnt answer and pea eye wasnt too sure what the colonel was referring to oh them big account books he said finally we used them to start fires back when it was so cold we was in a country where there wasnt no kindling and very little brush call looked over the side of the wagon at colonel terry he recalled that after brookshires first little panic at the amarillo station the man had been an uncomplaining companion he did not intend to let the colonel abuse him whered you lose your arm call asked him first manassas colonel terry said he looked into the wagon and saw that call had lost not only an arm but a leg as well he had been about to rethink the matter of the pension an accountant who burned the account books because of a little weather was not doing his job in the colonels view at least he wasnt doing it well enough that his family could simply expect to get his pension but captain call was a frosty sort it was known that he had killed the manburner mox mox another sizable threat to the security of paying customers colonel terry seldom paused for anyone but captain call had a distinguished record and it seemed he felt strongly about brookshire it was not the moment to harp on pensions paid or unpd the colonel decided brookshires sister lives in avon connecticut the colonel told them he remembered that the garza menace had been ended and the primary goal had been accomplished perhaps brookshire had been some help the pension was a modest one anyway enough to keep a widow or an old maid sister if the widow or the old maid was frugal well without those ledgers it will be damn hard to get the books to balance he said annoyed as he always was by irregularities in regard to the accounting he surveyed the group in the wagon there was call minus an arm and a leg there was mr parker and a handsome blond womanvery handsome he decided upon taking a second look then there was a greasy old fellow in buckskins and a mexican boy with shaggy hair and eyes somewhat like a sheeps there was a pretty little girl who appeared to be blind plus a bit of a menagerie two goats three hens and a rooster colonel sheridan terrysherry terry as he was known in the military because of his thirst for sherries and portshad an abrupt shift of mood it seemed to him that the people in the wagon had had too much hard travel and all of them looked dirty and all of them looked tired he gave the blond woman the smile that had won miss coras heart and the hearts of not a few others too the blond woman was a beauty if she had a wash she might look better than cora the truth was he had begun to grow a little tired of cora you people look like you need a wash he said i expect youve come a fair ways in that old wagon ill make my bath available of course youre welcome to go first maamyou and the young lady lorena had not been paying much attention to the palaver she was too tired she ached from her heels to her ears for the jolting had been continuous for almost two hundred miles the colonels speech was brusque but then most mens speech was brusque she had been half asleep when she heard the colonel offer his bath every time the wagon stopped jolting for even five minutes lorena was apt to go into a doze she had never been in a private railroad car before much less had a bath in one from the outside the car looked pretty fancyshe wished tessie could see it pea eye had taken to calling teresa tessie and soon they all were doing itthe captain too at least teresa could feel the warm water and enjoy the bath though my name is lorena parker and the young ladys name is teresa lorena said i cant think of anything wed be more grateful for than a bath come along thenits just a step colonel terry said he reached up a hand the left one the one that had been spared lorena took it and stepped down then she helped teresa out of the wagon and the two of them followed the colonel his manner had changed but not his gait he was soon twenty yards ahead of lorena and teresa the stationmaster walked with the womenfolk at a more moderate pace you reckon all yankees walk that fast he asked billy williams loaded the wagon with whiskey and started back for ojinaga the next day i aint been gone but a week and i already miss old mex he said i still wish youd come home with us and try farming pea eye said why lorena asked you dont even like farming yourself if you dont like it why would you think other people ought to do it pea eye didnt know what had prompted his invitation he thought it might have had something to do with the fact that billy williams was a bachelor hes by himself he told his wife wed be company for him youd be a bachelor yourself if i wasnt bold lorena reminded him colonel terrys generous mood lasted several days he insisted that they all ride back to san antonio as his guests he arranged a separate passenger car just for them and the goats and the chickens the more he saw of lorena the more he realized how tired he was of cora just as they were leaving for san antonio the colonel changed his mind and took them to laredo instead he needed to see the governor of coahuila and the errand couldnt wait i think mexicos the coming place he told call theyve got minerals all they need is railroads did it take you long to learn to get by without your arm call asked he didnt have much patience with terry but he did have some curiosity about the lost arm the colonel seemed to function briskly without it of course he owned a railroad and kept a servant with him to help him dress still call suspected the colonel was the sort who would function briskly servant or no servant it took me five years colonel terry said fortunately the war was on and the war took my mind off it my orderly did most of the work but i did all the thinking you cant worry too much about one arm when theres a war going on call said nothing he didnt feel brisk and didnt expect to the detour to laredo didnt bother him though it did bother pea eye and lorena they wanted to get home to their children but he himself had a little business to attend to in laredo he wanted to find bolivar and see if he was well enough to come with them to the panhandle he could not simply leave the old man with the mexican familythey were too poor and he had promised them he would come back and get bolivar when he could in laredo he asked pea eye to hire a buggy pea lifted him into it and they crossed the river into mexico call had some difficulty remembering just where he had left bolivar but by making inquiries they finally found the little house the woman he had left bolivar with could not conceal her shock when she saw how the captain looked he was gray and he seemed so old oh senor call she said bolivar died he died the day you brought himthe day you left to go up the river well ill swear call said he had brought some money he paid the woman well but he didnt say a word as pea eye drove him back across the rio grande he seemed to sink into himself so deeply that pea eye didnt even try to make conversation he concentrated on driving the buggy thats about the last of them call said in a whisper as they were driving through laredo the last captain pea eye asked the last of the hat creek boys call said well captain theres me pea eye mumbled as soon as colonel terry left for saltillo to pay his business call on the governor of coahuila lorena went directly to the telegraph office and sent two wiresone to clara allen in nebraska and the other to charles goodnight she asked clara to send her children home when it was convenient and she asked charles goodnight if he would loan her enough money for rail passage for three adults and two children from laredo to quanah she wanted to ask mr goodnight if he could possibly send a wagon and a cowhand to get them home from quanah but in the end she didnt make that request if they could just get to quanah they could scare up a wagon for themselves someone would get them home it was the money for the tickets she needed most she hadnt a cent and neither did pea eye the captain had given most of his money to a mexican woman the one who had kept bolivar in any case lorena didnt want to borrow from call she was willing to take care of him but she didnt want to be dependent on him for money she didnt intend to be in laredo when colonel terry returned from mexico either when the colonel had offered to let lorena and teresa use his big brass bathtub he had been courteous and had visited a saloon while they took their baths but on the long trip to laredo the colonel had begun to find reasons to invite lorena into his private car he had discovered that she was a teacher and no doubt liked to read he had quite a few books in his private car he had a man in new york who kept him supplied for occasions when he traveled with lady guests now and then he even liked to leaf through a book himself he had the latest novels and such and he felt sure he had some that lorena might enjoy lorena would have liked a book but she didnt want to go back to the colonels private car the colonel visited them in their car several times a day and he never missed an opportunity to compliment her to pat her to lean too close to breathe on her neck or to look her hard in the eye lorena surrounded herself with children she sat between teresa and rafael but the colonel still patted her leaned over her looked at her lorena put her arm around teresa when the colonel was in the car the one advantage to being blind is that shell never see mens looks lorena thought pea eye found it surprising that the colonel would be so friendly from hearing brookshire talk about him he would not have supposed that the colonel would be friendly at all he even had his servant bring them food from time to time giving them a whole car to themselves was plenty generous pea eye thought he mentioned it to lorena but lorena didnt say a word just before they got to laredo lorena was walking back to the dining car she was on her way to beg a little stale bread for teresas chickens when colonel terry suddenly popped out of a sleeping compartment he didnt say a wordhe just grabbed lorenas arm and tried to pull her into the compartment lorena dropped the bread plate and it broke the colonel was strong if he had had two hands lorena would have had a hard struggle the colonel wasnt expecting a struggle of any sort though he supposed lorena might fuss a little as cora sometimes did but what did that amount to women would fuss a little it was part of the game now missy he said but the next moment his hand was pouring blood lorena had picked up a piece of the broken plate and had slashed him with it across the top of his hand the colonel let go his hold blood was streaming from the wound she had cut him deep and from the way she was holding the shard of plate she would be capable of cutting him again why you hellion he barked you cut my hand you see that onelegged man in the next car lorena asked him you see captain call i cut his leg off myself with a bowie knife ill be glad to do the same for your one hand if you ever try to be familiar with me again colonel the colonel looked scared men usually did if you hurt them a little ive got to see the governor of coahuila tomorrow the colonel said in a shocked voice what am i going to do about this hand cant you bandage me maam im pouring blood all over the floor youre lucky it wasnt your throat lorena said one of these days if im not left alone im going to cut a mans throat i expect colonel terry felt a little faint cora might fuss but she never cut him when lorena went past him he drew back which was wise if he had touched her again lorena felt she might have cut him worsefar worse than she had done already charles goodnight wired the money and clara allen telegraphed that she was bringing the children home herself as soon as she could get a train lorena felt relieved she hoped clara would stay for a while clara was the one person she could let herself rest with when lorena came back with the tickets pea eye was startled the colonel had assured him that everything would be arranged he himself would be taking them home to the panhandle captain call hadnt spoken since coming back from nuevo laredo he seemed to have taken the news of bolivars death very hard pea eye was surprised at just how had the captain took the news when bolivar had worked for them the captain had usually been mad at him the way pea eye remembered it bolivar was given to clanging the dinner bell with his broken crowbar whether it was mealtime or not the captain hadnt liked it either but now he was so sunken that even tessie couldnt get him to speak the colonels due back tomorrow pea eye reminded lorena hes going to be right surprised when he finds out we left ahead of him were going todaydont lose the tickets lorena said handing them to him colonel terry turned red with anger when he returned from coahuila and discovered that lorena and her party had left ahead of him what was a little cut on the hand it was only a start womens anger sometimes led to better things who let them go was it you goddamn you the colonel said glaring at the elderly stationmaster why colonel they had tickets the stationmaster told him people with tickets can get on the train its just a matter of having tickets damn the tickets and goddamn you youre fired get off my railroad colonel terry ordered in san antonio lorena stopped for a day to take teresa to an eye doctor the stationmaster in laredo had noticed that the little girl was blind and told lorena the name of a doctor in san antonio who could help people with poor vision his wifes sister was shortsighted and had gone to him and got some fine spectacles before that she had been prone to mixing up the sugar and the salt her husband his brotherinlaw had been about to leave her for it the eye doctor was a very old man his name was lee no kin to the general he told lorena he boiled his instruments for a long time before examining teresa people think im kin to the general but im no kin to the general he said again while waiting for the instruments to cool teresa held her roosterthe old doctor had allowed it why sure whats the harm in a rooster unless he pecks he said when he was through dr lee took lorena aside and told her that teresa was incurably blind lorena went back to the train with a heavy heart but teresa had her rooster and she seemed happy north of fort worth there was a delay an old man had been crossing the tracks with a wagonful of pigs the old man was deaf and he didnt hear the train coming the wreck killed the old man and scattered pigs everywhere one of the wagon wheels jammed under the locomotive along with a dead sow it took a long time to clear it in the railroad station in san antonio lorena had used a little of mr goodnights money to buy a book by mr hardy she read it while the train was stopped its about a girl called tess she told pea eye when he inquired i hope she wasnt blind like our tessie pea eye replied call looked out the window at the grasslands as the plains opened around them teresa whispered to him trying to get him to talk but he could not bring himself to speak at least not often there must have been a lot of rain that winter for the cover was abundant it would be a good year for the cattle herds the captain could not imagine what he was going to do in the years ahead he would have to live but without himself he felt he had left himself far away back down the weeks in the spot west of fort stockton where he had been wounded he had saddled up as he would have on any morning he had ridden off to check two horses as he would have on any morning as he had ridden on thousands of mornings throughout his life he had been himself a little stiff maybe his finger joints swollen but himself he scarcely heard the gunshots or felt the first bullet that bullet and the others hadnt killed him but they had removed him now there was a crack a kind of canyon between the woodrow call sitting with teresa on the train and the woodrow call who had made the campfire that morning and saddled his horse the crack was permanent the canyon deep he could not get across it back to himself his last moments as himself had been spent casuallymaking a campfire drinking coffee saddling a horse then the wounds split him off from that self that callhe could remember the person he had been but he could not become that person again he could never be that call again even if he had kept his arm and his leg he knew it would be much the same of course having the arm and the leg would have been a great convenience for he could earn a living if he had them he could be far less of a burden but even if he had kept the arm and leg he could not have returned to being the call who had made the campfire and saddled the horse the first bullet had removed him from that person that personthat callwas back down the weeks on the other side of the canyon of time there was no rejoining him and there never would be the train reached the little station at quanah after midnight teresa slept rafael had been moaning he was having bad dreams call could manage his crutches a little but he was very stiff from the long ride on the hard bench pea eye had to help him up charles goodnight stood on the platform clara allen stood there too when lorena looked out the window and saw clara her heart leapt claras here she said to pea eye well get to see our children oh my lord pea eye exclaimed lorena picked up teresa and kept rafael close to her side she didnt want to scare him he had the smaller of the goats in his arms helloweve got two more children now lorena said as she eased rafael down the steps what a pretty child clara said coming closer to look at teresa in the light from the station window you must have traveled hardyou got here quicker than us and we was in texas to begin with lorena said she freed an arm and hugged clara to her eye clara looked older and too thin even with pea eyes help captain call had difficulty getting down the steps with his crutches he was embarrassed that he had to be met and particularly by clara allen who had never liked him but she had traveled from nebraska to bring pea eye and lorena their children that was doing them a considerable favor he recognized pea youve got to go back and get the other goat and teresas chickens lorena said i dont know what tessie would do if we left that rooster on the train ill fetch the goat goodnight said he was glad to have something to help with the sight of woodrow call was a shock to him though he was no stranger to wounded men it was not so much the missing limbs as the look on the mans face that bothered him but it was shadowy on the platform perhaps in the daylight he wouldnt look so ruined im not much of a hand with fowl he said hello woodrow yes hello captain clara said ill get the chickens charlie why didnt he just die she asked goodnight when they were on the train goodnight had already picked up the goat but looked as if he didnt know quite what to do about the chickens i was never much of a hand with fowl he remarked again i told you id get the chickens clara said annoyed that he had simply ignored her question about call goodnight had happened to be in the station in amarillo when she and the children arrived from omaha clara remembered goodnight from her childhood for he had known her father well he had been in nebraska once and had bought ten horses from her she went over and said hello since they were going to be on the same train she thought he might be some help with the little ones but that proved a false hope not only was goodnight hard to make conversation with he was as scared of the children as if they had been wildcats clara picked the chickens up by their legs and carried them off the train the hens and the rooster were outragedteresa had never carried them upside down the hens began to squawk and the rooster to protest whats wrong with my chickens dont carry them that way give them to me teresa said she had realized from the sound that the chickens were upside down it was only when teresa reached for her chickens that clara realized the little girl was blind the five children were asleep in a heap on the floor in a corner of the station clarie had her arms around them all at the sight of his daughter holding her brothers and her sister pea eye broke down in his time of danger he had almost given up hope of seeing his children again yet there they were all alive all sleeping on the floor of a railroad station his big daughter was looking after them it was more than he deserved more even than he had hoped for and he began to cry teresas hens were still squawking even though she had set them down they were running around the station one brown hen jumped up on the stationmasters desk and scattered his papers here scatwho are you he said he was not used to such commotion at that hour usually no more than a cowboy or two got off the fort worth train oh pa clarie said when she awoke and saw her father ben got awake and hugged his father but waking up proved too much for georgie and august both yawned heavily and went back to sleep laurie the baby opened her eyes and started to cry she didnt know who the strange man was hugging clarie then her mother reached down and took her there was an old man standing near who had only sticks for legs laurie looked at him curiously as her mother hugged her goodnight had arranged for a cowboy to bring a wagon the cowboy arrived at sunup driving the wagon and leading two horses the boys were awake by then they chased the hens and played with the goats they took to rafael right away but were a little shy with teresa who held her rooster in her arms there must be a doctor somewhere who could help that girl see clara told lorena although she had just arrived in texas she was already beginning to dread the trip home by herself she had grown used to lorenas children and to having laughter and fusses in her house there had been life in her house again since her daughters left it seemed to her there had been no life in her house it was hard for her one aging woman to bring life to a home yet how she missed it goodnight mounted one of the horses the cowboy mounted the other pea eye took the reins of the team it was still all he could do to keep from bawling at the sight of his children and the familiar country many thanks for the loan of the wagon he said to mr goodnight youre welcome goodnight replied he had not quite mastered his shock at the change in woodrow call ill soon repay that loan lorena told him she had not told pea eye she had borrowed money she intended to discuss it with mr goodnight privately but there had not been a moment when she could speak to him alone she was a little worried about pea eyes reaction but pea eye let georgie sit on his lap and pretend to drive the teamhe didnt hear the remark about the loan were branding today goodnight said in fact were branding all this week when were done ill trot over and check on the bunch of you he tipped his hat to the two ladies and turned his horse he rode a few steps and then turned back to lorena mrs parker i hope youll be opening the school again he said ill be opening the school again mr goodnight lorena said to him ill be opening it again soon well ive got to git goodnight said he had not gotten around to firing muley the cook it was a matter that preyed on his mind as he and the cowboy loped away at first they put captain call in a little granary in the barn there was no other place for him the granary was fairly clean there had never been any grain in it because they had never been able to afford any and had so far failed to raise enough to store the house itself was so crowded that clara had to sleep in a hallway during her visit this hall is fine clara said i wont have these boys evicted from their bedroom for an old lady i bet they didnt sleep in a hall at your house lorena said my house is bigger clara admitted everyone was surprised at how quickly teresa learned her way around the farm she went to the barn every morning to take call coffee and bacon and she learned all the farm animals by sound she rarely stumbled ben fought with herhe wasnt prepared for another girl to be living with them it hadnt been in his plans teresa more than held her own in the fights though she was quicker in the head than ben and she confounded him with her retorts the doctor in san antonio said shed never see lorena told clara hes just one doctor clara said call didnt mind bunking in the granary excepting teresa who came to him often to bring him food or tell him her stories he didnt want to see people or be around them he had a kerosene lamp but rarely lit it there was hay in the barn he didnt want to take a chance at falling asleep knocking the lamp over and burning the barn down three old cowboys one of them a former ranger stopped by to see him in the first week they wanted to congratulate him on having rid the country of mox mox mainly though they just wanted to see him to talk about old times call was uncomfortable with the men and he let them do the talking he felt like an impostor he was no longer the man who had lived the old times he was no longer even the man who had killed mox mox that man was not the cripple who lived in a granary in a barn on the quitaque that man lived back somewhere in memory across a canyon across the pecos that man had been blown away as brookshire feared he would be on the plains of time the cowboys felt awkward the captain clearly did not want to see them they regretted coming and they left disquieted by what had happened to a man they had once regarded as invincible his branding done goodnight came he took a look at call and the granary and left three days later two wagons full of lumber arrived accompanied by six cowboys between sunup and sundown of the next day they built call a shack they had brought with them the few possessions he had left in the little line cabin on the palo duro it was just a shack but it was better than an oat bin pea eye helped with the work although he was a poor carpenter he soon hit himself with the hammer raising a blood blister that was so large and painful lorena had to eventually cut off the nail she was grateful to goodnight for the shack for she had felt bad about putting the captain in the barn but she worried about the debt ill pay you back mr goodnight she told him i expect itll be a while though but were good for it eventually i just dont know when id take up a collection for call but i suppose it would embarrass him goodnight said hes ruined now but there are plenty of people in this part of the country who would have been shot or scalped or robbed if not for him or their folks would have been if not them lorenas mind was on the debt in the back of her mind was the knowledge which she had not yet shared with pea that she was pregnant we intend to pay you back mr goodnight she said again firmly if mrs allen needs a ride to the depot and if youll get word to me ill send a cowboy with a buggy goodnight said sometimes if teresa urged him call would hobble to the house for his meals he and clara rarely spoke when the meal was finished it was teresa who got call his crutches and helped him from his chair if teresa was out of the room for five minutes call grew visibly anxious he would look around for her wheres tessie he would ask if teresa was absent too long aint tessie here teresa always walked with him holding him lightly by the arm as he went back to his shack hes formed an attachment clara said watching its an attachment to a female too yes lorena said he wouldnt last long without tessie clara sighed she knew she ought to be going home soon it was time to geld the foals and put the mares with stud yet she hated to leave lorenas loud lively household sleeping in a hall was better than sleeping in an empty house laurie would toddle out in the morning and cuddle with her sometimes little august would come asking for a story if august came georgie soon followed she would lay in a heap of children sometimes for an hour in nebraska august and georgie had slept in her bed the little girl usually slept with clarie in the hallway holding the bright little boy and the babbling girl clara daydreamed about changing her life she realized she had lost touch just from not touching her daughters had produced no grandchildren for her to hold or carry to bed it didnt seem to her that her own life had ever been entirely normal but at least during her years of child raising she had had people with her in her house and in her bedpeople to touch now that was lost lorenas children were the first humans she had held in her arms in years it was not good for from being lonely too long she had become resigned no beaux lorena asked one morning when they were sitting in the kitchen talking the children had all run outside with rafael to look for his goats one of them had strayed during the night lorenas children had become protective of rafael all of them she didnt harbor much hope for that particular goat though the coyotes were too numerous and too hungry no beaux clara admitted i expect its just as well im too set in my ways now i doubt theres a man alive who could put up with me even if there is such a man alive he probably doesnt live in nebraska clara added a little later lorena thought her old friend looked sad you probably run all the boys off she said you have to be gentle with menfolk you know they arent tough like us well i did scatter a few i guess clara said but that was years ago rafael stumbled back in crying the remains of the goat had been found the boys all wore long faces lorena hugged rafael and shushed him they were planning to acquire a few goats soon and rafael could look after them the day she was to leave for nebraska clara walked down to say farewell to call he was sitting with teresa outside his shack whittling a stick teresa liked to feel the smoothness of the wood of the sticks once call had whittled all the knots away he had smoothed her a number of little sticks to play with teresa touched them with her fingers and sometimes she held one to her cheek well im off to the depot i guess clara said i wanted to say goodbye woodrow call had been hoping clara would come by before she left there was something he wanted to ask her but he didnt want teresa to hear his question tessie would you go to the house and ask mrs parker if i could have some coffee he asked teresa i woke up with a headachecoffee usually helps teresa handed him back the little smoothed stick and started up the path to the house she was barefooted the day was warm she stepped on a grass burr and had to pause for a moment standing on one leg in order to remove it from her foot ive heard there were schools for the blind call said to clara do you know anything about them why no clara replied tessies the first blind person ive ever had in my life but i can inquire for you woodrow id appreciate it call said ive got a little money saved if theres a way teresa can get her education id like to help i believe shes bright youre right about thatshes bright clara told him if she goes away im sure well all miss her call said you most of all woodrow clara said call didnt answer but the look on his face said more than clara wanted to hear or see or know about one human missing another she shook his hand and turned toward the house a moment later she grew irritated unreasonably irritated she turned back on the path call lorena lorena she said loudly you dont have to call her mrs parker now the mans trying but he just rubs me the wrong way clara said when she marched into the kitchen lorena was washing a cut on georgies hand she wasnt paying much attention later though she remembered the remark she wondered what clara had meant by it and why she looked so angry when she came in the bounty on joey garza was never collected colonel terry sent a detective to look into the circumstances of his death and the detectives research revealed that the fatal shot the one that finished joey garza had been fired by a mexican butcher in ojinaga mexico besides that the butcher then claimed that joey garzas own mother had stabbed the young bandit and that joey had turned the knife on her and killed her depriving the village of its best midwife citing the careless loss of the ledger books which made it impossible to compute the costs of the expedition accurately the railroad halved brookshires pension what was left was sent to his widowed sister in avon connecticut the same sister received a long letter from a mrs p e parker of quitaque texas mrs parker assured the grieving sister that the last words mr parker had heard brookshire say were to remember his sister and send her his love call discovered that he had a gift for sharpening tools even with one hand it was a skill he more than mastered one day watching pea eye futilely trying to cut a piece of rawhide with a dull knife call reached out and took it from pea he had a whetstone and he soon had a good edge on the blade from then on pea eye and lorena brought whatever needed sharpening to the captain he sharpened scissors and shovel blades he sharpened axes and rasps and scythes and awls and planing blades he even improved the slicing edge on the plows in time the neighbors heard of calls skill and began to ride over with bushel baskets full of knives and hatchets for him to work on lorena insisted that he order a wooden leg they wrote off for catalogues finally call ordered oneto sharpen some of the larger tools properly he needed to be able to stand when the leg came call found that he had to whittle it a bit to secure a smooth fit he was shy about it at first no one but teresa could be with him when he put on his leg or took it off she learned to tuck his pants leg expertly she laughed at him if he stumbled but call did not mind the truth was the leg made a big difference now he could stand up and work all day clara allen promptly sent him some literature on schools for the blind the best one seemed to be in cincinnati call hadnt mentioned school to teresa yet the thought of sending her away was too sharp a pain but he did discuss the matter with lorena privately lorena was torn she had had another boy tommy and was pregnant yet again the house was overfull she and pea eye had paid mr goodnight back for the train fare she was still running the school by herself except for claries help with the math clarie was engaged to roy benson and would be leaving soon the farm was doing a little better but they still had almost no cash money lorenas concern when the school came up wasnt for teresa who had not only marias look but marias strength lorena wanted tessie to have an education and she wanted her to have a chance to support herself but captain call had no one but the girl he scarcely knew lorenas children he scarcely knew her or pea eye even he worked all day at his sharpening but except for teresa he had no one even looking at the captain unless he was with teresa was painful often when he was looking at teresa call had tears in his eyes but otherwise there was nothing in his eyeshe was an absence lorena feared he would die if teresa left lets wait one more year captain lorena told him lets wait one more year i expect thats best call said charles goodnight and a young cowboy named j d brown were out looking for a stray bull one day they finally found the bull on the quitaque dead it had managed to strangle itself with a coil of barbed wire now and again if he was in the vicinity goodnight stopped by to pay his respects to call and the parkers they found call standing in his workroom in the barn sharpening a sickle that a farmer from silverton had nicked badly while cutting hay the blind girl was rounding up her chickens there must have been fifty chickens at least and there were also more goats than goodnight was accustomed to seeing anywhere they visited a minute or tried to call scarcely looked up from his work he had several hatchets and an axe in a bucket beside him that he needed to sharpen once he finished with the sickle pea eye was out plowing but goodnight and j d brown took a glass of buttermilk with lorena before they left lorena was heavy with child she paid goodnight twenty dollars against her debt on the shack he had built for call on the ride back across the gray plains the young cowboyhe was just twentylooked rather despondent goodnight ignored his despondence for a while then got tired of it what did a healthy sprout of twenty have to be despondent about whats made you look so peaked jd goodnight inquired why its captain call i guess the young cowboy said he was glad to talk about it to get his dark feelings out what about captain call goodnight asked why wasnt he a great ranger the boy asked ive always heard he was the greatest ranger of all yes he had exceptional determination goodnight told him well but now look whats he doing sharpening sickles in a dern barn jd exclaimed goodnight was silent for a bit he wished his young cowboys would keep their minds on the stock and not be worrying so about things they couldnt change woodrow call had his time he said finally it was a long time too lifes but a knife edge anyway sooner or later people slip and get cut well you aint slipped j d brown said how would you know son goodnight said in the fall of the following year clara allen was pawed to death by a piebald stallion named marbles everyone was scared of the stallion except clara marbles a beautiful animal was her special pride on the morning of the attack three cowboys including chollo her old vaquero the most experienced man on the ranch had urged her not to go into the pen with the stud hes mad today wait chollo told her hes my horsehe wont hurt me clara said shutting the gate behind her the stallion attacked her at once four men leapt into the corral but could not drive him off they didnt want to shoot the stallion for clara would never forgive them for it if she lived finally they shot the horse anyway but clara allen was dead before they could carry her out of the pen its risky raising studs call said she must have been good with horses or she wouldnt have lasted this long lorena shut herself in her room when she heard the news she didnt come out all day but then the day passed and dusk fell lorena still wouldnt come out pea eye knocked on the door just a little knock leave me alone lorena said in a raw voice sadly pea eye turned back down the hall pea lorena said through the door what honey pea eye asked feeling a little hopeful feed the children lorena said later when it was bedtime pea eye knocked his little knock on the bedroom door again leave me alone pea lorena said just leave me alone but wherell i sleep pea eye asked i dont know wherever you drop i guess lorena told him at a loss and worried pea eye put the children to bed and walked down to the captains little shack tessie was sitting in the captains rocking chair asleep the captain sat on his bed his leg off sharpening his pocketknife on a small whetstone lories taking it hard about clara pea said well thats to be expectedclara took her in call said there was only one rocking chair after a minute pea eye sat on the floor he thought he might go sleep in the oat bin since the captain was no longer using it he thought he might go after a while but he was used to his wife and his bed he wasnt ready for the oat bin not quite do you ever think of brookshire captain pea eye asked i rarely do call said its funny i got to liking him just before he was killed pea said he wasnt a bad fellow you know teresa woke up gave the captain a goodnight kiss on the cheek and went to the house to go to bed when she left the captain made it clear that it was time for him to retire so pea eye picked himself up and went off to the barn there were several mice in the oat bin and a small snake but pea eye soon chased them out he had nothing to sleep on so he went to the saddle shed and pulled out a couple of old saddle blankets which he wrapped up in as best he could sometime deep in the night he heard the door to the oat bin creak lorena came in and bent over him she held a lantern im bettercome on back honey she said pea eye felt itchy the saddle blankets had been covered with horsehair as was only natural now he was covered with horsehair too which wasnt so natural at least lorena wouldnt be likely to think it natural particularly on a day when she was in a bad mood anyway he had horsehair absolutely all over him a fact which made him more than a little nervous lorena was picky about their bed once she had lifted both her feet and kicked him straight off onto the floor because he had been cutting his toenails and had neglected to clean the clippings off the sheets to her satisfaction horsehair might offend her even worse than toenail clippings had but lorena was goinghe saw the lantern swinging as she left the barn pea eye got up rather stiffly and tried to brush as much of the horsehair off himself as he could in the dark he knew he was probably making a poor job of it but lorena was going he wanted to catch up pea eye shut the door of the oat bin to keep out mice and snakes and at moments nervous at moments relievedat least she had called him honeyhe followed his wife back to their house the end
