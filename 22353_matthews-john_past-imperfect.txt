john matthews past imperfect prologue provence june the three figures walked along the rough track alongside the wheat field two men and a boy of eleven the older of the men dominic fornier was in his late fifties a stocky figure just short of six foot with dark brown hair cropped short and almost totally grey at the sides another twenty metres ahead would be the best vantage point he thought his eyes scanning the broad expanse of the wheat field soft brown eyes with a faint slant at the corner a slant that somehow made them sharper knowing eyes perceptive eyes eyes that had seen too much the younger man stuart capel was an inch shorter and slim with light brown almost blonde hair midthirties the first faint worry lines showed more prominently as he squinted against the sun and the glare of the bleached white field dominic could see the slight resemblance between stuart and the young boy though the boys hair was a shade lighter and a few freckles showed across his nose and cheeks fresh faced happy but dominic could still sense the slight barrier a distance and detachment in the boys eyes that betrayed the pain and scars of the past months as they shuffled to a stop stuart asked so is this where it happened yes more or less dominic pointed about five metres ahead on the left stuart looked at the area of wheat and it told him nothing barely a foot high after being cut down to stubble in the early summer it was silent eerie no hint of the events which now brought them to this spot what had he expected he looked across at young eyes and a distant look that now he knew so well but there was no glimmer of recognition as usual little or nothing while the boy was awake probably now even the ghostly shadows finally faded from the edges of his dreams acceptance stuart wondered six months it seemed far longer as stuarts mind flicked through the nightmare odyssey which had finally led them here today and now the with the trial so much would hinge on the events of the next days and weeks is that what hed hoped for by asking dominic fornier to bring them out here a final closing of the book a laying to rest of the ghosts in both their minds to the right of the lane were pine trees and thick bushes clinging to an embankment which dipped down towards the small river tributary thirty yards away stuart could hear its faint babbling above the gentle wind that played across the field he reminded himself that whatever pain and anguish hed felt for dominic fornier it must have been much worse the case had plagued fornier for over thirty years from a young gendarme to a chief inspector from a provincial case to now one of the largest and most intriguing in french legal history the trial of the decadele monde had apparently headlined it and equally it had ripped apart forniers own family life dominic lifted his eyes from the field and into the distance towards the village of taragnon blood patches dried brown against the bleached sheaves the small face swollen and disfigured dominic shuddered the images were still stark and horrific all these years later the field and the view had remained constant thought dominic but everything else had changed everything how many times had he stood in this same field the past thirty years searching for clues and the missing pieces of his own life one and the same the last time hed visited in the spring just past hed cried cried for the lost years cried for the family and loved ones long departed cried for his own and taragnons lost innocence one and the same cried and cried until there was nothing left inside for a moment he thought he could hear the goats bells again but as he strained his hearing above the soft sway of the wind across the field he realized that it was the distant church bells of bauriac calling morning prayers the many services through the years christenings marriages funerals dominic bit his lip he could feel the tears welling again with the memories and turned slightly from stuart and the boy as he scanned the silent panorama of fields and the rich green provence hills beyond and as the pain of the images became too much he closed his eyes and muttered silently under his breath oh god please forgive me one california december fields of gold burnished wheat under the hot sun eyran could feel the warm rush of air against his body as he ran through the sheaves thrilling to the feeling of speed as they passed in a blur springing back and lashing lightly at his legs and thighs it was england he knew instinctively even though there were no guideposts in the dream from which he could be sure the field where he used to play back in england was on a hill a slow incline which led down to a small copse of trees with some of his favourite hiding places another wheat field rose beyond linking in turn to fields of cabbages maize and barley a colourful and lazy patchwork of green and gold stretching towards the horizon but the field in the dream was flat and eyran found himself running through frantically looking for those all so familiar landmarks the hollowed tree in the copse where he had built a camp the small brook that ran into the copse from broadhurst farm where sarah was on some days with her labrador the field stretching out before him remained obstinately flat no matter how fast he ran and how many sheaves he pushed past the line of the blue horizon above the gold stayed the same though he knew somehow that if he kept running the scene would change he would see that all so familiar incline towards the copse and he picked up the pace a tireless energy driving him on the contours changed suddenly he could see what looked like the brow of a hill just ahead but the position of the sun was also different shining straight into his eyes and moving closer closer blotting out the hill ahead then the horizon fading the golden wheat to stark white and searing his eyes as it became one blinding blanket of brightness eyran awoke abruptly as the light hurt his eyes looking from the car window he could see the car lights shining at them from one side start to swing away taking a left at the four way junction he didnt recognize any landmarks though he knew they must have driven some way since leaving their friends in ventura he heard his father jeremy mutter something about the junction they should take for joining highway for oceanside and san diego then the crinkling of paper as his mother in the front passenger seat tried vainly to unfold a large map to the right place they slowed slightly as his father looked over intermittently at the map is it junction for anaheim and santa ana can you see jeremy asked maybe i should stop maybe you should im no good with these things allison half turned towards the back seat i think eyran is awake in any case hes got school tomorrow it would be good if he slept some more allison turned and gently stroked eyrans brow eyran slowly closed his eyes again under the soothing touch but as his mothers hand moved away and he realized she was looking ahead again his eyes instinctively opened to stare at the back of her head focusing on her golden blonde hair until it became almost a blur willing himself back into the warmth of the wheat field and the dream allison noticed jeremy gripping the steering wheel hard as he talked about a problem case at work his eyes blinked as they adjusted to the fast dying dusk light signs now for carlsbad and escondido she stole a glance back at eyran he was asleep again but she saw now that his brow was sweating the neck of his shirt damp she pulled the blanket covering him lower down to his waist early december and the weather was still mild temperatures in the late sixties early seventies two weeks to school breaking up with the trip to england to see stuart and amanda only days after part of her mind was already planning how many days she should arrange for helena to visit during their three weeks away fresh food left in the fridge clothes packing what woollens and coats to take we should be back within an hour jeremy said shall i give helena a call on my mobile up to you shes preparing something but thats only going to make us forty minutes earlier than we said jeremy looked over as a large double trailer truck sped by and checked his speed mph the truck must be touching seventy he shook his head briefly he didnt notice the motorbike change lanes without warning ahead of the truck nor the sudden swerve the driver made in the cabin to miss the bike the first thing he noticed was the lazy snake like undulation at the back of the trailer twisting abruptly at an angle and into a jackknife which finally pulled it away from the cabin there was a suspended moment as it happened as if in one blink everything was still the road the trees the roadside signs and hoardings the grey dusk sky the landscape rolling past suddenly frozen and then in the next blink the trailer was rushing towards him jeremy braked hard and turned the wheel sharply away but the suddenness with which the trailer flew at them made him gasp out loud oh jeez he braked harder wrenching the wheel frantically away from the large grey steel block floated inexorably upon them filling the windscreen and his view as it scythed through the front of the jeep he heard allison scream as the jeep tilted sharply with the impact and felt something jam hard into his stomach and ribs pushing the air from his body as the windscreen exploded and shards of glass flew past them like blizzard snowdrops numbness more than pain hit him as the engine block was shunted back severing his right leg just below the knee joint and the first two rolls of the jeep became a spinning confusion of sky road grass verge then darkness he remembered awaking once later he could hear voices though they were muffled and indistinct when he tried to focus the people seemed to be far away though he could see clearly the arm of a man leaning over and touching his body he found it hard to breathe as if he was gargling and choking on warm water and a jarring pain gripped his stomach and one leg he must have lay there for some while at times almost succumbing to the welcome release of the darkness but knowing somehow that the pain was his only tangible link with consciousness and life he mouthed the word eyran but the man by his side didnt respond nor could jeremy in fact hear his own voice as finally they lifted his body the lights twisting and spinning briefly to one side and away the voices faded and he drifted back into the darkness stuart capel looked at his watch pm pm in california when he tried his brother jeremys number earlier it was on the answerphone so hed made a note to call again in the afternoon only two or three weeks to go and so much to plan he hadnt seen jeremy and his family for almost two years he had ten days off work over christmas while they were over but the problem was he couldnt remember if it was the th or rd when they arrived all so precise jeremy phoning him almost a month ago going painstakingly through flight numbers dates and times somehow hed ended up with the flight number and the time on his phone pad but not the date the problem was the same flight number left at the same time each week if he had to ask jeremy again it would probably provoke a comment a short snub that said it all im organized and youre not im successful because i plan carefully youve suffered in business because you dont all so precise jeremy each step of his life carefully mapped out and planned from university at cambridge through london chambers then retaking exams in the us and six months in boston as a stepping stone to a san diego law firm stuarts life and career had been in almost complete contrast a massive rise in the eighties in design work for print media then the slump two partnership break ups followed and he was almost bust by the late eighties only crawling his way out the last few years methodical planning had never worked for stuart and nearly all of his arguments with jeremy revolved around the same thing jeremy trying to suggest some well staged plan stuart telling him at every turn why it wouldnt work what would probably arise to fuck it up and finally theyd reach the subject of eyran stuart would strike back by complaining that jeremy was trying to structure eyrans life too carefully the boy was being stifled he sensed a kindred spirit in eyran that was somehow lost on jeremy a curiosity and thirst for life that jeremy so often quelled by trying to map out his sons life to finite extremes jeremy loved eyran but had little grasp how important it was to allow the child some freedom some choice the last get together almost two years ago stuart had taken his family out to california hed put his foot in it by mentioning some of eyrans old friends in england could eyran write them a postcard or perhaps get them a small memento from san diego zoo jeremy had shot him a dark look then explained later that theyd had problems with eyran being homesick and missing his english friends only in the last six months had he settled in more and not mentioned them later in the same holiday jeremy had poured cold water on stuarts plans to expand into multimedia production and theyd had more words of course there were risks stuart explained anything that depended on creative input market forces and an unpredictable general public was a risk as usual jeremy was blinkered stuart might as well try and explain picasso to a plumber stuart made a mental note eyrans friends in england advice about eyrans upbringing and future current business activities which might be viewed as risky any other no go areas for his conversation with jeremy he made the call again but it was helena the visiting mexican maid telling him that they were away hup state till later tonight about nine oclock you want i ask them to call you when they get back no its okay ill set an alarm call early and phone them back he arranged the call for am pm california time one finger tapped at the receiver for a second after putting it back fleeting unease he pushed it as quickly away told himself it was just his nerves settling back from steeling for possible confrontation with jeremy dr martin holman at thirtyfour the youngest of oceansides three head er consultants heard the babble and commotion of voices a second before the emergency doors swung open he was aware of two gurneys heading to different parts of the room and then his attention fell on the young boy what have we got accident victim ten years old head injuries but the chests the most severe two cracked ribs possibly a fractured sternum as well the paramedic spat the words out breathlessly as they wheeled the gurney rapidly towards a bed conscious at any time holman asked no hes been out since we loaded him breathing blocked so tracheal respirator plasma to keep up the volume the normal but still his blood pressure and pulse dropped the last few minutes in the ambulance last pulse reading was fortyeight okay lets get him up and attached one two they lifted the boy in unison onto the bed holman called over two nurses and a junior doctor garvin to attach the monitors pulse respiration central venous and arterial pressure within a minute the readings and a steady pulse bleep were there for holman but he was immediately alarmed blood pressure over and pulse only and dropping something was wrong seriously wrong more plasma infusion holman snapped at garvin do we know blood type o positive holman instructed a nurse to arrange a supply for transfusion then looked back to the boy the pulse stayed stable at for a few seconds with the increased plasma then dropped another notch holman began to panic by the early s it was all over the boy was dying he scanned rapidly the chest bandaged and blood soaked the face and head bruised with heavy contusions looking for telltale signs blood loss was heavy but the plasma infusion should have compensated he moved around feeling the boys skull shining a penlight into the eyes no responsiveness there was probably internal damage but no alarming swelling to cause the current problem thirty six garvin called out with alarm then holman noticed the unevenness of the boys chest one part of his lungs wasnt expanding possibly a broken rib puncturing one lung he nodded urgently at the remaining nurse trochal cannula set up a plural drainage holman cut through the chest bandages and then slowly inserted the cannula a hollow metal pipe with a cutting edge between eyrans ribs and into his left lung he then fed a thin plastic pipe through the cannula and at his signal the nurse activated the pump it started sucking out blood from the flooded lung garvin announced thirty four and holman muttered under his breath come on come on it had been a good day so far mostly only minor injuries hed been hoping to finish his shift unscathed at midnight dont die on me now holman looked anxiously between the cannula pipe and the pump it was a race against time hoping that enough blood could be pumped from the lungs to restore blood pressure and respiration before the pulse dipped too low but when blood pressure fell to over and garvin announced pulse at then after only a few seconds gap holman realized with rising panic that it was a race he was losing garvins shout of brady cardia and the boy lapsing into cardiac arrest came almost immediately after the pulse became a flatline beep holman had already signalled the nurse and now prompted urgently defrib garvin put the electroshock pads into position but holman held up one hand counting off the seconds six seven it was a calculated gamble holman knew that as soon as the heart started again fresh blood would be pumped into the lungs each extra second gave him more chance of clearing the lungs and stabilization ten eleven garvin looked at him anxiously the flatline beep sounding ominously in the background thirteen fourteen okay clear holman stepped back as garvin hit the charge the shock jolted the boys small body dramatically but there was nothing the flatline pulse still beeped nineteen holmans jaw set tight frantic now that he might have mistimed it left the defrib too long twentyone seconds now the heart had been stopped he leant across put one hand firmly on the boys chest and started massaging it was thick with blood and with the cracked ribs and sternum holman feared he couldnt apply the pressure hed have liked twentyeight twentynine still nothing the beep a persistent infuriating reminder he didnt need to look up he leapt back signalling garvin hit it again another shock and jolt but with still no pulse signal holman feared the worst he leant back over for another massage his hands now slippery with blood on the small frail chest trying to feel deep with each push down silently willing back a spark of life beads of sweat massed on his forehead only minutes since the boy had been wheeled in and his nerves were gone fighting now to control the trembling in his hands to hold the massage rhythm fortythree fortyfour if he lost the boy now he doubted he could face another patient the rest of his shift but already he knew there was little hope one more defrib and then that was it by then the boy would have been dead almost a full minute fields of wheat swaying gently in the breeze the incline changed suddenly without warning eyran could see the small copse of woods at the end of the field and ran down the hill towards it excitement growing as he got closer inside the copse it was dark and damp the air cooler he looked for familiar landmarks that would lead him towards the brook picking his way through the darkness at one point he thought he was lost then suddenly the brook appeared ahead from behind a group of trees he felt uncertain at first he couldnt remember the brook being in that place before as he got closer he could see a small figure hunched over the brook looking into the water he thought it might be sarah but there was no dog in sight the figure slowly looked up at him and it took a second for recognition to dawn daniel fletcher a young boy from his old school in england who he hadnt seen for years he asked what daniel was doing there it wasnt the normal place he played and daniel muttered something about it being peaceful i know eyran agreed thats why i come here its so quiet sarah comes down here with her dog sometimes as well then he remembered that daniel lived almost two miles beyond broadhurst farm it must have taken you ages to get here do your parents know youre here no they dont but it doesnt matter i havent seen them in years in years very funny though eyran could see that daniel wasnt smiling he was looking soulfully back into the water and some small quirk told him that something was wrong that all of this wasnt real it was a dream then he recalled with a jolt what it was daniel had suffered with acute asthma hed died at the age of six after a severe bronchitis attack over a year before eyran left for california he remembered now the service of the school chaplain the whole school tearful and how all the boys who had picked on daniel for his frailty had felt suddenly guilty he could see daniels pigeon chest struggling for breath hear the faint wheezing eyran was startled by a rustling among the trees preparing himself to turn and run before seeing that it was his father walking through he felt nervous because hed never seen his father down by the copse before he knew instinctively that he must be late returning home or have done something wrong and mouthed im sorry almost as a stock reaction his father looked thoughtfully down at daniel before waving his arm towards eyran you must go home now eyran you dont belong here eyran started to move away then realized his father wasnt following he was staying by daniel at the side of the brook arent you coming with me now daddy his father shook his head slowly his eyes sad and distant and eyran looked out of the copse to find that now it had become dark outside the darkness was a solid black blanket the wheat field seeming to stretch endlessly into the distance as before with no hills and contours which he recognized but i could get lost he pleaded just before his father turned and disappeared back into the darkness of the woods eyran started to tremble and cry he sensed that he must do as his father said and try to find his way back home though he was struggling desperately at the same time to understand why his father had deserted him to fight back through the darkness on his own if he could just get back home he knew that all would be well but the darkness of the field was deep and impenetrable with no familiar landmarks two provence august alain duclos saw the boy a few hundred yards ahead walking at the side of the road his figure emerged like a mirage from the faint shimmer of the august heat haze at first duclos wasnt going to stop but there was something about the boys tired posture and profile that made him slow down as he drew close taking in the boys curly hair and olive skin the sweat on his brow and his flustered expression he decided to stop the boy was obviously tired and something was troubling him the side window had been wound down because of the heat duclos leant across as he pulled over can i give you a lift somewhere the boy was hesitant and looked back towards the far ridge of the fields for a second no no thank you its okay duclos guessed his age at no more than ten or eleven he couldnt help noticing how beautiful the boys eyes were green with small flecks of hazel in contrast to his deep olive skin tone the eyes betrayed the boys anxiety are you sure duclos pressed you look as if youve lost somebody the boy looked back towards the ridge again my bike broke down back there just beyond the field i was walking to my friends house stephan his father has a tractor with a trailer to pick it up how far is it to stephans house four or five kilometres its the other side of the village but its okay ive done the walk before duclos nodded knowingly and smiled pushing the door ajar come on youre tired and its hot ill run you there its too far for you to walk the boy returned the smile hesitantly for the first time he looked the length of duclos car the sudden excitement at the prospect of a ride in a sports car showing if youre sure its okay again the reassuring nod and smile as the boy got in duclos leant across to shut the door revved twice quickly as he checked the mirror and pulled out they both sat in silence for a moment as the car picked up speed duclos noticed the boy looking at the dashboard and leather seats then lifting up slightly to take in the sloping bonnet duclos answered his obvious curiosity its an alfa romeo giulietta sprint custom colour dark green i wanted one of the classic italian racing colours red or dark green but i thought the red was too loud ive had it just under two years like it the boy nodded enthusiastically now checking out the small back bench seat and view through the coupe rear window whats your name asked duclos christian christian rosselot duclos checked his watch pm hed made good time since leaving aixenprovence duclos knew now what had made him stop the boy reminded him of jahlep the young algerian boy his marseille pimp had found for him and had become a favourite on his last few visits except more beautiful the skin pallor wasnt as dark as jahleps and had a smoother tone like polished cane and his large green eyes with hazel flecks were striking beyond belief the boy was wearing shorts and he found himself looking over at the smooth copper of the boys legs theyd already gone a kilometre and a half duclos estimated when he noticed the roadside sign taragnon km the friends house wasnt far past the village there wouldnt be much time duclos glanced again at the boys legs his mouth felt suddenly dry he had to think of a device to get himself alone somewhere with the boy and quickly a few hundred yards ahead he saw a roadside farm track duclos slowed down and stopped just past it ive had a thought if we get to stephan and his fathers not there or for any reason cant help out its a wasted journey ive got some tools in the back ill run you back to the bike and if we cant fix it ill rope it into the boot and run you home with it where do you live almost three kilometres that way from where the bike is now christian pointed behind them and slightly to the east but its okay im sure they will be there stephans father is always working on the farm duclos shrugged the problem is if theyre not there youre going to be stuck he backed into the farm track checked briefly for traffic then turned out heading back the way theyd come just take control his instincts told him the boys protests werent strong look its no trouble in any case ive just remembered i should have picked up something at the patisserie back in varages so its not putting me out of my way duclos wondered if the boy was suspicious in the wake of his insistence the boy had finally nodded and smiled though hesitantly then hastily looked away through the side window it could have been his normal awkwardness with strangers or perhaps he was suspicious it was hard to tell either way duclos was now more concerned of passing anyone who might see them together after almost a kilometre a truck came towards them with a company name and marseille in large letters on the side with the height of the cab and the speed theyd passed each other duclos doubted the driver had paid them any particular attention for a moment he thought to himself just drop the boy off leave him alone continue on to salernes but the urge driving him on was now too strong a mixture of excitement curiosity anticipation the thrill of the unknown he found it impossible to resist theyd just passed the point where hed first picked up the boy is it far now duclos asked no just under a kilometre more its on a rough track between two farms the patchwork of green and gold pastures each side were faded with the summer heat after a long flat stretch the road curved and they were passing a peach orchard only part of which appeared to be harvested uneven grass patches grew between the trees on its far side christian lifted one arm to indicate the pathway turning in duclos could see that a hundred yards ahead the peach orchard verged into woodland the track then ran between the orchard and the woods and the grass was long and unkempt closest to the woods the boy was pointing to where hed left his bike just up there on the left where the grass is long i tried to hide it so it would be safe until i got back with the bumpiness of the track duclos had changed down to second those legs those eyes his pulse quickened with anticipation images of what was to come were already forming in his mind but at the same time he felt nervous and uncomfortable with jahlep it was always prearranged the young algerian boy a willing participant now he was facing the unknown he wasnt sure how to make the first move that first contact that would break the barrier once hed touched the boy and his intentions were obvious he knew it would be impossible just to stop there the only question then was whether he continued with consent or force duclos pulled the car over to the side of the track and followed the boy out only after a few paces and prompted by the boy pointing could duclos make out the bike lying flat among the tall grass what went wrong with it he enquired the back brake locked on the wheel thats why i couldnt move it duclos knelt down to examine the wheel moving it back and forth with difficulty against the locked brake the boy was only a foot to his side also kneeling and keenly inspecting duclos could smell the faint acid sweetness of the boys sweat mixed with the scent of grass and ripe peaches it was then that he noticed the graze and bruise on the boys thigh it was the chance hed been looking for he reached over and touched the graze gently stroking it that looks bad you should get some antiseptic on it and the bruise is going to be a real beauty in the morning did you get that when the bike broke down when the brake jammed the bike got thrown to the side the boy made a dramatic motion with one arm towards the grass my leg got trapped underneath he was so sweet thought duclos the eyes were hauntingly beautiful green limpid pools in which he could almost swim the boy had flinched at the initial touch but hadnt moved duclos continued stroking working slightly higher it was in that moment that duclos saw the change in the boys eyes the pupils dilated the eyes suddenly looked darker and more troubled the boy knew something was wrong as the boys body tensed to move duclos reached up and gripped his shorts tight theres no point in struggling youll only get hurt i dont really want to hurt you duclos voice was both soothing and menacing the motion was sudden christian let out a half scream half gasp as duclos yanked down his shorts and pushed him face down in the grass duclos gently stroked the boys back lifting his shirt higher and running his thumb up and down the ridge of his spine the boys sweat eased the motion and after a few strokes duclos lowered his stroking to the boys buttocks and the cleft in between duclos became quickly aroused the boys skin was so smooth he could feel the small body trembling beneath his touch though after a few moments it became more intense then finally verged into gentle quaking as the boy started sobbing duclos found the noise disturbing the mood was being spoilt be quiet for gods sake be quiet it will do no good the crying became more muted duclos took off his own clothes he tried to force in other thoughts to distract himself from the crying as he crouched over the boy jahlep was beckoning with one finger smiling back at him and urging on his increasingly urgent thrusts the algerian boys eyes were dancing with mischief and pleasure he could feel the sun hot on his back the sweat in the ridge of the boys back as he ran his hands slowly up and down duclos shook his head from side to side the wind through the nearby treetops momentarily drowned out all other sound and duclos felt himself sailing on a wave of pleasure jahleps brown eyes looked at him soulfully imploring willing him on to greater heights of pleasure but the green eyes of the boy beneath him suddenly superimposed sullen and haunted frightened pleading he shook his head again to shift the image but it stayed with him obstinately until his final moment of orgasm his strangled and guttural cry of pleasure lost among the wind rippling through the treetops it took him a moment afterwards to become orientated again hed pulled out and ejaculated on the ground and part of his weight was rested on the boys back his cheek against the bare skin suddenly sweaty sticky he rolled off in the aftermath he lay on his back and stared up at the sky he could still hear the boy gently crying though intermittently it merged with and was drowned out by the rustling of the wind they became one and the same duclos looked over there was a small trickle of blood running down the boys inner thigh he reached over and touched the boys back but felt him flinch sharply under the touch he wanted to say im sorry but it would sound so empty and futile now he knew that he would have to be stern to warn the boy off he sat up and gripped the boys shoulder tight look at me look at me duclos gripped tighter and shook the boy until he looked up the boys face was streaked with tears and he made a vain effort to wipe away a fresh tear with the back of one hand what happened today never happened you understand it never happened duclos looked at the boy intently as if by staring and continuing to shake the boys shoulder he could force his will home its our secret and youre to tell nobody nobody if you do ill come after you and kill you i know where you live now it will be easy for me to get to you the boy nodded after a second duclos shook his shoulder once more for emphasis you understand but once again the boys eyes betrayed him mixed with the fear duclos could see the uncertainty and confusion he knew that whatever the boy agreed now later he would be faced with awkward and insistent questions from his parents about the afternoon and he would finally talk the police would be called with his distinctive car he would be easily found would face a trial public humiliation and a jail term his life and career would be ruined his dreams and plans of becoming assistant public prosecutor in limoges within three years would be over he knew in that moment that he would probably have to kill the boy duclos sat close to the window in the restaurant from there he had a clear view of his car at the far side of the car park it was out of the direct path of people approaching the restaurant but still he couldnt be too careful having decided what to do it had taken him almost fifteen minutes to secure the boy ripping up the boys shirt and using some rags from his car to tie his hands and feet and gag him space in the car boot had been very restricted and he huddled the boy tightly next to the spare tyre in almost a foetal position the arms draped over the tyre itself he warned the boy not to make a sound or move about otherwise hed feed in a hosepipe from the exhaust and gas him the boy had nodded fearfully his eyes wide it was the last image he remembered as he shut the boot lid those eyes staring back at him questioning pleading at first duclos wasnt sure why hed delayed it had just felt wrong killing the boy then and there on the spot and he wanted time to think but was the delay just to steel up courage for what he already knew was inevitable or was he having second thoughts in the end what he thought about most was if he had to kill the boy how best to cover his tracks he didnt want to take any action hastily the effort of tying up the boy and bundling him into the car in the heat had tired him duclos clearest thoughts only came as he drove away jigsaw pieces matching with how he saw the crime being reconstructed by investigators based on his past experience with forensics by the time he reached the outskirts of taragnon hed worked out most of the details and the restaurant was an integral part of that plan he checked his watch pm timing would be the key ideally he should stay just over an hour duclos had already looked at the menu and scanned it briefly again as the waiter came over plat du jour but with the veal cassoulett please the mushrooms to start and the l isle flotant to finish and for the wine the waiter asked vin rouge please and some water what is the house red that comes with it chateau vernet its quite good fairly full duclos didnt ask the year the house wines were nearly all nondescript recent vintage in any case in the hot weather he normally mixed house wines with water though if it was good he might savour one glass on its own the restaurant was the first that he saw after taragnon with a reasonable car park in front it was important that he could see the car while he ate simple and cafe style it was very close to the village less than a kilometre and the roadside sign advertising plat du jour at only f had attracted a reasonable crowd that lunch time almost half full duclos counted another eight cars and two trucks in the car park the waiter had put his order into the kitchen and now returned with his wine and water he poured the wine but left the water for duclos to help himself duclos took a sip it was full bodied but had a slight acid aftertaste palatable but unexceptional duclos added some water and noticed the other waiter behind the bar look over briefly he was more surly and curious than his own waiter and had been by the front window serving looking out as duclos pulled up and walked in he could tell the look hed seen it a thousand times young nice car nice clothes rich kid everything bought and paid for by his parents the waiter little more than his own midtwenties was slaving behind the bar day and night thinking that meanwhile kids like himself whiled away their summers on the coast on their parents money but in duclos case the resentment was misplaced hed come from a family probably no better than the waiters his father just a simple works foreman in a local pottery factory it had taken his father years to work up to foreman through various positions on the factory floor then three years later a badly stacked crate fell and injured his back after increasing time off for treatment he was forced to work part time then the company finally wanted to let him go the company was inadequately insured the compensation poor and it was only by involving a lawyer and the threat of a large suit that his father had finally won the day the company paid for treatment gave a six month pay cash settlement and a full time office position for his father handling inventory only thirteen at the time the object lesson of how the lawyer had managed to save the family when his father was virtually powerless had stayed strongly with duclos the power of being able to wield the law like a heavy sword to get what you wanted from life he worked hard at school and graduated to take law and a second of business studies at bordeaux university at twentyone three months after graduation hed joined the public prosecutors office in limoges the first year as a stagiare then two years with case preparation for the assistant public prosecutor and some lesser cases which he handled himself but in the last year hed handled a more important caseload including two landmark cases for the head of public prosecution who was retiring in three years everyone would then move up a rung and he was one of three lawyers in line for assistant public prosecutor his success rate with cases was higher than the other two and his file preparation was noted for being meticulous three more years of hard application and the job was his the waiter came up with his mushrooms he looked over towards his car again as he ate hed worked too hard for too long to give it all up now the friend that he was staying with in salernes claude hed met at bordeaux university and theyd stayed in close contact since this was duclos sixth visit in four years invariably for three weeks in august or ten days at easter claudes family owned one of the areas largest vineyards the main chateau had its own grounds and pool and the cote dazur was just over half an hours drive away idyllic particularly for summer vacations duclos would usually sneak off at least twice to marseille to see his pimp and jahlep making an excuse about visiting an aunt in aubagne a boring but necessary social visit claude had never been suspicious through the years hed got used to covering up had become quite professional at it there had been no steady girlfriends but he was not unattractive and with his position hed always been able to find girls for special dinner dates or work related functions keeping up appearances finishing the mushrooms the main course arrived after a few moments duclos checked his watch again hed been there twentyfive minutes he might have to take coffee and brandy to stretch the time there was one small element still missing from his plan and it began to trouble him increasingly he dwelled on it through the cassoullet only as he was close to finishing topping up his wine with water for the third time did something strike a chord he looked thoughtfully at the bottle he wondered it could work but would there be enough water in the bottle the thought was still gelling when an out of place movement in the corner of his eye made him look past the bottle towards the car park his nerves tensed two women who had just left the restaurant were approaching the car next to his as one went to open the car door the other appeared to be looking over at his car was she just admiring it or had some sound alerted her she stood there for a moment then finally looked towards the fence behind and got in the car backed out and moved away duclos relaxed but his peace of mind was short lived minutes later a truck pulled in and took the vacant space obscuring his view of his car duclos felt immediately ill at ease now he could only see part of the furthest rear tail light he found it hard to concentrate on the rest of the meal when the l isle flotant arrived he ordered coffee and brandy from the same waiter to save time fifteen minutes more the waiting was infuriating his nerves had built to fever pitch by the time the brandy arrived he had to steady his hand as he lifted the glass he wasnt sure if it was the aftershock of what had already happened or what he knew he faced the other waiter was looking over at him again with that same curious expression or was he reading too much into it seeing imaginary demons and problems he just knew that he had to get out of the cafe fast having steeled his nerves over the past hour he knew that if he didnt do it soon he might never be able to his composure and resolve would be gone mopping his brow duclos signalled to the waiter the waiter finished up an order three tables away and came over the bill please the waiter had turned to go when duclos realized hed forgotten something he pointed to the bottle on the table and some bottled water to take with me the bar was noisy with conversation and the gentle clatter of cutlery duclos closed his eyes fighting to calm himself while he waited for the bill had he appeared agitated was the timing right had the woman by his car earlier heard something thoughts of what might have already gone wrong and potential pitfalls yet to come jumbled hopelessly with soul searching what might have been if he hadnt gone to aix en provence that morning if he had never seen the boy at the roadside all those years of reading affidavits from people whod got themselves into hopeless messes and how he always knew so much better he shook his head in disbelief it took another six minutes to pay and receive his change and by that time duclos was trembling uncontrollably he smiled and tipped generously hoping that his nervousness wasnt outwardly obvious he wanted them to remember him but not in that way getting back into the car duclos let out a deep sigh and fought to calm his trembling hands as he gripped the steering wheel he felt nauseous and his mind was spinning with a thousand conflicting thoughts and finally the build up of nerves overtook him and his body slumped defeatedly he didnt think he could go through with it in the dark the first thing christian became conscious of was the sound of his own breathing he felt hot in the boot despite being without his shirt hed managed to control his tears but his body still trembled violently how was he going to explain his shirt being destroyed when he got home and why did the man have to tie him up and put him in the boot out of sight he just hoped the man wasnt going to hurt him again he knew that he would probably have to tell his mother what had happened she was going to be furious she had warned him so often about talking to strangers but the man had reminded him of his cousin francois who worked with one of the perfume companies in grasse not like the rough men hed imagined christian began to dwell on the mans threat if you tell ill kill you i know where you live now it will be easy for me to get to you perhaps he could swear his mother to secrecy though if she still had to tell the police surely they would protect him for what the man had done would he be locked up so that he couldnt get to him and for how long christian listened to the monotonous drone of the car engine and the wheels spinning on the road he strained to hear noises beyond after a moment there was a faint rushing sound perhaps a lorry or car passing then nothing how far had they gone it was difficult to judge speed the only guide changing echo tones when they passed buildings the echo was there for a while then gone briefly before returning for a long continuous stretch they were passing through taragnon unless theyd branched off and it was bauriac ponteves was too far after a while the echoing stopped another faint rush of something passing came immediately after and not long after they slowed he felt the car turn then they stopped and then the long wait the heat built up insufferably in the confined space his body was hunched up tight and he could feel the twinge of cramps in his legs for a while he wondered if the man had gone off and left him at moments he could hear distant voices and thought about kicking the side to attract attention the only action allowed him with the ties and gag but they were distant enough that they might not hear and what if the man was still close by he waited with time passing he became more fearful what the man might do to him he found it difficult to breathe with the extreme heat the hot air rasping uncomfortably at the back of his throat he started to feel faint it was then that he remembered the coin in his pocket the silver twenty lire given him by his grandpapa andre the luck token he took with him everywhere it was in his left hand pocket with his hands tied it took a minute to fumble in his pocket and finally have it in his grasp moving his arms back over the spare wheel he grasped the coin tight in his right hand and started a silent prayer that the man wouldnt hurt him again that he would be home soon that the police would find the man and lock him up and that his mother wouldnt be too annoyed when he told her what had happened the heat made him tired he was on the edge of sleep when some voices snapped him alert unlike the other voices they were coming closer until he could hear them virtually at the side of the car there was some shuffling and the sound of a car door opening he pondered on the action only for a moment then kicked back with his legs against the back metal panel then waited listening nothing except some fumbling and another car door opening he kicked again but at that moment everything was smothered by the rushing of a car or truck passing then he heard the car doors closing the engine started the car backed out and moved away christian let out a long sigh and bit his lip shortly after he succumbed to the heat and dozed off he had started to think about the farm and it filled his dream there was a small stone wall in the main back field against which wild strawberries grew one summer hed cut down an area of the strawberry brambles and built a small hideaway house against the wall with wood and patched straw he was in the hideaway when he heard his father jeanluc calling he decided to stay hidden a minute then leap up and startle his father on the third call he jumped up onto the ridge of the wall but his father kept scanning the horizon he hadnt seen him christian started waving one arm frantically once more his father scanned back and forth more slowly and purposefully this time calling his name yet again for a moment more his father stood looking blankly across the fields then finally turned resignedly and headed back across the farm courtyard to the back kitchen door christian jumped down from the wall calling his fathers name desperately as he ran towards him but as he ran the grass gradually became longer obscuring his vision of the courtyard and his father he became confused and lost he could never remember the grass being that long and now that he couldnt see the farm hed lost all direction he continued running calling his fathers name frantically but with still no answer he felt increasingly lost and was becoming tired it was getting dark and he was frightened he called his fathers name once more with no response then sat down defeatedly among the tall grass he started crying he felt deserted by his father why didnt you come and find me after a moment the ground seemed to reverberate and shake with the heavy drone of an engine the noise and movement perplexed christian and the only thing he could think of was that his father had brought the tractor out to try and find him that hope only quelled his tears slightly he was still crying as he awoke to the reality of the boot and the rough track they were driving on they had obviously turned off again from the main road how far had they gone he realized with a sinking feeling that hed completely lost track of time and distance they might be too far from taragnon for his father to find them suddenly he felt as lost and alone as in the dream fear and dread crept over him and his body started trembling again then he noticed with sudden panic that something else was wrong grandpapa andres coin was no longer in his hand his right hand had relaxed slightly open and it had probably slipped from his grasp with the tracks bumpiness he started feeling for it in the dark it was not on top of the wheel hub the top of the hub was smooth metal except for several small oval holes around its rim they were too small to reach into especially with his hands tied if the coin had fallen through one of them he wouldnt be able to retrieve it he started feeling around the edge of the tyre the car had stopped without christian noticing he was still searching for the coin when the boot lid opened and the bright sunlight flooded in blinding him three provence august dominic fornier sat in cafe du verdon and enjoyed his normal breakfast of coffee with hot bread and pate the coffee was large in a cup almost big enough to be a soup bowl and he always kept one piece of bread without butter or pate just to dip in it it was pm an unusual time for breakfast but then he had been on all night duty in the police station and had woken less than an hour ago to return for the afternoon shift it was a regular ritual the cafe owner louis knew his order off by heart now and had almost worked out his sequence of shifts one large coffee with milk third of a stick loaf sliced in half one half plain the other half with pate coffee refill half way through the cafe overlooked the main square and fountain at bauriac and the police station was only fifty yards to the right of the square on the road flanking the town hall the town hall and louis cafe were the most imposing structures overlooking the square neoclassical the town hall should have been far more imposing but louis had compensated by putting out striped blue canvass awnings and a row of tables with martini umbrellas particularly busy in summer it was only from louis pavement frontage that tourists could appreciate the town hall facade and the ornate fountain at the centre of bauriacs square there were a few tourists there that afternoon dominic could spot them a mile away shorts leather strap sandals and cameras always cameras louis grunted his way past dominics table as he served some of them the front doors to the cafe were wide open and from the juke box inside came the strains of stevie wonders fingertips louis gave a mock bump and grind to it on his way back into the cafe and twirled his tray in one hand dominic smiled it had been his one contribution to louis juke box decent music stax tamla the drifters on rca sam cooke ben e king booker t and now a new artist called stevie wonder all of it american soul brought in through his uncles export business in marseille and practically none of it available in france for at least two to three months sometimes never it was improving now but when hed first started getting records through his uncle in the late s only a selected few american soul releases made it to french shores none of the tourists on louis terrace unless they were american would have heard stevie wonders new record yet they seemed oblivious as they sipped their teas and cokes or ambled off for photos in front of the fountain or town hall they hadnt come to france to listen to american soul the records were there just for the benefit of himself and louis and the growing number of discerning late nighters a welcome escape from the syrupy tones of sacha distel serge gainsbourg the singing nun and the endless pop rock which filled the french charts and since louis had installed the juke box it drew an increasing crowd of young locals on their solexes and vespas with a sprinkling of and cc bikes lightweight rockers mostly between the ages of fifteen and twentytwo they came in heavier numbers on friday and saturday nights nearly all of them locals louis hunch about installing the juke box had worked those over twentytwo mostly had larger bikes or cars and would head off to the clubs or discos in aix draguignan or even marseille or toulon but for local entertainment apart from the town cinema and one other bar with music near taragnon louis had the market cornered bauriacs population was just over and even with the surrounding towns of taragnon varages ponteves st martin and la verdiere which came under the administration of bauriacs town hall and gendarmerie overall area population was still under dominic fornier was one of eleven gendarmes stationed in bauriac and at twentysix was the youngest of two senior warrant officers there having transferred from marseille just the year before head of station and the four other area gendarmeries was captain tobias poullain thirty seven locally born but now just biding time by tending provincial turf advancement meant transfer to aix en provence or marseille and a city administrative position with a shot at colonel and poullain hoped to make it there by forty station veteran was lieutenant eric harrault fortynine harraults knowledge of past bauriac cases and general procedures between the station and the local courts was absolute and as a result he spent much of his time deskbound without harrault for reference or procedural advice the station just didnt run smoothly louis was at the side of his table coming by tonight im not sure depends how heavy my shift is i might be too tired too tired at your age louis waved one arm dismissively he nodded towards the boulangerie why dont you ask odette valerie will probably be coming maybe odette was a fresh faced nineteen year old serving in the bakers whom dominic had been dating the past four months nothing too serious dominic tried to restrict dates to no more than two a week particularly with his other commitments at home with him not finishing until midnight it would be too late in any case for a full date though the sight of louis fighting to win valeries affections was well worth a visit ill probably come by on my own for a quick brandy keep you company at the bar on valeries last visit louis had put on sam cookes another saturday night which dominic had brought him only a few weeks before coming out from behind the bar like a matador louis dramatically threw his shirt to one side now down to his vest louis felt that it showed off his physique and with his dark and brooding corsican features he saw himself as another victor mature dominic teased him that he looked more like bluto the wrong side of forty too much of his own short order cooking had long ago rounded out most of his muscle definition louis bull like figure trying gracefully to imitate something between the jive and the tango with valerie was a sight to behold should be a good crowd later tonight louis commented dominic nodded calling by when his shift finished at midnight was probably good timing after pm the bikers normally thinned out and more young couples came in on their way back from the cinema cleopatra was showing for a second week louis was probably right the turn out should be good ill only stay an hour though then i should get home louis grimaced understandingly dominic not wanting to spend too much time away from his sick mother was by now almost common knowledge dominics elder sister lived in paris with her husband and only visited periodically so dominic had shouldered most of the responsibility diagnosed just over a year ago less than two years after burying his father his mothers cancer had been the main reason for his transfer from marseille why he restricted his dates and tried not to stay out too late dominic knew that there wasnt much time left to spend with his mother dominic was distracted servan one of the young station sergeants was running across the square towards the cafe louis stared as well the last time hed seen a gendarme running was when the newly installed alarm had gone off by mistake at the jewellers around the corner something was wrong servan was breathless as he approached dominics table a young boy has been attacked out towards taragnon poullains just radioed in hes on his way there now he wants you to assist and take myself levacher and another sergeant were to meet him there wheres harrault he was with poullain at tourtins farm when it happened one of tourtins outbuildings was broken into last night when poullain got the call he left harrault taking the statement how old is the boy anything from nine to twelve years old we still dont have any firm identification is the attack bad how badly is he hurt the surprise came through in dominics voice this was bauriac they hardly ever faced anything more serious than a stolen tractor servan was hesitant and looked away slightly he either didnt know or didnt want to talk too openly in front of louis i think you should get the details from poullain the cv rattled along the rough track alongside the wheat field the basic black gendarme squad car it felt as if it was made from old tin cans and powered by a lawnmower engine and rubber bands dominic hated them with a vengeance the track was on a slight incline and with three passengers the engine whined in protest servan pointed the way im sure this is the right track the rivers to our right about one hundred and fifty metres up poullain said rounding a curve they could see the lane cordoned off with rope fifty metres ahead poullains black citreon c was parked one side with an ambulance behind poullain was down to his shirt sleeves and his flat gendarme cap was off too beads of sweat massed on his receding hairline and he was in the midst of a heated argument with one of the ambulance medics as they parked the car poullain was not very tall but he was quite stocky and in any confrontation fought to make a powerful presence with effusive and rapid arm movements as they approached he was almost hitting the medic repeatedly with the back of one hand to emphasize his case poullain looked past dominic and snapped at servan did you bring the camera servan nodded hastily as you asked and ran back the few paces to the car to get it poullain was impatient and flustered when servan came back with the camera an old leica mm with a dented and chipped black frame poullain barked are you any good at taking pictures servan shrugged as if to say okay then take them yourself so that we can get rid of this prick poullain looked disapprovingly at the medic then down at the figure of the young boy on a stretcher at the medics feet the medic was holding an oxygen mask to the boys face poullain turned his back and let out a deep sigh as servan moved around for best position and angle dominic was close behind and studied the boys face as the shutter clicked away the medics had obviously cleaned much of the blood from the face but facial bruising and swelling was so intense that the bone structure looked distorted and blood was still caked thick in his hair a bandage was wrapped around part of the boys skull and under his chin a few paces to the side dominic could see a flattened area of wheat sheaves with dried blood patches a large oval patch with two smaller patches and some spots and splashes radiating out dark brown against the bleached white sheaves dominic shuddered after five pictures poullain waved the medics away with a few curt words about making contact later and directed servans attention to the blood patches pointing out some suggested positions for two or three close ups that he would need the medics loaded the boy aboard the ambulance and backed down the lane poullain looked up at dominic sorry about that first the medics say that they cant move the boy he could choke on his own blood and they spend time cleaning him up and putting a pipe down his throat i say fine i need some pictures in any case but as soon as theyre finished they want to move him by this time i can see you approaching but they dont want to wait i end up arguing with them to gain one minute poullain dabbed at his forehead with the back of one sleeve look fornier i want you to assist in this theres two reasons first therell be an awful lot of paperwork and notes second were going to be talking with a lot of outside units particularly from marseille a forensics team are on their way from marseille now what about harrault dominic asked harraults seniority would normally have guaranteed his role in assisting particularly on a major case harrault will do what harrault does best hell take our notes and reports and make sure the filing with the aix cour dassises runs smoothly this will no doubt end up there particularly if it becomes a murder case the medics said that its going to be a close call whether the boy lives harraults going to spend half his time running reports between us and the examining magistrate and public prosecutors office in aix i want you to assist and take notes ensure the reports reach harrault in good shape and liaise and smooth out any problems with the boys from marseille i dont want us to lose control on this one dominic wondered what was more important his good shorthand for taking notes or his three years with the marseille force obviously poullain was worried about getting upstaged by marseille the boy wasnt even at the hospital might not last through the night and already poullain was more worried about the politics of the investigation afraid of losing a major local case that could boost his career whos coming from marseille dominic asked i dont know i radioed in and was advised that a forensics team would be dispatched wasnt given any names servan was at their side with the camera held limply waiting for more directions wo levacher was looking thoughtfully towards the river have you brought the sticks poullain asked yes it was levacher who answered he turned back to the cv to get them theyd stopped for them at a hardware store on the way but it was obvious they were still wondering what they were for poullain pointed towards the wheat field levacher and servan start from three metres out from the blood patches and head out across the wheat field keeping two metres apart then at the end turn back and cover the next four metre stretch use the sticks to part the sheaves were looking for items of clothing even small fragments of cloth or buttons and sweet wrappers any possible clues and the weapon used in the attack a heavy stick or iron bar or perhaps a rock with tell tale blood stains poullain pointed towards the river then take the bushes along the river bank also look in the shallows as i say dont disturb the three metres around the blood stains leave that for forensics poullain surveyed the wheat field as servan and levacher headed out with their sticks he shook his head slowly after a moment who on earth would do such a thing a rhetorical tone so dominic merely joined him for a second silently watching their progress tapping across the field like blind men who discovered the boy dominic asked the man from the farm behind marius caurin this track provides the only access to his farm these fields are owned by his friend who is on an engineering contract in orleans thats why some of them are untended marius just plants the few extra fields he can cope with a light breeze played across the field as it shifted direction they heard the sound of a car approaching it was a large black citreon c pulling in behind poullains car with three men inside probably the team from marseille poullain greeted them then introduced dominic they walked towards the bloodstained area dominic stayed in the background as poullain pointed and brought them up to date on events he explained that the boy might be facing an operation in hospital at aix en provence so would be studied by the medical examiner there they could confer with him later the main thing now was gaining information from what was left blood group and some indication of timing for the attack were all the stains the same group as the boy or were any different dominic smiled to himself in his fifteen years of policing in bauriac poullain had only seen one murder an almost predictable domestic crime of passion and two manslaughters one domestic one bar fight yet he was handling this with all the casual aplomb of a marseille veteran used to fishing bodies out of the harbour every day no doubt driven by his fear of being upstaged from outside none of them were really prepared for this hed seen the shock on servans face when hed leant over the boy to take the first photos servan had gone deathly white and looked sick the other rookies had only managed to maintain some composure by keeping in the background none of them had come close to the boy and studied his face the way he had seen the massive bruising and fractures seen where his small face had been mashed half to a pulp part of his skull only held in place by a bandage this was bauriac and if they stayed their distance perhaps they could still cling to the illusion that things like this just didnt happen in their area even hed found the sight of the young boy disturbing despite having been directly involved in five murder cases in marseille perhaps it was because the victim was so young none of his previous cases had involved children who on earth would do such a thing the one moment staring silently across the wheat field when poullain had shown his true emotions the rest of the time hed been too busy sparring to try and prove he was in control one of the forensic team was walking to his car with a set of small clear polythene bags another was crouching now examining further up the rough track he looked over at poullain its been too dry and the track is too uneven and dusty i doubt well get any decent imprints poullain nodded and asked the team leader dubrulle about progress dubrulle explained that they would probably be at least another thirty or forty minutes then they would head over to aix and see the medical examiner it could be hell have some information by tomorrow morning our first lab test results wont be ready till tomorrow afternoon servan and levacher were half way back on their third sweep and levacher had his jacket unbuttoned with the heat poullains radio crackled with a sudden harsh distorted voice poullain went over to it dominic couldnt hear what was said he saw poullain look down thoughtfully after a moment the conversation appeared quite staccato apart from a stretch towards the end of the call when poullain waved his arms in a struggle for emphasis and then checked his watch as he finished poullain was pensive as he approached a calls come in to the station from a woman saying her sons missing its the only call of that type theyve received today the boy said that he was going to a friends house on his bike and should have been there for onethirty he never showed up but its only fourforty now it could be too early to jump to conclusions you know what kids are like the boy could have gone to another friends house or disappeared for sweets or to play somewhere else how old is her boy ten the age is right on a bad month the station might get three missing person alerts sometimes two months would go by with none most were false alarms but the timing and age of this one narrowed the odds dominic could sense poullain delaying the inevitable he recalled the incident of a young boy whod died falling down a disused well the previous autumn facing the relatives with the news had unsettled poullain for days this time he would probably send someone else dominic looked out thoughtfully across the field whats her name monique rosselot four monique rosselot looked out onto the farm courtyard from the kitchen a mass of bougainvillaea covered the wall on one side christian had been only six when hed helped his father jeanluc plant it now it was a profusion of pink flowers christians bike rested on the corner of the wall just past the bougainvillaea jeanluc had come back with it just twenty minutes before having followed the path christian normally took to stephans house at first shed felt relieved the bikes brake was jammed at least that might explain some of the delay walking would have taken him far longer but still he should have been there by the latest at pm it was now pm where had he gone perhaps hed stopped off in taragnon for a drink or sweets the walk would have tired him and made him hot and thirsty though still that would only account for another forty minutes or so he must have met another friend in taragnon gone off to play somewhere else and lost track of time it was all she could think of when jeanluc had come back with christians bike their daughter clarisse had asked is christian lost somewhere only four shed seen her parents consternation and picked up on part of their conversation no its all right hes just late seeing his friend because his bike broke down christian was so protective and caring of clarisse he was like a second father to her sharing his own sage past experience of the pitfalls and problems of being five but she was too young to be worrying along with them monique bit her lip it was over an hour since shed called the police the nearest phone was over a kilometre away and in the intense heat the walk had been exhausting on her return shed felt sick and went into the bathroom leaning over the sink despite her stomach still churning in the end nothing came shed caught her reflection in the mirror as she looked up shed aged five years in the last hour she felt physically and emotionally drained where was he why hadnt anyone called by the waiting was killing her nerves jeanluc had headed off on another search and probably wouldnt be back for forty minutes or an hour she resolved finally that despite the long walk if she hadnt heard anything from the police within half an hour she was going to put through another call in the end she was saved the trouble just ten minutes before planning to leave the black citreon cv pulled into their courtyard and two gendarmes got out it was almost am louis bar had been crowded but the numbers were beginning to thin out louis had been dancing earlier with valerie but now she was talking with a friend in the corner while he put away some glasses and had a pernod with dominic at the bar dominic was out of uniform in slacks and a short sleeved polo shirt nursing a brandy who saw her louis asked harrault and servan poullain was going to send me at first but there were too many notes to take from the afternoon recording times and early findings from forensics and our own team in the end he sent servan to pick up harrault hes the most senior poullain thought if anyone hed bring the right tone wheres monique rosselot now probably still at the hospital harrault ran her and the father there and stayed with them the first hour introduced them to the main doctors got as much information as possible and tried to console them the doctors were operating at midnight the boys probably still in there now the father headed back with the daughter but monique said she would probably stay the night what are the boys chances not good theres a lot of internal cranial bleeding and damage if he lasts through the operation and the next twenty four hours the doctors say his chances will increase but brain damage is heavy and even if he survives he could be severely disabled louis reached for the bottle and topped up his pernod swirling it briefly in its narrow glass before tipping it half back god this must be rough on her have you seen her before shes quite a woman no i dont think i know her harrault said that she was quite pretty quite pretty huh let me tell you monique rosselot is one of those rare beauties that you only see once in a while in bauriac those once in a whiles are even rarer even on the coast shed stand out im amazed you dont know her when are you seeing her sometime tomorrow we havent asked her any questions yet it seemed inappropriate while shes still grappling with whether or not her son will live ill see her with poullain tomorrow well arrange it around the timing of her hospital visits if shes at the hospital all day then well go there louis raised his glass taking another quick slug salut let me know what you think when youve seen her i warn you now youll be spoilt for other women dominic smiled louis the lecher louis the connoisseur of women three tables could be calling for service and louis would stop to admire at leisure a beautiful woman passing the fact that monique rosselot was married was immaterial she was still there for the admiring harmless voyeurism but dominic wondered if louis knowledge of monique rosselot went deeper than that do you know her well not personally shes been in a few times and weve spoken briefly once or twice but thats all she used to come in more when her boy was younger but my barman joel is quite friendly with the father jeanluc and valerie knows one their neighbours and you know me if theres a beautiful woman involved ill spend half the day talking im not choosy who i speak to probably why i spend so much time talking to you louis paused for effect and chuckled no seriously you know what bauriacs like people talk a lot and they came here what seven or eight years ago the boy was just a toddler people are particularly curious about newcomers questions were thick and fast the first year they arrived did many of them get answered a few it seems she had her boy when she was under age no more than fourteen or fifteen when he was conceived nobody knows exactly jeanlucs family gave him a hard time not only about being careless with an under age girl but her background her mothers half moroccan half corsican and her fathers french but the moroccan and corsican blood is predominant in her features his familys prejudice starts to show through cheap young moroccan whore seduced their poor young boy which is laughable seeing as hes ten years older than her dont they have prostitutes at the age of twelve on the street there you know the type of comment in the end they had a bellyful of it and moved she was more resilient than him i hear she could have stayed and put up with it but he insisted on moving cut himself off entirely from his family had little or no contact with them when the little girl was born they just sent a photo no invitations to the christening nothing where did they come from beaune not far from dijon but it was out of the frying pan and into the fire what with the fact that they were newcomers and her dusky looks she attracted more than her fair share of attention you couldnt really call it prejudice but it was curiousity so blatant it was almost rude you know the way you would expect a lost tribe to react upon seeing their first explorer i was probably one of the darkest skinned people in bauriac until she arrived and i attracted a fair bit of attention in my time let me tell you it took a few years for monique to be accepted here for them to look beyond her colour and realize what a nice person she is and by the time your mother and you arrived theyd practically been numbed into acceptance so this is what all this was about thought dominic why louis had been so inquisitive about monique rosselot it was all bauriac newcomers together time battling against the odds of small town minds and prejudices it was difficult enough being a newcomer without standing out as one and true enough when his parents had arrived four years ago his mother had encountered a few raised eyebrows her lineage was part french indonesian part french and dominics father had been pure french alsace by the time it reached dominic the indonesian blood had left only a slight almond slant at the corner of his eyes looking almost out of place with his proud gallic nose girls either found it endearing and mysterious or they didnt like him at all it might have caused some problems at the station too but dominic could never be sure the fact that he was newly transferred and enjoyed warrant officer status so young were reasons enough for resentment louis had travelled up from marseille thirteen years ago to be the chef at the cafe du verdon and when the owner had died four years later and the relatives were keen to sell on hed mortgaged his neck between the banks and private bills of exchange to take over only in the last few years having cleared the bills of exchange had louis enjoyed the fruits of his labour dominic could imagine that the locals had not been too keen on a corsican owning such a prominent local establishment especially all those years ago marseille was teaming with migrant workers and cosmopolitan mixes and the tide of invasion by outsiders and foreigners was accepted on the coast fifty kilometres away but not in bauriac louis was shaking his head its hardly believable something like this her and jeanluc have been through such a tough time already theyve had to work so hard to make a go of that farm they were sold a real pig in the poke previous owner saw them coming a mile off as locals often do with people like us from outside bastard drainage was bad top soil and yield was poor its been a real struggle for them and she dotes on that boy i dont know how shell get over this dominic nodded thoughtfully he was still trying to get a picture of monique rosselot she sounded quite exotic a rare beauty according to louis surely hed have seen her in the past year he realized then how closeted and predictable his life had become the past seven months his time spent between the gendarmerie home with his sick mother and the occasional drink at louis even on his dates with odette they always went to the same places the cinema the cafe du verdon or on the rare occasions they felt more adventurous on his bike to a favourite club in st maximin valerie was up at the bar ordering drinks for herself and her friend a marie brizard and soda and a glass of red wine you having another dance soon louis maybe later im not as young as i used to be he smiled as he watched her walk back to the table with the drinks hows odette these days okay a bit too demanding wants to go out every night i just dont have the time even if i did have the energy and the inclination what first attracted you to her louis leant forward slightly he lowered his voice conspirationally come on you must remember that that first flush of romance dominic thought for a moment i think it was when we first went on a picnic the way she wrapped her mouth around a bread stick sandwich i knew then she was the girl for me louis smiled broadly is that the only qualification your girls need no i quite like it if theyre good at yoga and can put their ankles behind their ears louis guffawed so loudly that valerie and her friend looked over briefly still chuckling louis poured another pernod youre a card dominic an absolute fucking card excuse me he swept out from behind the bar and half kneeling with a bar towel draped across one arm asked valerie to dance ray charles take these chains was playing on the juke box dominic took a quick slug of brandy and smiled to himself normally he was quite considerate and romantic with women but that wasnt the image louis wanted to hear louis would probably have been happier to hear hed split with odette back to how he was the first five months in bauriac different dates every other week screwing his way endlessly through the local girls in search of nirvana that at least was the idyllic swashbuckling image in louis mind in reality half of the dates had been a disaster dominic didnt know it was possible to go out with so many girls and still feel so lonely the only consolation had been editing the dates down to just the highlights that hed kept up his stock of bar stool stories for louis dominic watched louis and valerie dancing smiling as one of louis rogue hands drifted down towards her bottom in the clinches after ray charles came the crystals da doo ron ron louis attempt at the jive looked more like a flamenco dancer in the grips of epilepsy and dominic fought to keep a straight face louis thought of himself as a good dancer and dominic didnt want to spoil a good friendship by shattering that illusion after a moment his thoughts took over and the dancing and music faded into the background tomorrow would be a big day they would have the first forensics report plus the findings of the medical examiner they should know the timing of the attack the exact weapon used any other blood groups found and any other irregularities they would hopefully get the first responses to appeals for witnesses in the area and he would meet monique rosselot for the first main interview to learn the boys last movements before the attack they should also know if her son was going to live dominic wasnt sure if it was the events of the day or the two brandies at louis but it took him a long while to get to sleep hed checked on his mother on coming in she was already fast asleep often if she was awake he would bring her a hot chocolate and they would talk for ten minutes her weight loss in the past four months had been more dramatic but her mind was still lucid so dominic grabbed whatever conversations he could he knew that at any day her mind could slip if the day hadnt been too eventful they would reminisce the days from his childhood in louviers near paris were the most memorable some of the memories jumbled with the events of the day as he tried to get some sleep images of the young boy the dark blood against the bleached white wheat preparing himself for the interview with monique rosselot flashes from his own chidhood and thinking of his own mother as she was then how she could have possibly coped with anything so horrific it was the closest he could come to trying to understand how monique rosselot felt his bedrooms french windows led onto a small first floor patio overlooking the garden left partly open with the summer heat the sound of the wind through the trees outside wafted gently in after a while he finally drifted off to sleep the dream came three hours later he was a boy again in louviers and the wheat fields stretched out endlessly before him the sheaves seemed so tall he could hide among them and nobody would find him he walked ten paces into the field and crouched down holding his breath as he hid the sheaves were at least a foot above his head then suddenly he was looking down at the field he could see the gendarmes tapping across the field with their sticks to find him he felt suddenly that hed done something wrong but didnt know what and he wasnt sure whether to leap up and let them find him but in the end he stayed crouched and hidden he could hear them tapping closer closer and his heart pounded with the sound of their nearby movement though looking down from above he could see that theyd already passed him a gentle breeze wafting across the field suddenly became more violent bending the sheaves almost at a right angle their gentle threshing with the sticks was drowned out by the sound he stood up after a moment and was clearly exposed but the gendarmes were looking away holding onto their caps and shielding their faces from the harsh wind stinging their eyes he called to them but his voice was lost among the wind and the wild rustling of the sheaves dominic woke up with a start he was sweating profusely outside the wind had risen and the branches of the trees close by his window whipped back and forth he got up and walked onto the small balcony looking down onto the garden there was a tall jacarandah tree close by and its branches and leaves moved like surf rising and falling with the wind it could be the first stages of a mistral dominic thought or hopefully a small summer storm that would blow over by the morning dominics heart was pounding he wasnt sure if it was the dream or something else that he suddenly remembered would happen the next day a reporter from la provencal the areas main newspaper had called the station that evening two hours later poullain had released a statement that would no doubt appear in the paper the next morning the attacker would know then that the boy he had left for dead was still alive he would feel threatened the boy could possibly later talk and indentify him five when the phone call came about the accident at first stuart thought it was his alarm call but it was helena stuarts clock showed am she was babbling and incoherent and is terrible so sorry were repeated among the jumble along with a number he should ring for the oceanside police who had called her just ten minutes before emerging from his drowsiness stuart tried to clarify some points but helena was not very forthcoming as if she either didnt know much or didnt want to be the messenger of bad tidings the tears and the trembling in her voice betrayed the worst when stuart got through to the oceanside police he was asked to call back in ten minutes lieutenant carlson has all the details for that he should be finished with his interview then after confirming his relationship as jeremys elder brother and eyrans uncle and godparent stuart felt himself go numb as carlson went through the catalogue of horror as if it was a routine shopping list we have one female caucasian pronounced doa at oceanside county general the other two occupants of the jeep a caucasian male and a young boy are both still in emergency the boy was critical at one point but hes more stable now were waiting on more updates can i ask sir do you know of any other relatives the victims might have here in california who we can contact no i cant think of anyone were all here here in england weve got an uncle in toronto but we havent seen him in years stuart felt lame and helpless due to the distance an image of jeremy and eyran cut off and alone he knew he should be there with them can i rely on you then to make contact with your sisterinlaw allison capels relatives in england yes yes of course stuart was still numb trying desperately to work out how he could get out to california quickly hed never actually met allisons parents only a sister over six years ago at one of jeremys parties to his side amanda was stirring squinting over at him quizzically from identification found in the car we have your brothers age thirtyeight years old but not that of your sisterinlaw or the boy allison was thirtyfive i think eyran was just ten years old last april what number can we reach you on to inform you of any developments stuart gave carlson his home number then as an afterthought ill give you my work number as well just in case you dont hear anything from the hospital before tonight but as he said the words it suddenly hit stuart that he couldnt possibly just sit there through those hours waiting for the phone to ring knowing that eyran and jeremy were laying in hospital beds ten thousand miles away he made the decision im coming out there ive been thinking about it as weve spoken ive got to be there with them thats your prerogative sir but with all due respect we might know something within the next hour or so from the hospital theyre both in emergency right now thats okay ill book the ticket and phone you before i leave for the airport then again just before the flight leaves but ive got to start making my way out there amanda was sitting up now following every word of the conversation i fully understand sir ill wait to hear from you it took stuart only half an hour to make all his travel arrangements part of which was explaining the situation to an incredulous amanda and leaving her a few vital numbers to contact all san diego flights routed through la though there was an average four hours delay between connecting flights the first direct flight to la was an american airlines flight leaving at am from heathrow and from there a bus or train could take him down to oceanside miles south of la on the flight out stuart tried to read a magazine or a book anything to distract him but he just couldnt concentrate he found himself scanning the words blindly his thoughts still with eyran and jeremy trying to read something into carlsons bland status report on the call hed put through just before the flight announcement the news from the hospital was that eyran was out of emergency and had been transferred to intensive care and that jeremy was still in emergency stuart put down the magazine and closed his eyes briefly knowing that sleep was hopeless but trying to force some calm into his nerveracked body he let the images wash over him slowly the night they celebrated jeremy passing his bar exams jeremy helping him unload some antique timbers for the cottage eyran asking for a ride in the sports car hed bought to celebrate the first major account of his new agency the surprise on jeremys face when he turned up in the hospital with a half bottle of scotch in his coat pocket the night eyran was born what no cigars eyran so much of their lives had revolved around eyran he remembered now that it had been almost eight months since hed seen jeremy when eyran was born yet another futile argument that had forged a divide as the first born of the two families eyran had created a bond that just wasnt there before a simple focus of love and affection which crossed over any boundaries and past differences between himself and jeremy the petty arguments continued but suddenly eyran was an overriding force pushing them into the background probably even jeremy sensed he had become more than just an uncle hed stepped into the role of a second father to eyran the fact that hed been unable to have children with amanda despite numerous tests and clinics had intensified that bond eyran became like the son he could never have after another year of trying vainly with amanda to have a child theyd applied for adoption taking tessa as a two year old eight months later amanda had suggested a boy admitting in the end that she thought stuart had wanted a boy because of eyran he said that he wanted a girl because he didnt want their child seen as some sort of replacement for eyran theyd both told only half the truth stuart didnt want a child that might eclipse eyran perhaps dilute or distract his affection for the boy a girl could be seen as a separate entity amanda had wanted any child that would return stuarts focus to his own family breaking what she felt had become an unnaturally close tie between himself and eyran he remembered amandas anger brimming over one day as not for the first time he brought home two toys suggesting that they drive over later to give eyran his is this your idea of the perfect family stuart a girl in our family and a boy in your brothers throughout jeremy had never shut eyran out of their lives he could have become jealous and guarded about the relationship fearing that stuart might steal some of the limelight of eyrans love and affection yet he seemed to welcome it as if he understood that somehow it fulfilled something he himself could not provide a kinship of free spirit and shared likes and dislikes jeremy appeared happy in his role as guardian angel of both of them warning stuart about bad business deals and investments in the same way that he would warn eyran about climbing too high or not going near the electrical sockets jeremy didnt feel threatened because he saw them just as two boys playing together one small one big with the excuse that he lacked time to organize everything hed left amanda to phone his partner at work and his father in wales but the truth was he just couldnt face phoning their father and telling him this news jeremy had always been his favourite only their mother when she was alive had any time for stuart shed died of a brain haemorrhage two years before eyran was born and their father at the age of sixty two had then decided to take early retirement and move back from london to his native wales each month either he or jeremy had dutifully gone up to wales to visit but when jeremy went to california he sensed that his own family visits were little compensation stuart tried to sleep but found it impossible until much later almost three hours after hed washed down lunch with half a bottle of wine the sleep was fitful images of eyran jeremy and their father all jumbled together eyran was playing but the image quickly changed to himself as a child he was with jeremy in the derelict warehouse where they played hide and seek but couldnt find him and in the end decided that jeremy must have sneaked out and headed home but when stuart got home their father david asked where jeremy was he didnt want to say he didnt know in case his father worried that jeremy was lost so he said that he would go and get him and ran back to the warehouse he went looking for jeremy again along the rows of dusty shelves and empty crates telling him that their father wanted to see them but he knew that jeremy was purposely staying hidden thinking it was just a trick he called out jeremys name repeatedly starting to plead but only the empty echoes of his voice returned he started to cry but the tears werent for jeremy but for himself for what he felt certain was some dreadful trick being played on him how could jeremy do this stay lost and let him go home alone to face their father stuart awoke bathed in sweat the dream had disturbed him converging so much of the shock and anguish of the days events it washed over him without warning gentle sobbing shaking his body as he turned away towards the plane window to hide his tears guilt compounded his sorrow so many of his thoughts about jeremy the past few years had been ungenerous anger at him taking eyran so far away after a few moments he snapped out of it telling himself it was only a dream though four hours later all of stuarts worst fears were realized as he phoned carlson from lax to hear that his brother had died just over an hour beforehand and knowing that he couldnt possibly ask amanda to do this duty he had to call their father in wales and above the noise and activity of the crowded terminal tell him that his favourite son was dead six dominic drove the ds so that poullain could absorb the teleprinter message which had just arrived headed palais de justice aix from the nominated prosecutor pierre bouteille declaring that poullains jurisdiction had been granted prime investigative control over the case but he should liaise with marseille on items such as forensics bouteille had already notified an examining magistrate frederic naugier and a commission rogatoire generale had been signed off to empower poullains initial investigative stages a meeting had been arranged for thursday at am two days time to establish the full procedural process the brief teleprinter message gave no options on time poullain was being summoned dominic parked at the far end of the courtyard the air cushioned suspension settled back as they got out of the car the rosselots farmhouse formed an lshape around the courtyard with the garage and some farm store rooms coming out at an angle from the main house dominic could see a childs bike resting against the wall of the garage pink bougainvillaea grew profusely on the same wall and positioned equidistant between there and the front door was a small wrought iron table and four chairs two palm trees at the end of the courtyard separated the house from the broad expanse of the fields beyond and a mixture of elm and pine bordered the main road and the short approach to the house the sound of cicadas was heavy in the air it was am and the temperature was already over f variegated ivy grew up and around the front door frame as they rang the bell they could hear a faint clanking sound coming from the garage competing with the rhythm of the cicadas they waited only a moment before monique rosselot opened he door at first she was in half shadow as she greeted them and asked them in dominic only got a quick impression of dark wavy ringlets large eyes and a simple beige floral pattern dress but it was enough to catch his breath slightly her eyes looked particularly large and striking in the half light of the porch they followed her into the kitchen there was hot coffee on the stove which she offered to them its freshly made just ten minutes ago ive already had mine poullain thanked her and said that he would have black coffee and dominic followed suit and said yes but au lait the kitchen was large with a small fireplace in the far corner a large rough wooden table with chairs was close to the fireplace making up a breakfast area monique waved one hand towards the table please poullain and dominic took seats on its far side dominic observed her closer as she prepared the coffees louis had been right about monique rosselot a rare beauty despite the fact that he should have been prepared by louis description hed still found himself taken aback his mouth suddenly dry her wavy dark hair hung half way down her back her eyes were an intriguing blend of green and hazel and her mouth was full and generous it was an open expressive face with an almost childlike innocence tempering its sensuality making her look younger than the twenty six years mentioned by louis dominic would have guessed her age at no more than nineteen or twenty despite the faint dark circles no doubt brought on by the past night of worry hed heard that shed stayed at the hospital till past am her skin tone was smooth mocha the outline of her full breasts pushing against the cotton print dress with her movements she glanced over at them as she poured the coffees and dominic looked hastily away he felt a momentary flush of embarrassment as if hed been an unwelcome voyeur monique brought their cups over and set them down then looked towards the garage and the continuing clanking sound id better ask jeanluc in now he probably doesnt realize youre here she went out and crossed the courtyard it struck dominic that hed only half believed louis whose ratings of womens beauty had become increasingly suspect through the years that was why hed been caught by surprise but he felt immediately uncomfortable with those thoughts he was here to take notes about her son who was barely clinging to life the last thing she wanted was some gendarme ogling at her jeanluc came back in the room ahead of monique while she made the introductions by the way she faltered it was obvious she hadnt remembered their names and poullain filled the gaps jean luc took a chair at the far end of the table while monique poured a coffee for him his light brown curly hair was deeply receding on both sides and he was perspiring from his work outside some freckles showed on his forehead and arms from the summer sun his shoulders and forearms were broad from the years of farm work and there were calluses on his rough hands but there the farm labourer ended his eyes were soft and inquisitive and he had a vaguely intellectual air as if he was an accountant or lecturer who farmed just at the weekends according to louis he was in his midthirties but the receding hairline made him look closer to forty thought dominic the contrast in age between him and monique looked more marked than it was they could be father and daughter poullain looked up expectantly at monique and waited for her to set down her cup and join them dominic flipped over to a fresh page in his notebook and poullain started speaking first of all my condolences on my own part and on behalf of the gendarmerie i understand madame rosselot that you stayed with your son until the early hours of the morning poullain looked pointedly towards monique to bring you up to date i managed to check with the hospital just before leaving and your boy has rallied well after the operation of last night though the doctors wont know the full extent of just how successful the operation had been until this afternoon we can only pray for some improvement monique nodded appreciatively she had gone with jeanluc to the nearby phone kiosk only half an hour before their arrival to call the hospital but it was hardly worth mentioning poullain realized she was some distance from a phone and therefore checking was difficult no point in dampening the good intent of his gesture poullain placed one hand firmly on the table top as if he might reach out to moniques hand for comfort but stopped halfway short now as painful as this might be for both of you we need to go through the times you last saw your son before the attack when you first realized there might be a problem and the timing of you finding the bike poullain looked at jeanluc we will also need you to show us afterwards exactly where you found the bike but for now we are trying to establish the timing of events monique and jeanluc glanced at each other briefly as if deciding who should be main spokesperson jeanluc shrugged and held out one hand you first i was in the fields for much of the time monique drew a breath and glanced for a moment out of the window towards the courtyard and christians bike i let christian out to play at about he took his bike because he was visiting his friend stephan who lives five kilometres away on the other side of taragnon what route does he normally take to stephans house poullain asked about six hundred metres down the road a track cuts between our neighbour and the next farm it goes between two more farms for half a kilometre then comes out on the main taragnonbauriac road he goes along the main road through taragnon village and the farm is just over a kilometre past which side of the road on the left as you come out of taragnon its set back a few hundred metres from the road from the roadside you can see mainly vines though they also have some fields for grazing what is the family name maillots and your son never arrived there monique looked down and bit her lip dominic noticed that she looked at them directly only at intervals the rest of the time she looked down at the table or at the notepad as he recorded the interview in shorthand we didnt know straightaway were not on the phone nor are they i finally called jeanluc in from the fields at just past pm we had expected christian back by pm and normally hes very good with coming back on time jeanluc went over to stephans house and checked they hadnt seen christian that was when jeanluc checked back along the route christian normally took and found the bike at first we thought that with the bike broken down hed decided to walk the rest which would have taken him far longer then perhaps hed got distracted and stopped off in the village how far away was the bike monique looked at jeanluc jean luc answered almost towards the end of the track down the road not far from where it joins the taragnon road a few hundred metres at most so it looked to you as if christian had walked the rest of the distance to the main road then the two kilometres to taragnon village jeanluc nodded poullain paused for a moment looking over at dominics notes and taking stock of the information so far christian was found on a farm track little more than half a kilometre from the maillots farm but on the other side of the road bordering the river but somehow the boy had made it through the village poullain voiced the thought the first thing to find out is who in the village might have seen your boy between midday and three pm because we will then at least know if he walked through the village or was transported through by someone he met at the roadside monique and jeanluc looked at each other for a second something troubled them about this comment jeanluc was the first to speak if he was on foot the problem is he could have cut through the fields behind the village on his bike its not possible but on foot theres only a few stone walls and small fences to negotiate is it likely he cut across asked poullain jeanluc shrugged its a possibility its something hes done before in any case he would probably cut down and walk the last hundred metres of the village heading for stephans house theres another track there a hundred metres at the end of the village poullain considered it was quiet the main village establishments petering out if the one or two shopkeepers there hadnt seen the boy it proved nothing yet if the boy had walked through the entire village past boulangeries patisseries the main square and cafes without being seen it would have been a different matter hed already assigned three men to call on village shops from early that morning and had been hopeful of their findings now he wasnt so sure poullain couldnt even remember what shops there were in those last hundred metres the disappointment showed on his face on a fresh page dominic had been making a small diagram of taragnon the path from the rosselots to the main road the maillots farm and the track by the river it was a simple triangular drawing with distances in metres between xs marking where the bike was left and the boy was found while his pen hovered for poullain to speak again he took a quick scan of the kitchen dried flowers ornaments flour and spice jars a plate wall clock with portofino in scrawly black loops below a background harbour scene no photos little in the kitchen said anything about the rosselots lives though the kitchen was where the coffee was dominic couldnt help wondering if they hadnt been asked into the sitting room for another reason the rosselots didnt want too deep an intrusion into their lives so finally you made the call to the police station just before pm when it was clear that your son had not turned up the maillots farm and you had found the bike abandoned monique muttered yes and jeanluc merely nodded poullain glanced briefly at dominics crude diagram as if for inspiration he voiced his thoughts in staccato fashion as they came to him as if he was at the same time refreshing his own memory your son was originally discovered at about threefifteen by a neighbouring farmer just half a kilometre from the maillots farm we arrived on the crime scene within forty minutes and received your call almost an hour later we subsequently made some confirmations of identity to be sure the boy was yours and two officers were sent to you an hour and quarter after you called we suspect although we cannot be totally sure until all the medic reports are in that your son was attacked within an hour of being discovered poullain looked keenly between monique and jeanluc as he related the sequence of events this was the first time they were hearing this information and he wanted to see their reactions jeanluc stared back blandly and monique looked mildly expectant as if she sensed poullain wanted to add something vital dominic noticed poullain unclench one hand and wave it to one side the difficult part was coming and he was struggling for emphasis before the words were even formed i want you to think about this for a moment before you answer but are there any relatives any cousins or uncles or any friends or neighbours that have shown a special interest in christian in a way that perhaps might be described as a bit over friendly or unusual poullain was doing this by the book though dominic most child molesters were found close to home with a relative or friend often the dividing line between a natural fondness for children and an unnatural interest was impossible to determine monique appeared nonplussed at first then finally it dawned on her what poullain was aiming at and her face clouded but as she spoke her voice faltered as if she was still struggling to comprehend i dont think theres anyone we know like that she looked hastily towards jeanluc for support but i dont understand why do you ask this poullain smoothed back his crown faint beads of perspiration had broken out on his forehead and he looked uncomfortable believe me im sorry to have to ask you this but when i checked this morning with the medical examiner we suspected already that unfortunately your son was sexually assaulted before he was beaten and this was confirmed we know only a little about the timing of the attack or the sexual assault the full details will come out later from forensics and blood sampling but we do know at this stage that a sexual assault took place poullain exhaled slightly a part sigh part release of tension im sorry to have to bring you this news moniques lip trembled as she stared at poullain it took a moment for what hed said to sink in then she turned sharply away got up and walked over to the window her back to them her shoulders slumped and she cradled her head in one hand shaking it slowly her jaw line tensed as she fought back the tears jeanluc stared at his wifes back for a moment unsure whether to get up and comfort her there was some awkwardness some tension between them in the end he stayed where he was and looked down at the table smoothing it with one hand his face was slightly flushed a mixture of anger at poullains news and frustration he wasnt there to save his son and now he even felt too impotent to comfort his own wife dominic noticed the muscles tensing in jeanlucs neck and thick forearms as he struggled for fresh resolve there was silence for a moment the sound of cicadas from outside was broken only by the crackling of poullains radio finally jeanluc commented as my wife said im sure we dont know anyone like that christian is a very loving trusting child but we know nobody who has taken advantage of that trust or would do so poullain grimaced understandingly im sorry i had to ask but as you appreciate we have to explore every possibility as the radio crackled again poullain asked dominic to answer it dominic left the main door open as he crossed the courtyard to the car it was harrault from the gendarmerie he brought dominic up to date on progress three gendarmes had been out calling on shops in taragnon from am and the item appearing in the mornings la provencal had also attracted some calls harrault felt that poullain should know about one lead in particular madame veillan from the charcuterie was driving out towards ponteves yesterday and saw gaston machanaud on his moped coming out of the lane where we found the boy it looks like we might have struck gold quickly dominic knew machanaud he was a casual farm labourer who filled in with some local poaching what time was this just after three madame veillan aimed to be in ponteves for threefifteen so she was quite sure of the time about fifteen or twenty minutes before the boy was found dominic confirmed that they would be returning to the station before heading out to see the medical examiner so they should have time to go through the call notes hanging up he noticed monique rosselot still by the window she had stopped crying and was staring at him resolutely large soulful eyes which seemed to look right through him alain duclos left the vallon estate early to buy a morning paper deciding to head to brignoles for his morning coffee he wanted to look through the paper in private not with claude or his father looking over his shoulder he picked up a copy of la provencal at a news kiosk close to the cafe took a seat at one of five outside tables and folded out the paper he scanned the front page kruschev and the nuclear test ban treaty in moscow four dead in floods in tournin marseille warehouse fire two dead french navy aids stranded cruise passengers nothing there he felt a twinge of anxiety a murder should have taken precedence over the warehouse fire it should have been there he flicked over the page and was rapidly scanning page two when the item caught his eye on page three boy savagely attacked in taragnon it was a sixth of a page entry describing the discovery of the boy by a local farm worker and the police questioning of people in the village two thirds of the way down duclos froze he had to read the paragraph over again before it sunk in the boy suffered severe head injuries and is now in hospital the police and the family are awaiting news from doctors as to the extent of the injuries the name of the hospital wasnt mentioned duclos felt numb and stared blankly at the same paragraph the text fading out of focus he felt suddenly faint an icy chill gripping him the boy wasnt dead hed found the lane only three minutes from the restaurant his resolve rebuilding on the way everything had gone well except in the final moments hed been disturbed by the tinkling bells of a shepherds goat flock being moved into the adjacent field but he was sure hed felt the skull crush the blood spilling out another few seconds and hed have been able to check the pulse in the neck or wrist check that monsieur what can i get you it took a moment for duclos to detach himself from the paper and register the waiters presence his voice broke slightly as he answered an orange juice coffee with milk and a croissant the waiter nodded and moved away duclos hands shook as he closed the paper and folded it on the table how could he have made such a mistake the boy could have already identified his car in no time the police could trace it back to limoges a few more phone calls and they would know he was on holiday and where he was staying the police could be at the vallon estate that same day they might even be there on his return he shivered involuntarily his stomach churning with fear suddenly he felt very alone and vulnerable he couldnt go back to the estate and he would also have to change his car perhaps he would head for monte carlo and the italian border or the other direction to spain then what he wiped the sweat from his brow he realized he wasnt thinking rationally closing his eyes he fought to calm his nerves and think clearly his own breathing seemed louder in the self imposed darkness his heartbeat pounding a solid tattoo through his head along with the sounds of passing traffic he had to concentrate to filter any clear thoughts through a few minutes passed before the faint background shuffle and rattle of the tray of the waiter returning made him look up again some ideas had started forming as the waiter set down his breakfast duclos asked if he had a telephone yes at the back of the cafe the waiter pointed the bar was narrow and busy and duclos had to edge and push past the workmen and truck drivers having early morning coffees with brandy and pernod chasers the large directory on the shelf beneath the phone was the first thing duclos reached for he leafed through it rapidly there were only two hospitals he could think of in aix en provence where it was likely the boy could have been taken and one in aubagne the name of the second large hospital in aix had momentarily escaped him he had to call out to the barman to be reminded duclos took a pen from his shirt pocket and grabbed a serviette from the counter to write on as the barman mouthed the word above the noise of the bar montperrin duclos noted the numbers from the directory of the three hospitals on the same serviette then made his way back to the tables out front he didnt want to call from the bar too many people close by who could listen in he took a quick sip of orange juice and coffee put down enough money to cover the bill and left turning the corner he found a phone kiosk he dialled the montperrin first i wondered if you could help me i understand you have a young boy at your hospital by the name of christian rosselot he would have been brought in just yesterday one moment duclos could hear the flicking of paper it went on a long time as if the receptionist was checking twice finally im sorry i dont see anyone registered by that name thank you duclos called the second aixenprovence hospitals centre hospitalier im sorry to trouble you i understand you have a young boy registered at the hospital brought in yesterday christian rosselot and who may i ask is enquiring hes a friend of my son michel from school michel bourdin i wondered what room he might be staying in we would like to send some flowers and perhaps visit ne quittez pas one moment duclos was nervous during the wait he had no idea if she was suspicious or what instructions she was receiving the other end it was a full minute before she returned the boy is still in intensive care but when he can be moved he will be in one of the five private annexe rooms of benat ward when will that be it could be tonight tomorrow or even two days or a week from now hes still in a coma now and cant be moved until hes conscious there are strict instructions in any case for no visitors but family but if you still want to send some flowers theyll be put in his room yes thank you thats a good idea duclos felt a twinge of relief as he hung up but he knew it could be short lived at any time the boy could regain consciousness and talk he just couldnt sit back and let that happen seven the light of a single candle reflected against the glass monique rosselots concerned profile was caught in its glow looking through the large glass partition towards her son in intensive care the partition separated the small preparation and observation room no more than eight foot square from the main intensive care room monique rosselot sat in one of three chairs close to the glass shed been allowed to bring in a candle only one and light it as part of her daily bedside vigil two to three hours each visit the attending nurse had been gone for a full minute monique decided to go inside the intensive care room there was no chair so she knelt at christians side after a second of studying his features thoughtfully she reached out and started tracing one finger gently down his face memories flooded back of the many times she had stroked his face of him smiling back at her at bedtime asking her to read him a story his skin had been warmer then and it felt strange and somehow remote stroking his skin with no response no smile no bright eyes turning towards her she had to be careful as she ran her finger down not to disturb any of the tubes feeding and monitoring the story read she would reach out and ruffle his hair only now his head had been shaved clean his skull marked out for the tests theyd made stitches marked a grotesque gash to one side monique closed her eyes and gripped christians hand but it felt even cooler than his face and suddenly a pang of fear gripped her inside oh god please please dont let him die her eyes scrunched tight at the unthinkable christians prone figure blurred through tears as they slowly opened again she tried to push from her mind what had been done to him the cold hard details from the two visting gendarmes the sexual assault the repeated blows which had left him for dead her tears had mostly been in private but then that had reflected how shed felt almost throughout her vigil alone jeanluc had merely absorbed himself more in his farmwork to cope hed only visited the hospital once with her now gripping christians small hand in hers she wouldnt have wanted it any other way she probably wouldnt have grabbed this moment of intimacy if jeanluc had been with her shed only done this once before and then too had felt like a thief sneaking in and stealing something she shouldnt stealing a few minutes of intimacy with her son perhaps their last she shook her head no that wasnt going to happen she would see christian smile again feel the warmth of his embrace she gripped the small hand tighter willing the message home willing christian to awake the candle burning reminded her of birthdays and she remembered then that it would be christians birthday soon her mind flashing back to past birthdays with him smiling in the glow of the candles unwrapping presents expectantly the topo gigio doll a model car racetrack his bicycle only last birthday the house filled with joy and laughter and suddenly she felt more assured his coming birthday something close and real on which she could focus could actually picture christians presence its your birthday soon christian she muttered therell be some great presents for you ill bake a cake bigger and better than youve ever seen before in her minds eye she could imagine christian looking on with wide eyes and smiling at the oversized cake and in that brief moment she felt sure that christian would awaken was able to ignore the coldness of the small hand in her grasp well all be there now let us see what we have here dr besnard the chief medical examiner had a manila folder already opened in front of him as if hed been studying it before they entered a duty nurse ushered dominic and poullain to upright seats opposite his large mahogany desk poullain knew besnard from four previous cases mostly car accidents young boy christian yves rosselot ten years old eleven on the september just over two weeks from now admitted on august at pm besnard flicked forward a page and then back again in his early fifties he was bald except for some long wisps of greying brown hair he cradled his head for a moment smoothing the wisps across as he looked up again so the medics recorded arriving on the scene at pm the boy was wearing shorts but no shirt and he was laying face down his back exposed there was blood visible on his head and shoulder quite thick obviously from a wound to the head some smaller blood spots were noted on the boys back from the same wound and also a blood trail mostly coagulated on the boys inside thigh this was obviously from a separate wound the shorts were therefore cut with surgical scissors and the blood flow was discovered to have come from the rectal passage the wound was not active there was no fresh blood so their efforts were concentrated on the head wound besnard looked up at poullain periodically marking off his position in the file with one finger as he glanced at dominic as if waiting for his notes to keep pace xrays complex fractures haemotomas somatosensory cortex the pages of dominics notepad were already filled with notes from the surgeon whod operated on christian the night before medical notes in shorthand were a nightmare effectively only the conjoining words could be shortened poullain had arranged that dominic take the notes then wait on poullain for the meeting with besnard but there had been a spare thirty minutes for dominic in between pale green tiling and cream emulsion walls the clatter of heels and voices along bare and stark corridors dominic found the atmosphere unsettling hed spent far too much of the past year in hospitals images of the doctor approaching footsteps echoing ominously telling him the results of his mothers biopsy a year two years if she was lucky no unfortunately there wasnt much they could do except administer morphine in the closing stages to ease the pain check ups every three months but let us know if the pain becomes too much in between clearing the airway of any residual blood was a priority so a tracheal tube was inserted besnards finger ran quickly down the page fortunately the boy was face down otherwise he would have probably choked on his own blood before they arrived the wound was cleaned and the source of the blood flow as a ruptured blood vessel was discovered as was a likely skull fracture though not immediately the extent of the fracture that showed up later on xray badly bruised and broken skin also on the right cheekbone blood by then coagulated possible fracture beneath the patient was therefore bandaged both to stem the blood flow and support the skull oxygen was administered once the airway was cleared then he was transported here to the hospital from which point on verthuy in emergency attended conclusions from the medics report and dr verthuy first of all time of the attack besnard looked up pointedly from the extent of blood coagulation around the main wound and rate of new blood seepage their estimate was that the attack took place any time between an hour and an hour and a half before they arrived as for the other injury to the boys rectal passage this was more or less the same time possibly only minutes beforehand but probably the most interesting factor was from verthuys note on the boys sexual assault he discovered varying degrees of rectal inflammation and damage suggesting that in fact two attacks had taken place at entirely separate intervals besnards pause for emphasis had the desired effect on poullain poullain sat forward keenly two attacks how far apart thirty minutes forty minutes one hour at most but definitely two separate assaults one area at the neck of the rectal canal which had been bleeding had almost completely coagulated by the time the second attack was made dominic could sense that poullain was still grappling with the timing of the attack when he was hit with this new information dominic had already written on his pad attack hours before medics arrive pm anything from minutes before discovery sexual assault minutes beforehand now dominic wrote separate sexual attack minutes prior to final assault that meant that at the outside estimate the attacker had stayed close to the path up to an hour and half resting a full hour in between and at the least he had stayed there almost fortyfive minutes resting for half an hour surely someone else would have come along the path in the time where had he hidden any semen detected on either attack asked poullain no none verthuy found nothing in the rectal passage apart from blood and inflamed tissue all the blood is also of one type b positive the boys blood group our attacker obviously was careful and pulled out to ejaculate did forensics find anything poullain pictured the succession of polythene bagged samples taken from the wheat field by the marseille team their report was due the next day but they didnt know till now that the attacker had probably ejaculated on the ground would they have looked for that as a matter or course a few droplets of semen among the wheat probably by then hopelessly dried and crystallised by the heat of the sun if not by now it had probably been washed away with last nights rain im not sure yet poullain commented ill know tomorrow other points of interest in verthuys report besnards finger skipped a few paragraphs instrument of attack a rock or large stone determined from rock particles found in the boys hair and embedded in skull tissue four blows in total one breaking the skull and rupturing a blood vessel another blow tore heavily through the skin and shattered the right cheekbone bone fragments were removed though constructive surgery will later be required for the cheekbone eleven sutures were required for the skull wound eighteen for the cheek suspecting internal cranial haematomas verthuy ordered a series of xrays at pm minutes after the boys entry into emergency the boy was comatose throughout and still remains so with the only break from intensive care for surgery last night at the hands of dr trichot notes of which you already have besnard nodded towards dominic trichots full report is expected sometime tomorrow but i can let you have a copy of verthuys report now you might find something small that i havent covered in summary he passed across a carbon copy while poullain flicked through dominic asked any estimates for how long for each sexual assault besnard looked forward then back a page no longer than a few minutes for each one though verthuy suggests the second was perhaps shorter purely because it was less forceful they were silent for a second as poullain continued looking through the folder finally he looked up possibly therell be some questions when i read it in more detail back at the gendarmerie but thats fine for now thank you youve been most helpful besnard came out from behind his desk to show them out making small talk about the continuing august heat and how it slowed work doctors and gendarmes were probably the only city officials not to disappear for the month en masse to the coast call of duty or foolhardiness you tell me the corridor was quiet as they made their way along and down the stairway activity increased as they approached the first floor what arrangements for machanauds interview tomorrow dominic enquired poullain had decided earlier they would interview machanaud the next day but the time and place hadnt been fixed i think we should go out to visit him initially try not to make it look too official and serious if a second interview is necessary well ask him in apparently hes working at raulins farm most of tomorrow but we should try and get to him by eleventhirty before he has a chance to hit the bars and the other leads that came in today poullain looked at dominic pointedly lets not lose sight of the fact that at present machanaud is our main suspect a curt reminder that earlier that afternoon theyd had words for the first time on the investigation machanaud was a drunkard a parttime poacher and vagabond and with his wild stories and bar room antics when drunk was viewed as odd by at least half of taragnon but a murderer it was ridiculous and dominic had made the mistake of voicing that thought but what was the alternative the enquiries had centred on anything out of place in taragnon imbued strongly with the belief that nobody local could do anything so atrocious this had translated into people out of place the only other leads were a van with lyon markings and a traveller passing through as if appeasing for his previous sharp tone poullain commented youll probably be pleased to hear that another lead came up late this afternoon cafe fontduroux just over a kilometre from where the boy was found barman saw a green alfa romeo coupe he hadnt seen before its driver had lunch there but dominic wasnt particularly pleased it was too simplistic misfits machanaud because of his oddball nature at times and now three others purely because they were strangers village thinking was one track and poullain and his merry men lacked the imagination to push it that one stage further ahead a crowd at the reception caused a small bottle jam for people entering and exiting the hospital doctors and nurses crisscrossed the passage from the main admittance hall and emergency a face among the crowd stared at them briefly startled and concerned but among the milling confusion of people it hardly registered and the figure turned and was lost again in the crowd as it made its way swiftly out of the hospital alain duclos headed for the coast at first he had decided on cannes and juanlespins but then he realized he just couldnt face the people and frenetic activity he headed instead for st tropez the village was quiet and the beach wasnt too crowded because of its expanse there were wide open areas where duclos could walk and think or sit in solitude away from the groups of sunbathers he wondered if the gendarmes had noticed him at the hospital he kicked himself now for taking such a risk but hed found it difficult to think clearly or function since reading the newspaper and phoning the hospital leaving the bar that morning hed headed out of brignoles towards castellane and the mountains he stopped close to the point sublime and looked out over the canyon du verdon the view was breathtaking the wind sweeping up sharply from the valley floor ruffling his hair he closed his eyes and let the refreshing coolness play over his skin but it did little to clear his thoughts the wind playing through the treetops in his final moment of pleasure the rustle of wheat sheaves as he brought the rock down repeatedly on the boys skull shifting wheat rising and falling on the wind white noise merging with the sound of waves gently breaking he opened his eyes slowly he scanned the horizon of st tropez bay two distant yachts and a fishermans boat showed as white flecks against a deep blue canvass children played in the shallows the view was different now but the images in his mind remained the same perhaps he hoped the grandeur of the vistas would override the images in his mind or was he simply seeking solitude space to think clearly in the end none of it touched his soul he still felt desperately empty inside and confused after the mountains hed headed back to the vallon estate for lunch claude and his father had hardly seen him in the past twentyfour hours hed picked at his food through lunch struggling even to make small talk and he was sure theyd noticed his preoccupation the obsession haunted every spare moment when his thoughts were free respites through outside distractions were brief the sun was weak now above the bay it was almost seven thirty he hoped to make a better show of it that night for dinner at the estate and headed back dinner was impressive caviar daubergines daurade cuite sur litiere and gelee damande aux fruits frais served by the estate chef there was vintage red wine from the vallon cellars and cheeses coffee and cognac to finish the conversation was animated claude talking about arranging a day on one of the carmargue ranches and duclos even managed his own anecdote about one of his first disastrous experiences riding a brittany seaside donkey though later his conversation petered out the images resurging to plague him and he excused himself early and went to bed it was difficult getting to sleep he kept replaying in his mind entering the hospital pushing past the crowd by the reception then seeing the two gendarmes and turning quickly away he could have milled with the crowd for a moment kept his back turned until theyd gone then continued along the corridor if only hed kept his head the night was hot humidity high and he turned incessantly to get comfortable sleep finally came after almost two hours the dream was confusing the boys eyes were looking back at him from the darkness of the boot haunting pleading then the boy was playing in the shallows at st tropez and duclos was hovering above him with the rock silently willing the boy to move away from the crowds but when the boy looked up at him directly he was smiling his eyes suddenly mischievous and defiant the boy was mouthing some words softly and duclos had to move closer to hear what he was saying the words were a tease whispers almost lost among the wash of the surf thin red strands appeared like spider webbing slowly thickening seeping across the clear blue shallows blood that at any minute others on the beach would see as soon as i open my mouth they will know they will know duclos awoke with a jolt almost knocking the clock off his small side table as he grappled to look at the time am his hands were shaking he knew it would be impossible to get back to sleep so he went down to the kitchen to make coffee he decided to sit on the chateaus back terrace overlooking the pool and watch the sunrise he was on his second cup of coffee just over an hour later when claude joined him after a few attempts at small talk claude sensed his consternation and asked what was wrong knowing that he might get the same questions over the following days he answered that it was a girl hed met two days ago at juan les pins hed arranged to meet her on the same stretch of beach the afternoon before but she hadnt showed claude half smiled she must have got to you badly you look quite ill quite ill in different circumstances duclos would have burst out laughing claude could be such a prat at times in the end all he managed was a weak smile in return but at least the past torturous hours had strengthened his resolve the obsession was destroying him the constant fight to keep hiding it fraying his nerves and he just couldnt cope any longer there was only one way to end it he would have to return to the hospital dominic opened the door slowly the first thing he saw was monique rosselots profile reflected in candlight against the glass screen shapes beyond the glass were more indistinct with the reflections monique didnt notice him immediately and dominic gave a small nod of acknowledgement as she finally looked up then he looked towards the prone figure of christian beyond the partition the wires and intravenous feed tubes looked somehow obscene on such a small body desecration apart from the tubes the harsh reminder that doctors were fighting for his life the boy looked like one of botticellis gently sleeping angels though his burnished curls had gone shaved off for the operation the night before the pain of the ordeal the daily waiting without knowing was etched on moniques face her anguish was almost tangible pervading the small room though he knew that the full depth of her pain was beyond him he could understand it and feel desperately sorry for her without really feeling it himself would it make him deal with the investigation more effectively if he had make the battle he feared was brewing with poullain over charges against machanaud any easier dominic eased the door shut monique looked up again fleetingly a faint pained grimace of thanks or goodbye through the closing gap he didnt want to disturb her hed had to call back to the hospital to pick up the final surgical report so decided to look in for a moment some visual reference to match with the medical descriptions in answer to his concern about the boys safety theyd only been able to allocate a gendarme two hours each day though when monique rosselot wasnt visiting besnard had assured that a nurse would always be in attendance dominic shook his head as he made his way down the corridor poullain machanaud the interview with machanaud hadnt gone well still it had only been a casual visit to the farm where machanaud had been working that morning the true test would come tomorrow with the official interview in the gendarmerie but why would machanaud lie about his whereabouts dominic had no ready answers to that when poullain posed the question and poullains keenness had been sickeningly transparent other than to shield his own guilt suddenly the question was rhetorical dominics opinion was superfluous dominic could imagine poullain already preparing the charge statement in his mind one hand playing distractedly with his handcuffs the glory of the case solved early dominic made his way out of the hospital and started up his bike evening traffic in aix was light and within minutes he was on the n heading for bauriac officially his duty shift had ended half an hour ago the hospital had been his last call after picking up the forensics report from marseille but poullain wanted summary notes on both reports by am so he would have to do them later that night the day had been busy the meeting with pierre bouteille had taken over an hour and a half in the morning while a prominent case for bauriac filed under grievous assault it was probably just one of many such regional cases on bouteilles desk court clerks with files and the telephone interrupted at intervals throughout bouteille would now determine the best point of crossover general to official enquiry and handing over to the examining magistrate frederic naugier dominic panned back again through the meeting and the events of the day trying to pick up on small details that might be significant but his thoughts were dulled by overload he found it impossible to focus he pulled back on the throttle the wind rush was fresh exhilarating alain duclos circled the hospital for the third time each time he took a different street a block further away until he felt sure hed covered all the streets within reasonable walking distance of the hospital he didnt want to make the same mistake as the day before almost walk into two gendarmes the black citroen cvs and dss were practically standard police issue he saw only one black cv two blocks away stopping briefly and looking inside it had no police radio he turned the corner and went another two hundred yards before parking the hospital was now four blocks away he was conscious too of his conspicuous car of it not being seen too close to the hospital duclos kept close to the buildings as he walked along turning his head from the road as cars approached it was relatively quiet that time of night pm only three cars passed in the first two streets turning the corner he passed a busy restaurant with a large picture window looking out onto the street a babble of voices some muted laughter and merriment a lone face catching his eye as he scurried past it brought home stronger the solitude of his mission now he should be with claude and some friends at a restaurant on the coast instead he was sneaking through the back streets like a thief his nerves at fever pitch his eyes had probably looked wild and startled to the people hed passed in the restaurant at least this time hed planned more thoroughly with a story that his son went to the same school and he wanted to ensure that flowers arrived while madame rosselot was there the receptionist informed him that she normally visited every day arriving anything between four and five and staying two or three hours though on two occasions she also visited in the morning for an hour or so he timed to arrive just after the evening visit rounding the next corner the hospital entrance was fifty yards ahead he paused for a second taking a deep breath then continued at a steady pace he didnt want to look hesitant be stopped at reception and asked what he wanted there was a small crowd at the reception and the two nurses behind hardly paid attention one had her head down studying something in the register the other was deep in conversation duclos only gave them a brief sideways glance not wanting to attract undue attention as he made his way quickly through the main hallway to the stairway and elevator he waited only a second before deciding on the stairs too many prying eyes close by in the elevator people who might talk to him ask him which way for so and so ward notice on which floor he got off on the stairs he would be far more anonymous second floor far end of corridor room a his heartbeat seemed to pulse through to his head its rhythm almost matching the stark echo of his footsteps as he made his way along the second floor corridor at its end was a t where it split in two directions with markings and arrows indicating the different departments it looked like a was close to the end duclos shortened his step as he got close to the door almost unconsciously he held his breath the last few steps reaching one hand out for the door handle his hand hovered by the handle for a second then he retracted it wiping the sweat that had built up on his palm on his trouser leg the plan was straight in his mind if anyone was there or he was confronted he would say that hed arranged to meet mrs rosselot had he missed her another deep breath forcing the air deep into his lungs to calm his nerves he reached for the handle turning it the room opened out before him a womans profile dark hair a candle glowing a bed and instruments through a glass partition a splitsecond impression the woman started to look up duclos closed the door again equally as swiftly a sudden exhalation release of tension he headed quickly away afraid that the woman might come to the door and open it look out to see who had been there not daring to look back duclos listened intently for sounds behind him none came he turned the corner of the t safety again he was sure the woman hadnt seen him it was probably the boys mother madame rosselot he cursed his bad luck she should have left at least fifteen minutes ago suddenly a door to his side opened startling him he almost jumped out of his skin as a nurse and hospital porter came out duclos covered hastily with a sheepish grin but they hardly paid him any attention as they headed towards the stairs duclos thought about giving up heading back out of the hospital coming back another day his nerves were shot a trembling deep in his stomach his body weak from lack of sleep and nervous anticipation but he knew that if he left now he would never come back he wouldnt be able to face the same ordeal again he went across to a bench a few paces to one side with a clear view of the stairway and when he leant across the full length of the corridor and room a at its end perhaps he could wait it out she was already fifteen minutes late how much longer could she stay he fought to relax again breathing deeply and steadily but with each passing minute he became increasingly agitated two fresh sets of heels hed heard only to lean over and see people coming out of other rooms false alarms only a few minutes had passed but it seemed like a lifetime another set of heels faint at first started their echoing clipping he leant across half expecting another false alarm then pulled back quickly catching his breath at last his pulse raced counting each beat of the slowly receding footsteps he waited a full twenty seconds after they had faded down the stairway then concentrated on the sounds around for a moment no fresh footsteps on the stairway or the corridor he got up and made his way along covering the distance steadily half of his senses attuned to the sounds around the rest focused on what lay ahead the door approaching closer the last few footsteps reaching out for the handle listening for a brief second for any sounds beyond nothing the corridor was empty no fresh footsteps approaching slowly he turned the handle the door opened the view steadily expanding nobodyinside a quick release of breath then he looked through the glass screen to the larger room beyond stepping fully into the small anteroom closing the door quickly behind him the boy lay beyond the glass partition his skin pallid like yellow porcelain wires and tubes connected and monitoring it was certainly the boy from the day before and there was nobody else in the room duclos mouth was dry with anticipation the boys breathing was probably so shallow that all he would have to do was reach out and cover his nose and mouth for a minute to finish him but he would have to be quick at any moment somebody could come back in the room his nerves were racing his palm suddenly clammy on the handle of the door to the main room his whole body trembled and he felt cold even though the night air was close to f with a final deep breath he opened the door and stepped inside when this old world starts getting me down and people are just too much for me to face i climb right up to the top of the stairs and all my cares just drift right into space on the roof the only place i know where you just have to wish to make it so dominic lay on his back on his bedroom terrace staring up at the star lit sky above bauriac the drifters on his record player soothing his thoughts it was one of the best songs of the year his favourite the record had been in his collection and on louis juke box since early january just as it was climbing up the american billboard charts files and notes lay scattered over his bedroom floor hed finished his summary report for poullain all but the last paragraph hed searched for the right tone that key phrase which neatly encapsulated everything before finally giving up after half an hour and deciding on a break to clear his thoughts his mother had gone to bed over an hour before with some hot chocolate and biscuits just after ten the days basic household activities seemed to tire her earlier by the day hed positioned his record player close to the double terrace doors so that it didnt disturb her asleep downstairs his mind drifted back to algeria the foreign legion where hed first found the habit of laying on his back staring up at the stars the desert sky had been even more spectacular crystal clear skies of deep blue velvet sprinkled with a snowstorm of stars after a few months the idea had caught on with half the platoon somebody would light a camp fire hed spend a while rigging up his record player to a car battery and would put on some ray charles or sam cooke and on occasions some hashish would appear that somebody had picked up at a souq it was easier to get hashish in algeria than alcohol the sessions made him popular with comrades the thought that they were laying in the middle of the desert cut off from civilization and all they knew yet listening to the very latest sounds courtesy of dominics uncle almost two months before the rest of france had the privilege it somehow made them feel in touch in tune compensated for the isolation the legion had left its scars not so much on him personally hed been a back room radio and communications sergeant and had hardly seen any fighting but with his present career the gendarmerie treated exforeign legion recruits with an air of suspicion as if they were all unarmed combat experts or reformed cutthroat murderers at the end of the last century with uprisings in morocco and algeria many recruits had come from the french prison system an alternative to the bastille or devils island but not in the last few decades dominic didnt trouble to put them right tell them hed hardly seen any action during the algerian war sometimes the tough guy image had its advantages colleagues were careful not to tread on his toes local prejudices could be used to advantage but he feared that they might work against machanaud if the interview didnt go well tomorrow the forensics report revealed little the blood tested was the boys group no semen deposits were found and there were no startling fibre discoveries rock particles found in the blood confirmed the medical examiners suspicion about murder weapon though no blood stained rock had been found by the search team nor the boys shirt and the few items of paper from the field and a mans torn jacket and shoe by the river bank looked too weathered to be connected still theyd been passed to forensics for checking with little or no forensics findings they became more reliant on the timing of the attack and eye witnesses which pointed back to machanaud but with his protest to poullain the day before that it was ridiculous to suspect machanaud he was just a troublesome drunkard and poacher if poullains look of thunderous reproach was any gauge of local opinion dominic feared it could rise swiftly against machanaud like himself and louis machanaud was from outside originally from the foothills of the pyrannees and had been in bauriac less than three years more than a few times dominic or others from the gendarmerie had been called to a local bar because of machanauds drunken antics machanaud would usually either want to sing or fight or both having warmed up for the evenings renditions with stories of his wartime exploits how as a young lad of eighteen in the resistance he tried to blow up a nazi truck with vital supplies but the truck spun off the road and hit him and hed ended up with a metal plate in his head most villagers thought he was half mad and treated him with a mixture of suspicion and contempt perhaps the other leads would prove fruitful and divert attention away from machanaud when hed phoned the gendarmerie earlier servan brought him up to date on progress a green alpha romeo had been seen in pourrieres the number taken and they were now putting through a trace request with vehicle registration in paris the lyon van was seen sixty kilometeres away about the time of the attack and no news yet on the passing traveller dominic sat up filtering down through his thoughts his summary notes finally gelled he went back to the folder before the thought flow went and wrote distinct lack of forensic evidence no other blood groups other than the boys no semen no fibres the weapon cannot be found nor the boys shirt whoever committed this crime was extremely careful if we are to suspect machanaud then we also have to ask ourselves is he really the type to be this careful and meticulous dominic scanned quickly back over the report the time gap between the two attacks had introduced a new puzzling perspective but with no specific relevance to suspicion of machanaud whoever had made the attack the question was the same where had they been in that time no other area of flattened wheat had been discovered and from the strength of body imprints where the attack was finally made the marseille teams view was that it had been occupied for no more than ten minutes the supposition was therefore that beforehand the boy and his assailant had been by the riverbank mostly obscured by trees and bushes from the bordering farm lane or somewhere else the record had finished without dominic noticing the needle clicking repeatedly on the inner circle dominic took it off and put on sam cookes another saturday night then came back onto the terrace he closed his eyes for a moment as he laid back then opened them again letting the broad blanket of the sky and the mass of stars sink slowly through his consciousness suffuse through his body until it touched every nerve end touched his soul solitude a single candle flickered at the back of his mind monique rosselots profile partly in shadow against the dancing light a raw essence of beauty and motherhood hoping and praying that her only son lived he remembered in algeria a woman at the souq in el asnam he never normally paid much attention to the local women generally a nondescript rabble covered from nose to toe in black sheets this woman had been dressed the same except that her eyes above her face mask had been large and captivating and shed met his stare for a second longer than was probably considered discreet her eyes laughed at him provocatively hazel with green flecks soulful bright then she was gone disappearing quickly among the market stalls and back street warrens of the souq many times since he had wondered what her face looked like images forming in the flames of the campfire or from the starry depths of the velvet sky during those long and lonely desert nights but the image that superimposed now as the face veil was gently removed was of monique rosselot he shook the image away sam cooke was singing its hard on a fella when he dont know his way around if i dont find a honey to help me spend my money im gonna have to blow this town it reminded dominic of one of his last dates with odette the song had been playing at a fairground theyd visited in draguignan another saturday night bright lights candy floss a fluffy baby blue toy cat hed won for her at the rifle range but the single candle burned through the sullen but proud profile half in shadow reflected against the glass he found it hard to get the image of monique rosselot out of his mind eight session am th february stuart capel looked anxiously at the door ahead through it he could hear only muted mumbling only the occasional word could be picked up clearly he leant forward keenly his arms resting on his knees around him were a mixture of diplomas dr david lambourne phd mr psych and theatre posters collection of magazines on a small coffee table no receptionist just an answerphone that would kick in only two calls the past fifteen minutes but despite stuarts posture every nerve and muscle tense his jaw set tight his eyes were dull and unfocused dulled by the nightmare of the past two months clinging to one last chance as his hands clasped and unclasped oh god i hope this will help i hope this will help and so youll be twelve soon eyran is that right yes in april the fifteenth and what would you like for your birthday lambourne asked any thoughts i dont know really i was going to get a surf board in san diego eyran drifted off for a second scanning the ceiling the couch he was laying on was old and overstuffed with a fading floral print it would have looked more at home in a country cottage than a psychiatrists office in holborn perhaps a new bike some more computer games have you thought of asking for a pet a dog maybe no not really but the boy two doors away has got a red setter we went playing in the fields with it a few days back did you get on well with the boy yes sort of his names kevin hes two years older than me he was asking a lot about san diego said that hed like to go there fresh faced lightbrown hair a few faint freckles across the bridge of his nose it was difficult for lambourne to relate the boy before him with what he knew from the report on his desk accident victim nineteen day coma temporal and parietal lobe trauma both parents lost in the same accident and now possible psychological discordance increasingly violent dreams and development of a secondary character to push away acceptance of his parents death have you ever had a pet before asked lambourne no but i like them dogs more than cats maybe you should ask your uncle for one with all of those fields around it could be fun the perfect place for a dog it had come out of his discussion with stuart capel the day before new object attachments to help diminish what eyran had lost and at school any friends yet i understand that you started at the beginning of last week only one simon he was at my primary school from before in england i didnt know him so well then but were becoming friendlier now and how are you getting on with tessa okay but shes a few years younger than me she has her own friends david lambourne looked down at his notes briefly was about to ask another question about home or school trying to gauge how eyran was settling in when eyran continued my other old friends from before are too far away though i went over to broadhurst farm the other day with kevin being there with his dog reminded me of sarah and salman her labrador we used to play there years ago before i went to america they were in one of my first dreams too early lambourne didnt want to explore the dreams yet his first aim was to put eyran at ease establish comfortable ground birthday presents friends possibly a pet from his two hour meeting with stuart capel the previous day hed planned his guideposts well he knew that the mention of a pet would trigger eyran mentioning one friend school another but the past kept interjecting san diego old friends and memories spoiling the rhythm how are you settling in at your uncles house i understand youre right out in the country it must be nice yes its very nice my room looks over fields at the back so theyve given you one of the best rooms in the house faint smile from eyran the first so far stuart capel had told him eyran smiled rarely uneasily was generally slow to respond it was one of stuarts main areas of concern and youve got all your favourite things around you lambourne continued building on areas of familiarity but the answers gradually became more stilted and relied on past reference understandable eyran had only been in the house six weeks his main memory of it was from when he lived with his parents nearby eyran was still preoccupied with the old house its position and distance from his uncles house its only four or five miles away and broadhurst farm is just at the back when i look out of my bedroom window now theres a hill in the distance its not too far the other side of that and thats where you went with kevin the other day thats quite a distance to walk it wasnt too bad i wanted to see how it had changed from before perhaps i might have bumped into some of my old friends there it was strange the pond was much smaller than i remembered and in one of my dreams it was enormous present past and now the dreams again it was a hopscotch each time lambourne dragged him to the present eyran leapt back the week before i drove past there with uncle stuart but we just looked up from the field behind that leads up to the copse we didnt go in i see stuart capel had mentioned the significance of the copse that at least two of eyrans dreams had taken place there but lambourne didnt want to let on that he knew it was important that eyran revealed the significance in his own words although lambourne had planned to delay exploring the dreams until the second session one area of the dreams might be worth exploring now in the dreams who do you see most your mother or your father or do they both appear equally my father appears more in the first two dreams my mother didnt appear at all then when i did finally see her she was distant out of reach in another dream i wasnt even sure whether i saw her or not it was misty and i thought she was just ahead of my father but i might have just been imagining it it wasnt very clear and do either of them speak to you in the dreams my father has twice my mother never on the one occasion i was sure i saw her she was turned from me walking away and i was trying to catch up i see lambourne glanced at his notes one area where the dreams offered a convenient allegory it would have been awkward to ask straight out which parent eyran felt closest to did you catch up with your parents in any of the dreams no my father was closest but he always remained just out of reach do you think theres any reason why your father appears more than your mother in the dreams were you closer to him when i was younger no but as i got older i felt i could talk to him more you know if i was having trouble with someone picking a fight some problem with my bike or selection for the school football team i just felt hed know more about those things than my mum so you went to him for help confided in him more but you felt equally close to both of them yes and did you love them both equally mum and dad stupid question but it was necessary to have eyran say it admit the attachment before he started suggesting other object attachments yes and do you miss them longer pause this time eyrans brow was slightly furrowed yes of course clasping unclasping the muted voices through the door after a while made stuarts mind drift back through the nightmare which had finally brought him to david lambournes office hands clasped behind his back as he looked out at the view two large palm trees like sentinels either side of the garden a faint mist rising from the swimming pool december in southern california moments break from packing boxes with jeremys personal papers and mementoes behind him helena jeremys mexican maid saying something he didnt quite catch on arrival shed grasped his hand extended in greeting in both hers as she looked deep into his eyes and expressed her sorrow he could tell that she had been crying and as she kept grip a second longer willing home her emotions with eyes brimming with watery compassion she burst into tears again hed cried enough on the flight over and since identifying the bodies of his brother and allison in the morgue seeing eyran laying helpless and prostrate in the hospital bed to be able to join her death the morning mist somehow mirrored his mood looking through the sliding windows towards the pool and patio happier times jeremy at the barbecue eyran and tessa swimming allison and amanda sipping long island iced teas and preparing a salad he snapped himself away back to packing boxes another minefield of memories jeremys diplomas from cambridge and his bar exams photos with his old rugby team in hertfordshire him and jeremy sitting at a restaurant table in mykonos one of their few holidays together theyd been in their early twenties and stuart couldnt even remember the name of jeremys girlfriend at the time who had taken the picture two boxes had already been filled with a mixture of photos papers mementoes and small ornaments how long did it take to tidy away the personal effects of a lifetime leave the room neat and tidy so no memories no trace remained the day before had been a nightmare a blizzard of paperwork and officialdom forms to be filled out at the police station and morgue more at the hospital then onto jeremys employers hassler and gertz to deal with jeremys probate and insurance details it seemed that all hed done since arriving in california was sign papers autograph his brothers aftermath perhaps it was all part of the grieving process youve now witnessed and signed fifteen papers relating to your brothers death surely you can now finally accept that he is dead hadnt he read somewhere that the grieving process didnt start until after acceptance then when stuart went finally into eyrans room the thought of eyran at that moment in the hospital deep in coma barely clinging to life gripped him hard posters of pamela anderson the power rangers jurassic park the daytona racetrack it was amazing how quickly they grew up had he started thinking of girls when hed been eleven from the stereo and a small stack of cds to one side he picked out four janet jackson seal madonna ub quick scan of the rest of the room probably the last time he would see it a semiprecious rocks and minerals collection some model sports cars an sx computer with a small box of disks a signed baseball bat a model dolphin from san diego seaworld a large corner box full of assorted toys many obviously from when eyran was much younger stuart bit his lip as he packed but at least this duty carried with it a bit more hope mementoes for the living hands clasping clutched tight to the report as eyrans surgeon in california dr torrens delivered his stark prognosis traumatic intracranial haemotomas two small parietal lobe haemotomas larger temporal lobe haemotoma risk of oedema irregular eeg recording but which one had carried the possibility of later psychological disturbance thought stuart which one at the time all hed hoped and prayed for had been eyran awaking he hadnt looked beyond torrens had mentioned only the possibility of later disorientation of direction topography and shapes due to the temporal lobe haemotoma usually hardly noticeable outside of reading detailed maps or directions or sorting out complex puzzles if thats all were facing be thankful in the end there had been two eeg activity recordings hours and hours respectively before eyran finally waking in answer to his key questions chances of survival how long the coma might last and degrees of damage that might persist if and when eyran finally awoke dr torrens seemed reluctant to speculate hiding mainly behind text book statistics from a cross section of american hospitals stuart recalled that of coma victims made a full recovery and another made recoveries with impairments so slight as to be unnoticeable though a daunting did not survive at all the midground taken up by cases ranging from moderate disablement to complete vegetative states easy to get lost in the medical terminology stuart thought acceptance by conditioning concern and grief all so real when focused on a loved one swallowed up as part of the grander scale of general statistics affecting all coma patients the first shock had come learning that eyrans heart had stopped for seconds when first admitted stuart had asked if that might have contributed but torrens felt that the direct head injuries and cranial haemotomas were likely the prime cause of coma clasping as a nurse had led him finally to eyrans bedside an image to match with torrens stark report tubes and wires feeding and monitoring eyrans face grey and wan he found it hard to relate with the eyran he remembered so full of curiosity and enthusiasm and suddenly came to mind a day out in his sports car eyran at his side cheeks rosy with the crisp air eyran had been only six and they were driving up highgate hill stuart pointed theatrically towards the cemetery do you know whos buried there karl marx to which eyrans eyes lit up with enthusiasm was he one of the marx brothers it had remained part of stuarts dinner party repertoire for almost two years talk to him torrens had said familiar voices shared memories stuart started with the karl marx incident then went on to relate another story from when eyran had been seven and asked him what was the rudest word at first hed tried to avoid it by saying he didnt know but eyran was persistent but you must know lots of rude words at your age uncle stuart knowing that he couldnt easily escape but not wishing to get into trouble with jeremy for teaching eyran rude words hed finally offered codswollop is that the rudest word yes absolutely its a terrible swear word never to be used but is it the rudest rudest yes its the rudest rudest you must never ever say codswollop a moments thought as eyran compared with what hed heard in the school playground is it ruder than fuck jeremy had burst out laughing when stuart told him finding stuarts vain attempt to preserve his sons already tainted innocence particularly amusing yet another dinner party anecdote eyran too had been let in on the joke later when he was old enough but relating the story to eyran hearing only the echo of his own voice stuart found it unsettling like a comedian on stage with no audience and so half an hour later when his one man dialogue ran out of steam he turned to the cds hed brought from eyrans room and let janet jackson take over familiar voices familiar music torrens had arranged for a player but now listening to the muted mumbling beyond lambournes door he recalled with clarity the feeling that had crept over him in that instant dreading the moment if and when his tearful wishes of eyran awaking were fulfilled that he would have to tell eyran his parents were dead and when that moment did finally come the haunted lost look in eyrans eyes still lingering days and even weeks later he should have guessed then that a part of eyran would always cling on refuse to accept david lambourne flicked back through torrens report so what did he know after the first session the first aim had been to judge eyrans responsiveness made just four days after eyran had revived from his coma the report showed ten to fifteen percent impairment on conventional thought and speech response if anything there had been improvement since then eyrans response had been slow on very few questions though perhaps when he entered the more complex and problematical areas of eyrans dreams responsiveness would drop the barriers would go back up thirty eight percent below average on iq puzzles lambourne couldnt help much there the best indicators would come from maths results at his new school or perhaps he could get some standard tests from st barts for the capels to do at home but the main problem was eyrans increasingly violent dreams and the key question were they a byproduct of the accident and the coma some chemical imbalance causing dementia or a defence mechanism of eyrans subconscious unwilling to accept that his parents were dead with the first lambourne realized hed have limited control swept along on the changing tide of the condition leaving him little range within which to wield influence damage limitation but if it was the latter hed have far more control and at first glance the analysis was straightforward eyran couldnt accept that his parents were dead so his subconscious had manifested various scenarios played out through his dreams where he could find them alive text book freud denial mourningobject attachment though lambourne had conducted his main studies in the freudian school he liked to think that hed kept an open mind on later theories and papers some of them contradictory to freuds principals jung winnicott adler eysenck and then the later radicals lacan laing and rollo may twentytwo years in practice seventeen of them at st barts lambourne prided himself on keeping up to date with his papers and readings felt that he was better equipped than most to pick and choose at the smorgasbord of psychoanalysis return with the plate most suited to his patient lambourne looked around his office the furniture had hardly changed since st barts the same old floral pattern sofa his upright padded seat chair a rolled top walnut desk the dark oak coffee table with a few magazines strategically scattered stuffy country cottage atmosphere which he felt put patients at ease or perhaps it was all just a replica a home away from home modelled on the buckinghamshire country house hed left his wife in their divorce settlement six years previous now he was just a weekend father to their two daughters hed learnt more about object loss during the divorce than through the years of study and practice for the first time hed actually felt what his patients fought to describe in bland monotones he could help solve their problems but not his own hed left st barts a year after the divorce and decided to combine costs by living in he loved the theatre and the main theatre areas and covent garden were a short stroll away past old book stamp and curio shops and one in particular hed discovered specializing in old theatre posters he never used the armchair always the straight backed chair the armchair made him appear too relaxed distant from his patients while in the hard back chair he invariably ended up leaning forward he looked more interested in them throughout the first fourteen years of his practice hed smoked a pipe but with the more responsible age of doctors taking the lead with nonsmoking had given up he immediately found his pipe hand his left at a complete loss and so sucked at an empty pipe during sessions for another three years felt that chewing on the mouthpiece helped him concentrate until one woman patient had been bold enough to question what he was doing as hed explained her puzzled look had made it clear just who of the two of them should be on the couch so now there was no more pipe just one orphaned hand jojo eyrans imaginary dream friend who always promised he could find eyrans parents a simple invention to support nonacceptance of their death or a possibly threatening secondary personality lambourne wondered one of the key factors was going to be separation from reality if any illusions in the dreams started crossing over into eyrans thoughts while awake and if they did to what extent might eyran accept or adopt them at present they were at arms length but jojo trampling through eyrans conscious thoughts could be disastrous there was also the maze of object attachments to fight through not just eyrans loss of his parents but attachments and memories with the house in san diego their previous house in england and old play areas which perhaps due to their closeness to his uncles house were resurging strongly finding his way through was not going to be easy he would need to follow the threads carefully in order to draw out eyrans perception of jojo in the right way then press hard to break eyran away from jojos subconscious influence yet too hard and all trust and patient transference would be lost it was going to be a delicate tightrope and eyran would probably resist him all the way no child wanted to face that their parents were dead and the dreams and jojo were probably the only sanctuary eyran had left nine the courtyard was in moorish style in the panier quarter of marseille two sides framing the courtyard were the house itself on three floors the third the blank wall of the adjacent building the fourth and the entrance to the courtyard were large solid wood double gates studded with black iron with a small door with buzzer inset one side the brothels main entrance and all that was visible from the narrow street emile vacherets establishment was discreet its facade anonymous as its many regulars preferred the centrepiece of the courtyard was a small fountain edged with blue and white mosaic tiling and window sills throughout the building had the same pattern edging some white doves played and strutted in and around the fountain while he waited alain duclos looked out through the ground floor french windows towards the fountain and courtyard prostitution was legal so the anonymity of the building was for the benefit of clients and for the small side attractions offered clients which werent so legal the rooms cleaners servants and waiters in the bar were all young boys mostly from morocco and algeria between the ages of twelve and nineteen though the youngest age on any identity card was sixteen in the event of a police raid vacheret paid heavily to the local precinct each month the boys functions as waiters and room cleaners were mostly a cover they were also there for the clients pleasure if so required for heterosexual clients which was indeed seventy percent of vacherets trade a choice of girls would be paraded in and the boys just served drinks and made the beds afterwards duclos sat on the bed as vacheret introduced two new boys who had arrived in the last week as possible alternatives to his favourite of the last few visits jahlep the two boys wore claret red baggy harem trousers and round neck white shirts one was very young possibly twelve while the other was closer to fourteen or fifteen duclos concentrated on the younger one as vacheret explained that he was a mulatto from martinique exquisite light brown eyes delicate complexion brand new the last week hardly touched vacheret might as well have been trying to sell him a used car duclos thought true the boy was exquisite cream brown skin just the age he liked but he just couldnt concentrate and get up any enthusiasm noticing his hesitancy vacheret commented whats wrong you want a drink while you decide or is there something private you want to ask me about them shall i send the boys away im not sure perhaps give me a minute vacheret ushered the boys away and sat down beside duclos have you decided on jahlep again but you didnt want to say so in front of those two or are you just undecided between jahlep and this new boy perhaps you could try the two together vacheret raised his eyebrows hopefully beads of sweat stood out on duclos forehead and he looked troubled his eyes darting as he contemplated the floor look im sorry i cant think clearly about the boys for the moment maybe later but theres something on my mind something id like to ask you about first vacheret nodded suddenly pensive barely containing a half smile he was sure that duclos was about to enquire about some bizarre practice or fantasy something hed been too coy to mention before it always tickled him this part clients admitting their secret sexual desires it was almost like being a psychiatrist or priest finally clients got around to what was really troubling them but as duclos explained what he wanted vacharets expression became slowly graver this wasnt what he expected crossing the courtyard as he left twenty minutes later duclos could see the misty shape of a girl rolling up one black stocking through the net curtains at a window to one side she had wild red hair and was naked except for a garter belt and the one stocking and was sitting on the edge of the bed facing the window because she was close to the window she saw him and smiled gradually parting her legs wider duclos turned away and headed for the courtyard door if hed stayed she would probably have put on a little show for him but he wasnt interested he phoned vacheret that night and as arranged vacheret gave him a name and a time and place to make contact the room where machanaud was taken to was at the back of the gendarmerie the main window was open with the heat its grey wooden shutters closed only faint slats of sunlight filtered in so the main light a football sized glass sphere screwed to the ceiling had been switched on the rooms at the back away from the traffic and looking onto a car park shared with the town hall were quiet machanaud had arrived at am as scheduled but poullain had made him wait in the room on his own for almost twenty minutes dominic timed and dated an interview form and made notes as poullain started with machanauds main background details age town of birth st girons place of residence seillons occupation farm labourer past convictions machanaud could recall two past convictions but not the dates so dominic took the details from the past charge sheets drunken and disorderly in march of that year and poaching the previous october machanaud looked older than his age dominic always thought closer to mid or late forties his skin was weathered and pitted his thick brown hair long and unkempt and heavily greased back in an effort to make it look tidier though all too often a lank forelock would break loose and hang across his face when drunk and in one of his more rebellious moods the one eye that wasnt covered by hair gave the impression of leering wildly poullain waited for dominic to stop writing then started with a general summary of machanauds activities on the august most of it purely skimming details from their interview of the day before then poullain went back to the beginning going into more specific timings so you left after finishing work at raulins farm at about eleven is that right no closer to twelve poullain was testing machanaud had told them twice before that it was twelve eleven was closer to the time they thought he had left from their interviews the day before both with raulin and henri at bar fontainouille who seemed to remember machanaud calling in and leaving earlier and you went straight on to bar fontainouille from there yes thats right how long would that take do you think about fifteen twenty minutes poullain spent the next ten minutes running through machanauds movements bar fontainouille at pm leaving just before pm for gilbert albrieux farm where hed planted some vines the february past albrieux apparently hadnt been there to see him but after a quick check of the vines machanaud claimed he sat on a stone wall and had a sandwich after half an hour he then headed off to leons dominic felt the tension building with each question or maybe it was because he knew what was coming poullain was slowly circling in for the kill so its what only ten or twelve minutes from albrieux to leons bar what time did you arrive there about two thirtyfive two forty but i only stayed about an hour because i had to be back at raulins for the late shift at four oclock dominic looked at his notes effectively all that machanaud admitted to was being on his own for about half an hour after two oclock their various interviews from the day before told a different story raulin didnt recall seeing him after am and although henri at bar fontainouille wasnt sure what time machanaud arrived he was certain of the time he left at about pm because of when he started serving set lunches that day leon too wasnt sure what time machanaud had called in but they had the firm sighting from madame veillan which would have put machanaud at leons at about pm that left almost two hours unaccounted for between pm and pm did you go anywhere on the way back to raulins just to pick up some tobacco but thats just a few doors from leons it only took minutes and in all of your travels on that day did you happen to see a young boy the question threw machanaud all of his answers had been carefully thought out to defend their suspicion of him poaching why else would the questions be angled so insistently around the two hours hed been by the river the continued questioning the fact that they seemed to be taking the issue so seriously for the first time started him wondering a boy what has that got to do with anything i dont know you tell us poullains easy manner asking questions at a steady pace suddenly went what time did you meet him half past one two oclock where was it you first picked him up in the village or near the lane machanaud was perplexed he ruffled his hair uneasily i was at bar fontainouille i had at least two drinks with henri himself serving at the bar i couldnt possibly have met anyone then except that you left the fontainouille an hour earlier at one oclock and yes you went to have lunch with your knapsack but instead of going to albrieux place you went down to the river by breuilles land and on the way there you met the boy machanaud blinked nervously and looked down then across briefly towards dominics notes so they knew hed been down by the river at breuilles probably guessed that hed been poaching but why the insistence about this boy i dont understand why youre asking all this i dont know anything about a boy oh but i think you do poullain went in for the kill he leant forward his body rigid with intent your account of the entire day is complete fabrication not one bit of it is true the only thing we know for sure is that you were seen at three oclock by madame veillan coming out of the lane at breuilles farm poullains voice was rising feverishly the same place where minutes beforehand a young boy was left for dead with his skull smashed in with a sickening sensation it suddenly dawned on machanaud why poullain had been asking about the boy hed heard about the attack it was the talk of the village but there had been no mention of where are you trying to tell me that this boy was found on the lane to breuilles farm machanauds tone of incredulity only served to anger poullain deeper you know he was because thats where you left him just after you smashed his head in with a rock machanaud shook his head wildly no i told you i had nothing to do with that boy i never touched him so are you now trying to say that you were there and saw the boy but you never touched him machanaud was confused his voice breaking with exasperation no no i never saw the boy i know nothing about him i went from the fontainouille a short break for lunch then straight onto leons leon doesnt remember seeing you until at least threefifteen it was a bluff but poullain was more confident of madame veillans time keeping than leons and henri says that you arrived at eleven and left about one thats impossible machanaud spluttered desperately i was still at raulins until twelve raulin says that he didnt see you after eleven and thats the time he has entered in his book for you finishing that day there was some extra work on the bottom land he probably didnt see me there poullain ignored it henri knows for sure you left at one oclock because thats when he starts preparing lunches and between then and madame veillan seeing you leave the lane thats almost two hours he leant forward until he was close to machanaud his tone low and menacing two hours in which you calmly took your pleasure with this boy before deciding that youd have to kill him what did you do to keep him quiet in the meantime tie him up machanaud was cold with fear he had been shaking his head at poullains bombardment stunned by the sudden turn around of events surely they couldnt really believe that he had attacked this boy if it was just a ploy to get him to admit to poaching theyd succeeded he was so frightened hed run for any sanctuary okay i admit it i was there but i know nothing about the boy i was poaching i see poullain looked down thoughtfully drawing a deep breath before looking up again and how long were you there two hours and have you been to that stretch of river before yes two or three times i dont remember exactly any particular reason why you favour there the fish are no better than elsewhere but breuille is away less chance of getting caught and even if i am hes not around to press charges machanaud risked a hesitant smile poullain considered this for a moment so now youre trying to tell us that all of this mornings subterfuge all of this lying was purely to cover up the fact that you were poaching even though you know breuilles away and therefore charges cant be pressed poullain looked disgustedly towards dominic he waved one hand dramatically pah it is not even remotely believable a swathe of hair had fallen across machanauds face he cut a sad picture like a lost and bewildered animal a lamb to poullains slaughter his eyes darted frantically but marius caurin is still around caretaking the land i even saw him head out at one point on his tractor he could have seen me even if we accept this ridiculous story that you were poaching you expect us to believe that you spent two hours calmly fishing while a young boy was savagely raped and assaulted not yards away and you saw absolutely nothing machanaud looked pleadingly towards dominic clutching out for any possible support dominic looked away and back to his notes whatever misgivings dominic might have with poullains interview tactics it was the first golden rule unless a two pronged assault had been previously agreed the interview witness remained silent he had already made his thoughts clear to poullain about suspicion of machanaud any comment about what arose in the interview itself would have to wait till later machanaud was desperate spluttering the river bank dips down at points the lane is partly obscured by trees and bushes somebody else could have come along without me seeing yes they could but that same person couldnt possibly have stayed on the lane for all that time without the risk of someone coming along and seeing them and yet if they hid in the only place possible down by the riverbank you would have seen them but the real reason that you saw nobody else is that there was only one person down by the river bank you nono and it was there that you chose as your hiding place a place you know well from past visits while you molested the boy concealed from anyone passing twice you sexually assaulted him then later to cover your tracks afraid that he would talk you picked up a rock and no machanaud rose to his feet slamming one hand on the table his head had been shaking slowly his low and repeated groans of no finally rising to a crescendo poullain let out a final exasperated breath looking towards dominic just take him away im sick of hearing his lies what do you want me to do with him put him in the holding cell for a few hours let him cool his heels perhaps hell remember something with a bit more sense well decide then if were going to hold him longer the arrangement was that duclos meet the man in front of the fort st nicolas in marseille from there they could walk across boulevard charles livon and into the parc du pharo to discuss their business at dusk the number of park strollers would be thinning out it should be quite private the time and place had been arranged through vacheret and the man was known as chapeau obviously not his real name duclos had already waited ten minutes gradually becoming more anxious dwelling stronger on what he was waiting there for conscious suddenly of every small sound and movement around the wind ruffling a flag on the fort a stray cat tugging at a bag in a nearby bush the shuffle of people approaching and walking by uncomfortable if someone looked at him as they passed catching his eye for gods sake hurry up he couldnt take much more of this waiting while he was distracted for a moment by a coach that had pulled up in front collecting a stream of tourists shepherded aboard by their guide a man was suddenly at his side he seemed to emerge from nowhere among the throng leaving the fort and duclos was slightly startled he hadnt seen him approach your name is alain the man enquired yes we have some business to discuss i believe duclos merely nodded it was obviously chapeau there was something familiar about him but duclos wasnt totally sure were you across the road a moment ago looking over yes i was chapeau didnt offer to explain why which unsettled duclos further they walked in silence towards the park duclos took the opportunity to study him closer no more than thirty skin quite dark tight knit curly dark hair heavy set and jowly probably corsican judging by the accent duclos guessed one eye was slightly bloodshot and yellowed in the corner as if hed been hit close to it or perhaps it was a permanent ailment the nickname intrigued duclos the man wasnt wearing a hat what is it your friend wants done asked chapeau at the mention of friend duclos was wary just how much had already been discussed what did vacheret tell you did he explain the problem and what needed to be done no just that you had a friend with a problem nothing more you know what vacheret is like afraid of his own shadow doesnt like to get involved duclos grimaced weakly good he had spun a story to vacharet of a married friend who played both sides getting into trouble with a rent boy and his pimp the pimp was threatening blackmail by informing his friends wife some muscle was required to warn him off duclos knew that vacharet had milieu contacts and would be able to recommend someone the pimp was streetwise so it should also be someone with a reasonable reputation perhaps a few hits to his credit otherwise the warning would carry no weight thankfully vacharet had been worried about complicity didnt want to know too many details ill just give you a number the rest is up to you for the same reason vacharet had obviously said little to chapeau even if he had duclos would have covered by claiming that for obvious reasons he hadnt wanted vacharet to know all the details now none of that was necessary except to maintain the subterfuge that the boy who was laying in hospital in aixenprovence was a rent boy and that his friend was responsible for the attack why did your friend attack him in the first place chapeau asked blackmail my friend is married this is one of his little indulgences on the side that he tells me hes only done a few times and was trying to get over but this time he got caught out the boy was threatening to tell and your friend didnt finish the boy off no chapeau pondered over this information so now hes afraid the boy will wake up and tell duclos nodded theyd walked almost two hundred metres into the park a few evening strollers passed staccato breaks in a conversation they were both being careful to keep out of anyone elses earshot at times the pauses were unsettling chapeau left long gaps after people had passed why the hospital at aix chapeau asked they were driving out of marseille into the country and they got into an argument it just happened that aix was the nearest town so the boy was taken to the main hospital on avenue tamaris whats the boys name javi but its just a nickname i dont think he knows the boys real name and has he known him long i dont think so just a few months at most another silence something didnt add up thought chapeau though he thought he knew what was wrong as usual vacheret had been tight lipped except on one simple question how was this alain known to him a client for the girls or boys boys and now alain was talking about problems with a rent boy and a friend it could be just a case of all gay boys together but it was too much of a coincidence for comfort chapeau was sure the friend was pure invention it was this alain himself who had the problem with the boy and now wanted him killed but there was no point in confronting him and possibly frightening off a good paying client more fun to see if pushed if he still clung to the story your friend likes fucking young boys does he whats wrong cant he get it up for his wife anymore i dont know youd have to ask him yourself the irritation in duclos voice was barely concealed he bit back hoping to pique chapeau a little how did you get the nickname i dont see a hat no thats true you dont chapeau smiled wryly as if he was about to elaborate then suddenly decided against it they walked in silence for a second chapeau let out a long breath hospitals are risky its going to cost extra seven thousand francs duclos went pale even at what vacheret had estimated francs it had been a fortune over half a years salary and a third of his savings now it was going to cost more im not sure if my friend can afford that he was expecting it to be less theres people around in a hospital more risk of being seen some sort of diversion will probably have to be created ill have to visit at least once beforehand to work out what that diversion might be its not worth doing under seven thousand but the boys half dead already all you have to do is sneak in and cut off his life support or put a hand over his mouth my friend even knows the room hes in and the layout chapeaus brow furrowed so your friend has actually been there duclos faltered looking away for a second as a young couple passed the memories of the day before came flooding back hed known from the outset that it would be hard to skirt around the issue it was vital to pass on detailed information so that chapeau didnt start phoning the hospital the only way his imaginary friend would know that information was if hed actually been in the room yes at first he thought be might be able to deal with the problem himself how close did he get heartbeats the nightmare was still vivid the sound of his own heartbeat and pulse almost in time with the bleep from the life support machine stepping closer reaching out sounds in the corridor a moments pause as he went to put his hand over the boys mouth voices outside getting closer more prominent he was actually inside the room when he got disturbed chapeaus tone was slightly incredulous what your friend gets a second chance at it and still he cant manage to finish the boy off fighting to control the trembling as his hand closed in feeling for a second the boys shallow breath on his palm warm vapour cool against his sweat indecision then quickly retracted sudden panic as he heard voices almost upon him i told you he was disturbed what else could he do duclos stammered i dont know you tell me chapeau half smiled sounds to me as if your friends a bit of a gutless shit duclos didnt answer turned away biting at his lip coming out of the room the worst part had been realizing that the people outside had already passed he could have stayed a moment longer he even thought for a moment of going back inside but his nerve had gone he had been close so close chapeau savoured his discomfort for a moment before commenting more philosophically still i suppose if it wasnt for friends like that thered be no need for people like me shall we conclude matters it took another ten minutes for them to run through the other details room number position and floor best timing payment arrangements chapeau took the point of the urgency of the situation at any moment the boy could wake up he would try and make a reconnaissance of the hospital work out a diversion and hopefully execute the plan all in the same day tomorrow they were coming to a point in the park where both the marina and the old harbour could be viewed a succession of white masts speared the skyline stretching back towards the town again it reminded duclos that this was his holiday he should have been out sailing on the vallons jonquet the wind in his hair then afterwards grilled sea bream or swordfish washed down with a glass of chilled white wine in a cafe overlooking the old harbour instead he was negotiating murder and being taunted by this neanderthal prick who was also going to take almost half his savings for the privilege but hopefully the whole sad saga would soon be over that was what he was paying for the thought of the freedom ahead of not having to go through this nightmare again made it all worthwhile means to an end he took a deep refreshing breath of the salty air of the harbour as they concluded duclos asked how the boy was going to be killed but chapeau said that he wouldnt know till after the first visit chapeau had given nothing away twenty minutes of conversation and duclos knew nothing about the man he was still the same shadowy figure as when theyd entered the park chapeau asked if he was heading back towards the fort but duclos said he wanted to enjoy the last rays of sunset over the harbour truth was he couldnt bear to stay in chapeaus company a moment longer the man made his skin crawl duclos found a bench near the apex of the harbour walk as chapeau headed back a part of him felt relieved at the action hed taken but yet another felt strangely uneasy had chapeau suspected him of lying hed kept everything as remote as possible the friend a disagreement with a rent boy the nickname it was unlikely chapeau would tie anything in with the recent newspaper article even if he had seen it and with the depth of detail provided about the rooms position and best timing he doubted chapeau would call the hospital surely it was unlikely that all his precautions would collapse the thought of what chapeau might do in response sent a shiver through his body duclos looked away from the harbour view for a moment watching chapeaus figure as it receded into the distance faintly silhouetted against the dying light and for a while his strong will to believe hed taken the right action fought hard against the fear of what new horrors he might have introduced dominic was called to the teleprinter as soon as the message came through it was from the gendarmerie in south limoges and read your enquiry regarding alain lucien duclos not at the limoges address you supplied from vehicle registration however monsieur duclos is known to us he is an assistant prosecutor attached to the main cour dassises in limoges according to work colleagues he is currently holidaying with friends at the vallon estate near cotignac provence trust this is helpful head of station captain rabellienne dominic ripped the message from the printer the corridor and reception was busy and he found poullain in the back mess room having coffee with harrault he handed the message across and waited a moment as poullain read it do you want me to make initial enquiries dominic asked poullain was hesitant as he lifted his attention from the message no no its okay i think id better phone first then well probably go out there together it looked like a waste of time a complete mismatch thought poullain an assistant prosecutor staying with one of the areas largest landowners and more highly regarded citizens marcel vallon it would need personal kid glove treatment vallon was good friends with the mayor they played golf together and belonged to the same masonic lodge poullain looked at his watch they had a meeting about the rosselot case scheduled for late afternoon with bouteille the prosecutor in aix en provence if we can see this duclos late morning or lunch time since we have to pass through here again on our way to aix do you think you could have the notes typed up and put in some semblance of order before tomorrows meeting yes i think so dominic faltered only for a second another lunch time with a rushed sandwich good lets plan for then ill phone within half an hour anything new from machanaud no not really apart from the car sighting he mentioned as you requested we got him to sign the forms and hand over his identity card then let him go just before eleven last night without sufficient evidence to hold machanaud it was all theyd been able to do a standard local police to be notified if moving form and holding his identity card without it new housing jobs or any form of social registration for machanaud would be practically impossible poullain had already half discounted the car sighting it had been so vague a dark car perhaps blue or dark grey sloping at the back possibly a citreon ds when pressed machanaud admitted hed only caught a quick flash of it between the bushes but what he was sure of was that it had left only minutes before him how convenient machanaud knew that if he didnt come up with another possible scapegoat things were looking grim for him and after a couple of hours alone in the jail cell he came up with one quelle surprise poullain glanced again at the brief message it looked like it would come to nothing but you never knew if nothing else it would at least demonstrate they were being thorough and exploring all options a bit of dressing for when they laid machanauds head on a plate for bouteille and naugier ten the car tyres of the citreon ds crunched on the gravel driveway the front of the building was an imposing but flat three story provencal masse its line broken only by frequent window boxes and a long terrace at one end running above the garage a row of neatly manicured cypress firs framed the semicircular sweep of the driveway with two smaller trees in large pots each side of the entrance vallons servant came out to greet them and showed them through the house along a wide main hallway then into a narrower corridor towards the door at its end the library marcel vallon was nowhere to be seen hed ascertained on the phone with poullain that his presence wouldnt be required while poullain had assured him that it was nothing too serious something just to help with their other enquiries vallon had made it patently clear their visit was an intrusion a favour granted only by his good nature dont take advantage was the silent undertone poullain was therefore already nervous about the visit complaining on the drive over that it would be a waste of time would serve no purpose other than to upset vallon hed probably get a call from the mayor in a day or so while they waited in the library dominic could sense poullains unease returning poullain had taken one of three seats by a low round coffee table while dominic sat at a small drop leaf desk by the window a room four metres long and three wide two walls were lined with books the atmosphere austere stuffy this was old provence old money and power a gentle reminder they waited almost five minutes before duclos walked into the room a taut smile upon introduction to poullain a brief nod towards dominic he was only slightly taller than poullain and slim dominic noted short dark black hair swept neatly across a rounded almost baby face eyes so dark green they were almost black some women liked that sort of soft innocent look thought dominic someone to mother but he couldnt help thinking that some men liked it too poullain started with the niceties of thanking duclos for seeing them at such short notice and apologizing for the intrusion it was just a general enquiry regarding visitors to taragnon five days ago on the eighteenth a young boy had been attacked then no attempt at subterfuge dominic noted no trap for duclos by drawing him out before mentioning the main purpose of their visit we are as a result talking to anyone in the area at the time for information your car was seen at the cafe fontduroux during lunch time that day i wondered monsieur duclos do you remember your movements then last thursday particularly before and after your visit to the fontduroux a moments thought from duclos a slow blink well i remember stopping at the cafe id been to aixenprovence for the morning and was on my way back what exactly did you want to know lets start with the time you arrived at the cafe if you remember duclos looked down feigning deep thought a hundred times over hed worked out his timing and what hed say if questioned but coming straight out with it would seem unnatural preprepared how much hesitance was normal to recall something that happened five days ago it would have been quite late in the lunch period one thirty maybe quarter to two i remember stopping because i knew i wouldnt make it back for normal lunch time here at the estate and the chef maurice can be quite strict he doesnt like preparing separately for latecomers duclos forced a smile yes it would have been about then and did you stay long maybe an hour or so service was a bit slow when i arrived they were quite busy and i had coffee and brandy to finish so you left at what half past two or so no it was closer to three when i asked for the bill i remember looking at my watch then because id planned to head to juan les pins for the afternoon and started to get a bit anxious about being too late perhaps five minutes to settle the bill so about three when i left had you arranged to meet someone in juan les pins nothing particular planned but id seen someone on the beach the day before that i hoped to bump into again a girl so i wanted to be there more or less at the same time poullain looked towards dominic for our notes then you arrived at cafe fontduroux at a quarter to two and left at three more or less yes i suppose it must have been closer to a quarterto when i arrived i dont think i stayed as long as an hour and a half a moments silence the sound of dominics pen scratching on paper some distant splashing from the swimming pool in the rear garden and courtyard which dominic could just see at an angle if he looked through the window at his side duclos heart pounded the timing was etched on his mind arrived at left at three minutes drive to the farm lane eight minutes off the road with the boy heading off again at hopefully hed buried the eleven minutes without them noticing surely the barman wouldnt remember the exact time he left he fought to control his nerves it was vital he appeared calm and after the cafe did you head straight for juan les pins poullain asked yes did you stop anywhere or see anyone on the way no a moments afterthought oh except i stopped off at a garage near le muy filled up with petrol had an oil check speeds of kmph nearly all the way to hopefully bury the eight minutes hed been off the road with the boy do you remember the name of the garage no it was a few kilometres before le muy on the right it was the only garage for fifteen kilometres thought duclos they were bound to find it if they bothered to check and what time did you get to juan les pins about a quarter to five maybe five i dont remember exactly duclos felt small beads of sweat pop on his forehead but then it was quite hot in the room pulse racing palms clammy as hed stopped by a bin in a deserted alley at the back of town pushing deep inside the rock and the boys shirt wrapped in a large rag from the car in juan les pins did you go anywhere in particular perhaps meet the girl youd hoped to no she didnt show but the cafe i went to on the beach is one ive been to a few times before claude vallon and i had lunch there just a week ago the owner knows us if the garage didnt remember him stopping he was sure at least the cafe owner would inside his nerves were racing but it was hopefully going well pauses at the right juncture the afterthought of the garage remembering the timing of leaving the taragnon cafe but guessing at the arrival time accurate details but not too glib too quickly though now he sensed as the questions became more direct and personal that perhaps he was being too compliant but what has my visit to juan les pins got to do with this i thought you were interested in events around taragnon and the fontduroux quick retreat and apology from poullain yes yes im sorry we just need to ascertain peoples general movements were quite happy to accept that you were not in taragnon later on so earlier on the way into taragnon did you see or meet anyone a barely perceptible flinch from duclos poullain didnt notice it only dominic though it could have been the sudden jump in timing and mood from hours after the event to before defensive to offensive such as this young boy no im afraid not said duclos the final masterstroke to throw forensics inserting a finger in the boys rectum and working it brusquely around hopefully interpreted as a second attack there were people walking about in the main street of taragnon but i dont remember anyone in particular you stopped nowhere in or near taragnon except the cafe no the bottle taken from the cafe stripping down to his underpants before striking the boy with the rock then washing down with the bottled water and dressing again no bloodstains poullain waited for dominics note taking to catch up with them using the gap to collect his thoughts then he recapped on a few points mainly clarifying times at one point he asked dominic what time do you have noted for the time that monsieur duclos arrived at juan les pins five or a quarter to dominic was sure poullain remembered the time normally statement recaps were purely to see if the suspect said something different second time around and the time you stopped at the garage monsieur duclos asked poullain i dont believe we covered that before duclos shrugged slightly i dont know what is it just over halfway there about four oclock i suppose poullain nodded slowly as if still preoccupied with all the prior information then he suddenly went off at a tangent do you visit your friends here the vallons very often at least once a year nearly always in the summer months claude vallon and i went to the same university bordeaux a slight frown from duclos why do you ask poullain shook his head hastily no particular reason its just that your car was reported in response to our request for any strangers to the area when in fact it appears youre almost an honorary local poullain grimaced weakly he could hardly admit that he wanted to know the strength of association between duclos and the vallons in case of later problems with his own mayor he sighed faintly bracing his hands on his thighs with an audible slap well i think thats just about it monsieur duclos thank you for your time poullain stood up nodded curtly and shook hands with duclos heading for the door he turned oh i forgot one thing i meant to ask you mentioned that when you went through taragnon you were on your way from aixenprovence what time did you leave there duclos hammering nerves had settled slightly with the questioning trailing off but his keen prosecutors nose made him suddenly alert again the throw away question hed seen them so often catch defendants out the boys stark green eyes struggling to look back at him as he pushed his face flat down to the earth raising one arm with the rock twelvefifteenish i suppose it was just a quick shopping trip i was there probably no more than an hour and a half pick up anything interesting theres a cheese shop and delicatessen i always visit on rue clemenceau while there i picked up a few other bits and pieces some olives and pistachios some aged brandy to take back for my uncle poullain nodded and smiled once again thank you monsieur duclos and sorry for the intrusion started with an apology and finished with one thought dominic no surprise tactics no ambush the nature of their enquiry explained clearly quite a contrast to the tactics used with machanaud the only thing poullain had pushed for was trying to get duclos to say hed left the restaurant half an hour earlier the vital half hour in which the boy was attacked perhaps poullain was going to wait until theyd checked some of the details from duclos then hit him harder on a second interview they were led out to the main hallway by duclos then the servant reappeared from the adjoining drawing room and took over duclos went into the drawing room and watched through the window as they crossed the gravel driveway overall hed been quite convincing he thought controlled his nerves well poullain had been easy to handle had accepted his account of events readily was almost apologetic a true system man obviously daunted by the association with vallon the younger one had looked more surly and doubting but had stayed silently in the background a junior with no real power he would present no problem there was only one thing left to worry about but hopefully chapeau would be visiting the hospital soon if he hadnt already done so screaming pistoning crescendo hot white light stabbing his mind as he brought the rock down repeatedly the tinkle of goats bells from the next field barely breaking through his frenzy and the gentle sough of wind through the trees a slow exhalation of breath sudden relief and letting loose the overflow of built up tension but deep in his stomach the butterfly contortions hed been fighting to control the past hour finally got the better of him he headed for the bathroom to be sick chapeau visited the hospital twice within three hours before a plan started to formulate the time in between filled in with a leisurely lunch and an afternoon stroll along aixs cours mirabeau the hat he wore was a nondescript brown trilby a habit acquired from a spell working as a bouncer in a marseille night club borsalinos where he had to wear a bright wide brimmed trilby the hat was a distraction it covered his tight knit curly hair and could be tilted to shade his discoloured eye it could only be noticed up close but it was a strong distinguishing feature he always wore a hat while working never when not on the first visit hed walked along the second floor corridor twice then sat on a bench at its end for a while watching the movements of people back and forth from viewing a hospital porter a few doors down from a exit laden with towels he guessed it was a store room he didnt notice the porter open or lock the door so chapeau waited for a quiet moment when the corridor was empty then went to check eight foot long by three foot wide one side was stacked with linen towels cotton swabs a bucket with mop in the corner floor cleaner and bleach no uniforms the room gave him an idea the rest of it slotting into place over lunch he would have to get a uniform lighter fluid and a syringe he returned to walk the corridor again rechecking positions between the store room and a distance from the fire alarm and the main wards then he sat down on the bench again one last run through of the plan in his mind he looked up the door to room a had clicked open he watched a woman walk out long dark hair in ringlets pale beige dress as she lifted her eyes towards him he leant forwards resting his elbows on his knees while he contemplated his shoes all she would see was an apparently concerned trilby waiting for news from one of the nearby rooms as she went from view he headed for the stairs and made his exit when theyd gone through best timing alain had mentioned that his friend had seen a woman visiting the room probably a girlfriend or relative of the boys pimp quite a beauty thought chapeau at least partly arab but dressed simply and understated not the gold hoop earrings heavy make up and high heels of a pimps girlfriend so she was just a friend though probably her main role was as caretaker and guardian for his various boys as many as twelve or fifteen under the same roof a surrogate aunty with pimps mostly male women invariably took care of the domestics cooking cleaning shopping over the next few hours he visited three shops in marseille specializing in hotel and industrial uniforms before finding one close to that of the porters at the hospital lighter fluid he picked up at a nearby tobacco shop the syringe at a pharmacy now sitting at a panier bar he sipped at a brandy and ran through again the projected sequence in his mind the only thing still to decide was whether he went back that night or waited till the next morning dominic headed out straight after their meeting with pierre bouteille with poullain suddenly eager to progress the next stage alibi verification for all possible suspects not just machanaud he made it to the garage near le muy by pm then made the deduction from the time he passed cafe font du roux minutes that meant that if duclos had left the cafe at just after three he would have been at the garage by pm the garage attendant remembered duclos car not only because of the rarity of giulietta sprints but because duclos had asked for an oil change and whether he might make it to juanlespins by four thirty impossible i told him it would take at least forty minutes hed be lucky to make it by four fifty so it must have been about five past four then dominic asked if hed noticed anything unusual any bloodstains or clothing in disarray but no on each dominic headed off on his bike for juanlespins the attendant was right the road was winding for part of the route and it took him minutes he parked close to the sea front and walked along the promenade past the pavement artists and makeshift souvenir stands the promenade was raised so that he was looking over the rooftops of the bars and restaurants tucked in below at beach level as dominic came to the third set of steps leading down he saw the sign for the rififi to the left part bar part restaurant at nearly oclock it was busy with diners the evening air was still hot so stepping off the bike hed taken off his leather jacket underneath was his white epaulette shirt and he put his gendarme cap back on a waiter asked how he could help or did monsieur wish to dine dominic explained the purpose of his visit and was shown to the bar to await the owner a short stocky man with bushy grey hair in his early fifties who introduced himself as pierre malgarin he looked slightly flustered at the interruption during the busy dining period dominic explained the background and confirmed that malgarin knew the vallons apparently they dined here about what twelve days ago or so about that yes claude vallon the son had a friend with him an alain duclos mid twenties slim black hair did he come in here about six days ago on his own it would have been late afternoon about five oclock i dont know im not usually here then i come in lunch times and evenings but possibly my head waiter will know malgarin beckoned the waiter who had shown dominic to the bar as malgarin repeated the question the waiter nodded young friend of the vallons yes i remember him coming in for about half an hour or so five or six days ago do you remember what time it was not really just that it was well after lunch time because wed cleared up by then but for all i remember it could have been any time between four and sixthirty maybe gilbert will know he leant across and involved the barman in the conversation but the barman shrugged i dont remember exactly only what he drank campari and lemon and he asked me if id seen a girl long dark hair italian looking early twenties she was wearing an orange bikini when hed seen her on the beach the day before we get so many girls i told him it was hard to place one just like that i couldnt remember her did he call into the bar the day before when he saw the girl for the first time no or at least i dont remember seeing him perhaps he saw her from the promenade or from one of the adjoining bars anything unusual about his dress or his manner no not really just that he seemed bothered that he might not see her dominic couldnt think of any more immediate questions in the conversation lull the waiter excused himself the owner asked has that been useful would you like to stay for a quick drink on the house dominic was about to decline then ordered a beer on an afterthought and offered his thanks perhaps one of them might remember something else while he waited he was close to the end of the bar with only three lines of tables between there and the beach edge two sets of large glass windows had been drawn back so that the front of the bar was mostly open onto the beach dominic sipped at his beer the sound of gently lapping surf wafted in above the babble of voices and clatter of cutlery deep into the bay dominic could see the lights of four or five fishing boats and behind him from an open air restaurant with a live group by the town square drifted quando caliente el sol a sordid investigation with a young boy sexually assaulted and battered it seemed a million miles from this could duclos really have battered the boy half to death then come down here and calmly sipped at campari and lemon while looking for this girl if she existed where had he seen her from the day before it struck dominic as a rather convenient underlining of heterosexuality and if duclos had been so worried he might miss her why stop for an oil change and to confirm the time what was more important that the attendant remembered him or to get to see the girl on time but despite the inconsistencies time would be the deciding factor and there simply was not enough of it for duclos to have committed the crime even at excessive speeds he might have had ten or fifteen spare minutes at most the minimum estimate covering both attacks was forty minutes given the background of his debates with poullain over machanaud even mentioning the inconsistencies would be seen by poullain as obstructive and pointless unless something new came up about duclos timing dominic wished now he hadnt made the trip he felt deflated he had set out in hope of deflecting poullains one track case against machanaud and instead would be returning with information which would help to further seal his fate chapeau poured the lighter fluid generously on the cotton sheet then bundled it into the corner with some other sheets and thick towels he listened for a second to sounds outside on the corridor nothing audible it was important that nobody saw him come out of the small store room once the sheets were lit there was no turning back he would have to exit immediately the small room would fill with smoke in seconds he lit the sheet and stepped back hastily as the flames leapt he watched for only a second to ensure the sheets beneath had caught then exited the corridor was empty and he headed past room a towards where the corridor angled off at an l at the end of which was the fire alarm a few paces past a he heard footsteps close to the top of the stairs hed been lucky two seconds more and hed have been trapped inside the store room but it was important also that he wasnt seen rushing away from the store room and he picked up pace only just making it behind the angle of the l before they reached the top of the stairs the corridor ahead was twentyfive yards long with two doors at its end three on its right flank and one on the left past a window the fire alarm was close to the end just before the two final doors suddenly the middle of the three doors on his right opened a doctor stepped out merde from the sound of their footsteps the people who had come up the stairs were also heading in his direction just about to turn into the corridor but there were no cries of alarm obviously the smoke hadnt yet started seeping through the door noticing chapeau hesitate and look around as if he was lost for a moment the doctor asked looking for someone dr durrand chapeau answered hastily recalling a name hed seen on the resident doctors list by the reception chapeau fought to control his agitation appear calm you wont find him up here i dont think first floor optimology the two people an elderly couple heading for a door at the end passed them his porters uniform shouldnt raise suspicions it was an almost exact match optimology his mind spun panning frantically for options his eyes fixed on the number of the furthest door ive just come from optimology and they said i might find him in c whats the patients name they didnt say the doctor shrugged theres nobody in c right now new patient isnt coming in till tonight and the old patient was moved back to the general ward yesterday okay ill try there chapeau headed back the way hed come pacing calming his breath he silently cursed crucial seconds had been lost and the doctor might later remember him behind him at the end of the corridor the couple had already disappeared calming the sound of the doctors footsteps receded beyond his own rapid shallow breaths but ahead now at the angle of the l he could see the first trails of smoke drifting across misty grey suffused with stark sunlight from the window and he begged that the doctor didnt turn around suddenly and see it he listened intently to the sounds of the doctors fading footsteps between his own a faint shuffle a door opening slowly closing all too slowly chapeau let out a long breath as it finally shut then ran the last few steps towards the smoke a nurse had come out from the general ward at the far end looking equally startled as she noticed the smoke chapeau lifted one arm in acknowledgement and ran back towards the alarm halfway along he heard the plaintive cry of fire from the nurse he took the small brass hammer on a chain at the side of the alarm and swung it sharply smashing the glass and releasing the alarm button the bell was deafening echoing from the stark walls and floor chapeau ran back swiftly towards the smoke and room a he heard a door open behind him some muttering a sudden startled voice but he didnt look back as he turned the l and came back into the main corridor five or six people had come out of their rooms is it another fire drill someone asked faint babble of replies more startled voices rising above the final realization as the build up of smoke became evident that this was the real thing sudden mobilization more people starting to spill out of the rooms most of them from the large general ward at the end some were now heading for the stairs and the five or six quickly grew to over twenty panic confusion chapeau suddenly felt more secure among the milling crowd hardly anyone was paying him any attention he took the syringe from his pocket the needle was already attached and he slipped off the plastic protection cap room a was only a few yards to one side he tucked the syringe neatly up inside his sleeve and reached out for the door a quick intake of breath but he felt confident his adrenaline was racing because of the fire and activity around not nerves the scenario was perfect it would all be over within a minute it didnt strike him as odd that hed seen nobody run from a until he opened the door wide no nurse or doctor nobody in attendance a split second elation that hed been lucky and chosen a totally unguarded moment before realizing as he looked through the glass screen that there was no boy either shit shiiit he stood transfixed staring at the empty space around him pandemonium was building he was the only person on the second floor not in motion a steady stream was now heading for the stairs and a medic with a fire extinguisher was spraying the inside of the store room while a porter rushed for another extinguisher it took a moment for chapeau to break himself out of his trance and ask someone passing where the boy had gone hed stopped three nurses before finding someone who knew he was taken into the operating theatre over an hour ago thanks chapeau merged with the throng heading down the stairs the porter had joined the medic with a second fire extinguisher they would probably have the fire out within a few minutes in the first floor operating theatre the alarm bell rang ominously in the background the chief surgeon dr trichot asked one of the nurses to find out what was wrong she came back in after a moment fire on the second floor apparently is it confined to there i dont know i didnt ask trichot nodded for his assisting nurse to dab his forehead and silently cursed lets assume that theres no immediate danger or at least someone will come running in when there is and continue please the assisting nurse took the scalpel from him as he held it out tersely she thrust a selfretaining retractor into the same hand the boy christian rosselot had been on the operating table over thirty minutes now but theyd lost vital time getting xrays and angiograms and preparing for anaesthetic in that time the temporal skull section by the boys ear had bulged alarmingly with an active clot but two nights ago hed operated on the boy for a similar clot in the parietal lobe snatched him within minutes from the jaws of death and he was determined not to be defeated now fire or no fire the clanging bell was enfuriating grating at his nerves it couldnt have come at a worse time he needed all his concentration at this point implements were placed in his hand and taken back without him looking up the last an electric burr drill its high pitched drone lowered as trichot cut into the bone of the skull the extradural cortex was exposed there was no sign of haematoma and trichot began to worry he would have to go deeper we must go into the subdural partly gelateneous trichot sliced through the dura easily with the scalpel pulled back with a hook and prompted his assistant to shine a penlight into the aperture grey and white tissue and vessels reflected brightly under the light the dark matter of the blood clot only showed up as trichot widened the arc of the penlight it was in the upper portion of the temporal he wouldnt be able to judge its size or remove all of it without a larger incision a nod a dab trichot passed back the penlight ill have to go higher the attending anaesthetist announced pulse rate sixty to sixtyfive as the sound of the drill cut in again from seventy seventyfive just a few minutes ago thought trichot he looked across briefly at the blood pressure gauge it had dropped points to over in the same period the burr hole made he started sawing across joining the two the bleep rate dropped still further fiftyfour fiftyone now with a note of urgency trichot was sweating profusely another dab it was going to be a race against time another ten seconds of sawing fifteen or twenty seconds to cut through the dura and widen the aperture then the time needed to suck away the clot itself would depend on how large it was how much more would the pulse have dropped by then trichot finished sawing and pulled back with the hook all but a small portion of the clot was now visible the air pressure sucker was passed across fortyfivethree dropping fast forty trichot felt a twinge of panic once the pulse rate fell to thirty thirtytwo it was effectively all over hed fought too hard for the boy to let him go now the air sucker ate into the congealed dark red mass of the clot within twenty seconds trichot had removed almost a third of it thirtyeight seven the rate of pulse drop had slowed but part of the clot was still out of sight trichot glanced at the blood pressure gauge over it was going to be a close call if the rupture was behind the last portion of the clot if it was difficult to reach to cauterize if the pulse rate dropped more rapidly if there was more than one rupture any one factor meant that he wouldnt make it in time beads of sweat massed on his forehead and his own pulse drummed a double beat to the bleep from the monitor trichot moved his way upward with the sucker praying that the ruptured vessel would soon come into view thirtysix thirtyfive outside the alarm bell suddenly stopped ringing only the sound of the bleep remained slowly counting down the seconds trichot had left to save his patients life chapeau found a bar three blocks from the hospital and sat over a pernod while he pondered what to do how long would the boy be in the operating theatre two hours three probably he would be returned to the same intensive care room but then what he couldnt use the same fire distraction again he would have to think of something else nothing came to mind quickly and chapeau sharply knocked back another slug of pernod he should have made the hit the night before rather than wait till the morning his best shot had probably now gone he was going to be hard pushed to come up with an alternative plan that would be so effective and carry such low risk worse still if the boy died on the operating table there would be no more chances he finished his drink paid and headed out he needed a walk to clear his mind early morning nineforty the streets of aix were coming to life but chapeau was in his own world oblivious to passersby planning scheming weighing options hed walked for almost twenty minutes blindly window shopping between his thoughts when a smile slowly crossed his face it was cheeky and audacious but why not hed always liked a gamble and the prospect of shafting that little paedophile prick alain somehow appealed to him he thought it through once more for possible pitfalls but it was perfect the timing matched almost exactly but he would have to wait over two hours to deliver the news two prearranged phone kiosks and times one in le luc for the midday call one in brignoles for the ten oclock call chapeau decided to drive back to marseille to make the call at one point on the drive the audacity of what he was about to do tickled him again and he burst out laughing by the time he made the call hed managed to control his mirth it rang only twice before alain answered its done said chapeau when was this just this morning i created a diversion pumped the boy with a syringe and last thing i knew they were in the operating theatre trying to save him are you sure hes finished dont worry he wont make it also they wont suspect anything it will look like he died from complications arising from his coma and the initial injuries they made arrangements to meet and settle payment at six oclock the next day at parc du pharo chapeau was sure alain would probably phone the hospital that afternoon to check but it was a reasonable set of odds if the boy made it he would just have to come up with another plan if not for once hed get paid without having any blood on his hands eleven third session and when you fell back asleep did the dream return yes but the wheat field had changed it was different a large reel tape whirred silently in the background eyrans eyelids pulsed gently as the memories drifted across the second session had been disappointing details of the dreams scant so lambourne had decided on hypnosis the practice had become increasingly outmoded in his profession he used hypnosis on less than four percent of his patients only in the case of deeply repressed thoughts or where normal transference was poor or nonexistent and hardly ever on children but with the main clues buried in eyrans dreams and so much either faded or selectively erased hed seen little other choice he hadnt expected anything significant from the dreams until jojo appeared after the coma then suddenly sat up sharply as eyran started describing a dream just before the accident his mother folding out a map and eyran staring at the back of her hair willing himself back into a previous dream in which way was it different when you went back lambourne pressed it was flat not on a slope how i remembered and suddenly it got dark i couldnt find my way back everything was too flat i couldnt pick out anything to tell me which way was home was it important that you reached home yes i had the feeling that if i didnt make it back something terrible would happen i might die finding my way out of the darkness and home was my way of staying alive lambourne clenched one hand tight if there was a significant gap between the two dreams the accident could have already taken place by the second dream its later corruption after the coma and the introduction of jojo could speak volumes when did you first start dreaming about the wheat field i dont remember exactly quite a few years back was it when you first went to california and started missing your friends no id dreamt of it before when we first moved into the house in east grinstead and i walked into the field it felt familiar i had the feeling id been there before and did the dreams always feature the wheat fields no sometimes it was the copse and the pond they led to sometimes the woods at the back of the old house that led to the field did you ever dream of the house itself i dont remember exactly perhaps once before then the dream recently where i was looking out of the back kitchen window and saw my parents and met jojo again in the woods so the wheat field and the copse were more significant than the house itself his own private play areas whereas in the house his parents were dominant the house started to feature again only when he was trying to find them he took the search partly to their territory in the dream about the time of the accident when you feared you couldnt make your way back home how long did you feel had passed since the last moment in the car you remembered being awake it seemed to come almost straight after but i dont know the other dreams seemed to come with little gap yet they told me when i awoke that id been in a coma for three weeks lambourne scribbled a quick note timing inconclusive first significant dream could have occurred before or after the accident probably they would never know and was there anyone else in the dream any of your old friends from the copse there was someone but not really a friend it was a boy from my old school daniel fletcher he died just a year before we left for california and then my father appeared saying that i didnt belong there that i should start making my way back but it was suddenly dark and i couldnt make out anything familiar and by then hed disappeared and left me to find my way back on my own what was the stronger emotion anger that hed deserted you or fear that you were suddenly alone and lost i dont know i felt both maybe more confused than angry i just couldnt work out why hed left and was your fear just because you were alone and it was dark or was it also because you felt you should do as your father said you were equally afraid to disobey him eyran frowned he looked vaguely uncomfortable it was because i was alone i wouldnt purposely disobey my father and upset him but i wasnt afraid of him he was a very good father i know lambourne noted the defensive tone he changed track which was the first dream that jojo appeared in moments silence eyrans eyelids pulsed it was the dream straight after that again in the same place the small pond in the copse and in that dream tell me what you saw what happened eyrans eyelids pulsed more rapidly only grey outline at first hazy but gradually the images sharpened became clear eyran could only just make out the brook in the darkness of the copse at first a faint mist lingered across its surface he moved forward cautiously a figure on the far side becoming gradually clearer as he got closer it wasnt sarah or daniel it was a boy of about his age that he hadnt seen before though the trees and mist cast a shadow over part of his face so he couldnt be sure he knew that the boy had seen him because he waved and called out to eyran his voice echoing slightly across the water who are you eyran asked i havent seen you here before yes i know i dont normally come here but we have met before dont you remember eyran looked hard into the face it was still indistinct he felt suddenly uncomfortable admitting that he couldnt remember the boy seemed so certain they had met before its the mist i cant see very clearly across the brook then you should come over this side with me eyran peered through the mist but as part of it cleared the expanse of water between them appeared to be much wider a dark and fathomless lake all the familiar landmarks of the brook were now far away out of reach across the murky depths im looking for my parents eyran said my father was here earlier have you seen him no i havent i lost my parents as well though it was many years ago i can hardly remember it now eyran tried hard to make out the boys features tried to remember him but the shadow across his face and the mist of the lake robbed him of any chance of recognition whats your name gigio though the faint echo that came across the lake sounded more like jojo to eyran the boy looked straight across for a moment in silence the air was cold his breath misty you dont remember me do you eyran could see a tear on the boys cheek though eyran couldnt believe he was that upset at not being remembered it must have been the memory of losing his parents which reminded eyran again why hed returned to the brook i must find my father he was here only a short while ago i told you you wont find him over that side if you cross over ill help you find him eyran looked down and across the water it was jet black murky he felt afraid of what might lie beneath the surface imagining water snakes and all manner of creatures tree roots like tentacles trapping him and dragging him down thick mud and slime like quicksand cold with fear he shook his head hastily no i cant come over there its too dangerous the boy smiled warmly raising one arm beckoning but you must come over otherwise you will never find your father eyran closed his eyes steeling himself against what he knew he had to do feeling the cold of the water as first he put his feet in he stopped for a second looking imploringly across to the boy are you sure are you sure i have to do this the boy was now openly crying i cant promise youll find your father eyran i looked for my parents and never found them but i had to be on this side of the lake and you belong here with me then at least if you dont find them youre not alone but i must find them eyran pleaded i know i know ill help you if they are here well find them dont worry eyran waded slowly deeper trying to walk as far as he could before swimming the cold of the water penetrated deep into his body as it came up above his waist the mist was moving on the surface of the water partly obscuring the boy on the far side then clearing as the water came up to his chest eyran started swimming the mist became denser towards the centre of the lake and eyran lost sight of the boy completely for a while then suddenly he was there again but he still appeared the same distance away eyran didnt feel that he was getting any closer or perhaps he was losing direction with the mist fixing the boys position when it cleared eyran tried to make sure that he stayed swimming in a direct line during the blind periods he was never sure and when it cleared again the boy still seemed to be the same distance away he started to despair and called out jojo seeing clearly the boys reassuring smile and his beckoning wave before his figure was swallowed up once more in the mist at that moment he was conscious of the weight in his legs thick clinging mud and tree roots pulling at his ankles holding him back or perhaps they had been there all along which was why he hadnt been getting any closer he fought to break free but the roots slowly raised like tentacles higher up his legs pulling at him harder in blind panic he screamed jojos name again the roots dragging him inexorably downward as he struggled vainly to raise his head the first icy water filling his mouth break away he fought hard thrashing out with his arms coughing and spluttering as his lungs began to fill but the grip of the tree roots on his legs was impossible to break he felt tricked cheated by the boy led into the cold depths of the lake to die but as he slid deeper into the watery blackness the vision of jojo stayed with him still smiling reassuringly and beckoning reaching out a hand towards him slipping deeper i i break away break away i cant breathe cant eyran eyran break away the rapid pulsing beneath eyrans eyelids slowly settled his tortured breathing eased lambournes mouth was dry a film of sweat on his forehead he cursed himself he should have seen it coming cut everything short as soon as eyran started wading into the pond he could feel his nerves still racing he waited a few seconds more watching each beat of eyrans slowly settling expression he swallowed slowly so outside of the dreams when youre awake has jojo ever spoken to you switch to generalities thought lambourne avoid specifics eyrans brow knitted slightly obviously he found it an odd question no and how do you feel immediately after waking from the dreams are you able to believe just for a moment that your parents might be alive long pause from eyran i dont know just confused i suppose and afraid but lambourne could tell that eyran was holding back yet theyre enough to convince you that the next time jojo might succeed and catch up with your parents youre willing to trade that for the horrors the dreams might bring eyran shook his head i dont know when they start i dont seem to think about how they might end im just happy that for a few moments im somewhere where i might see my parents again but do you consciously welcome them knowing that you might see your parents i dont know no i dont think so lambourne eased back it was the closest he was likely to get do most of your dreams occur by the old house in england eyran took a second to catch up with the shift in questioning yes do you know why eyran paused as if for a moment unsure whether the question was rhetorical and lambourne would suddenly answer im not sure perhaps in the dreams thats where i think i have most chance of finding them or perhaps i dont think i can do it alone i need jojos help and i know i can find him there are your memories of that particular house stronger than your other house in san diego is that where you recall your happiest times with your parents with your friends eyrans expression relaxed lambourne watched the selfrealization sweep slowly across at least one small piece of the puzzle had slotted in place yes i suppose so i was happier there lambourne made a final note main object attachments father mother house in england old play areas old friends possibly now represented through jojo house in san diego quick distillation from the sessions so far he might change the order later and add to the list but it was a start the session had taken an hour and ten minutes when he went into the waiting area with eyran stuart and amanda capel were already there before they left he arranged and pencilled in the time for the next session lambourne was pleased with progress so far eyran was quite bright and more open and communicative than hed at first feared his recall of detail in the dreams strong under hypnosis but stuart was right the smiles were rare apart from the dreams perhaps the only outward sign that eyran was deeply disturbed but the dreams were becoming more of a refuge where eyran could believe his parents were alive jojo was also becoming bolder in two recent dreams introducing eyrans father again to maintain the illusion lambourne was convinced it was only a matter of time before jojo crossed over eyran would awake one day to find jojos voice still with him from there his own core character and everyone in the outside world telling him his parents were dead would regress and jojo would gain dominance the only way was to confront jojo now drag him from the dark recesses of eyrans dreams and strip him bare let eyran face the truth accept his parents were dead only then would he be able to start mourning adjust to whatever his new life held without them but it wouldnt be easy lambourne reflected his nerves were still rattled from the session just past like faust with the devil he could find himself trading all the way through a truth for a nightmare twelve the news that christian rosselot had died reached the bauriac gendarmerie midmorning the call came from dr besnard the chief medical examiner at the hospital poullain wasnt there at the time so harrault took the message dr trichot had fought hard to save the boy but oedema from an active clot caused unforeseen complications after more than two hours in the operating theatre and three attempts to restart the boys heart all procedures were finally terminated at am and the boy pronounced dead could you please try and make arrangements to inform his mother straight away as she normally plans a hospital visit for the afternoon thank you and im so sorry to have to bring this news harrault was in the small room directly behind the main entrance desk he fell silent as he put down the phone it was a moment before he got up and looked for fornier who as the main assisting investigator was the first person he felt should know fornier was in the general administration office typing in the same room was levacher and a secretary after confirming some details of the call dominic looked down thoughtfully at his typewriter he exhaled audibly suddenly his body lacked any strength to punch the black metal keys levacher mumbled the obvious about how awful it was then after a brief pause asked who was going to tell the family when no answers came everyone wrapped in their own thoughts he added i suppose well have to wait for poullain to decide and the secretary who had stopped typing at the same time felt she had her emotions under control until the silence and constrained atmosphere suddenly got the better of her and shielding part of her face she hurriedly left the room hushed voices in the corridor questions muted surprise then finally again silence the pall spread through the small gendarmerie as if by osmosis whispers of death seeping through the cream plaster walls within five minutes the full complement of nine gendarmes and two secretaries on duty knew from there it started spreading through the town a young sergeant went out to buy some cigarettes there were two other people in the shop at the time who heard that the rosselot boy had died one of the shoppers next calls was the boulangerie where five more heard the news it ricocheted through the main town shops echoes of death which by the time dominic had fired up a solex and started heading out towards taragnon and the rosselots had already changed the atmosphere in the town centre or was he just imagining it a nod of acknowledgement from marc tauvel restacking his front display of vegetables but then a look that lingered slightly madame houillon following his progress around the square staring she was overinquisitive at the best of times but now her head was slightly bowed as if he was a passing hearse respect for the dead dominic felt that he couldnt wait any longer before heading out poullain was expected back soon but that could be an hour or more by which time monique rosselot could have started her way to the hospital or worse still by the way the news was spreading through the village her hearing it clumsily from a neighbour or tradesman calling by my condolences im so sorry to hear hear what dominic didnt want it to happen that way after a quick consultation with harrault theyd jointly agreed to break protocol by not waiting for poullain and harrault signed out a solex twenty five minutes had passed since the call from the hospital nothing in his past had prepared him for this all those years stuck in back radio and communications rooms both in the legion and the marseille gendarmerie hed had so little people contact between the code and call signature manuals the gun range and procedural guides for arrest filing and administration there had been no special training on consoling grieving relatives how should he phrase it how would he even start on the edge of town dominic passed the tannery and leather workshops tucked into a hillside rock outcrop where the road was cut away dyes and acids for stripping and treating the skins were heavy in the air piquant sauce for the smells of death dominics eyes watered slightly he wasnt sure whether they were sensitive with emotions or it was a combination of the fumes and the wind rush on the bike eighty yards past he was clear of the fumes and the smells of the fields took over ripening vines lemons almonds and olives grass and wheat burnished almost white by the sun he breathed deeply but still his eyes watered images flashed before him the dark brown blood patches against the wheat the boy being carried to the ambulance the gendarmes tapping through the field with their canes monique rosselot opening the door to him on that first visit and the single candle in her daily bedside vigil of begging and praying to god to spare her son how could he possibly bring her this news the well of his emotions finally ebbed a gentle catharsis washing through him without warning his body trembling against the vibrations of the bike he bit at his lip and swallowed back the sobs at the back of his throat no sound emanated his steadily watering eyes and his trembling body the only release valves his reaction confused him hed witnessed murder before battle hardened by his years in marseille was it the age of the boy or monique rosselots strongly displayed devotion for her son bringing him closer to her emotions too close her saddened face in half shadow reflected in the glass against the candle light tears streaming down her cheeks as he told her that her son was dead dead no oh god no as he uttered the words breathlessly what lay ahead of him suddenly seemed impossibly daunting one simple sentence destroying monique rosselots life tearing down any remaining vestige of hope his grip on the throttle relaxed the bike slowing slightly apprehension gripping him full force his conflict was absolute he knew he had to go he cared too much to risk her hearing casually from someone else passing but he dreaded having to utter the words himself and so he switched off part of his mind driving the last few miles cared for her he hardly knew her pushed the thoughts back as he turned his solex bike into the rosselots driveway parked dismounted words shaped in his mind almost on the edge of his lips all of them sounding so inept inadequate the messenger was that what worried him being the messenger always being remembered as the man who brought the news that her son had died as he approached the door he noticed the boys bike still against the garage wall waiting in expectation his mouth was dry he took a last deep breath to calm his nerves as he reached for the door knocker and flipped it down twice but it did little good his nerves built to a crescendo blood pounding through his head as the door opened and she stood there her young daughter clarisse in the shadows behind he fumbled the words seeming to catch in his throat but from the quickly distraught look that came back from her she seemed to already half know perhaps from his expression and awkwardness and he only managed to say im sorry i have bad news i wanted to make sure i caught you before you headed for the hospital before she started pleading no no no no no no a repetitive and steadily rising mantra to hopefully drive the inevitable away her eyes imploring him as she slowly collapsed to her knees and her body finally giving way to convulsive sobbing she let out a single wailing cry the cry painful and desperate pierced the still morning air echoing from the walls of the small courtyard and rising up the gentle slope of the fields beyond jeanluc rosselot had been working in the west field out of sight of the courtyard for over an hour digging to find the leak in an irrigation pipe he didnt see or hear the solex approaching the cry was the first thing he heard he dropped his spade and started running the fifty yards that would bring him in sight of the courtyard halfway another wailing cry arose a gap then another and already he feared what was the cause before hed thrashed his way through the last of the dried grass in the almond orchard and the courtyard came into view it was like a frozen tableau the gendarme trying to stand proud with his wife on her knees before him one hand clutching out and almost touching his ankles as another cry of anguish drifted up across the field he saw the gendarme reach out towards her shoulder as if to reassure but the hand hovered just above without connecting each of them stood alone grief unshared though jeanluc felt even more distanced and awkward looking on he tried not to accept what the tableau told him force it from his mind in search of other explanations but in the end the imagery was too strong left nothing to interpretation his son was dead his first instinct was to rush towards his wife comfort her but after a few paces he stopped his legs felt weak and he was strangely dizzy the field seeming to tilt slowly away from him the light oddly dim in hues of dull grey and suddenly it seemed ridiculous for him to bound down the hillside waving even if his legs still had the strength to carry him and so he resigned himself and slowly sank down gave way to the buckle in his knees until he was sitting they hadnt seen him they were faced away and he was still too distant and so he watched from a distance through the grey haze through eyes stinging with tears watched his life and all he loved all that he had prayed these past days for god to save slowly slip away with the tilt of the grey field into nothingness the death intensified the investigation and the mood in taragnon and the surrounding villages questions and speculation peppered much of village conversation part nervous reaction there were few other escape valves new snippets of information about possible suspects and excitement at an impending apprehension replaced their normal daily routines and pleasures in a village where local gossip and drama was a large part of the daily fare this indeed was a lavish banquet but in the lulls moods were dark and sullen silent it was either feast or famine the first main change in the case came in a call from pierre bouteille notifying poullain that he had passed over his file to alexandre perrimond aix chief prosecutor the main reason is workload with this now a murder investigation im afraid i wouldnt be able to devote the time it deserves ive brought perrimond up to date on everything no doubt hell make contact soon the morning after la provencal carried the news in a three column band at the bottom of its front page carrying over onto page two it was the most complete story theyd carried yet of the rosselot case going over the initial assault its impact on the small village of taragnon and police progress the police were quoted as having a few possible suspects and how they hoped to conclude the investigation and press charges within the week poullain had spent almost twenty minutes on the phone the previous afternoon with the reporter the end of the article went back over other notable child disappearances and murders in provence over the past decade mostly from the marseille and nice area underlining the rareness of such incidents in inland villages perrimond made his mark on the case early within an hour of being on morning duty poullain received a call from his office in aix i see from this item in the paper that you have a few possible suspects that is news to me from the information i was passed by my assistant pierre bouteille i understood there only to be one it is still only one the other suspect mentioned to prosecutor bouteille a certain alain duclos was fully interviewed and later my assistant fornier checked his details hes a nonrunner were still left only with the main suspect in the file machanaud bouteille might handle things differently but i like to be informed before having to read it in the newspapers the phone was put down abruptly headline chaser poullain muttered after hanging up the call put poullain in a bad mood for the rest of the day he pressed and niggled at dominic about small details in their final report making him retype it twice before he was satisfied most of it went over dominics head he typed mechanically the words little more than a blur he was still preoccupied with how the rosselots were coping most of the news had come from louis whose girlfriend valerie was friendly with the rosselots neighbours the fievets they were the rosselots closest friends in taragnon clarisse rosselot had stayed with the fievets during moniques daily hospital vigils so that jeanlucs farm work wasnt too heavily disrupted monique rosselot had hardly left the farm since receiving the news asking the fievets to get whatever shopping and essentials were needed jeanluc had meanwhile buried himself back in his farm work was out in the fields much of the day the one time shed left the house was to use the fievets phone when shed finally summoned up courage to call her mother in beaune to break the tragic news the mother was going to travel down to console her the next day a day before the funeral but according to valerie at the same time jeanluc was talking about visiting his parents straight after the funeral hed had no contact whatsoever with them in twelve years but just couldnt break news like this to them over the phone he had to see them monique had complained to the fievets that while she understood jeanlucs reasoning the timing was bad she felt as if she was being deserted when she needed him most louis message was clear she was coping but except for her mother and some neighbourly support from the fievets she was coping alone dominic sipped thoughtfully at a beer louis had poured for him the first day back at the bar after having seen the rosselots louis had teased and pressed him until hed finally admitted yes shes very pretty now the bonhomie had gone replaced by sullen camaraderie trying to understand through pieces of second hand information the grief and pain of someone they hardly knew dominic wasnt even sure what drove his curiosity pity for monique rosselot or to assuage his guilt at having brought her the news late that afternoon dominic had his worst argument yet with poullain over machanaud the emotions of the day before the relentless funnelling of evidence now aimed at machanaud the words hed blindly typed that morning as the mist of his preoccupation with monique rosselot lifted all converged and it dawned on him that they were delivering little more than a death warrant for machanaud he once again raised doubts about machanaud but you were the one who drove out and actually gained corroboration of duclos movements that afternoon poullain defended we know he was in the restaurant when the boy was attacked and he had little or no time spare after he left its all in the report and half of the facts you gained yourself i know but some of his alibis fall into place too conveniently almost planned and something about duclos makes me uncomfortable also im not convinced about machanaud even if machanaud was accused of raping a woman i would be doubtful but a young boy we have nothing on him in the past more serious than some poaching and drunken and disorderly and youre saying that duclos is the type possibly lets face it we know nothing about him at least with machanaud we have something to go by on past form and based on that it just doesnt sit right with me yes i suppose youre right we dont know much about him when they telexed through from limoges and told us he was an assistant in the prosecutors office they forgot to mention that oh by the way our friendly local assistant prosecutor has a history with buggering young boys hope that is useful but as you appreciate we like to keep that sort of thing quiet with public officials maybe that will follow in their next communication poullain smiled cynically you think that duclos looks the type dont you dominic ignored the barb for the second time no its more than that i mean why stop for oil when youre in a rush to see a particular girl and youre worried about being late why spend over an hour in a cafe when time is tight he probably only remembered the girl and hoped to see her on a whim when he left the restaurant or perhaps not even until he was at the garage which is why he asked about timing there was no specific meeting arranged as he told us he just hoped she might still be on the beach that time of day i dont see anything suspicious i dont know its almost as if he wanted people to remember him visiting at specific times that day and the girl was just thrown in to underline heterosexuality some of the facts are just too convenient the way that but they are the facts and you seem to be ignoring that poullain cut in or perhaps you can give us your alternative dissertation on how to prosecute based on type and looks hes a bit of a pretty boy a bit soft and erudite in manner he looks the type who would bugger young boys so lets sweep aside all the facts for a moment especially the fact that he was in a restaurant when the attack happened and aim for him perhaps you could explain your thinking to perrimond he works with assistant prosecutors all day he might be able to spot the type quickly marvellous why didnt we consult you earlier fornier dominic bit at his lip and went back to his desk he should have bided his time only the day before hed reflected on just this reaction from poullain but he realized now that the boys death had changed everything changed the mood and pace of the investigation that the keen scent for machanauds blood could soon drive a hungry pack a fast rising tide of panic that said cry halt early and swept away his previous resolve bauriacs church bell sounded in the square calling the faithful to evening mass it reminded him that there was a memorial service for christian rosselot in three days flowers incense candles burning monique rosselot on her knees before him her heart rending cry seeming to pierce right through him and drift unheeded over the fields and hills beyond still the memory of that moment sent a shiver through his body how much longer before that was him grieving the loss of his mother six months a year the bell tolled ominously in the background and he found himself looking towards the window and the sound filtering in with the muted shuttered dusk light he felt very alone cold and distanced from the gendarmerie activities around him and he tried to escape the fast descending gloom that the bell was striking for the inevitable for that which he would be helpless to change it was almost pm when machanaud called by the gendarmerie briant was on desk duty machanaud asked to see poullain and briant said that he wasnt there and looked at his watch adding but if you want to come back in forty minutes or an hour he should be back then or fornier warrant officer fornier is he here he would do no im afraid that hes with captain poullain in aix en provence briant noticed machanaud sway for a moment uncertainly as he took in this information hed obviously been drinking and mixing this now with deep thought didnt go well together is there anything i can help with a slow blink through bleary eyes then finally yes you can take a note for them machanaud shuffled closer and leant on the counter you can tell them ive now remembered the car that passed you might want to write it down machanaud waited for briant to grab a pad and pen from the side then said the words very slowly the last part in pronounced syllables it was very low dark green a sports coupe probably an alfa romeo an alfa romeo coupe have you got that yes okay but you realize that this is only a note if you want to make this part of any official statement youll have to return and speak with captain poullain okay okay i understand you have your procedures machanaud held up one hand defensively as he stepped back from the counter i just thought it important that they have that note while i remember yes certainly ill make sure they get it briant watched thoughtfully as machanaud shuffled back out probably back to the same bar where hed found inspiration to suddenly remember the car theyd walked for almost a minute in virtual silence through parc du pharo before the package was handed over waiting for the groups of tourists to thin out it was a large manila envelope chapeau looked briefly inside and saw the small bundles of cash it went well he commented your friend should be pleased yes he was duclos looked back at chapeau directly for the first time it had been his main worry that chapeau would have read the papers and discovered his lie it had been quite prominent in la provencal but still easily missed for someone only paying half attention wedged in at the bottom of the front page with no pictures accompanying he breathed an inner sigh of relief obviously chapeau hadnt seen it probably was illiterate or only read comics and gun manuals duclos thought cynically i think youll find its all there chapeau walked to the nearest bench sat down and partly shielding with the envelope counted one of the bundles then he measured its depth against the others three bundles each of francs one half size chapeau shut the envelope folded it over by the flap and stood up with the closest hed come to a smile in all of their meetings hopefully your friend can rest easy now and with a curt nod he headed back the way theyd come leaving duclos on the bench chapeaus car a peugeot was parked fifty metres back from the main entrance to the park hed arrived ten minutes early so that he could see duclos arrive get the registration number of his car it arrived punctually just two minutes before six dark green alfa coupe a neat compact car for a neat compact man everything in his life was probably neatly compartmentalized thought chapeau he watched duclos get out and enter the park and then waited a minute before following chapeau flipped over the newspaper on his passenger seat and glanced again at the report at the bottom of the front page hed already read it twice earlier that day pondering what to do the last person to cross him so blatantly hed left with his throat cut in a marseille back alley but with this alain he wanted to bide his time learn a bit more about him before taking any action at one point earlier hed laughed out loud at the double dupe in return getting payment for nothing somehow seemed divine justice but he couldnt get out of his mind the bad intent that had been there the possible repercussions if he had killed the boy a high profile murder case with a whole station of rural gendarmes with little else to do but catch the murderer hed have probably had to move to paris for a few years until things had quietened down ahead he could now see duclos getting back into his car he decided to follow thirteen and in that dream did you recognize it immediately yes it was the pond at broadhurst farm it only turned into a lake later and you said that jojo was already there could you see him clearly what did he look like stuart capel tensed as the tape rolled leaning forward lambourne had told him one of the key objectives had been to get a clearer picture of jojo lambournes notes were in his hand headed session th february he knew how the notes and the tape slotted together from the last tape sent i couldnt see clearly it was too misty and he was too far away then after a second i only saw him clearly when i was closer looking up through the water silence background drone of london traffic brief cough from lambourne stuart could imagine eyran struggling for a clearer image finally his hair was dark slightly curly and his eyes were bright blue or dark green i wasnt sure does he remind you of someone you know perhaps an old friend or someone from school longer pause this time eyrans low regular breathing came over clearly for a second no but theres something familiar about him yet i dont know why note one lambournes voice came across in a deeper timbre stuart dutifully followed the instruction and read the note an initial assumption was that jojo might be modelled on an old friend someone from eyrans past if thats now to be discounted why the familiarity after the note one announcement an eight second silence then continues in transferring to cassette lambourne had put in the break points it reminded stuart of linguaphone tapes with gaps left for student repetition did jojo tell you where youd met before no i told him i was looking for my parents and that was when he first offered to help and you went back because in the previous dream youd seen them there only my father another long silence faint rustling of papers that was when jojo wanted me to cross over told me that hed lost his parents as well and hadnt been able to find them until he crossed over did he tell you what happened with them nothing then eyran swallowing clearing his throat only in another dream later but he said it was years ago he could hardly remember it note two shared grief yet jojo conveniently has no memory of his loss eyrans loss is the main focus crossing over could symbolize to jojo that eyran trusts him is siding with him yet we know from a later dream that they are together in their search the barrier has by then been crossed lambournes voice on tape reminded stuart reminded him of their first meeting when did you first realize there was a problem and hed told lambourne everything the nineteen day coma the hospital the nightmares everything except how much hed resisted finally bringing eyran to see him clinging to the eyran he remembered eyran had awoken finally from his coma four days before christmas when did you first realize had it been when hed first told eyran his parents were dead the hospital staff had been briefed just to say his parents were ill in another ward until stuart arrived but then stuart remembered seeing that same look in that first moment of greeting eyran something distant and lost in eyrans eyes almost as if stuart was someone he knew only vaguely and couldnt be placed for a moment yet it remained through those first hours that split second delay in recognition and response at first the explanation in stuarts mind had been the shock and grief and eyran struggling to come to terms with the unbelievable the unacceptable but by the late evening as eyran prepared to sleep stuart was keen to know torrens assessment how much of eyrans slowness of reaction was due to the coma how much could be attributed to shock and grief was he under any drugs or medication that might cause such an effect how long might the condition prevail and most importantly might it be permanent torrens started with the obvious its too soon to tell hes only been out of a coma a day yes there has been some recent medication promethazine to cool his body temperature down though that shouldnt delay his reaction rate but possibly the shock of his parents death could cause such a reaction his mind might be numbed by the collection of recent events its just awoken electrical and chemical connections are flexing their muscles for the first time in almost three weeks and suddenly it has to deal with the fact that his parents are dead the numbness the slowness of reaction could be a form of protection i doubt if its all sunk in yet did he cry much when you told him yes a bit but what had struck stuart the most was eyrans eyes looking so lost desolate hed hugged eyran expecting a catharsis of sobbing which in the end had never come just the same sad distant gaze through watery eyes as they broke the embrace i dont think we should read too much into it for a few days ill run some detailed responsiveness checks then a few days stuart had always assumed hed be flying back with eyran the next day in time for christmas impossible apart from the necessary tests and monitoring there were eyrans other injuries to consider the cracked rib has a way to go yet and wed want to restrap that and run another xray before okaying him for a long flight dont reckon on him being able to leave before five or six days staying over christmas he knew he couldnt possibly leave eyran alone in hospital over those days but he wasnt relishing the call to amanda to tell her he wouldnt be back with her and tessa for christmas as it was it had taken him over a week to talk openly about his grief with amanda so many years sparring with jeremy fighting over stupid inconsequential things it all seemed such a waste now so pointless no opportunity left now for amends except to whisper emptily i love you vapoured breath on the chill air as theyd lowered jeremy into the ground the only thing to keep them close the past ten years had been eyran if it hadnt been for eyran hed have had the same relationship with jeremy he had with his father it was the nearest hed ever come to explaining to amanda his affinity with eyran hed lived part of his life through eyran the childhood he felt he had lost the mistakes and barriers between his father and himself that he could see being repeated between eyran and jeremy but at times hed taken it a step too far kidded himself he knew better about eyrans upbringing tried to be an alternative father and he felt guilt for that now in forging his own close bond with eyran trying to be honest broker perhaps he had stolen some limelight from jeremy precious years that now couldnt be replaced after explaining torrens prognosis brief silence from amanda finally i understand you have to stay with him but the silence and the tone said it all you should be here with us your family but how can i possibly protest about favouritism for eyran appear heartless by suggesting that you leave him alone in hospital over christmas thanks for understanding ill phone christmas eve then again christmas day i can have a long session with tessa then christmas at the hospital was a strange affair christmas morning everyone gathered in the canteen for a small show the highlight of which was one of torrens colleagues walowski playing father christmas with a heavy germanic it was like some exaggerated robin williams sketch with a couple of curvy nurses in short red skirts and black stockings playing his little helpers eyran smiled at intervals but was still too remote and withdrawn for full laughter even the first half smiles had only come that morning opening his presents from stuart christmas lunch had been laid on for later but stuart wanted something less organized more personal he got permission from torrens to take eyran into town and they found a lively restaurant a block back from the sea front the menu was a curious mix of texmex and italian with a sprinkling of christmas turkey specials but the atmosphere was wonderfully raucous and joyous party streamers and cheering and a small mexican combo in the corner played a range of tijuana christmas favourites tony orlando gloria estefan and santana they had taco dips to start and turkey for the main course stuart finished off with brandy pudding eyran with pecan and maple syrup ice cream they found it difficult to talk above the music and background noise and had to shout merry christmas as theyd pulled two crackers but eyran enjoyed the atmosphere regardless at least they could lose their emotions within it rather than feel obliged to speak to fill a silent void especially when stuart knew hed have to do most of the talking tiptoeing around such an emotional minefield hed already done it for three days at the hospital and was fast running out of safe footholds he noticed eyrans fingers tapping to the bands version of oye como va good something at least breaking through the barriers built by the coma a part of him getting back into the rhythm of life but the smiles were still infrequent stilted stuart had a southern comfort with his coffee eyran an elaborate butterscotch flavoured milk shake as they left half the restaurant was singing along to knock three times outside the fresh salt air hit them even a block back from the beach lets go down there walk along for a bit stuart suggested on impulse eyran merely nodded a faint smile threatening to escape on the front the air was bracing a fresh westerly breeze was struggling to clear some cloud built up the air warm and moist with salt spray as they walked stuart talked of tessa looking forward to seeing eyran theyd plan something special for new years day when they were all together and it was there walking with the warm pacific breeze buffeting them from one side ruffling their hair that the dam of eyrans emotions finally broke and he started weeping he mumbled i miss my mom and dad as stuart pulled him into an embrace then something about remembering mission beach where they all used to go for the day together the words partly muffled against stuarts chest and then finally lost among the sobbing and the noise of the surf i miss them too terribly stuart said but it sounded so lame empty consolation stuart felt the small body quaking and trembling against him and inside he felt his own sorrow rising again tears welling but this time it wasnt just for jeremy but for the strength of spirit and zest for life in eyran that now also seemed lost bitter tears and silent prayers on the mist of the pacific surf rolling in willing that the next days and weeks might see some improvement bring back the eyran he remembered eyran awoke in the middle of the night eyes blinking adjusting consciousness searching in that first moment for a reason had he dreamt again or had a noise perhaps disturbed him he didnt remember any dream and no sounds came except the faint swish and sway of trees outside his window as he held his breath and listened intently he tried to judge if the wind was rising a storm brewing but the movement of the branches remained gentle and steady soothing and swaying white noise to lull him back to sleep again was he still in the hospital or at his uncle stuarts house he looked at the light coming in through the window and tried to pick out shapes in the room faint light from a watery moon the hospital room had been brighter from street lamps outside the window larger and the two large trees his side of the hospital he could never hear moving for the thickness of the glazing sometimes the days in the hospital and those in england seemed to merge then suddenly he would be back once again in his room in san diego joy and surprise momentarily leaping inside that everything in between had been a bad dream before the shapes and shadows in the room slowly fell into place the nightmares and the time awake had sometimes been difficult to separate the friendly face of his uncle stuart voice echoing telling him his parents were dead doctors with tests and monitors smiling faces telling him that everything was going to be alright his uncle was coming to see him explain youll stay with us now well take care of you everythings going to be fine tessas looking forward to seeing you the rhythm of the band pumping through his body people cheering smiling as they clinked glasses everyone seemed so happy except him and so the sleep became a welcome release transported him back where he wanted to be the warmth of the wheat field where he might meet jojo and they could look for his parents again the first dream had been two nights after awaking from the coma the doctors said that hed been asleep for nineteen days but he couldnt recall anything not even the accident the last thing he remembered was his mother reaching back soothing his brow staring at her blonde hair as he sunk back into sleep only when he saw jojo in the dream did fragments of the other dreams start coming back to him that theyd been on this adventure before of trying to find his parents after the dream by the pond there had been another with him and jojo pushing their way uphill through thick woodland and bracken jojo had said that there was a clearing towards the brow ahead and from there they would see his parents waiting for him in the valley below after thrashing through a light had shone ahead and eyran could see the trees and bracken thinning see the clearing and he ran expectantly towards it hardly feeling the barbs of the bracken pricking his legs but as he finally burst free into the light he awoke since that night hed willed himself back into the dream each time before sleep to try and reach the brow and find his parents though there had been no more dreams with jojo only one with him alone sitting in a stark hospital corridor waiting for news on his parents from one of the rooms expecting jojo to come out at any minute and say that hed finally found them but in the end it was uncle stuart and a doctor faces forlorn eyes sad saying there was nothing that could be done the doctors tried their best but your parents are dead dead hed hid his face and his tears momentarily in his hands and when hed looked up again the corridor was empty his uncle and the doctor had gone he began to fear the entire hospital was empty that he was the only one there the last thing he remembered was calling out for jojo but no answer came except the hollow echo of his own voice from the corridor walls and so all he was left with was the stark solitude of those waking hours and sometimes those hours seemed like the nightmare and the hours asleep and his dreams the possibility of meeting jojo and being able to find his parents became a welcoming and warm reality familiar objects had been placed in his room his computer the daytona racetrack and baywatch posters to make him feel at home as if nothing too much had changed but unless they could tell him that theyd made a mistake that his parents were alive and had survived the accident none of it held any meaning for him uncle stuart and his wife amanda and tessa who tried so hard to play with him and cheer him became little more than vague background voices he was always trying to remember play vivid scenes in his mind of how it was picnics on mission beach a visit to disneyworld hot dogs at the chargers game going fishing on his fathers boat sometimes he could hear his father or mother speaking recall whole phrases and sentences the other voices around became an intrusion eyran wondered how far it was to broadhurst farm four miles five he got up and walked towards the window he left the light off so that the faint moonlight might pick out objects in the garden and the field beyond a large oak and two elms had lost nearly all their leaves only two large fir trees at the end of the garden moved with the wind the hedgerow separating the garden from the farmers field beyond tessas climbing frame the rockery and pond even small objects became clear as his eyes adjusted the field beyond was still indistinct except the faint silhouette of the line of trees on its brow he wondered if he closed his eyes and willed it hard if his mind could sail across the farm fields to broadhurst farm put an image in his mind so that when he went back to sleep his dreams might take him there again but he wasnt even sure which way it was was it over the ridge ahead or over more to the west the moon was a watery half through faint mist and cloud for a moment he thought he saw the dull shapes of figures moving beyond the garden but as he looked more intently they were no longer there it was just the shadow of tree branches moving on the breeze he closed his eyes and tried to imagine the wheat field beyond the hill let his mind drift until it was before him but hed never been there at night felt too frightened to let the image linger and he tried to cast his mind back to how he remembered the wheat field in daylight running through the sheaves with the warm sun on his back but the image never came it remained dark and cool shades of grey under the pale moon and the field for him in that moment became yet another symbol of death something that could only serve a purpose in his dreams if he could recall it in daylight perhaps he would ask his uncle stuart to drive past broadhurst farm the next day the first dream stuart became aware of was six days into the new year eyran had awoken screaming bathed in sweat stuart asked him if hed dreamt like that before and hed said yes but they hadnt turned bad like this one what happened in the dreams different things it was confusing some of it was at the hospital some at the farm where i used to play is that the farm we drove past the other day just down from your old house yes stuart thought it was quite a normal request that eyran had wanted to see the old house relive old and fond memories theyd stopped while eyran studied the front of the house saw the changes the different colours on the window frames and doors along with the familiar the basket ball hoop still above the garage door that jeremy had put up stuart had a quick flash of jeremy and him playing basket ball showing off for the kids jeremy had twisted his ankle sending the kids into guffaws of laughter as hed hobbled off they thought it was all part of the act abbott and costello do the harlem globetrotters theyd been quite close then lived only five miles apart in fact stuart had been drawn to the area on jeremys recommendation and then after only two years jeremy left for america as they drove off eyran asked him to turn right at the end of the road it was a narrow country lane and after another two hundred yards or so eyran asked him to stop again stuart pulled into the first available farm gate entrance this time they got out of the car and stood misty breath showing on the crisp air looking out across the fields stuart asked him if that was where they used to play yes theres a small pond in the copse over there eyran pointed towards a wooded area in a dip between the fields oval in shape no more than a hundred yards at its widest point then the wheat field on the other side rises up towards the woods at the back of the house little more than stubble now stuart noted looking bleak in the cold misty air the sun was weak and low in the sky hardly penetrating a faint mist which obscured its far end two crows suddenly crawking loudly and flapping away from a nearby tree broke them out of their moments reverie it was almost a week ago theyd made the drive what frightened you in the dream there was a ledge and a drop i didnt see until too late i started falling is there a ledge like that in the field no just in the dream eyran blinked slowly even the pond in the woods is very shallow at most up to my chest are you all right now brief pause for thought yes stuart playfully ruffled eyrans hair and forced a smile a vague smile returned nothing too harmful thought stuart just some old memories jumbling trying to sort themselves out probably driving by the old house and the farm fields had sparked it off but over the following two weeks there were three more dreams increasingly violent and disturbing and stuart began to worry most took place in the fields by the old house or at the hospital though one had been at the house in san diego at night with the pool lights on mist rising from the warm water eyran thought he heard voices coming out of the ghostly mist and moved towards it but it spread quickly and drifted in billows until it engulfed the entire garden and the house and he couldnt find his way through hopelessly lost and frightened the warm mist clinging all around him suffocating he awoke stuart asked him if any of the other dreams had involved him looking for his parents and after a moments hesitation hed answered yes in the hospital dream when stuart discussed it with amanda shed immediately opted for them taking eyran to the psychiatrist torrens had recommended stuart wanted to wait see what the next week or so brought it had been five days after his return before hed even mentioned the psychiatrist to amanda stuart remembered twirling lambournes card in his hand without really reading it as torrens explained some electrical activity within the brain concerned me it occurred on two different occasions but only on the last did it finally reach any motor senses and lead to eyran awakening which meant for the remainder it was largely confined to the subconscious it could be nothing but it warrants keeping in check given the tremendous grief eyran has suffered and coming to terms with the loss of his parents counselling is advisable in any case i dont think we should delay urged amanda these dreams are beginning to worry me why wait another week or so i want to give eyran some natural period of grieving some time for him to come to terms with the loss in his own way before sending a psychiatrist into the fray to force the issue i just dont see any dramatic change coming quickly hes not the same bushy tailed brighteyed eyran we remember and the sooner we accept that and try and do something about it the better i dont think delaying will help with the dreams hes having it could even do more harm stuart was insistent we dont know yet if his unresponsiveness is as a result of his grief and loss or a byproduct of his injuries and the coma and im not sure a psychiatrist would be able to tell that only time will tell some time for his grieving to subside amanda held his gaze for a moment with her best you cant be serious expression then slowly shook her head and went into the kitchen for the next five minutes he could hear plates and cups moved and stacked and kitchen cupboard doors closed with more gusto than normal perhaps she was right delaying was unreasonable behind her annoyance he could almost hear the words she was biting back you dont want to face it because youre unwilling to accept anything less than the eyran you remember only a miracle recovery will do for the golden boy but shed spared him the barb or perhaps wished to avoid what was now a stale and unnecessary argument between them absorption with eyran over and above his own family but that thin line was probably close to being crossed and she was painfully close to the truth part of him couldnt accept eyrans current condition perhaps never would be able to the psychiatrist was the last line of defence the final throwing in of the towel admittance that eyran was psychologically disturbed and needed help there was nobody there just rows of old weedkillers and pesticides and i recognized it as the shed from our garden my father warned me when we first moved in not to go in the shed until hed fixed it the floor was rotten and the old jars of weedkillers were dangerous i was confused i remembered him clearing them away that summer and now they were back did jojo say anything explain no i felt the floor shaky beneath my feet and he held one hand out to me but as i stepped forward i felt the floor give way and i i its okay eyran step back back stuart was yanked back to the tape sharp reminder of the dream when hed finally relented to eyran seeing lambourne eyran screaming and amandas rapid footsteps on the landing above i was falling falling everything spinning back break away away stuart sat forward his pulse was pounding hard as it had been that night racing up the stairs lambourne had mentioned the danger area of the dream endings that as much as possible he would generalize or pick out random details but still hed been caught out eyran in that moment reliving falling spinning down helplessly silence finally only eyrans rapid fractured breathing came across lambourne waited a few seconds more you must have been disappointed when you didnt see your parents jojo let you down and has he let you down in other dreams eyrans breathing easing more a faint swallow stuart picked up on lambournes tactic generalities to shift eyrans focus but the sudden leap seemed to have caught eyran by surprise stuart could feel the tension coming across with each beat of silence on the tape could imagine eyran struggling to extricate himself from one set of horrors sifting frantically through time and misty images probably only to find himself facing still more a simple consent and now hed put eyran through this a pang of guilt gripped him one hand clutching tight at lambournes report i dont remember exactly i eyran either still struggling for images or pushing away acceptance do most of the dreams too end abruptly in the same way lambourne prompted yet with the hope youll find your parents right up until the last moment at length a slow exhalation final admittance yes note five no explanation is offered by jojo for his failures from one dream to the next each one starts anew eyran filled with fresh trust and hope like an incurable gambler eyran conveniently blots past form from his mind and jojo is there to convince him that this time theyll hit gold lambourne went back to the early sequence of dreams before and after the coma then and during those dreams the first of running through the wheat field directly after the car accident and the last you remember before awaking in the hospital from the coma do any other voices reach you did you hear anything from outside i dont know im not sure eyran sounded flustered uncertain try to concentrate take yourself back and try to remember if you heard anything stuart saw immediately where lambourne was aiming after the last session lambourne commented that what went against the theory of eyran creating jojo through nonacceptance of his parents death was him appearing before eyran awoke and knew they were dead lambourne was digging for subliminal reference stuart felt for eyran in that moment wished that hed been alongside to hold eyrans hand as he delved back through the darkness of his nineteen day coma at length a low almost indiscernible muttering there was something a mans voice stuart felt his skin tingle what did it say eagerness in lambournes voice fear that at any second the images would slip from eyrans mind that that the woman was gone nothing could be done but there was still some hope for the other two staccato breathing the words mumbled in between there was the sound of traffic in the background then i was being lifted moved to one side was there anything else some other voices more distant someone i thought called my name but i couldnt be sure for stuart the images were suddenly too clear too painful he was still gripping eyrans hand only now he was by the roadside while eyrans shattered and bloodied body struggled for life gasps for life now no more than gasps for words then a lot of movement some lights passing which hurt my eyes a voice closer saying that it looked like another late shift but he hoped to make it up the next day and another voice more muffled speaking on a radio phone it was answering and crackling and the siren the siren again the siren and the crackling made me feel sleepy any more voices brief pause only the wheat field then and jojo note six memory of medics and police attending and first few minutes in ambulance nothing after that but it appears there was some subliminal reference for eyran to draw upon the fact that he knew his mother was already dead might explain why in the dreams she either didnt feature or was more distant stuart recalled from the oceanside medical report that eyrans coma hadnt been caused immediately by the accident injuries but by the fast accumulating blood clots and oedema soon after and while the cranial pressure was still building before stuart bit at his lip oh god eyran had been conscious for a few moments then and while he was struggling for his own life had learned of his parents fate stuart could hardly think of a worse scenario stuarts hand was trembling as he came to lambournes summary unless we can confront jojo directly in future sessions progress could be slow working second hand scant additional light i feel can be thrown on jojos core character and motives my plan would therefore be to side with eyran over specific questions instil in him a strong need to know the answers from jojo then switch over and try and ask them directly yet part of that process is in conflict all other voices are telling eyran his parents are dead and jojo is probably the only crutch supporting that part of eyrans psyche still clinging on refusing to accept the bridge between the two has to be crossed cautiously remove it too hastily destroy the illusion and eyran either falls into the void or has to leap towards full acceptance before he is ready yet if we dont act quickly jojo could become increasingly dominant it would then be that much harder to wean eyran away the threat of schizophrenia would be a stage closer stuart shook his head forty minutes of hell approved by a single signature and now another consent slip was before him approving lambournes foray to confront jojo in finally acceding to the sessions hed told himself that it was for eyrans own good but now he wasnt so sure he found himself wrestling with the nagging doubt that his own desire to have back the eyran he remembered might have played a part this time he wanted to be sure the decision was purely for eyrans benefit the pitfalls and dangers against the advantages lambourne saw jojo as a threat and no doubt he was right yet in eyrans troubled mind with his parents gone jojo was probably one of the few friends he felt he had left in this world and now lambourne wanted rid of jojo with another simple signature stuart picked up a pen then put it down again he flicked back through lambournes notes for more guidance but suddenly he found himself biting back tears and slumped dejectedly cradling his head in one hand fourteen the small back room was insufferably hot a ceiling fan swirled slowly but poullain could still feel his shirt sticking to his back he adjusted a small swivelling desk fan so that its sweep cut across him more directly the telephone rang it was perrimond the aix chief prosecutor ive had a chance now to think about this new information from machanaud and i think your assessment is right its a little too convenient that he should suddenly now remember an accurate description of the car has there been much mention of the car in taragnon or bauriac not so much in bauriac but we visited quite a few shops in taragnon and then the restaurant just outside where duclos had lunch the village is small news spreads quickly and machanaud hits the bars heavily spends half his time leaning on the counter swapping stories with barmen i think thats how he picked up the description of the car yes yes i would agree a brief pause flicking of papers from perrimonds end so what do you want me to do poullain asked its up to you but if you should decide not to ask machanaud in to make the statement official on the basis the description has been manufactured from local gossip id support that assessment i understand but he suddenly realized the decision was back with him hed hoped merely to provide background and let perrimond decide the desk fan cut a cool swathe of air across his chest more papers turning then oh i had a call from bayet the aix mayor yesterday apparently marcel vallon is quite a close friend of his mr vallon expressed concern about the police questioning of one of his house guests this duclos character of course this came a day before this new information so i felt quite safe assuring that monsieur duclos had merely assisted with some information and was not in any way a suspect the message was clear to poullain if they made the statement official they would be duty bound to question duclos again perrimond would have to backtrack on what hed said and call the mayor the mayor would have to call vallon and hed have to go cap in hand when he phoned vallon again to arrange a second interview this time under far less hospitable circumstances but he felt uncomfortable making the decision without more support from perrimond so you think it might be awkward to suddenly put duclos back under the spotlight the awkwardness i can argue with the mayor this is a murder case and we have to do whats right and damn the awkwardness but i would like at least to be armed with a good reason if at the end of the day it couldnt possibly be duclos because he was in a restaurant at the time and if youre already suspicious that machanaud has merely picked up on the car description from town gossip id rather not make the call id sound foolish you just phone vallon directly yourself for a second interview and be prepared for a cold blast of air and ill wait for the mayor to phone again and if and when he does ill tell him its something routine regarding a sighting of duclos car nothing to worry about really poullain its up to you what you do i see it would be awkward it would be foolish it would serve absolutely no purpose because the person concerned was somewhere else at the time there was only one sensible decision to be made and it was now entirely his to make no more clues or guidance i think i made my views clear at the outset yes you did now ive given you my input i can only deliberate on details you present to me for prosecution not how or why those details should be gained while the case is still under a rogatoire general and not yet passed to the examining magistrate its an investigative matter your jurisdiction whichever way it went he would never be able to say perrimond made the recommendation he was on his own i understand if i should decide to pursue the matter ill call you first as a matter of courtesy let you know whether or not to expect another call from the mayor perrimond mentioned that the warrant for machanaud would be ready the next day and that he would be requesting a pretrial for only three weeks time machanauds defence probably a standard state appointee will no doubt try and push for anything up to two months well end up somewhere between hows the statement from this woman he used to live with coming along it will be typed up later delivered tomorrow when we pick up the warrant through machanauds old work place on the carmargue theyd tracked down a divorcee with three children in le beausset with whom hed had a relationship shed had a child for him a girl but hed disappeared when it was only three she hadnt heard from him since nor had a penny been sent for the child the tale of bitter desertion of his hard drinking and violent temper tantrums lashing out at her and sometimes the children had been an important breakthrough built a picture that machanaud was not just a harmless oddball vagabond he had a temper was unpredictable and violent when drunk its quite a strong statement i think shell make a good witness on the stand good the case against machanaud was looking stronger by the day that was where their energies should be concentrated not wild goose chases with this duclos and him having to fend off calls from the mayor they arranged the time for collecting the arrest warrant for machanaud and poullain commented i should also by then have decided if therell be any follow up on the car description and duclos very good ill see you tomorrow perrimond bit lightly at his lip just after he hung up the call had gone well except at the end he realized hed sounded too nonchalant already confident of the decision poullain would make dominic finished his shift at pm he changed at home fried two veal steaks tossed some salad and fifty minutes later sat with his mother on the back porch sipping some chilled white bordeaux in the fading evening light pale pink then crimson streaks along the skyline finally ochre in the last of the light his mother asked if he was going to cut back the mimosa in the next few days he did most of the gardening now shed become too frail and theyd talked about the mimosa the week before but hed just been too busy recently with the investigation workload should be lighter soon how was it going she asked he made light of it didnt want to burden her with his disasters that they were probably charging the wrong suspect and there was little he could do about it he just said there were two strong suspects but that evidence was light on the one he suspected the most difficult they talked about his older sister janine and her husband possibly visiting from paris at christmas shed missed the previous christmas and had come out at easter instead her boy pascal was now nine her younger daughter celeste just six his mother surveyed the garden fondly probably remembering her grandchildren running around playing earlier in the year then her eyes fell back to the tree and the mimosa its starting to get strangled we shouldnt leave it too long dont worry this weekend or next ill see to it the tree as far as she was concerned it might as well be the only one in the garden a young tangerine tree now a bushy six foot high his father planted it two years before he died he saw its first blossom but died before the november when it fruited his mother viewed it now as a symbol shed seen two years full fruit how many more would she witness from what her dear departed had planted and now a nearby overgrown mimosa was threatening its continuing blossom and fruit and she was too weak to cut it back it somehow seemed unjust that after a lifetimes work and struggle theyd moved to this quiet backwater in expectation of a long and peaceful retirement and within four years his father was dead another two and his mother was gravely ill dominic lit a night light on the table as it became too dark and they sat like two lovers on their first date except that the stories swapped were old and familiar fond memories perhaps one of the last chances fading light his mothers skin had a pale yellow translucency to it looking now even more ghostly under the flickering candle light he drank faster than normal swilled away the unwanted thoughts he was on his third glass to his mothers one before he even noticed he started to mellow the sound of cicadas and crickets added rhythm to the night pulsed gently through his veins when his mother finally announced that she was tired and headed for bed he felt suddenly restless he sat only five minutes on the empty terrace before resolving to head back into town she hardly made it past nine these days the medication sapped her strength as much as the illness was this what it would be like when she was finally goneempty terraces by candlelight odette or some other simple shop girl with the right face and the right smile sat opposite just to fill the void he needed another drink louis was half full he sat up at the bar and louis after pouring a beer asked if hed seen monique rosselot again louis interest was somewhere between the healthy curiosity he showed in any good looking village woman and genuine concern for how she was coping with her grief dominic hadnt seen her nor anyone else from the gendarmerie as far as he knew we probably wont now until the memorial service theres been nothing new somebody would probably have to see her straight after arresting machanaud tell her that a suspect had been arrested but he couldnt tell louis news could too easily reach machanaud on the village grapevine i think a lot of people will be going to the service louis commented i know originally shunned now at least in her worst hour the village would be there for her it took time to be accepted in taragnon louis gave him the latest from valerie through the neighbours jeanluc wasnt coming back from seeing his family for another day or so might not even make it for the memorial service monique was distraught awkward that she might have to be alone in front of the village tongues would wag either that they were having problems or that he didnt care about his sons service both were far from the truth monique had protested to the fievets but that might be the impression given louis shook his head louis distant slightly glazed expression said it all if louis had a woman like that he certainly wouldnt desert her at a moment like this they indulged in small talk and it quickly came around to odette and his love life he had only seen odette once since the investigation had started had been too busy but louis was a master at reading between the lines when it came to romance was astute enough to realize things werent going well the glazed look was back broken prematurely by a renewed throng at the bar louis excused himself to serve the cinema had just emptied out and two tables in the corner had also filled louis was obviously going to be rushed little time for more talk after a few minutes dominic knocked back his drink and said his goodbyes to a suddenly harried louis his first intention was to head home but as the night air hit him he decided on another drink he aimed his bike for the maison des arcs bar two kilometres out of town it was almost empty just a few diehards clustered at the bar he stayed only for a quick beer and a play on their fruit machine then went on to the bar fontainouille near taragnon just past eleven thirty when he arrived this time he ordered a brandy it was busy though most of the noise and activity was towards the end of the room with a group of ten or eleven mostly men egging on whichever contestant theyd backed in a table football game among the noise and throng it was a moment before he noticed machanaud though machanaud was already staring at him and he had the uneasy feeling that he probably had been doing so on and off from when hed walked in machanaud raised his glass dominic nodded back and smiled he looked just as quickly away from machanaud as if he was partly listening in on a conversation of henri the barman with a customer two bar stools away in the corner of his eye he could tell that machanaud was still looking over at intervals he wondered if unconsciously hed sought out machanaud he knew this bar was one of his regular haunts see the suspect on his last night of freedom reconcile the image in his mind of the harmless vagabond and poacher with how perrimond would soon portray him before a jury woman and child beater child molester murderer dominic wasnt convinced by the exgirlfriends statement felt that poullain had prompted too conveniently she had a hard face lined and worn and looking ten years beyond her thirtyfive years struggling between absent fathers state aid and part time cleaning jobs to keep food on the table for four children the bitterness and scars showed in her mannerisms and speech with machanauds illegitimate child shed probably been unable to get aid then suddenly comes the chance of payback we cant get you money but we can get you retribution just say the right thing and well nail the bastard how often did a woman like that get the system working on her side the table football game was breaking up money was changing hands coins and notes being slapped on the table side back patting and jovial abuse someone suggesting that the loser join the paraplegics league machanaud started singing a ribald version of lili marlene to the cheers of some colleagues perhaps he would simply whisper in machanauds ear go and go now get far away come tomorrow afternoon therell be no more chances theyre out to get you and theres nothing i can do to stop them dominic wished now he hadnt come he felt awkward could hardly look machanaud in the eye knowing what was coming the next day he swilled the last of the brandy in his glass and knocked it back was suddenly eager to get out but it was already too late machanauds voice had trailed off mid chorus he was peeling away from his group and coming across a swathe of black hair fell across his face and he tilted his head as if to see better and how is young monsieur fornier this evening fine i was just leaving but can i get you one before i go he held out a f note to get henris attention in the same hand as a gauloise machanaud held up a small tumbler with half an inch of pale amber spirit in the bottom he passed the tumbler across the bar ill have another eau de vie if thats okay dominic ordered and paid and henri poured in his normal elaborate style of pulling the bottle gradually further from the glass after taking the first swig machanaud commented i suppose youll all be over the moon with this new information dominic squinted quizzically at machanaud surely the gossip network didnt work that quickly for him to already know about his exgirlfriends statement and was he drunk enough to be sarcastic about his own downfall i dont understand what information the car the car i suddenly remembered what that car passing looked like i came into the station two days ago and told your desk sergeant who was that didnt catch his name young chap brown hair slightly wavy briant or levacher thought dominic why hadnt poullain mentioned it cant be many alfa romeos like that at least not in this area youve probably tracked it down already but dont want to say much salut machanaud took a quick slug knocked back half his eau de vie then he was suddenly thoughtful isnt that why youve asked me in tomorrow make the statement on the car official dominics mind was still reeling duclos car yes yes he answered hastily perhaps in all the confusion poullain had overlooked mentioning it the past days had been a nightmare of notes typing statements reports and filing for the arrest warrant or perhaps poullain intended to mention it only once he had the full statement from machanaud perhaps it had been dominics suggestion to serve the warrant on machanaud by asking him in to make another statement rather than trying to serve it outside and risk a scene fighting to subdue a handcuffed machanaud all the way back in the car now he knew why poullain had been so keen on the suggestion machanaud had expected to be asked in to make his car statement official machanaud noticed dominics consternation and leaned over whispering conspirationally its okay if its awkard to talk about it i understand machanaud cut a pathetic image smiling probably thinking that half the local gendarmerie were busily tracking down the car that would solve their largest case in years and hed provided the vital clue totally unaware of the sword of damocles hovering over his own head dominic felt a pang of guilt aiding poullains false pretence with the statement or was he missing something with machanaud that poullain and others saw machanaud with one reassuring hand on dominics shoulder smiling the harmless poacher dominic smiled in return tinker tailor poacher murderer machanaud leering one hand raised with the rock to smash down on the boys skull which was the right image from the end of the room came renewed shouting and cheering two new contestants had stepped up to the table football machine beyond a plume of gauloise smoke dominic could smell the eau de vie on machanauds breath eau de mort water of death machanaud swilling down the boys bloodstains from his clothing dominic shook the images away the atmosphere in the bar was suddenly claustrophobic suffocating he stood up are you all right asked machanaud yes yes fine its just someone i should have seen and i suddenly realized i might now be too late he looked at his watch am officially poullain finished todays shift at midnight but often he was still there up to half an hour afterwards chapeau backed into a side farm track a hundred yards along from the main gates of the chateau on the opposite side of the road some trees and foliage mostly concealed his car though he had a clear view of its main gates through a small gap two days before when hed first made the drive hed kept a discreet distance from the alfa romeo all the way from marseille especially on the quieter country road on that first occasion he waited across from the chateau fifteen minutes then spent the next day checking with the land registry and vehicle registration in paris the chateau was owned by one marcel vallon one of the areas largest vineyard owners and wine producers but the car was registered to alain duclos with a limoges address so this wasnt duclos family house he was probably a family friend or business associate visiting chapeau decided to return see if duclos was staying with the vallons or whether two days ago had been just a one time visit after half an hour he saw a bentley leave then a delivery van arrive fifteen minutes later then nothing for over twenty minutes chapeau was getting impatient it was late morning and the heat was building up he longed to get moving and get some air rush through the cars interior when finally the green alfa romeo appeared it was heading towards him he quickly ducked down out of sight heard the engine drone pass and raised up again he counted three seconds fired up the engine waited for a renault dauphine to pass heading in the same direction and pulled out harrault was on desk duty and confirmed that poullain was still in his office getting ready to leave dominic decided to look through the desk register first then talk to poullain harrault flicked back the page then stood to one side as dominic ran one finger down the entries nothing he was halfway through checking back through the entries when poullain came out of his office he looked between harrault and dominic i thought youd finished a few hours back fornier looking for anything interesting yes i just bumped into machanaud he asked how our enquiries were going after his statement about the car poullain met his stare for a moment then nodded towards his office it was obviously going to be awkward discussing this openly in front of harrault as soon as the door was shut behind him he questioned so what is the problem i dont see anything entered in the register and you wont not until ive discussed the development fully with perrimond but machanaud came in two days ago if hed come in five or six days ago or mentioned it on one of our first interviews it might have been different poullain walked around his desk stood to one side of his seat think about it fornier weve been asking about sightings of his car at bars and shops throughout taragnon half the village has probably heard about it and suddenly miraculously machanaud remembers what it looked like dont be so naive machanaud has picked up on the description from village gossip is that what perrimond thinks no its what we have both discussed at length as a distinct possibility hell no doubt tell me what he thinks tomorrow dominic shook his head regardless of what we think it should be taken as a full statement and entered in the register we can interpret it any way we wish after that poullain was keen to keep some distance in the argument a pending decision from perrimond gave him someone detached to blame i have to take perrimonds guidance as prosecutor if the statement is so obviously false is not heading anywhere concrete theres no point i cant force him to pursue it also we would probably then have to question duclos again an additional waste of investigative time we can ill afford perhaps it wouldnt be such a waste of time if we mention his car has been sighted put him on the spot his story might change something new might come to light poullain stared dully at fornier so they were back again to forniers groundless suspicion of duclos when he thought about perrimonds concern about the mayors call the whole messy background he was stealthily avoiding mentioning the eagerness in forniers voice was almost laughable and what is going to change all the waiters who saw duclos while the attack took place are suddenly going to say they were all wrong they didnt see duclos or is duclos going to do it all for us and just say that the waiters were all lying he wasnt in the restaurant at the time wake up its not going to happen theres no point in us even going through the exercise is that your assessment or perrimonds poullain stared back icily both it was already clear the answer that would be coming the next day thought dominic the statement wouldnt be made then i dont agree with it dominic noticed poullain openly flinch then his head cocked slightly as if he hadnt heard properly his eyes darting fleetingly across the desk top for explanations before looking up again the surprise showed in his face in their previous disagreements over duclos dominic had always given way for a moment poullain looked undecided how to rise to this new challenge then at length he exhaled audibly and waved a hand to one side a dismissive gesture as if the whole affair was suddenly unworthy of his emotions and what exactly do you propose to do if the decision is made not to take the statement then as the assisting investigative officer i would like my disagreement of that action recorded are you sure thats what you wish to do youre aware of its seriousness dominic felt uncomfortable under poullains intense glare his heart pounding heavily but hed gone too far to back down again now his mouth was dry as he stammered yes poullain stared at him a moment longer then sat down and rubbed his forehead with one hand fornier obviously wasnt going to budge was forcing the issue to its limit the procedure normally used only in extreme cases was to protect officers who felt that a line pursued in an investigation might later reflect badly on their career records once filed the complaint would no doubt end up on his area commanding colonels desk in aix all manner of awkward questions and complications could arise faced with that perhaps it would be easier to take machanauds statement and visit duclos again regardless of the fact that it was all a waste of time do everything by the book perrimond would just have to put up with another call from the mayor poullain sighed is there anything else he looked up only fleetingly his annoyance evident no then ill make your thoughts known to perrimond when i visit him tomorrow and pick up the arrest warrant you stay here in case im not back before machanaud arrives what shall i tell him if youre not back by then tell him you think its for a statement but you wont know for sure until i arrive poullain forced a tight smile if you get your way youll be partly telling the truth chapeau sat in a cafe in a side street just off marseilles rue st ferreol duclos car was parked twenty yards along in the same road he could just see its back bumper was ready to mobilize quickly if it moved coins already on the table for the black coffee and brandy chaser he was drinking at one point following duclos from the vallon estate he thought of giving up the road headed towards aix and marseille but most interesting of all it went through taragnon the village where the boy was found for a while he toyed with the enticing possibility that duclos might stop in taragnon perhaps even revisit the old crime scene but duclos headed straight through the village shortly after when duclos took the marseille rather than the aix road it struck him that duclos might be visiting vacherets for one of his young boys he decided to continue following they were parked close to the main shopping area and the panier district and vacherets establishment were over a mile away hed followed to the corner and seen duclos head in the opposite direction towards the opera and the palais de justice before deciding to find himself a cafe in the small side street and car sit hed been there now forty minutes and this was his second coffee and brandy where was duclos shopping no doubt buying designer shirts and silk underpants or whatever gay paedophiles liked wearing or perhaps a quick stroll in the puget gardens sitting on a park bench and feeding the pigeons while surreptitiously getting his jollies by watching young boys in shorts play with a football people like duclos made him sick clean on the outside dirty inside and with the cheek to look down their noses at people like himself he might be a thug and a killer for hire but there was no pretence what you saw you got no false labelling he sharply knocked back another slug of brandy to quell his growing anger little shit feeding him a false line to commit a murder that would have had half the gendarmes in the var hunting him down the irony and sheer joy of stiffing duclos for the francs was already waning he wanted more much more if hed actually gone through with the murder he would have probably killed duclos straight after collecting the money followed him out into the country lanes beyond aubagne pulled up alongside at the first deserted crossroads pumped two bullets through duclos head and drove on bliss it had still been a tempting proposition following duclos to the vallon estate that first time but he was glad now hed shown restraint if he was patient nurtured it well this could turn out to be a long and profitable association a meaningful relationship no point in fucking duclos on the first date he had been disappointed to discover that duclos wasnt part of the vallon family that would have been a remarkable pot of gold to strike so quickly but he was obviously a family friend perhaps came from a similar moneyed background waiting and watching he would soon know chapeau suddenly pushed back from the table almost spilling his coffee duclos was passing heading for his car chapeau was poised to stand up and head out and pointed to the coins on the table for the benefit of the concerned waiter looking over duclos put a shopping bag in his car leant over rearranged something in the back seat for a moment then straightened up and locked the door again he started heading back down past the cafe chapeau turned away from the window looked back towards the bar until duclos was past then got up and went out he hovered by the doorway for a few seconds until duclos was about eighty yards ahead and almost at the end of the road then followed he saw duclos turn right this time heading towards la canebiere and the old port with the panier not much further on perhaps duclos would end up at vacherets after all along rue st ferriol towards la canebiere the shops gradually became smaller and seedier cheap souvenirs and cards carved wood and ivory beads and caftans goat skin drums a delicatessen with goats cheese and couscous they might as well be in the kasbah half the shopkeepers and people passing were north african at la canebiere duclos turned left towards the old port past the quayside cafes and the hotel de ville a brief respite of nice cafes and shops people dining out and looking out over the kaleidoscope of brightly painted fishing boats in the harbour then they turned into the winding panier back lanes dark and narrow cobblestone streets washing strung at intervals between the dank stone buildings to catch what few shafts of sunlight filtered through some yorrelling in the distance a radio playing the latest hit from morocco wavering pipes and strings that sounded like cats being strangled an old man in a black djellabah passed chapeau and on the corner in front of a small cafe with a beaded curtain entrance a young moroccan was trying to sell lottery tickets wearing a stained pale blue shirt black trousers and flipflops his watery eyes behind dark glasses stared distractedly at the corner gable of the house across the street chapeau doubted that he was really blind and listened hard beyond his repetitive sales chant for duclos footsteps in the next street finally he picked it up to the left thirty forty yards down he waited a second before following as duclos took the next right hand turn chapeau realized he was heading for vacherets at the end was a short street that wound up some steps with vacherets not far along in the next street chapeau kept a block behind hidden around the corner waiting until duclos had receded deeper into the street before walking in by the time chapeau reached the start of the steps duclos was already at its top turning left towards vacherets the short street was deserted one side was a half demolished building the other the blank stone side of a building plastered with posters two cats scavenged around a group of rubbish bins at the top of the street now that he knew duclos was heading for vacharets he might as well head back but he was suddenly curious to see how long duclos stayed twenty minutes it could be a simple business meeting forty or fifty minutes and he was probably with one of the young boys chapeau decided to wait it out found a bar not far around the corner with vacherets a hundred yards further up on the opposite side it was a small and seedy bar sawdust over cream and terracotta patch tiling the barman was fat and wearing an orange tshirt two sizes too small from his accent he was a local marseilles though over half the bar were north africans two men playing checkers in the corner two at the bar and a group of local workmen in blue overalls at another table the radio was playing tony bennett the barman poured the brandy chapeau ordered chapeau waited an easy listening station edith piaf bert kampfaet and frank sinatra followed a minah bird in the corner chirped in on every other chorus chapeau wondered how the moroccans liked frank sinatra after cats being strangled it must sound like golden syrup it was his kind of music but the accompanying minah bird and the sounds of checkers being banged down to grunts and shouts started to grate on his nerves half the afternoon hed spent tracking this prick duclos and now duclos was probably in some lavish back room with potted palms getting sponged down by one prepubescent boy while getting his rocks off with another while he sat in a bar surrounded by grunting moroccans and a minah bird singing along to frank sinatra great his hand gripped tightly at his glass he looked at his watch almost thirty minutes ten minutes more and hed leave but minutes later already thinking ahead to the other pieces of the puzzle hed like to put into place with duclos an idea struck him a smile slowly crossing his face perfect his initial gloating gradually gave way to the worry that it was almost too good too cheeky it must somehow be flawed but after chewing it over some more between brandy slugs he saw few pitfalls at the same time it might also get rid of some of his pent up anger and frustration with the little turd all he had to do was keep close to the end of the bar look out at an angle until he saw duclos emerge then head out a moment beforehand he put some change on the bar to cover the brandy ready for a quick exit chapeau sat through billie halliday maurice chevalier mario lanza and brenda lee with minah bird accompaniment and checkerslapping percussion before duclos finally emerged chapeau stepped out briskly he was at least eighty yards ahead of duclos and hoped and prayed that duclos didnt suddenly recognize his profile from behind ten yards more six two he ducked around the corner sharply taking the steps almost two at a time now at a half run he stopped thirty yards down eyeing up an open doorway in the derelict building for suitability a second before stepping inside he went two yards in stepping over the rubbish piled up and waited the sound of duclos footsteps came after a minute the short street was deserted chapeau prayed that nobody else suddenly came into it a sudden sound from behind chapeau jumped wheeling sharply around to see a cat pulling at a rubbish bag its eyes met his for a second in the semidarkness then it scampered off chapeaus nerves settled back duclos was close very close footsteps almost upon him chapeau held his breath low shallow and as soon as duclos profile came into view he stepped deftly from the shadows and struck out quickly a right fisted blow to duclos cheek duclos hadnt seen him had only started to turn towards the approaching sound as chapeaus ham fist connected chapeau swung again hitting duclos nose from the side this time feeling the bone crunch and seeing the blood spurt as duclos crumpled and fell this felt good chapeau got in a quick left to the stomach as duclos was going down then as duclos hit the ground and lay prostrate on his side all that was left was to kick he managed one to duclos groin before duclos rolled over and put his hands down then made do with two swift kicks to his kidneys duclos started to look back up towards his attacker so chapeau pushed one hand against the side of duclos face jamming it hard against the ground half kneeling now he took out his gun a heckler amp koch mm and slid it next to his hand against duclos cheek duclos eyes shut tight as the cold steel of the barrel pressed home chapeau cocked the chamber the eyes scrunched tighter a breathless non escaping chapeau savoured duclos fear a moment longer before uncocking and releasing the pressure then deftly flipped the gun in the same motion and swung the butt twice sharply against the side of duclos ribs and again lower to his kidneys and stomach it was a measured attack he didnt want to kill duclos just enough to make him walk like an old man for a week and piss blood chapeau reached across and took out duclos wallet from his inside pocket straightening up he gave one farewell kick to duclos groin keep him away from the young boys for a few weeks then he slipped his gun back inside his jacket and scampered off down the steps to the receding groans from duclos which brought a smile to his face fifteen weve got a problem poullain was in perrimonds office the arrest warrant for machanaud had been duly signed notarized and stamped perrimond passed it across tell me poullain started by explaining that hed already reached the decision not to make machanauds statement official for the reasons theyd discussed the other day when the problem arose his assistant fornier had been told about the car sighting by machanaud while off duty and was now of a different mind so much so that if it wasnt entered officially he was threatening to file a complaint with the commanding area gendarmerie colonel though it might be a complete waste of time pursuing the statement perhaps under the circumstances it will be less awkward if it is made perhaps where did this fornier meet up with machanaud in a bar in taragnon i see perrimonds nostrils flared and pinched back as if an odious smell had just hit him though it was unclear whether his disdain was directed at fornier or poullains lack of control over his staff leaving aside the implications for a moment before this happened with fornier you personally had made the decision not to make the statement official no point its very obviously fabricated and interviewing duclos again would serve absolutely no purpose at least two people saw him at the time of the boys attack his alibi is solid so now it was down to varying degrees of awkwardness thought perrimond another call from the mayor or questions from the area gendarmerie colonel tell me about this fornier whats his background young twentysix years old was with the foreign legion in algeria for four years then joined the gendarmerie in marseille did he see any combat action in algeria none that i know of his work was mainly with radio and communications back room logistics stuff he took a similar position with the marseille gendarmerie what made him move to bauriac from marseille his mothers ill dying from cancer he wanted to be close to her and he put in a request for transfer through marseille we had no communications or logistics department just purely street pounding work but he took it he was pretty desperate feared she might have only six months left and so was willing to take whatever was offered so he has sacrificed career advancement in order to take care of his dying mother very noble though from perrimonds half smile it was difficult to tell if he thought it was noble or just foolish then he became more thoughtful why did you specifically use him to assist on this investigation my main assistant harrault was in the middle of another investigation plus i thought forniers past experience with marseille might come in useful a fair degree of liaison with marseille was necessary particularly with forensics the complaint if its made will probably end up with colonel houillon here in aix is that correct yes i get one copy its noted and filed and another goes to colonel houillon i have quite good contact with houillon perrimond glanced down brooded for a second as if his ink blotter might inspire him he was slow in looking up look say nothing to fornier for the time being tell him the issue is still being decided and youll know something tomorrow but i think i have an idea anything reported for your area chapeaus voice was husky and muted as if people unseen might be listening in no nothing yet when did you check last just before seven when i finished duty it was over twentyfour hours since the attack thought chapeau it was unlikely the report had been made his police contact jaquin was a detective inspector stationed in the panier revenge for a client who had beaten a club girl was the story chapeau invented jaquin would have little sympathy for such a client the club wanted to be forewarned of being named in any police statement or perhaps the incident might be reported simply as a mugging hed asked jaquin to check the station nearest the attack nothing filed yet not even for a mugging ill phone again at the same time tomorrow just in case thanks but chapeau knew that most reports were made within hours and had certainly filtered down within twentyfour hours even if made from another station the ploy had confirmed what hed suspected duclos had something to hide didnt want to report the mugging and risk contact with the police giving duclos a beating had put him on a high for several hours but it was nothing to what he experienced now as he thought over the information gathered during the day duclos wallet had been a veritable treasure chest of information identity card credit card for banque nationale business cards mostly lawyers from the limoges area and a recent payslip it was for a provincial government office in limoges department e four phone calls later hed ascertained what department e dealt with and from scale pay rates duclos position hed dropped the credit card in a panier back street a block away hopefully someone deserving would pick it up go on a spending spree perhaps the supposedly blind lottery ticket seller next time by hed be wearing crocodile skin shoes and sporting a rolex duclos would have to report the card lost or stolen to the bank and if it was used fraudulently he would be duty bound to make a police report or be liable for the expense hassle with the bank and the police perhaps duclos would just eat the expenditure oh this was fun and he felt sure that the best was to come department e francs per annum duclos was an assistant public prosecutor chapeau had only been to jail once for twentyseven months at the age of eighteen hed been a club bouncer since sixteen and one night threw out three students who were getting out of hand with the bar girls one of them landed badly as he was thrown out and broke his collar bone the boys father was a leading businessman a member of the chamber of commerce and the golfing partner of a local prosecutor charges for grievous bodily harm were pressed and a three year sentence called for the trial was a farce a onetrack railroad chapeau served all but nine months due to good behaviour but one vision had stayed with him strongly through the years the prosecutor and his assistant huddled in conspiracy through the instruction process and the final trial then smug and elated as the sentence was pronounced the boys father had come over and congratulated the prosecutor another triumph plotted on the golf course it had been chapeaus first taste of the system at work hed vowed then that if he was to continue making his living from physical enforcement it would be done in the shadows and with the buffer of an organization that knew how to work the system fifteen months out of jail he became a milieu enforcer at first it was just low key strong arm work intimidation and threats the occasional limb broken the work ranged from small time gambling protection and loan debts to non payment on street level drug packets but within three years hed progressed to the big league and made his first hit an area dealer had pocketed heroin with a street value of almost francs claiming it had been seized in a police raid through an inside police contact the milieu discovered that wasnt true it couldnt go unpunished he thought again now of the two smug prosecutors smiling congratulating themselves slowly he twirled duclos identity card between his fingers and smiled himself a gay paedophile assistant prosecutor his entire life and future now resting in his hands the circle of revenge could hardly be more poetic this was going to be much more fun than he first thought the memorial service for christian rosselot was held at the church of st nicholas fifty yards back from the main bauriac square the inside of the church was a microcosm of village life and social stratas the first row nearest the altar was taken up with the rosselots and immediate neighbours and friends a dark complexioned woman in her sixties to monique rosselots left dominic assumed to be her mother she was dressed fashionably and well dark pierre cardin blouse and matching pleated skirt though perhaps a little too much jewellery dominic was surprised when louis had mentioned moniques mother visiting hed imagined her shrouded in a black djellabah like the drab old widows he remembered from the streets of algeria jeanluc had made it back in time and had also brought his brother and his mother his father had been too ill to travel the latest updates from louis through valerie as theyd filed into the church they stood to the right of jeanluc with the fievets immediately alongside the next few rows were taken up with village people who had an acquaintance or vague connection with the rosselots various shopkeepers monique visited regularly jeanlucs farm equipment and seed suppliers the family doctor louis and valerie the gendarmerie was represented five rows back with an assortment of mostly unconnected villagers who wished to pay their respects filling another four rows behind the murder had touched taragnon deeply sorrow and gentle weeping alongside those who were just curious or openmouthed trying to catch a glimpse of the rosselots in the front row four days ago curate pierre bergoin had held a small funeral service for christian rosselot at the burial ground chapel between bauriac and st maximin only jeanluc monique her mother and the fievets were present the family had wanted a private affair and the brunt of their grief had already been spent away from onlookers the memorial service started with the requiemternam dominic looked up as curate bergoins voice echoed around the church te decet hymnus deus in sion et tibi reddetur votum in jerusalem hear my prayer all flesh shall come to thee eternal rest oh god creator and redeemer of all the faithful grant to the souls of all thy servants and handmaids departed the remission of their sins that through pious supplications there were six of them from the gendarmerie harrault poullain servan briant levacher and himself dominic wondered if the division in their ranks was obvious poullain and he were at opposite ends of the group since the call late in the day before theyd hardly spoken it had come from colonel gastine his old commanding officer in marseille after the preamble of how dominic was settling in bauriac gastine quickly came onto the subject of the call hed had from colonel houillon in aix he might call me once in four months if im lucky so although he tried to make light of it the fact that he should trouble to call at all over such a matter made me realize there was something much more serious in the background apparently theres some sort of disagreement between you and your commanding officer over an investigation now in progress is that correct so pouillain had got to houillon before him yes its a murder investigation i dont think my captain heading the investigation here is looking fully at all the possibilities you might have very good cause dominic its not my position to question and thats not the problem though it hasnt been said directly only intimated if anything lands on houillons desk captain pouillon is going to request your transfer hell argue that he only took you in as a departmental favour to accommodate the fact that your mother was sick and you needed to be close to her he saw your main usefulness as liaison where marseille might be involved such as the investigation in progress but that if he cant use you effectively if your working styles clash there is really nowhere else in the gendarmerie he can deploy you effectively youll be surplus to requirement where would they transfer me dominic asked meekly perhaps if it wasnt too far away he could commute rouen is one suggestion brest another or possibly nancy dominic felt as if a trapdoor had opened all were at least three hundred miles away the message was clear if he didnt tow the line hed be sent into exile his mother would die alone im sorry to bring you this news dominic the way houillon put it it was almost as if they were doing you a favour by using me as honest broker warning you giving you the option if youd filed the complaint theyd have just shipped you out they houillon was slightly apologetic as if he felt a bit uncomfortable with all of this as well so i read into it that someone with far stronger influence than pouillan was involved pouillain couldnt risk directly asking houillon to get involved like this perrimond so in the end theyd all ganged up together to get their way over machanaud put the lowly gendarme in his place make sure he didnt cause any waves it had probably all been done with a few quick phone calls and now he was powerless a bloodless coup fratres ece mysterium vobis dico curate bergoins voice cut through some stifled sobbing from the front rows in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last trumpet for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall rise again incorruptible and we shall be changed for this corruptible must put on incorruption and this mortal put on immortality and when this mortal hath put on immortality then shall come to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in victory o death where is thy victory o death where is thy sting now the sting of death is sin and the strength of sin death his mothers pale yellow face before him smiling softly dont worry i understand if you have to go youre young and you have your work and your career and him protesting no i cant leave you at a time like this i promised machanaud screaming at him as he was being dragged from the interview room by servan and harrault you betrayed me i was meant to be here for a statement about the car i trusted you probably pouillain had planned it left him alone for over an hour with machanaud before hed returned with the warrant knowing fully that machanaud would get edgy without some reassurance busily basting their sacrificial lamb while poullain and perrimond cemented the final stages of their coup with the arrest warrant served and machanauds rights read out as he was dragged off to the cells for the first time it struck dominic what machanaud faced if convicted he would probably get the death penalty or would be exiled to a living death in the penal colonies with the harshness of colony regimes and disease rife average life expectancy was little more than six years from his cell window machanaud had probably even heard the church bells announcing the memorial service rallying the emotions of the village against him it was a daunting impossible choice leave his mother alone to die or stay silent and allow a man whose guilt he questioned be condemned teste david cum sibylla muted weeping now also from an unknown woman towards the back of the church quantus tremor est futurus the last loud trumpets spreading tone shall thro the place of tombs be blown to summon all before the throne nature and death with fixed eyes shall see the trembling creature rise to plead before the last assize the written book shall be outspread and all that it contains be read to try the living and the dead curate bergoin offered little guidance sixteen session or is it perhaps youre concerned that if we confront jojo ask him questions well frighten him off he wont appear in the dreams to help you again i dont know perhaps a bit the dreams are special between you and you dont want to spoil it its not knowing what to do eyrans head lolled as if asking consent of an unseen figure lambourne let the moment ride let the thought sink deeper home hed spent the last twenty minutes setting the mood to draw out jojo directly and finally he sensed he was close i think youre a lot surer of his friendship than you make out you dont think hed frighten off easily do you after a few seconds eyran exhaled slowly reluctant acceptance no but while you might like to know the answers know how jojo lost his parents and where see just how much you have in common youre not sure how to ask the questions but thats where i can help you lambourne left a long silence watching eyrans reaction his brow was furrowed then relaxed his tongue lightly moistening his lips the suggestion was fully there now all he had to do was fill in the gaps you dont need to worry about confronting him because we can go back to the past dreams and i can talk to jojo directly lambourne could see that eyran was teetering on the brink fighting between what hed like to believe being able to ask jojo questions guide some events for once rather than be just a passenger and what his senses told him was real the dreams were over they were in the past if he could change the past the first thing hed do was bring his parents back alive like a boxer with his opponent reeling lambourne knew that if he didnt keep up the momentum he could lose eyran at any moment but ill need your help eyran jojo is with you hes part of you part of your dreams if you really want to know the answers jojo will talk to me of that im sure will you help me i dont know how would i help by wanting to know the answers as much as me you do want to know about jojo dont you know why hes a friend know what happened to him so that you can better understand why hes there to help you lambourne watched each tick of expression on eyrans face as the messages went home eyran was close to coming to terms with it if you really want to know those things then im sure it will work eyran swallowed slowly yes i would like to know but lambourne could read the uncertainty still in eyrans face if it doesnt work if jojo doesnt want to speak to us then well soon know therell be nothing lost well just continue as before and for the first time there was a glimmer of acceptance an easing in eyrans expression as the portent of failure was lifted it wasnt the full acceptance hed have liked but probably the best hed get he pushed the advantage before the moment was lost so lets go back to the last dream you had try and find jojo tell me whats the first thing you see the sudden leap caught eyran by surprise and lambourne could see that eyran was suddenly perplexed fighting for images just out of reach its okay take your time lambourne soothed he counted off the seconds as eyrans breathing slowly settled back it was dusk the light was fading fast i was approaching the copse the dreams were always a tease thought lambourne images not clear mist that obscured reality fading light that meant he would be lost in the darkness if he didnt find his parents soon jojo always had him on a tight treadmill there was a figure on the edge of the wheat field just before the copse looking back at me but i couldnt see clearly who it was did you think that the figure might be your father or jojo perhaps i wasnt sure but as i started to run closer to get a clear view i came into a clearing of wheat which looked like it had been cut neatly away and jojo was sitting there looking down he looked sad at first lost but as he saw me he smiled and stood up lambourne saw an opportunity did you ask jojo what was wrong why he looked so sad no no i didnt when he smiled and stood up i was sure then it was my father ahead and i was keen to point him out to jojo lambourne could see the mixture of doubt and elation on eyrans face doubt that once again he might have ignored jojos emotions and feelings battling with his elation that it might be his father he would need to deal with the fathers sighting first to get eyran fully focused jojo quickly took control eyran described the distant shape fading into the shadows as jojo looked up saying that eyrans father had probably gone deeper into the copse jojo started to lead the way lambourne tensed as the descriptions rolled tapping his pencil on his notes over a weeks delay before stuart capel finally signed the consent slip and only then because thered been another bad dream lambourne knew that if he didnt succeed in drawing out jojo now there might not be another chance as eyran described them in pursuit heading across the field and through the trees towards the brook lambournes nerves bristled fearing another dream ending but this time they headed out of the woods and into an open field the other side and he was lulled into complacency by the setting and his preoccupation with returning eyran to where he first met jojo he was only alerted by eyrans sudden change in breathing suddenly more laboured his eyelids flickering rapidly does the dream end badly there yes we there was a dip i i fractured breathing eyran swallowing on his words its okay its okay you dont need to go there again step back from the clearing step back eyran looked startled for a moment lambourne realized then that hed shouted he quickly introduced a calmer more soothing tone lets go back back away from the clearing yes thats it youre away from any danger now lambourne left a few seconds gap between each comment as if waiting for eyran to catch up with him were going back to the beginning back to where you first met jojo in the first field he was sitting then in another clearing of wheat you mentioned that he looked very sad but we never found out why he was so sad eyrans breathing gradually eased he looked more settled you thought perhaps that you should have asked that he might have been upset you didnt ask but it doesnt matter we can ask him now i dont know im not sure i doubt and uncertainty returned swept across eyrans face like rising storm clouds lambourne could see eyran retreating a moment more and the chance would be gone completely but you need to know more about jojo you never ask him anything yet hes put in so much time helping you trying to find your parents dont you think its only fair hell be upset if you never ask one night youll be dreaming youll return to the copse expecting him to be there to help you find your parents and youll be all alone he wont be there lambourne saw eyran visibly flinch but as his expression settled back lambourne could see that a glimmer of acceptance had returned it had been the right ploy remind eyran that there was just as much risk in not talking to jojo it wasnt all one way lambourne spent the next minutes cajoling and reassuring one minute enticing and luring hoping that eyran would make the decision then suddenly once again stormtrooping before eyran finally relented and he broke through entered the elusive world of jojo lambourne spent the first minutes getting accustomed to jojos voice the intonation was slightly different slower and more purposeful but apart from that it was eyrans voice lambourne asked if he was eyrans friend where he knew eyran from but jojo was vague from before it was a long time back he got a similar answer when he asked jojo about losing his parents distant memories obscured by a haze of time lambourne wanted to stay for the moment with the present and the recent dreams did you lose your parents by the copse where you first met eyran you mentioned that youd had the same experience as eyran that he wouldnt be able to find his parents unless he crossed over i only wanted to help i was over the far side i couldnt help him unless he crossed over did you see him crossing over as a sign that he trusted you that he wanted your help lambourne knew that hed have to be more patient talking to jojo each response was being fed in turn through eyran yes but why the copse was it familiar reminded you of where you lost your parents there was something about it i couldnt be sure but i had the feeling stronger in the wheat field it was a long time ago though i couldnt remember clearly the same wheat field where you were with eyran in the last dream yes but eyran was running through the wheat field in the first dream it was that which made me look up and see him from the copse eyran too had mentioned that when he first moved in the house the wheat field had seemed familiar as if id been there before you could see him between the trees running towards you yes and i i felt his concern his worry as he was running through i knew that something was wrong the same concern that you felt when you lost your parents yes id felt the same and that was what first made you feel close to eyran made you feel you could help find his parents a small nod and a mumble of yes from jojo was that the first time you saw eyran yes then but i knew him from before the past again when was that i dont know it was a while a while ago its not clear how far back lambourne wondered how many years did it take for events to fade from an eleven year olds memory five six even in the unlikely event they had met as children and the memory had now gone jojos memory of losing his parents wouldnt so easily fade in inventing jojo eyran had simply buried the details in the past hopefully out of reach lambourne picked his way through some other dreams for jojos interpretation matching symbolism to a list hed made earlier the brook and the wheat field familiarity home loss of parents shared experience crossing the pond and entering the woodland shed trust now he added wheat clearing mirror images jojo filling the gaps that eyran didnt want to face but trust had quickly given way to dominance jojo always led eyran followed lambourne tried to draw jojo out on the failure of the dreams but jojo seemed as surprised and disappointed as eyran even as jojo submitted to the reality he knew eyran would have to face relinquished control his sense of failure mirrored eyrans disappointment do the failures in the dreams make you despair wonder if each time you might face the same disappointment yes sometimes but when i see eyran i feel hopeful again and i feel i cant let him down you feel that he expects it of you expects you to be able to find his parents yes but how do you feel do you feel you can really find his parents eyrans head lolled slightly then turned slowly back until he was again facing the ceiling i dont know but eyran feels sure i can find them and he needs a friend to help him i couldnt leave him on his own lambourne wondered if that was going to be the pattern jojo sidestepping passing the main responsibilities back to eyran and you think that your own experience with losing your parents will help yes at least i know how he feels it seems so so unfair that it has happened twice twice you mean with you and now eyran you both experiencing losing your parents yes but you remember so little about your own loss you said that it was too long ago for you to recall so how will you be able to help eyran create doubt start chipping away at jojos dominance thought lambourne he watched intently as eyran grappled with the thought eyrans expression was taut a muscle pulsed momentarily by his left eye if i went back perhaps i would remember clearer maybe i hope ill find my parents at the same time thats why ive returned why i want to help eyran so you were unable to find your parents when you were there before no i never found them the first small admittance of defeat if he could build on that get jojo to admit that he might fail again then he would be halfway to breaking his hold do you fear that you might fail with eyran as well that you wont be able to find them yes sometimes but i cant just leave him on his own give up lambourne sensed a chink of uncertainty but what if you cant help eyran find them in the same way that you have never been able to find your own parents eyran believes theyre alive but do you eyran shook his head struggling with images he didnt want to accept i dont know he needs a friend hes all alone when hes looking for them i was alone before i know how he feels i must be there to help him lambourne retreated a direct assault wasnt going to work eyran was still clinging resisting jojo continuing to hide behind eyrans desire to find his parents and take the passive role as just a helping friend what was it that felt familiar about the wheat field eyran said that when he saw you in the field in the last dream you looked sad can you remember why im not sure i just felt alone deserted who had deserted you i dont remember it was just a feeling the wheat field the water running in the nearby brook it reminded me of something did it remind you of losing your parents is that why you were sad yes but i wasnt sure it was somehow different i tried to get a clear picture but it was too far back again the convenient shield if you went back do you think youd remember the images would become clearer yes i think so the answer threw lambourne hed expected more hesitance and resistance why bury the events conveniently in the past then invite their exposure surely the last thing eyran wanted was him delving back yet jojo seemed to be encouraging it one area where they were in conflict lambourne wanted to stay with the present a bit longer continue exploring the dreams but he realized the opportunity to go back might not arise again easily he decided to take the bait call what he was certain was a bluff so lets go back jojo back to where the memories might be clearer lambourne started by taking jojo back just over three years to when eyran was almost eight the last months at the old house in england nothing no recall no memories the process was slow eyran left long gaps as he mentally jumped time frames and surfaced again lambourne prompted by mentioning their play areas by the old house the copse and the woods at the back the wheat field at broadhurst farm but nothing triggered a memory he decided to make the invitation more open take me back to when you first met eyran was it when eyran first moved into the house there were you friends together then no it was from before then go back further back to when you first met only eyrans breathing and the faint whirring of the tape reel punctuated the silence lambourne tapped his pen softly on his pad with the passing seconds as jojo panned frantically back in his mind through past events and images and almost two minutes had passed with only the sound of eyrans breathing now slightly more laboured lambourne became sure that nothing would surface or that jojos recollections would only be vague the painful memory of losing his parents selectively erased in the same way that eyran didnt want to accept his parents were dead jojo would have no recall of his when eyran finally surfaced and jojos voice returned it startled lambourne he felt numbed his mouth suddenly dry and he had to consciously snap himself out quickly adjust to the new situation and break the silence by asking the next question he knew that he sounded inept hesitant hadnt fully made the leap to what he now confronted his palms were sticky and he was stumbling as he continued with a few rudimentary questions for the first time he was eager to end the session and minutes later he stopped the tape recorder and counted eyran back awake he needed time to himself time to think he didnt mention anything to eyran or the capels as they confirmed arrangements for the next session and said their goodbyes lambourne sat back and closed his eyes easing out a slow sigh now looking back the signs had been there clearly it seemed unfair that it should happen twice it was long ago from before if i went back perhaps i would remember clearer as much as he suspected eyran had buried events in the past and so wouldnt want them uncovered jojo had been enticing him to go back throughout intent on only one track hed missed the signals but as the implications sank home he realized he was out of his depth hed need help even the few closing questions had made him feel awkward fishing in areas of psychoanalysis hed barely touched upon he looked at his watch almost three hours before he could put through a call to the university of virginia seventeen the warrant holding machanaud was an initial detention order signed off by perrimond for four days the maximum any suspect could be held without an official arraignment before an examining magistrate on the fourth day machanaud was transported from his cell in bauriac for a ten oclock hearing at the palais de justice in aix frederic naugier was presiding though informally dressed in a dark grey suit his red robes would appear at later hearings perrimond was to one side of the room briant as police escort behind machanaud and a greffier court clerk sat alongside naugier a young duty lawyer was dragged from the floor below to brief machanaud on what would await him in the proceedings during a thirtyeight minute hearing machanaud provided his main details for the court file naugier read the charges against him and decision on bail was held over to the next hearing in ten days by which time a state lawyer would have been appointed through the bar council at the close of the proceedings summarily naugier signed off a four month detention order in that time he had to complete the instruction process and pass the case to full trial on murder cases it was not uncommon for him to sign off two or three such orders peuch had already made it clear to machanaud that bail was unlikely given the combination of the charge and his transient background whether found guilty or not at the final trial unless dramatic new evidence came up during the instruction machanaud was going to spend much of the next year in prison dominic had bought a tv for his mother four months previous they were expensive a luxury item but it was something to keep her company especially during his long evening shifts he remembered the first time he saw perry mason french national programming was poor and slicker american productions predominated the popular courtroom drama however took time to catch on in france mainly because the proceedings depicted were alien bore no semblance to the justice system familiar to the french the quick changing drama of different witnesses surprises change of pleas and sudden admissions would in france be spread over several months of the instruction process witnesses were grouped and called in different sessions and testimony from the victims family the police forensics and expert witnesses such as psychiatrists were heard in continuing separate sessions with usually no more than two instruction hearings in any one month the process was long and arduous and complex cases could drag on seven to ten months before presentation to full trial but by that time evidence and testimony had been boiled down to just the essential facts necessary for a jury and three judges to deliberate witnesses could be recalled but their answers were now no more than distillations of their previous testimony during instruction no rambling no surprises no dramatics or sudden about turn admissions just the core evidence the prosecution and defence wished showcased for the jury as a result even murder trials lasted only a day or two dominic had followed the early stages of machanauds instruction hearings after a second hearing at which bail was refused two weeks later naugier summoned the rosselots apart from confirming vital details about the last time they saw christian what he was wearing and who he had headed out to see that afternoon naugier had to formally ask them if they wished to press charges against the suspect held almost redundant since if they had answered no the state would have continued with the prosecution regardless but it had to be recorded jeanluc responded of course while monique just nodded the next hearing almost a month later was to clarify police and forensic findings at the initial crime scene dominic was concerned the subject of machanauds car sighting might be raised but the hearings were strictly structured naugier conducted all questioning directly and any questions proposed by the defence and prosecution had to be presented to naugier two weeks in advance with a full schedule of topics to be raised then made available to both sides two days before the hearing perrimond had gone rigorously through the schedule with poullain and dominic there was nothing about the car sighting though in two or three hearings time dominic knew that they would start to cover machanauds later hearings and statements and the subject could come up he was dreading it having to face machanaud and his council and change his story for naugier four days after the call from houillon in marseille hed decided to throw in the towel and told pouillain that he wouldnt be proceeding with a complaint poullain wasted no time in sequestering him and briant into his back office closing ranks tightly by ensuring their stories matched poullain suggested that they both admit the meetings but modify the details discussed from what i understand machanaud was drunk on both occasions id be surprised if he remembers exactly what was said dominic agreed numbly along with briant but part of him remained uncertain hopefully the subject just wouldnt come up from what he heard about machanauds lawyer over the following weeks that hope began to fade only twentysix leonard molet had been in full practice just over three years and divided his time between a private firm and state aid cases machanaud had shown alarm at their first meeting that this would be molets first murder trial without fully appreciating how much worse his representation could have been most state aid lawyers were inexperienced stagiaires still in pupilage with invariably little or no courtroom experience over the weeks molet showed his paces and gained machanauds confidence making perrimond and naugier at the same time sit up and take notice unlike the usual state aid fodder he gained preliminary notes on time saw his client regularly and rebutted with sensible defenceangled questions for naugier to pose at instruction the case was going to be tightly contested while reading from his notes in testimony about the initial crime scene dominic felt molet staring at him intently at one point felt uncomfortable that molet was perhaps measuring him for a later confrontation later towards the end of poullains testimony naugier cut in admitting his confusion at the various positions of machanaud supposedly fishing the lane and the wheat field and where the boy was finally found naugier had already gone over the details twice without being fully satisfied and suggested that everything be reexamined at the scene itself perrimond and molet showed scant surprise examining magistrates often visited crime scenes to question suspects and witnesses the theory was that suspects found it harder to reconstruct an invented story at the scene itself discrepancies started to show looking at his diary naugier saw that the next instruction in sixteen days was for witnesses who had sighted machanaud on the day of the attack at that hearing he would notify both perrimond and molet of the date set for a reconstruction facing molet had unsettled dominic he felt somehow vulnerable that his guilt about covering up showed he thought seriously about going back on his agreement with poullain his mothers condition had worsened the week before and shed gone in for more tests if the prognosis was bad she might only make it another few months the instruction covering the police statements and later car references wouldnt be for at least six weeks if he filed the complaint a few days before the hearing and only then warned poullain of his upcoming change in testimony it could take them almost two months to manipulate his transfer longer if dominic stopped himself sharply shaking his head could hardly believe that he was actually weighing the timing of his mothers death just so that he could come clean and salvage his own guilt in the days after giving in to poullain he was haunted by images of machanaud in one dream machanaud was alone in the wheat field calling out as dominic turned his back and walked away youre deserting me just like the others why but as he turned and looked back at machanaud only then did he notice one of machanauds hands covered with blood could see where it had run down his arm the bloodied rock discarded at his feet and he awoke in a cold sweat catching at his breath even in his dreams he was trying to assuage his concern convince himself that machanaud was guilty he was doing the right thing but it was little consolation knowing that he was merely joining poullain and the rabble and machanauds plea about desertion lingered stronger than any other image the session with witnesses went smoothly mostly repetitions of their earlier police statements confronted by naugier with the various witness statements machanaud admitted that hed lied in his own statements only because he thought the police questioning was aimed at his poaching that day naugier didnt pursue the mention of cars or go deeper into machanauds police statements one he would tackle at the reconstruction the other at the session following naugier summarized the proceedings and looked at his diary the next hearing was the reconstruction to take place at brieulles farm present should be the suspect defence and prosecution and all relevant police and medics who attended at the original scene date set was in nineteen days time nd november chapeau tried the main palais de justice number in limoges again when hed phoned two hours earlier he was told that monsieur duclos was in a meeting but should be free at twelve hed left his name as emile vacheret but no number he would call back originally he had planned to call closer to the final trial date but during those months duclos memory could have started to fade the second time he was put straight through monsieur vacharet yes one moment ne quittez pas then duclos voice in hushed tones emile why on earth are you phoning me here are work you know that be quiet chapeau cut in i used vacherets name to get through who is this i dont understand duclos spluttered but it was a stock reaction suddenly he did know who it was and understood fully why are you phoning me how did you get this number im quite sure emile wouldnt be so stupid as to give it to you chapeau chuckled no youre right but your wallet was a treasure chest of information silence from the other end only the background clatter of typewriters came through to chapeau for a few seconds it was you the other month duclos hissed god this was fun chapeau wasnt sure what was more joyous the outrage in duclos voice or the sudden flashback of the incident itself ah you guessed and i wanted so much for it to stay a surprise look i just cant talk here duclos voice was muted edgy ill phone you straight back from outside give me a number chapeau looked down at the number on the dial and read it out five minutes no more or ill be phoning your office back again he hung up duclos made a quick excuse to his secretary about seeing a client on the third floor he wouldnt be longer than twenty minutes he headed out along the long corridor then skipped down instead of up by the time he reached the main palais de justice steps he was practically at a run chapeau picked up the phone on the second ring less than three minutes impressive duclos was even keener than he thought okay what do you want duclos voice came breathlessly obviously no patience left for preamble or politeness thought chapeau what was the world coming to luckily for you it looks like theyre nailing some poor local poacher for what you did to that young boy chapeau listened intently over the static on the line for duclos reaction a short intake of breath i dont know what youre talking about chapeau had no time for fencing look i know all about the boy in taragnon i saw the whole story in the papers and i know that theres no friend it was you you attacked him and that was why you wanted me to finish him off in the hospital you were afraid hed awaken and identify you youre wrong it was for my friend and i know nothing about taragnon my friend told me the boy was from marseille chapeau read the bluff could pick up on the tremor at the back of duclos voice if there was any slight doubt remaining now he was certain there was no friend duclos had killed the boy but he would have to push hard to get duclos to admit it come on duclos youve got a weakness for the young boys youre a regular customer at vacharets you want me to believe that this friend of yours has got exactly the same problem and you drive straight through taragnon on your way from the vallon estate to aix so does my friend whether you believe me or not doesnt really concern me flatter calmer voice now you seem to be forgetting along the way that the boy was still alive in the hospital youre the one who killed him you cant tell your little theory to anyone without incriminating yourself chapeau allowed duclos his glorious moments gloating before dropping the bombshell thats the beauty of it i never touched the boy when i got to his room he was already in emergency they were fighting to save his life i was annoyed at first that id missed him and then it struck me that if the boy died that night youd have no way of knowing i hadnt made the hit so i decided to claim the kill and stiff you for the money anyway i dont think ive ever had so much fun chapeau sniggered except that is for beating the shit out of you a week later longer deeper silence this time chapeau could almost feel the waves of panic at the other end duclos mind racing whether to continue denying question or retreat a slow exhalation why should i believe you now it was a weak protest more grudging acceptance than doubt you dont have to why dont i call the police and tell them about you hiring me to kill the boy let them work out if the boy died on the operating table or not after all they have access to all the hospital records and then when they turn up to arrest you you can tell them all about your little friend as an accomplice and seeing as the murder you hired me for never took place youd probably only get a few years no no dont do that chapeau savoured the panic in duclos voice before commenting so whether its you or your friend at least weve established one thing you dont want me to go to the police duclos was slow to answer his voice subdued barely audible no thats a shame because i had such a strong urge to do my citizens duty this time the story of that poor poacher in the paper really touched me so unfair you know i probably have a lot more in common with someone like that than than someone like yourself monsieur prosecutor it would almost feel like im betraying one of my own i think it would take quite a lot to persuade me to do something like that what do you want duclos had no energy left to spar with chapeau as it dawned on him that chapeau was probably telling the truth about not killing the boy and he realized how vulnerable he was a sinking sensation gripped his stomach in the past weeks of work hed finally started to free his thoughts from the nightmare of taragnon but now it was back with him full force bleak years of the incident rekindled with each demand from chapeau stretched out ahead he felt physically sick chapeau paused for breath like a lion circling his prey now he had duclos exactly where he wanted him ready for the kill but it was too soon besides only a couple of months had passed since hed probably cleaned duclos out i dont know yet ill have to think about that one ill probably call you again when the date for the final trial for this fellow has been set therell still be time then for them to haul someone else in for questioning and acquit him if they get new information when will that be flat monotone defeated washed along on whatever chapeau suggested it had taken him almost a month to fully get over the injuries from the beating in the marseille alley he was still haunted by the image of the cold steel barrel sliding against his cheek sure in that moment he was going to die duclos shuddered now once again he felt powerless and afraid two months maybe as much as four or five you know probably better than me how slow the wheels of justice turn in france why dont i send you regular press clippings keep you up to date no no its okay the thought of regular reminders through the post made duclos blood run cold surely chapeau wasnt serious just phone me when youre ready i will in the meantime i suggest youre a good boy and start saving up for when i call have you got a piggy bank you bastard you slimy fucking bastard oh i do love it when youre angry it gets me so excited chapeau blew an exaggerated kiss close to the mouthpiece and hung up eighteen voices from the rooms running feet in the courtyard a ball bouncing laughter crying christian biting back the tears after being stung by a bee jeanluc running down the field with christian on his shoulders and her worrying about them falling christian at six holding up his favourite puppet doll topo gigio hed left it in the courtyard and some chickens had pecked the stuffing out and an arm was almost falling off shed restuffed it and sewn the arm that night tucked it back in alongside him while he was asleep christian running out of the surf at le lavandou helping jeanluc by measuring the boules for a local village game christian blowing out the candles on his tenth birthday party fragments of memories some old pictures on the shelves and in albums christians old clothes and toys all that was left monique had promised herself each time that the next day shed clear them away the next day each time she looked at his room with each toy and item of clothing in exactly the same place hed left them that afternoon it was easy in that moment to believe that he was simply away a school trip or summer camp and soon would return but as the images flooded back the police drawing up in the courtyard that first day her candlelight vigil in the hospital the young gendarme at her door saying he was sorry so sorry a cold steel hand of reality reached deep inside her and ripped out her emotions her very soul stripped bare every fibre and nerve ending until her pain was rendered down to no more than pitiful numbness a grey void whispers in the first empty dawn after his death oh christian christian knowing in that moment that there would be no more answer no kisses like soft butterflies on her cheek no more embraces and feeling the warmth of his body clinging now only to the memory hugging the top cover of his bed around her and rocking gently as her emotions flooded over and once again her body sank into uncontrollable sobbing most of her crying had been alone sitting in christians room now it had come to symbolize catharsis the only place in the house where she felt comfortable venting her grief the rest of the house was for cooking cleaning sewing all the day to day mechanical chores to help push her grief into the background when she cried it was just her and christian alone a last vestige of intimacy only once had she been caught just over a month after christians death clarisse had been at the door half hiding behind the door frame perplexed monique had quickly stifled her tears and rushed to comfort her feeling guilty clarisse was probably suffering even more than her at only five struggling to truly grasp what had happened let alone come to terms with it asking questions about where christian was now would he be happy was it nice in heaven drawing pictures of christian sitting among floating clouds his topo gigio doll at one side his favourite tree from the garden an old spreading carob which he used to climb the other clarisses idea of christians heaven all they had was each other for consolation jeanluc had been distant remote when theyd lost christian theyd lost most of jeanluc as well she had shared her affections equally between the children but jeanluc had always shown more affection for christian and now it was more marked it was as if he was saying ive lost what i care about most in this family theres little for me here now long bland stares straight through them at the dining table little or no interest in any of their activities whenever any personal involvement threatened to come close he would make an excuse about cleaning tools or the tractor and head out to the garage and when his emotions became too much and monique tried to hug and console him hed shrug her off during the summer evenings he stayed out late in the fields but as the evenings drew in hed make an excuse and head for a local bar it was as if he could no longer bear to be in their company or perhaps it was the house itself reminders of christian many a time when he was working in the fields she would look up from the kitchen window and see him sitting on the stone wall at the ridge of the field staring emptily into space she would busy herself with chores for a while and sometimes as much as forty minutes later he would still be in the same position when she looked out the fievets next door had been helpful and supportive but they werent close enough for her to share her innermost thoughts about christians death or the worry of jeanlucs increasing emotional distance from her and clarisse the town had rallied well behind her shed been particularly touched by the memorial service but at some point afterwards she felt unable to face another village shopkeeper another sympathetic face and heartfelt condolence for over a month after the service she had hardly ventured out the fievets did her shopping outside the church captain pouillain had approached and said that someone was in custody a local vagabond justice would soon be done a satisfied firm statement as if he felt assured the news would salve her pain shed hardly remembered him from the first interview the only gendarme she recognized from the line in the church was the one who had called to tell her christian was dead he stayed in the background gendarme cap in hand most of it outside the church had been sympathy at arms length pats on the shoulder heads hung in sorrow muttered condolences with eyes downcast trite offers of help from people she hardly knew shed grimaced afterwards at the irony it had taken the death of her son to make her feel truly accepted in the village apart from the week when her mother had visited there had been nobody to share her grief until she looked up and saw clarisse at the doorway so for the past long weeks shed shared small stories comforts and hugs with her daughter fighting to come to terms with the unacceptable partly through the innocent eyes of a five year old fill the sickening void with whatever vestiges of love and affection remained in her house the only thing jeanluc had shown any interest in was the trial seeing justice done while shed been still too blind with tears and numb to react to poullains statement outside the church jeanluc had nodded enthusiastically asking several questions before theyd parted for the first time since christians death he appeared animated drawing hard on each word for comfort solace each week he phoned the police station and was brought up to date on the latest stages of the instruction next week theyre all going out to the scene of the crime to reenact it he commented one morning at breakfast but shed hardly been listening jeanluc mentioned it again the morning of the reenactment and only then did she pay attention two mentions and again a rare show of eagerness it must be important heading out he said that he would be working in the west pasture but half an hour later the rising wind made her think about how exposed the west field was and when she looked to see if jeanluc might have moved to the more sheltered fields at the back she noticed the car was gone as the wind rose it bent the wheat at an angle but not evenly one swathe would be cut sharply at an angle while another remained upright the path of the wind undulating weaving patterns through the field like rolling golden surf the morning air was cool the wind gusting intermittently and patches of brief sunshine broke through between the shifting grey clouds bathing them momentarily in light and warmth dominic looked thoughtfully at the figures ahead as the light shifted the shadow of a large cloud floated down the bordering hillside like a giant valkyrie until it hung over them bathing them in grey matching the intensity of their mood thirteen men in a lonely windswept field linked only by the death of a ten year old boy with the shifting light the wheat sheaves undulating with each pulse of the wind it was almost as if the field was protesting trying to evade them and keep its secrets the figures huddled close together to be heard naugier was going over information with the attending medics forensics and poullain in no particular order servan levacher and harrault were just behind closest to dominic a greffier constantly at naugiers side made notes in shorthand machanaud stood beyond handcuffed to an aix prison warden his turn would come next perrimond was to one side of naugier molet the other by the greffier dominic noticed machanaud glancing towards the riverbank his eyes bleary and distant perhaps stung by the wind or was he still in a daze with it all hardly believing that he was back in the same spot three months later charged with murder pleading for his life hed had a lot of time to contemplate his story naugier looked up at machanaud sharply at intervals as he went over the forensic details naugier then clarifed with machanaud which part of the river he was at that day and directed servan to remain standing where the attack took place everyone else was then directed down to the riverside two hours and in all of that time did you see or meet a young boy naugiers question cut through the air crisply the assembled group stood silent expectant naugier had spent the first minutes by the river confirming that machanaud had been fishing what he caught and the time he was there ten past one to just after three before coming to the key question no machanaud said with stronger emphasis than his previous answers even the furthest in the group heard his denial naugier looked pointedly in both directions did you see or meet anyone in that time foliage further down the riverbank was thin the view virtually clear most of the foliage and trees were clustered along the banks ridge bordering the farm track no following naugiers gaze towards the flat bridge a hundred yards downstream molet suddenly picked up on the significance the small bridge connecting the neighbouring farm to breuilles wheat field was in the police report as where we think the boy crossed mainly because there were no sightings of him walking through the village itself but he hadnt realized it would be so visible naugier pointed you are aware that is the only connecting bridge for some distance can you see it clearly from here molet prayed for machanaud to suddenly plead shortsightedness but his yes came crisply and you saw nobody crossing that bridge throughout your time here that afternoon no naugier looked thoughtfully in the other direction upstream then he slowly scanned up the river bank towards the path as if he was following an imaginary line towards where the attack had taken place monsieur machanaud can you see the gendarme we left standing on the path no i cant see him and the afternoon you were fishing did you see or hear anything from the position where the gendarme is now standing no naugier nodded this made sense the river bank dipped down sharply the only part of the lane visible was lower down as it sloped towards the road now let us return to your sighting of vehicles passing that afternoon starting with the first vehicle what time would that have been maybe forty minutes after i arrived what sort of car was that i didnt see i only heard the noise and the direction it was travelling up towards caurins farm caurin naugier flicked back a few pages in his file for the reference marius caurin owned the farm behind and was the first to discover the boy hed been quickly eliminated his tractor had been seen by at least three people going through taragnon at the time of the assault and machanaud too had mentioned his tractor leaving in his first statement the same caurin whose tractor you saw heading down the track what time would that have been perhaps forty or fifty minutes before i left naugier ran through with machanaud the remaining car sightings and timings then flicked forward to some blank pages in his file and started writing first car up at second car down at not heard by machanaud third car caurins tractor down at fourth car up at heard by machanaud fifth car down at just minutes before machanaud leaves himself heard and seen by machanaud machanaud leaves on his solex is sighted by naugier looked up towards poullain what is the name of the woman who saw machanaud leaving madame veillan naugier wrote in the name and added caurin returns to his farm and discovers boyestimated duration of attack minutes time of attack so certainly caurins tractor had passed while the attack was in progress but possibly the first and second cars as well he took out and lit a gitane and blew out the first fumes hesitantly with the various cars passing if indeed there was someone else there that afternoon they couldnt possibly have stayed on the lane the final attack must have been a few minutes at most any longer exposure in that position would have been too risky for the rest of the time they must have machanauds voice cut in but it wasnt till later that i remembered that final car clearly it was an alfa romeo it took a second for naugier to detach from his previous thoughts he noticed molet glaring at machanaud probably he had prewarned his client about making uninvited comments during instruction from your statement i thought that it was a citroen you saw molet stepped in before machanaud put his foot completely in his mouth it was on my clients original statement but later he went into the police station and advised of the change which from checking i believe has never been recorded he also later mentioned the same revised sighting to a gendarme in a local taragnon bar we expected this to be covered at a later instruction at which stage my questions would have been put forward for you to pose to the gendarmes in question a bit late for that isnt it naugier barked your client seems to have brought the subject up himself molet duly nodded and looked down one of the great inadequacies of the instruction process was that the examining magistrate could freely divert while the lawyers were restricted by the schedule provided two days in advance of each hearing diversions were unchartered territory to be avoided at all costs the only consolation was that it also worked against the prosecution perrimond looked equally as uncomfortable dominics heart was in his mouth at the sudden change in questioning hed resigned himself to prepare for the later instruction and tie his answers in with poullains but now with rising panic he realized that naugier could turn on him at any second and he wouldnt know what to say naugier turned towards poullain i understand captain poullain you were the officer who took the original statement regarding the citreon to your knowledge was this at any later stage changed poullain fleetingly caught perrimonds and dominics eye but hid his concern quickly yes i believe so he nodded back in the direction of briant a few days after his initial statement machanaud came into the station and saw one of my officers sergeant briant and he perrimond interrupted sir i along with the defence council would like to protest this was something scheduled to go into in more depth at a later meeting we are therefore as with monsieur molet totally unprepared with any questions that could add valuable light i see neither the prosecution or defence case benefiting that isnt quite how i feel molet countered i see my client benefiting from pursuit of this line of questioning its just that i feel he would benefit more with prepared questions as is his right naugier held up one hand sharply gentlemen in case you both need reminding i and i alone will decide the benefit of any line of questioning at this or any future instruction hearing at which you are both present you may still prepare your questions regarding this subject and propose them at a later date as originally planned but this now is for my curiosity naugier pulled hard on his gitane captain poullain i suggest you finish your answer monsieur molet was correct to mention inconsistencies because that is exactly why no record was made of the change in statement poullain was more confident firm the few seconds interruption had allowed him to gather his composure machanaud came into the gendarmerie a few days after his initial statement it was late in the evening and he was very drunk he advised that he now remembered more clearly the car that passed it was an alfa romeo sports an open top sports in checking there were no other sightings of such a car but in any case we were about to ask machanaud in to make his statement official when a day or so later he met one of my other men in a local bar this time he said that it was an alfa romeo coupe that he saw molet exhaled audibly he could see already where it was heading his worst fears at the issue being tackled early were being realized naugier gave him a sharp look warning off any possible interruption and turned back to poullain well surely one or the other should have been entered possibly but with machanaud changing his description to an alfa coupe we started to have doubts we had already fully investigated the driver of such a car and eliminated him from our enquiry he was in a local restaurant at the time of the attack at least three waiters saw him poullain waved one arm with us asking about the alfa coupe in the village there was a lot of local talk it looked as if machanaud had simply changed his description to suit and because the car in question had been eliminated we thought such a change in statement could only further incriminate machanaud hed been drinking on both occasions so we decided as much for his benefit to stick with the original statement that was the one we trusted most free from corruption by village gossip molet shook his head lifting his eyes skyward as if for divine help so now we are supposed to believe that all of this was done for my clients benefit ridiculous my clients later description of the car was consistent on both occasions i went over this with him several times nice to know you are so certain monsieur molet naugier raised a sharp eyebrow especially when it appears your client was probably drunk he turned to machanaud how much had you drunk the night you went into the gendarmerie to change your statement i dont know exactly perhaps a few eau de vies some beers a fewsome try to be more precise naugier pressed did you have more than normal yes yes probably i met with a friend i hadnt seen since we worked together in the spring naugier looked between poullain and molet as if pressing home a final seal of understanding machanaud was a known drunkard and bar slouch a few more than normal meant that he was ratted hopefully this has cleared up this misunderstanding you may as i mentioned earlier monsieur molet pursue this line of questioning at a later instruction when we go back over previous statements and captain poullain i would suggest that in future you put everything in files you present to me and let me decide whether or not they should be disregarded the noise of the trees swaying in the breeze seemed much louder in the silence following poullain muttered i understand while molet merely nodded and contemplated some dried leaves floating past that was it thought dominic he felt a sudden wave of relief wash over him weeks of worry and in the end hardly any blood had been shed the fact that the file entry had been buried equally to avoid local hierarchal awkwardness had never even surfaced and now looked unlikely to at any later date dominic had panicked halfway through that naugier would suddenly wheel around on him only now were the knots in his stomach easing a low sigh escaped lost among the wind rush through the trees and as quickly dominic was swept with guilt how could he be relieved at just avoiding some awkward questions when what he had witnessed had probably quashed one of machanauds last chances of salvation he followed molets contemplative gaze towards the river some sunshine broke briefly through the trees flickering off its surface glimmers of hope fading just as quickly as the clouds again rolled across he had built up a wariness and fear of molet and now found himself empathizing with him naugier drew on the last inch of his gitane and stubbed it out he looked upstream again his thoughts returning to where someone might have hidden if there was someone else no possible refuge on the lane with the cars passing no other area of flattened or disturbed wheat so where the view along for the most part looked clear but he needed a marker to be able to judge distance picking out levacher he asked him to go up to where his colleague stood then walk in a straight line until you are halfway down the river bank as levacher walked up the river bank forty yards beyond dominic thought he saw a figure peering through the bushes bordering the lane he was sure it wasnt servan he hadnt noticed a gendarmes uniform but just as quickly the figure was gone levacher reappeared after a moment naugier waved one arm directing levacher until he stood halfway down the bank can you see the gendarme now standing on the river bank slight pause from machanaud then yes naugier waved back shouting go twenty yards further along and stop he asked the same question of machanaud with levacher in two more positions further back and received a yes on each one there were few obstacles along the river bank the bushes low and sparse naugier instructed the greffier let the record show that the suspect could see a figure clearly along the river bank up to sixty yards past a point running parallel with where the attack took place molet looked down and slowly closed his eyes recalling one of the key greffier entries from the last instruction no other area of flattened or disturbed wheat was discovered other than that where the boy was finally found due to the risk of exposure of that position directly beside the lane where cars passed it has been concluded by the police and attending forensics that the first attack probably took place at some point down the river bank obscured from the lane now the two entries would be linked in the jurys mind and would effectively seal his clients fate he had started the morning with some optimism but bit by bit it had evaporated first the car discrepancies dismissed out of hand now the image of levacher standing in clear sight of all present levacher could have moved another twenty yards back and still been visible the image had burned home strongly his client was now on record that he was in clear view of where they thought the boy had crossed the river and where it was presumed the first attack took place any hopes hed harboured of seeding strong doubts about machanauds guilt had gone in that moment molet knew now that it would take nothing short of a miracle to save his client from being condemned as they made their way back up the river bank and onto the lane dominic noticed a figure in the distance towards brieulles farm it took him a moment squinting against the sting of the strong wind to recognize that it was jeanluc rosselot a sad and lonely figure among the shifting blanket of wheat watching them play out like markers on a draught board the scenes that led to his sons death nineteen what makes you think its a case for me mainly the boys use of french how fluent is his french asked calvan i only asked a few questions i got a bit flustered when he started talking in french it caught me completely by surprise i just asked a few rudimentary questions went about as far as my pidgin french would take me then stopped the session what few answers there were sounded pretty fluent but i couldnt be sure i just didnt ask enough questions marinella calvan was flattered that lambourne had called her theyd met three years previously at a medical convention in atlanta and on average hed called her three times a year since but this was the first real professional consultation the rest had been just minor points of reference do you know such and such professor someone whod usually published a paper stateside and he thought she might have better knowledge of it than him then invariably hed get around to how she was how was work life in general she had the feeling that if she said on one of the calls i got married the other month or i just met this great guy the calls would suddenly stop except when there had been the occasional great guy she hadnt told him she obviously didnt want him to stop calling at their first meeting a quick coffee between lectures at the atlanta convention they discovered they had a lot in common he was divorced she had separated from a commonlaw husband she was just coming up to forty he was fortyfour light banter a few quips some one liners that belonged more to seinfeld than freud questions and general background but no hard and fast answers two psychiatrists fencing with each other both knowing that what had partly spoilt their respective relationships was being too deep too questioning not fully switching off when home keep it light and simple this time theyd snatched a couple more coffees together during the convention then spent two hours at a cocktail bar on the evening it had closed but their only real date together had been almost eighteen months later december shed come over to the uk for five days to handle a case in norfolk and had managed to grab an evening in london he showed her his office and they went to dinner and the theatre nearby theyd also been able to find out a lot more about each other not just personally but professionally their respective views on psychology shed felt guilty at one point that she seemed to be hogging most of the conversation purely because her background with past life therapy plt was more unconventional though lambourne had admitted his fascination and seemed to be egging her on in contrast hed only had a few cases involving plt mostly conventional cures for phobia regressing a patient initially back to childhood in search of textbook freudinduced phobia discovering nothing so heading back even further patients with inexplicable fears of fire drowning or enclosed spaces were often found to have had alarming experiences in past lives which explained their phobias a recent survey showed that twentytwo percent of american psychiatrists used plt regularly alongside standard therapy though she had no idea of figures for the uk and europe what made you initially regress the boy she asked did you think that part of your problem might lie further back yes but in early childhood not in a past life that was totally unexpected lambourne had already explained the main background to the case the accident the coma the dreams with eyran clinging to nonacceptance of his parents death through a secondary character who claimed he could find them now he explained that much of the secondary characters memory seemed to be buried in the past it was impossible to determine if jojo was a friend from eyrans infancy who had since faded from conventional memory or a complete invention jojo also has no specific recall of losing his parents the main shared experience linking the two characters he said it was long ago from before seemed almost to be inviting me to go further back my sons almost that age now she commented thoughtfully sebastian would be ten next september but the children she had regressed over the past years now well over a hundred cases would no doubt provide the strongest points of reference very little of it did she relate to her own life when the boy surfaced again and started speaking in french do you know what year it was not exactly i asked him what he saw on the tv but he said that they didnt have one just a radio i was about to change tack my knowledge of french radio is nonexistent when he said but they have one in the local cafe so perhaps late fifties sixties or later if they were very poor or extremely religious thought tv was a bad influence possibly the only thing i managed to find out was where he lived a place called taragnon i looked it up on the map its a small village in the south provence well at least some ground can be gained by verifying his regional accent they were both silent for a second only the sound of faint crackles on the line between london and virginia why did she feel hesitant was it just her current workload the nightmare of arranging a week away and leaving sebastian with her father or a concentrated period of working close to david lambourne when she wasnt really sure what she felt about him then immediately pinched herself for even having the thought realized shed fallen into the trap of thinking that all his calls were just excuses to talk with her masked by a thin professional veneer this was surely different though she was one of the main recognized experts how many cases of true xenoglossy had she experienced in all her years her last paper published claimed twentythree but only nine did she count as significant four of which had been with children out of almost three hundred regressive sessions xenoglossy use of a foreign language unknown to the main subject parapsychological golddust rare and one of the strongest proofs for real regressions particularly where children were concerned she should be grateful lambourne had called her tell me something about eyrans parents and his godparents is the current family environment strong are they supportive yes very lambourne gave her the background eyrans parents living in california at the time of the accident the closeness with his uncle stuart and memories of england particularly a past period which features in most of eyrans dreams and is only a few miles from where they now live uppermiddle class thirtysomething advertising executive nice house in the country one child a daughter now just seven fourwheel drive solid sounds ideal probably no disfunctionality stemming from that quarter she thought but are they going to let us tap dance through eyrans brain while we explore this past life the only problem ive got right now david is workload it sounds exciting and id love to jump on the first flight but i just dont think im going to be able to get out of here for almost a week if thats the earliest fine but his voice carried a trace of disappointment i dont really want to do any more sessions with you not here so ill cancel next week with the boy and hold the week after do you think youll be over by then yes i think so she was already thinking ahead to preparation for the first session were going to need that time anyway for a start well need a french translator preferably a native francophile who can also tell us if the regional accent is correct and some method of transcription between us so that too many voices dont start interfering with the patients concentration theres also a number of things well need to know from the boys godparents look keep the next session date but use it to counsel the godparents at this stage inform them that the secondary voice has spoken in french and your next session will hopefully find out exactly why but dont tell them or even infer that it might be a voice from the past after all were not even sure of that ourselves only seconds ago the case had started to feel tangible and already the adrenaline was running she was afraid of losing it how many sessions should i schedule initially try and plan two within five days that at least should get us to the first stage finding out if the regression and its central character are real from her room if she looked out the window at an angle marinella calvan could see the university of virginia rotunda in the distance the half scale copy of romes pantheon which in the spring and summer attracted a steady stream of tourists the centrepiece of the seat of learning founded by thomas jefferson which at the us bicentennial was voted one of the proudest achievements of american architecture in the past years this was old grass roots america hallowed learning halls to some of the founding fathers of the constitution and one of the last places youd expect a department of parapsychology yet the university of virginia had for the past thirty years largely under the guidance of dr emmett donaldson been one of the leading centres for the study of parapsychology in america real strange term given that nearly all their time was spent bringing some texture and colour to the unreal the unexplained not only to convince themselves within the department but the army of sceptics faced with each case paper published in the end so many of their questions mirrored those of the sceptics was the regressions central character somebody famous somebody with a well documented life accessibility of general historical data about the period and area depicted patients interest in the same possible input from relatives or friends in the case of xenoglossy because the most startling characteristic was use of a foreign language most of her questions for lambourne to pose the capels revolved around eyrans prior knowledge of the language normal school grades in french school trips to france any french friends past family holidays in france french study books or linguaphone tapes general dexterity with the language from hearing eyran finally speaking as jojo hopefully the interpreter would know whether it was not only fluent but also accurate for the region and period described xenoglossy and conducting sessions under hypnosis had been the main area where her work differed from that of emmett donaldsons her professor and mentor through the years donaldson had built up a reputation as one of americas leading parapsychologists a fountainhead of knowledge on past life regressions backed by over case histories many of them published and to date five books her contribution paled by comparison case studies published one book though one area she had beaten him in already was the talk show stakes mainly because donaldson hated personal appearances one local radio and two tv one local the other a cable science channel the oprah winfreys and donahues were but distant dreams she had been working with donaldson on and off since shed gained her degree and doctorate at piedmont college and went into private practice for three years before realizing it didnt suit her and joined donaldson shed admired donaldsons papers and work with plr even while at piedmont three years later shed started living with a local architect but much to her fathers disappointment except for the compensation that she kept the family name they never married after a first miscarriage sebastian was finally born in donaldson was particularly understanding allowing her three years off until sebastian was at preschool but the more intensive period of work when she returned put extra pressure on an already strained relationship and within another two years she was separated it was only during that period that she gained her main focus of where she wanted her work to head donaldsons work had concentrated almost exclusively on regressions while awake conventional question and answer sessions this meant that he could normally only work with children up to seven or eight beyond that age conventional memory of past lives was invariably erased sometimes the memories faded earlier particularly in societies where reincarnation was not accepted all too often past recalls were labelled as merely infantile fantasy much of donaldsons work had therefore taken place in india and asia where reincarnation was fully accepted children with recall were not stifled by their parents apart from the restrictions of conducting conventional sessions did she really just want to follow in donaldsons footsteps the answer to both was no but where to find her own niche while she was attracted to the broader parameters of age and culture that hypnotic regressions allowed donaldson had pointed out that so many practising regressionists used hypnotism how would she be different donaldson had also built up one of the most impressive bodies of plr work ever recorded with children and she didnt want to totally turn her back on that legacy in the end she chose what she hoped was the ideal compromise hypnotic regressions but with a high quota of children and specific focus on xenoglossy most practitioners of hypnotic regressions had quotas of no more than twelve percent with children largely due to the difficulties of gaining parental approval for hypnosis she hoped to raise that quota to at least thirty percent the occurrence of xenoglossy also had stronger significance with children opportunity to learn the language adopted was far less in the middle of battling through one of her most difficult cases donaldson had commented just satisfy yourself marie if in doing so you also satisfy the doubters and critics then so be it set out just to please the critics and youll be lost theyll sense your vulnerability know that youre just playing to the gallery and have you for breakfast why do you think i never do live appearances the case had looked ideal at first nine year old son of a cincinnati doctor originally regressed to cure agoraphobia fear of wide open spaces a past life as a mexican conquistador was uncovered he became detached from an expedition due to a lame horse and spent days roaming in the coahuila desert before dying of heat exhaustion and exposure the spanish was convincing and she was already arranging additional sessions to prove the other areas of authenticity geography period events customs and dialect when the boys father phoned his sons main phobia had been cured he didnt want to risk his son being disturbed with continuing sessions she was destroyed no oprahs or donahues this time either donaldson was right shed invited the let down played too much to the gallery but it was difficult not to be influenced by the years of scepticism seeing donaldsons predominance of regressions in asia dismissed by one critic as having scant relevance there is far too much suggestion within the society of reincarnation young children already with over fertile imaginations could too easily be led it had been one of her main reasons for avoiding cases from that region they were less accepted by the gallery the university would have swallowed any lame excuse case studies in the us and europe were less draining on research funds she knew that one good mainstream case such as the cincinnati boy would not only boost her career but throw fresh light on the whole profession plr for the masses the kid next door with average grades suddenly speaking fluently in a foreign tongue with a linguistic expert and historian riding shotgun for authentication okay now we believe you marinella calvan wondered whimsically if eyran capel might be her ticket to oprah probably not shed become excited before and been disappointed too much could go wrong the boys godparents could refuse continuing sessions the boy could suddenly claim to be marshal petain or maurice chevalier his french could turn out to be no better than phrase book rudimentary or he could have holidayed or gone on school exchanges regularly in france it was too early to get excited twenty after the reconstruction molets hopes had sunk of being able to clear his client and the witness instruction before christmas if anything lowered them still further madame veillan was very sure of the time she saw machanaud coming out of the lane just after three oclock marius caurin was next with the time he found the boy and then the other people who had seen machanaud that day raulin where he was working that morning and the various barkeepers henri from bar fontainouille and leon who had seen him from threefifteen onwards repeats of the main testimonies which had ripped apart machanauds original police statement now all officially recorded for full trial molet could imagine the image that would be built up at full trial for the jury a day in the life of a lowlife vagabond some casual farm labour followed by a few swift eau de vies then heading out half drunk for some poaching only he sees the boy and decides to spice up his lunch hour with a bit of buggery and murder then back to the bars again to what celebrate drown his regrets steady his hands again or perhaps blot out the horror of the bloodied images still with him or was it that leons at threefifteen was part of his regular routine and he wanted to make sure everything appeared as normal molet knew that the statistics for people cleared at the final trial having gone completely through instruction were grim less than eight percent the best chances of acquittal were during instruction with the examining magistrate but that now looked unlikely with machanaud he would go the full course the only way to introduce a lesser charge was if machanaud admitted the assault said that hed only hit the boy to knock him out there had been no intention to kill try to get a manslaughter charge introduced which normally carried a five to eight year sentence hed mentioned it one day to machanaud tried to make him realize how heavily all the prosecution evidence weighed against him but again machanaud protested his innocence was almost outraged at the suggestion id rather that they did hang me or send me to devils island than admit to something i didnt do in february the instruction hearings started to involve witnesses more as character assessments of machanaud molet watched machanauds exgirlfriend give evidence to his unpredictable and sometimes violent nature then a succession of townspeople testifying to his drinking habits and his oddball nature and molet was suddenly struck with an idea perhaps hed be able to save his clients neck after all each christmas dominic spent with his mother he wondered if it would be her last six months to a year the doctors had said already seventeen months had passed clinking glasses over the christmas table was it just seasonal celebration or partly because they knew she was cheating death another year his elder sister janine her husband and two children had come down from paris for the week and for once the house was full janine and guy took the spare room with their daughter celeste while their boy pascal now just nine slept on a mattress in dominics room when his sister got a moment alone with him she enquired about the latest round of hospital tests the message was clear they could only visit once or at most twice a year was mother still going to be around when they visited in the summer dominic didnt know either way there were times when he counted her time left in weeks others when it seemed she might soldier on for months dominics uncle had sent him another package of the latest sounds from the states sugar shack mocking bird and two recent hits from a new producer called phil spector then he kissed me and be my baby edith piaf had died two months previous and his mother not yet satiated by the many commemorative piaf hours on the radio was still playing some of her tracks so dominic ended up playing the records for himself and pascal up in his room innez foxs mocking bird was dominics favourite but pascal preferred phil spector the boy had never heard such a powerful sound system and the strong orchestral background and echoing beat were quite awe inspiring dominic started warming to the records more as he edged up the volume as the music suffused the room and he felt its rhythm washing through him he found himself smiling god knows what the neighbours would have thought if they could hear phil spector upstairs and edith piaf downstairs dominic turned it down a bit seeing young pascals excitement over christmas opening presents getting drunk on wine sneaked from his fathers glass and now bouncing up and down on his bed to phil spector brought home even more to dominic how terrible it must be to lose a child what monique must have suffered must still be going through dominic had seen her only once in the village since the memorial service louis mentioned that shed only started to venture out a month before christmas and then only rarely if she could avoid going out she would but she felt guilty continuing to rely so heavily on the fievets dominic thought she looked better than at the memorial service the dark circles beneath her eyes had mostly gone and a faint glimmer of life was back in her eyes she didnt notice him and he was careful not to look too long her beauty he found somehow intimidating and he didnt want to make her feel awkward village life in bauriac and taragnon had settled back though news from each instruction filtered back via the various witnesses called dominic started to worry about details of machanauds car statement arising again at the instruction in january but it passed without incident the instruction process was due to finish in late april but at the last moment molet introduced a new element which kept it going through may calling character witnesses for machanaud in the same style that perrimond had paraded an assortment against the resultant coup by molet probably the main turning point of the case had dominic smiling as much as poullain had been cursing when he brought news of it back to the gendarmerie molet was giving perrimond a run for his money the instruction process ended in early june and twentytwo days later both perrimond and molet received notification from the palais de justice that the case would be presented to full trial at the cour dassises in aix and the date set th october by then fourteen months would have passed since the attack on christian rosselot what makes you think i can afford that okay ill be generous one half now and the other in two months time just two weeks before the trial starts theyd done the same as before chapeau put a call through to the general limoges office and duclos went out and called him back minutes later it was still francs thought duclos outrageous almost as much as hed paid chapeau in the first place i dont think i can manage more than four even splitting it in two parts and even that would mean taking a small overdraft from his bank chapeau sniggered you know i should ask you for six thousand for being so cheeky ill accept it this time but next time you try and bargain ill put the figure up what do you mean next time if i pay you this now i dont want to hear from you again chapeau sighed his shoulders sagging and just when we were getting on so well you think i phone you just for the money has it never occurred to you that i might like to hear the sound of your voice oh fuck off its true practically no family left except my brother and hes away at sea most of the time apart from killing people every now and then and phoning you theres few pleasures left in my life you think im going to pass up on that chapeau smiled slyly and let the silence ride a second let it sink home that he would be calling regularly duclos didnt respond dont worry im sensible enough to realize that ill have cleared you out for now i know your salary everything about you so i also know when best to phone you wont hear from me for a while how longs that duclos asked cynically six months a year two years i dont know it depends how quickly i think you can save or how well you do but just think when you get that pay rise or promotion i could be the first one calling to congratulate you duclos didnt rise to the bait this time sensed the pure joy chapeau was deriving from his anger lets just settle the business at hand when and where chapeau said that hed make a small concession by driving in duclos direction to montpelier but no further he suggested a roadside bar on the a heading north out of town eau de herault i dont want to do this in a crowded bar duclos protested its okay the few times ive been there its not been that crowded but if you feel uncomfortable they have a large car park in front we can stay there when you see my car come over and get in they arranged to meet the following saturday at pm the three judges filed in the presiding judge in a red robe and the two assessing judges in black robes who took up seats each side of him the pots de fleurs the nine jurors were then chosen by picking names out of a pot of thirtyfive by the presiding judge herve griervaut and his greffier the nine selected took their seats flanking the judges molet had advised machanaud of his right to challenge up to five jurors but cautioned that often it aggravated and unsettled the rest of the jury the defence made no challenges the prosecution made only one perrimond singled out an old man in a crumpled suit and beret looked like a farm worker out for the day thought molet perrimond probably feared he might identify too readily with machanaud a replacement juror was picked out of the pot machanaud was first on the stand he was asked by judge griervaut to first of all provide an account of his activities on the day in question then was questioned by griervaut on specific points this was mainly for clarification rather than angled at areas which might cast suspicion that would come later with perrimond thought molet for now griervaut was merely setting the scene for himself and the jury the only contentious point he raised was machanaud lying in earlier statements confirming if machanaud considered his final statement and later testimony at instruction to be correct hesitant yes perrimond was next he made much of the earlier lies and changes in police statements sewing a strong opening image in the jurys mind of machanaud desperately lying to cover up his dark deeds that day he then focused on machanauds claim of not seeing the boy or seeing or hearing an attack confronting him with the earlier police instruction entry that the boy was not seen at any time in the town centre so must have reached the river by crossing the fields behind molet cringed as perrimond took machanaud through each stage of the gendarmes position at the reconstuction molet tapped his fingers impatiently to each reluctant yes to twenty metres back forty sixty so you saw absolutely nothing mr machanaud perrimond concluded a boy was attacked and killed not yards away and you had a clear view of the only point where he could have crossed the river and yet you saw nothing perrimond kept machanaud on the stand for another thirty minutes ripping apart his earlier statements magnifying the inconsistencies and planting clearly in the jurys mind that not only was machanaud at the scene of the crime but it was stretching credulity that anyone else could have possibly been there machanaud would have seen them perrimond closed with the equipment that machanaud used when fishing apart from your rod and bait you had a bucket with water for the fish and what else some waders if i have to walk into the shallows anything else any other sort of plastic protective clothing oh yes a plastic front apron to go over my shirt or overalls and what is that for if i have to gut any fish it stops the blood getting on my clothing perrimond passed the floor thank you a more complete legal bombardment molet had hardly witnessed machanaud was clearly rattled his few weak protests and arguments laying in tatters but molet wondered why perrimond had finished with details of machanauds fishing equipment surely a stronger image to close on would have been machanaud standing in clear sight of where it was suggested the attack took place monsieur fornier when you realized that the car description given to briant was different to the one mentioned to you were you surprised i dont know i didnt really think about it molet looked down thoughtfully the first hour after recess had been taken up with police testimony dominated by perrimond asking poullain carefully weighted questions to support his earlier arguments molet had gone over the same points with poullain for almost twenty minutes without finding a significant flaw to build on then came to machanauds car statements and the later changes after a gruelling quick fire session poullain finally conceded that it was incorrect of him not to have passed on the changed statement to instruction then added hastily but as the investigating officer it is my duty to enter the information that i trust the most and feel is accurate all early advantages were lost molet had dismissed him shortly after and called dominic fornier after the first few minutes with fornier he had the feeling fornier was more nervous about the car incident might be easier to crack than poullain if he knew anything when machanaud mentioned changing his car statement to you in the bar that evening you apparently showed surprise is that correct yes so that was the first time that you had heard about the change in car description yes it was quite a few surprises and changes that evening it seems molet commented cynically perrimond looked as if he was about to object then changed his mind as the assistant investigating officer would it not be normal for you to be advised of such a change in statement the moment it was made dominics hands sweated profusely on the lectern his chest felt tight constricted no not necessarily so tell me what would the circumstances be under which you might not be informed as perhaps in this case where my commanding officer has already determined the information was false and when did he share this information with you a day or so later perhaps was that the reason for him not entering the change in the file dominic was sure his face looked flushed as the blood rushed to his head he glanced across briefly at machanaud but his mothers image was stronger reaching out to him poullain and him being questioned charged with perjury for their earlier false statements what price for machanauds life he just couldnt lie but in the end as the images receded and he saw molet staring concernedly and about to prompt he did the next best thing and only told half the truth yes it was from what he told me later molet looked down at his file and flicked back a page if he just asked one more question thought dominic was that the only reason he was sure in that moment he would have told him everything told him about duclos and the call from marcel vallon relayed through perrimond the pressure from poullain to cover up the whole sorry mess that would probably ruin his career along with poullains yet might at least save machanauds neck and he realized then that he was almost willing it hoping that molet would look up and ask the question but molet nodded to the bench and resumed his seat while griervaut dismissed fornier molet was still thoughtful there had been a glimmer of recognition in forniers eye almost a look of apology as hed glanced towards machanaud but then just as quickly it was gone what was it that fornier knew the thought preyed on his mind for a while afterwards through the remainder of the police testimony and the start of forensic evidence when perrimond came onto the gap between the two attacks estimated at forty minutes and dubrulle pointed out that this had been determined mostly by the hospital medical examiner not forensics perrimond ended the session abruptly molet noted that perrimonds questioning of dubrulle head of the marseille forensics team was scant but put this down to the fact that griervaut had already covered most of the key points molet took the floor monsieur dubrulle you had the benefit of blood samples for matching supplied by my client i believe is that correct yes we were supplied with samples after he had been detained and did monsieur machanauds blood match any of that found at the crime scene no we found only the victims blood present type b positive that of christian rosselot molet flinched slightly at the mention of the boys name and blood together too vivid an image for the jury items of clothing were also taken from monsieur machanauds house and tested for any fibre matches and blood deposits from the boy is that correct yes were any fibre deposits found that matched that of my clients or any blood deposits on his clothing that matched the boys blood group no we found no such matches but in this case there were no significant is it in fact not the case molet cut in sharply that you found absolutely nothing at the crime scene or after no deposits left by my client or stains on his clothing that could have possibly linked him in any way with the crime no we found nothing dubrulle was more subdued but as molet concluded expecting griervaut to dismiss him perrimond requested a reexamination only the second time he had done so monsieur dubrulle you were about to comment that there were no significant somethings or other when my colleague interrupted i wonder if youd be so kind to now complete your comment well it was just that we found no significant fibres of any type at the scene of the crime any blood or semen deposits or indeed anything at all linking to any individual no we found nothing so the fact that nothing was found linked to monsieur machanaud was not particularly significant no not particularly but in one area of blood stains i understand you did find something significant an area of stains that was weaker and pinker than other areas how do you think this occurred molet tensed sat forward keenly hed known the information would come up at some point he should have caught on when perrimond didnt cover it earlier with dubrulle perrimonds earlier tactic of grandstanding the fishing apron suddenly made sense and now again hed carefully engineered everything to make it a closing point it looked as if someone had washed down with water perhaps from the murder implement or their body washed away the boys blood it was the same group as the boys but had been mixed with water now if somebody in normal apparel perrimond ran one hand down inside his suit lapel say standard cotton shirt and trousers had tried to swill off bloodstains in this fashion would the blood have washed off successfully or left stains very little of it would have washed off most of it would have soaked into the clothing but if this person was wearing some sort of protective waterproof clothing say a plastic apron or bib of some type would it have washed off in this fashion then yes probably and such a bib would also have protected their clothing from stains i presume yes obviously thank you perrimond sat down and griervaut dismissed dubrulle from the stand molets spirits sank scanning the jury the impact of the point had gone home strongly testimony from attending medics and doctors was next looking at his watch molet realized that part of it was probably going to spill over to the next morning little arose as the days events drew to a close to raise his spirits again now that perrimond had stolen his thunder over forensics there were precious few ace cards left to play any chance of clearing machanaud had probably now gone all that remained was the testimony of an ageing resistance fighter an army doctor and his own closing arguments to be able to save his clients life and how long were you practising at the military hospital in aubagne doctor lanquetin over twenty years though im retired now just four years ago during that time what did you specialize in in treatment of cranial injuries i was a practising surgeon who dealt almost exclusively with head injuries incurred by soldiers or legionnaires in active service i see molet looked down thoughtfully it was an idea hed struck on late in the instruction process seeing the procession of character witnesses from perrimond testifying to machanauds strange and oddball character one of them had commented i believe he even has a metal plate in his head from a sabotage operation that went wrong while in the resistance machanaud had originally fought the idea felt that playing on his old injuries was merely supporting the oppositions case that he was mad and had done something strange that afternoon molet admitted then that he thought his chances of clearing machanaud were remote and this was probably their only hope of getting a lesser manslaughter charge introduced reluctantly machanaud had given him the name of the hospital where he was treated his old doctor had since died but molet managed to find a retired army doctor lanquetin who was an expert in head injuries hed introduced him along with an old resistance colleague at a later instruction and argued strongly that a lesser charge of manslaughter should be introduced half of the prosecution case rests on the fact that machanaud is slightly odd yet he has never done anything like this before and in months of talking with my client if indeed he has done this he clearly has no memory of it this is an old resistance fighter one with a metal plate holding his head together and we are going to argue on one hand that he is odd and slightly mad yet on the other claim that he knew exactly what he was doing and condemn him to be hanged ridiculous i move for a lesser charge of manslaughter to be introduced on the grounds of diminished responsibility and will produce the medical evidence to strongly support it predictably perrimond opposed the suggestion naugier accepted it reluctantly but only as an alternative charge the manslaughter charge would ride alongside that of premeditated murder it would be up to the jury to decide of which they thought machanaud was guilty so your knowledge in the area of cranial injuries is quite extensive yes and during this period have you had experience with metal plates and their effects on patients yes i have quite a bit molet merely looked at him expectantly lanquetin continued the effects can vary but the plate is no more than a drastic emergency solution to hold together two parts of the cranium that could possibly shift as such they may be affected by cold or hot weather or even sudden movement electrical and chemical imbalances can be sparked off what would be the affect of such imbalances it varies enormously it could be nothing more than a mild headache slightly irritable behaviour or anxiety or at the other extreme quite irrational even violent behaviour so it is quite conceivable doctor lanquetin that someone with a metal plate given the right conditions could suffer a temporary memory loss have absolutely no recall whatsoever yes it is molet produced the xrays lanquetin had viewed earlier and lanquetin confirmed that it was quite an extensive implant and that indeed given its proximity to the parietal lobe which controlled both some motor and behavioural functions given the right conditions there could be adverse affects thank you doctor lanquetin perrimond spent very little time crossexamining lanquetin his main thrust was an attempt to discredit lanquetins grasp of modern medicine due to the fact that he had now retired but the ploy partly backfired when lanquetin reminded him that metal plate implants were not particularly akin to modern surgery and indeed the practice was fast dying out the conclusion of medical testimony and the various incidental and character witnesses had taken up most of the morning only one witness was left to call machanauds old colleague from the resistance vincent arnaud molet realized that the closing arguments would probably now have to follow after lunch there wouldnt be time before arnauds testimony transported them back to another age he and machanaud were both in their late twenties colleagues in the resistance fighting the germans near tours a ragtag bunch with limited resources doing the best they could arnaud described the dynamite set one day so that they could stop and ambush an ammunition truck but the dynamite was damp it went off late and the truck veered off the road striking machanaud and was it this that caused your colleague gaston machanaud to be hospitalized and have a metal plate inserted yes it was it was days before we even knew whether hed live or not whatever was decided later thought molet with arnaud on the stand it was once again machanauds finest hour machanauds eyes welled with emotion old colleagues old memories and confirmation at last for all his doubters and detractors that his day of glory the story he had spun over so many bar counters had not just been drunken ramblings perhaps now everyone would believe him the first fifteen minutes of perrimonds closing arguments were predictable how machanaud was the only person present his extensive lying when first questioned the reconstruction which had proved conclusively that he was within sight of not only where the boy crossed the river but also where the first attack had taken place and the forensic evidence which had demonstrated that blood had been swilled away with water who else but machanaud would have been equipped with not only waders and a plastic apron but also a bucket of water for such an exercise perrimond swung around dramatically surveying each juror in turn make no mistake this was a very measured and deliberate act machanaud knew that if the boy was found on the lane and it looked like the assault took place there then if by chance it was discovered he was down by the river that day he could claim that it was somebody else that committed this atrocity perrimond looked down thoughtfully giving the jury due time for consideration and lo and behold when he is confronted with being by the river that day this is exactly what he claims perrimond then started to preempt the arguments molet might propose you will probably hear from the defence that his client was just some poor misfortunate who happened to be in the same place on that dark day that the first attack might have even taken place elsewhere and the child was transported to the lane for the second attack but how perrimond scanned the jury each car that passed up and down the lane while machanaud was there was accounted for one was in a restaurant for over an hour just beforehand with his car in full sight in the car park a friend visiting spent all his time speaking with marius caurin and caurin himself when leaving was seen at various places in town perrimond looked imperiously at the bench this was taragnon a small rural village and it was lunch time the streets were busy the police spent painstaking weeks and months questioning and with only one conclusion christian rosselot did not pass through the town nor did he pass through from the farm behind it was too far out of his way and besides marius caurin would have seen him so desparate are the defence that they would have you believe anything anything but the facts perrimond shrugged and smiled caustically then quickly became grave again no the boy crossed at only one point the small bridge down river fully in sight of where the accused was fishing it was there that their fatal meeting took place and it was also there that the accused relentlessly assaulted the boy and left him for dead a cold merciless act perpetrated by only one person who sits before you now the accused gaston machanaud perrimond finished by asking for the harshest possible sentence that it was ridiculous to consider anything but a guilty verdict on premeditated murder anything less would not be doing service to themselves justice or to the memory of the young boy who can now only beg for justice silently from the grave and trust that in your hearts and souls you will make the right judgement perrimond closed his eyes briefly and nodded as he sat down as if concluding a prayer and left the floor to molet no blood no fibres no semen not a single thing that links my client to the crime scene itself i just want you to remember that when you sentence him to be hanged molet surveyed the jury audibly drawing breath except the fact that he was there there at the time fishing poaching as he had been so many times in the past and yes the prosecution is right i am going to suggest that someone else came along and committed this crime because that is exactly what happened molet paced to one side a thorough police investigation that discounted all other possibilities this is the same investigative team that could not even enter a change in car description accurately from one day to the next that when confronted started clinging to the excuse that my client was drunk to hide their error a vital change not even entered at instruction that the examining magistrate openly admonished them over yet we are supposed to believe that they conducted a thorough investigation one that eliminated all other possibilities when they could not even pass a bit of vital evidence from one stage to the next when it was laid on a plate before them i think the police merely latched onto the first obvious target my client and have been constructing a case out of thin air ever since one built on a single circumstance that he was there and not a single fact or piece of concrete evidence to support this circumstance what are we all doing here how could we all have been dragged this far on such a pitiful illusion a harmless poacher and local drunkard who one day suddenly decides to molest and kill a young boy no history of molesting young boys no sexual predilections in that area whatsoever yet we are supposed to believe that this day this one day all reason and normal instincts were suddenly thrown to the wind unbelievable how did the prosecution even raise the audacity to try and get us to swallow such a ridiculous story so let us think afresh what are we left with let us strip away all the ridiculous coincidences slotted into place by the police and the prosecution and see what we are left with a simple man with a long history of poaching and no history whatsoever of harming young boys we ask him what he was doing that day what do you think is the most likely explanation that as he claims he was poaching or the more ludicrous suggestion that then starts to stretch all precepts of credible thinking that he suddenly broke with past form and harmed this young boy because that exactly that is what is being suggested today molet waved one arm dramatically even what the prosecution are asking for here today and the evidence they are providing in support are at odds on one hand they want you to believe that this was a cold blooded premeditated murder on the other they would have you believe from the various witnesses they have produced that the accused is mad half the time and drunk the rest a complete oddball and misfit a village idiot who can hardly premeditate his life from one day to the next let alone plan a murder like this so meticulously in fact that the police and a whole team of forensics could not find a single trace of evidence molet slowly shook his head the two just dont go together the only honesty you have seen here today was just before lunch gaston machanauds old resistance colleague and the army doctor that is the real gaston machanaud the resistance fighter who fought bravely for his country suffered an horrific injury that still plagues him as a consequence and is now just left with a few fond tales to tell in the local bars this is the man that the prosecution wants you to hang pathetic molet drew a long and tired breath yet i had to fight with my client to bring them here today and to the earlier instruction even though it was the only way to bring some honesty to this whole charade introduce the charge that if anything at all my client should be facing manslaughter manslaughter due to diminished responsibility it is outrageous that any other charge should have even been discussed today molet looked down reluctant dismay but in doing so i have partly turned my back on what i believe that my client is innocent that only one thing is true about the prosecutions claim he was there nothing more no blood no semen no fibres no scheming individual who could successfully hide those elements and no reasonable explanation from the prosecution of what he was doing there that afternoon except the one he gave himself that he was there fishing as he had been so many afternoons before molet nodded in turn to the jury and the three judges and sat down the jury returned after almost two hours between the nine jurors and three judges the votes counted painstakingly by the greffier and then passed to griervaut to announce were to not guilty of premeditated murder to guilty of manslaughter molet felt a twinge of disappointment at no aquittal followed quickly by relief it could have been worse much worse but machanaud looked destroyed molet knew from the earlier instruction when he fought with machanaud over getting the lesser charge introduced that machanaud would probably never understand or accept understandable for someone who was probably innocent despite his strong closing arguments molet knew how strongly the jury had been swayed by much of the prosecutions presentation and witnesses and that without the midground of the lesser charge they would probably have found machanaud guilty of premeditated murder because the charge for manslaughter partly hinged on diminished responsibility judge griervaut raised the subject of medical and psychiatric assessment molet argued for private assessment while perrimond predictably argued for state assessment after consultation with his two assessing judges griervaut cleared his throat summarily and looked up to pass final sentence that machanaud be detained in prison for no less than six years and that he be treated and assessed twice each year by a state psychiatrist at the end of that period if not deemed to be mentally fit he should be released to the care of a state psychiatric hospital where he would undergo suitable treatment until fit for release at the outside machanaud would do the full six with maybe another year in an institution molet considered if things went well he could get parole in four years and be cleared to leave immediately what molet hadnt noticed was the look that passed between perrimond and one of the assessing judges when they were deliberating on the issue of state or private psychiatric assessment all that struck him as odd was perrimonds slight smile when the final judgement was passed down a strange reaction to what surely must have been considered mostly a defeat by perrimond twentyone marinella calvan was still adjusting after the long flight and the wine had made her feel sleepy she held one hand up to indicate half a glass more was enough as david lambourne poured where did you find philippe she asked london school of economics just down the road hes not an official translator just a french student on a social sciences course but his english is almost word perfect and hes all i could find at such short notice with a south of france background how old is he twentyfour hes from a small village in the alpesmaritimes peyroules theyd spent just over an hour in lambournes office going over the case before retiring to a small bistro close by theyd already agreed the only french spoken would be between the patient and the translator one voice with questions marinella would tap them out to appear on a computer screen philippe would then pose the questions and tap out the answers in english on the same screen the session for them would be a series of onscreen questions and answers in english it was the only way to avoid distraction and confusion will his knowledge of patois from the fifties and sixties for that region be good enough it hasnt changed that much according to him especially in the inland villages marinella nodded and sipped her wine earlier theyd discussed what lambourne had discovered through the capels eyrans grades for french were average there had been one or two holidays to france but no school exchanges or long stays eyrans french was at la plume de ma tante stage shed already gained the main background of the capels and now filled the gaps some details such as how long theyd been married lambourne didnt know the only thing to cause a chink of concern was lambournes flippant remark that the area where they lived east grinstead was home to more fringe religious groups than any other part of the country when pressed lambourne assured her that they were normal lapsed church of england still she asked the obvious do you think they could have staged all this she knew that it was one of the first questions shed be asked by sceptics advertising executive vivid imagination from an area noted for fringe religions in no time the media would have them taped as weirdoes from some obscure cult which not only believed in reincarnation but that we all live concurrent lives in different dimensions no i dont think so if anything they were reluctant to enter eyran into the sessions certainly stuart capel at least he admitted that he should have taken torrens advice earlier and entered eyran into counselling almost straightaway he delayed hoping that eyran might improve in his own time torrens the name struck a faint chord but marinella couldnt recall from where the doctor from california who operated on eyran and treated him during his coma he made an initial report recommending eyran should have psychiatric counselling not only due to the loss of his parents but assessment of impairment after the coma the boy was under almost three weeks have you got a copy of torrens report yes good good that will help enormously couldnt be better counselling initially recommended by a stateside doctor us or the boy marinella calmed her enthusiasm and bit her lip lightly at lambournes frown im sorry that probably sounded a bit callous their aims were at odds she realized his was to cure the boy hers was to prove an authentic regression only where the regression might help the main subject did they coincide but grandstanding her own aims above his had been insensitive she smiled you know donaldson always warned me about playing to the gallery that each time it would land me in trouble but its unbelievable what we have to put up with when we get things wrong she went on to explain how their critics many of them from within the profession sat on the sideline like vultures waiting for them to footfault one bad case one falsehood we fail to uncover before them and our credibility can be set back years suddenly everything were doing is false questions at each corner the threat of departmental budget cuts why didnt you find that out before is your next case going to be like the so and so fiasco its no wonder we become paranoid lose sight of other objectives im sorry lambourne nodded hed put her at ease earlier about their respective objectives by assuring that he couldnt continue with conventional therapy until a regression uncovered more about jojo but there was still a gap to her this was just another research paper to him it was an extension of plt eyrans current problems and obsessions partly stemming from his past as jojo but there was no point in underlining that gap spoiling the mood of their association before it had started if we can each get only thirty percent of what we initially hoped for out of this then well at least be doing better than my normal sessions cheers they spent a while talking about the structure of the next days session then the conversation became more general the mood lighter anything notable come up since we last met he asked you mean like the conquistador boy lambourne looked down toying with his dessert he knew how frustrating the case had been for her but why the reference now was it a warning shot dont cut me short on this one put me through that again i was hoping you might have had something more fruitful not really lot of conventional regressions but only two with xenoglossy both adults but use of language wasnt exceptional in both cases it could be argued that the subjects would have been able to learn the language used especially at that level of proficiency beneath lambournes look of concern she noticed a half smile a smile that said perhaps tomorrow will change your run of luck he was obviously more hopeful than hed made out the early signs looked promising she conceded but her long years of battling with sceptics had made her fear the worst even if the first stages of authentication were satisfied would the capels agree to continuing sessions and for how long would lambourne remain convinced that their aims coincided session its dark and warm inside outside i can hear the wind through the trees and the birds or sometimes my father working in the fields nearby the session had been under way forty minutes and already marinella calvan was exhausted the start had been slow the rhythm staccato heightened by the gap waiting for philippe to type the translated answers on screen and then pose marinellas typed questions in response the only words spoken in the room were in french while the onscreen version in english would provide a useful typescript theyd decided to run a tape as well nuances or possible language misinterpretations could be gone back over later david lambourne was at her side parts had been rambling the boy spending a long time describing a visit to the beach at le lavandou the seagulls overhead making a sandcastle with a rivulet for the sea to wash in and form a moat shed been eager to move on but lambourne put a calming hand on her shoulder felt it might be better to introduce a more relaxing tone and mood minutes before when theyd asked him about being separated from his parents his breathing had become rapid and hesitant hed mumbled something about a bright light not being able to see then laying flat in a wheat field his face against the sheaves but by that time his breathing had become too fractured words little more than spluttered monosyllables in the gaps she quickly prompted philippe to interrupt whatever had separated him from his parents had obviously been deeply disturbing theyd return later she guided him towards fonder more relaxed memories recall of the day at the beach had been one and now describing his favourite hideaway camp in the field at the back of the family farmhouse another in between the rambling in the moments marinella had been able to impose some structure to the session shed been able to find out the names of both his mother and father and how far the farm was from the local village taragnon jojo had been a nickname two or three corrections passed back and forth with philippe before they had it right jijo gigot then finally gigio after one of his favourite puppet characters asking gigio what he heard on the radio at home theyd also identified the period early s sometimes i jump up from my hiding place and surprise my father does your father spend a lot of time in the fields yes and in the garage at the side of the house all his tools are in there is it a big farm yes at least forty hectares just over eight acres thought marinella small holding but to a young boy it was probably large and from your hideaway can you see the house what does it look like the field slopes down and theres a courtyard before the kitchen door sometimes when its getting dark i can see my mother working in the kitchen and i know then that its time to come in i know if my father is in the garage because he always has the light on there are no windows do you have any other favourite places in the house you like to hide what about your bedroom do you like your bedroom yes but i prefer my hideaway my sister always comes into my bedroom and plays with my toys she broke one of my toys once it was a favourite car marinella watched patiently as the tale unfolded on screen gigio describing how upset he was how the car had been for his birthday just a few weeks before hed shouted and she started crying his mother took his sisters side and made him even more upset she was about to interrupt with another question felt that gigio was starting to ramble again when he suddenly became more thoughtful i shouldnt have become so angry with her made her cry i loved her really i always helped her if i could i missed her so much later as i did my parents marinellas skin bristled often with regressions accurate detail could only be gained by taking the person back to a specific time and place a room a fond memory an event that stuck out in their mind but at others they would jump time frames and generalize periods and feelings did you become separated from your sister as well and was it at the same time as your parents yes either gigio had lost his entire family or he had become separated from them she asked eyrans head lolled his breathing suddenly more erratic as his eyelids pulsed struggling with the images it was me i became lost from them i remember thinking how worried they would be and my father my father why didnt he come and try to find me there was a bright light so bright i couldnt see anything and the field i recognized it i thought i might see my father there looking for me any minute when when i i eyrans head started shaking beads of sweat on his brow the words subsiding into guttural gasps on fragments of breath lambourne put one hand on marinellas shoulder but she misread the signal tapped out did you blame your father for not finding you think that it was partly his fault eyran swallowed fighting to control his erratic breathing yes partly but it was more me i blamed myself i kept thinking how they couldnt face that id become lost from them that id somehow let them down their sorrow my mothers face so sad so so sad her eyes full of tears crying no it couldnt be real it couldnt have happened no couldnt not real no no eyrans head started rocking wilder this time his eyes scrunched tight his laboured breathing rasped in his throat lambourne reached over frantically to the keyboard tapped out stop it stop it now move gigio on from the incident marinella looked up quizzically theyd arranged a code whereby any message between them should be typed in brackets so that philippe knew not to translate shed pushed for lambournes benefit would have been happy just to ask limp questions about gigios background and let him ramble at will build up her research paper but lambournes objective was to find and exorcize the link of shared loss between eyran and gigio it seemed crazy to give up now just when they might be on the brink she was about to tap out were so close to proving the link just a few more questions when reading the intensity of lambournes expression she thought better of it she typed when you were in your hideaway by the old house how old were you return gigio to a calmer happier period they waited over twenty seconds for eyran to make the leap for his breathing to settle back and answer i was ten years old then marinella knew that gigio was nine at the time of his day out at le lavandou his sister four do you recall any memories from when you were older eleven or twelve marinella was aware of lambournes slight intake of breath and him staring intently at her as she waited for an answer if she could have spoken she would have explained that general overviews usually posed no danger didnt get subjects wrapped up as intently as specific recall of incidents no after the light and the field there was nothing i uh eyrans head tilted as if he was grappling for images just out of reach everything grey grey behind my eyes then another light things distant too far cant hear cant some mumbling words and thoughts trailing off lambournes nerves tensed this was the second time that field had been mentioned on impulse he reached forward and tapped out was it a wheat field short pause as philippe translated and the answer came yes yes it was marinella sensed that it was significant by lambournes sudden urgency but he just gave her a wideeyed shrug an its interesting but ill tell you later look now that she knew lambourne wouldnt expect her to push more on the shared loss link between the two boys she relaxed and returned to general information filled in gaps from what theyd learned so far how often gigio went to the local village his full name his school the name of the street by their farm and friends and neighbours at only one point did gigio start rambling again describing stopping off from school at the local boulangerie and how the woman there madame arnand when her husband wasnt in the shop would often give him some free pan chocolat they were stale from one or two days before and would soon be thrown out but her husband was too mean to give them away she confided one day it became their little secret the husband probably puzzled why this young boy came in his shop so often and browsed without buying anything and the wife winking at gigio as soon as her husbands back was turned marinella let gigio ramble it was providing some useful extra details to check and for the first time during the session eyran had actually smiled she could feel a stronger bond and trust developing with the lighter mood if she built on that rapport by the next session they might have more success breaking through the barriers gigio had erected and could start tackling the core grief that linked the two boys marinella was aware of david lambourne checking his watch and nodding at her she checked the time an hour and twelve minutes more than enough for a first session she gradually wound things down let gigio finish his description of discovering an old car tyre one day on his way home from school with a friend and how they rolled it back to the farm then brought eyran back out of hypnosis while lambourne escorted eyran out and she heard him talking with the capels in the waiting area she scrolled back on the computer screen apart from lambournes stop it command the only other item in brackets was where shed asked philippe if the regional french was accurate she asked him now to elaborate on the basic yes on screen was it accurate for the time period as well as the region yes pretty much as i said to david it hasnt really changed through the years only on the coast has it been corrupted because of the massive influx of visitors and residents from other parts thirty miles inland its a different world is it the sort of patois that would be easy for someone to copy or effect philippe shrugged not that easy perhaps someone from paris or dijon could attempt a reasonable mimicry but they would still be caught out on some words but somebody english already struggling with french as a second language i dont think so marinella clicked the print command the printer was on the second sheet as lambourne came back in marinella asked him about the wheat field i remember you mentioning a wheat field from one of eyrans earlier dreams is that why you thought it might be significant yes that and eyran mentioning that when he first moved to the old house in england the wheat field at the back seemed somehow familiar well at least the main prognosis seems to have been supported marinella commented earlier she speculated that if a real regression was proved probably some memory of loss or grief in the past life had been sparked off by the accident and eyrans loss in the same way that many plt uncovered phobias lay dormant until awoken by a similar incident i think well find that if there was much memory or link between the two before the accident that it was mostly subliminal little more than fragments of deja vu possibly but we wont know for sure until weve gone back in more detail through the transcript and compared with the transcripts from previous sessions marinella noticed lambourne glance towards philippe and picked up on the signal either he didnt want to talk openly in front of philippe or he wanted more time to consider his prognosis she too would probably benefit from a few hours to collate her thoughts of course were jumping the gun a bit the first thing we need to know is if the regression and its main character are real if not then we can focus again on the original theory of a secondary character invented by eyran she turned to philippe how would you like to earn some extra money philippe smiled slyly the last time an older attractive woman asked me that i got into trouble marinella explained her problem they had various names and details from the session all of which would have to be checked this would involve a number of calls to town hall registrars and clerks in france and her french was practically nonexistent marinella circled the names on the transcript the rosselots the boy christian and his parents monique and jeanluc sister named clarisse from taragnon early nineteensixties shouldnt be too hard to find if they exist the boy had probably died when he was only ten years old everything should therefore start with registration of the death certificate she explained then perhaps they could begin piecing together the details of his life see if those pieces match his descriptions twentytwo jeanluc rosselot sat on the small stone wall and looked down the slope of the field towards the courtyard and the house it was summer again eight months after the trial the scent of the fields reminded him of the day hed found christians bike of days theyd spent together working on the farm of the bleak wheat field with the gendarmes placed like markers christians small makeshift camp the far side of the wall hed dismantled just a few months before the winter winds had made it look dishevelled no longer a pleasant reminder of the days when christian used it the images too were fading many times before hed sat on the wall and looked down imagined christian running up towards him waving calling his name now when he summoned up the image he could see a figure running but it was indistinct it could have been any boy the features were faded hazy little more than a cezanne impression he wondered whether it was because his eyes were watering with the pain of the memory blurring his vision then would suddenly realize his eyes had slowly closed the images were playing only in his mind the only images that remained clearly too clearly were those hed fought to blot out the young gendarme in the courtyard with monique collapsed at his feet the photos of when christian was found which he and monique had to view at instruction part of the process of official identification before the almost ludicrous question is it your wish that charges are proceeded with the two days in court his outrage as the defence tactics became clear and then the judges final sentence six years six years for the life of his son not even a semblance of justice diminished responsibility metal plates army doctors and old resistance fighter the whole thing had been a pathetic sham all that hed clung to all along had been justice everything else had already been stripped away pride hope some reason to explain the ridiculous the unacceptable that hed lost christian was that what hed hoped for that day in court some explanation of why it had happened to lay the ghosts to rest in the end reason had been as lacking as justice what were they saying in the end that the man had murdered his son but it was partly excusable because he had a metal plate due to being hit by a nazi truck twenty years ago jeanluc shook his head he felt tired very tired the land the fight to make the farm work had been sapping him dry the last few years christians death and the ensuing investigation and court case had taken whatever strength and resolve remained he felt increasingly awkward in moniques and clarisses company could hardly look them in the eye knew that they might see what lay beneath that he just couldnt love them the way he loved christian and ashamed that hed let them down failed them the last two letters from the bank hed stuffed in a drawer without opening them he knew already what they would say he rose slowly clearing the welled tears from his eyes as he started down the field towards the courtyard if he saw christian now saw a clear image again waving and calling to him perhaps that would stop him make him think again but there was nothing only the empty field empty and dry under the summer sun unyielding nothing left to cling to any more not even the memory as he got closer to the house he saw a faint flicker behind the kitchen window monique was busy in the kitchen but she hadnt noticed him and didnt look up as he crossed the courtyard to the garage th december monique rosselot tried to make out shapes in the room everything was misty as if looking through a sheet of muslin the figures moving around were indistinct blurred except the nurse when she leaned close asking her again if she could feel anything below her waist yes yes she answered between fractured breaths now slightly indignant at the nurses doubting tone feel was such a lame word for the terrible pain that gripped her starting deep in her stomach and spreading like a firestorm through her thighs and lower back shed never before experienced such intense pain didnt know it was possible for any human to endure such agony i dont think the epidural has taken she heard a mans voice we might have to give her another shot i dont think we can at this stage came another and then the nurse leaning over again can you feel your body relaxing now yes yes but can you still feel the pain from lower down monique exhaled the yes between clenched teeth her breathing now little more than short bursts as she tensed against the pain doctor jouanard contemplated the dilemma the patient had been given the epidural almost thirty minutes ago after twenty minutes when it became obvious it hadnt taken because of the patients continuing pain the baby was by then engaged in the birth canal it would be almost impossible for the patient to bend forward to get the right curvature in the spine for a fresh epidural and the risks of trying to administer it without full curvature were too high a half centimetre off target and the patient could be paralyzed in the end hed ordered a mild general anaesthetic something to calm and relax nerves but leave the patient awake so that there was some response muscle control to push with at least that had now taken but the continuing pain and the fact that the baby didnt seem to have progressed any further in the birth canal despite concentrated pushes from the patient began to worry jouanard hed read the patients history thoroughly two previous natural births without complications her pelvic girth was obviously sufficiently large why the problems now with one hand on the abdomen he could feel the baby lodged deep in the birth canal with the other he spread back the vulva to get a clearer view he thought he saw what looked like the babys head and something else though he couldnt immediately make out what there was also too much blood he began to worry that something might have ruptured internally he felt inside trying to identify by touch what he thought was the head he worked his hand around moulding to the shape of the smooth damp flesh it was a shoulder straight ahead that hed seen further down he could feel the thorax and arm and the head the head was pushed sharply to one side and something in between jouanard ran his hand around once more to make sure he looked up sharply dr floirat administer the patient immediately with full anaesthetic for surgery floirat started issuing instructions ecg monitor and oscillatometer to be wheeled forward doses for the thiopentone jouarnard stepped back supervising the laying out of instruments with his assistant the blood loss worried him three or four minutes to set up the monitors another minute for the thiopentone to take effect how much more would she have lost by then he directed a nurse to keep swabbing the flow he noticed the patients eyes darting taking in the renewed activity its okay its okay he soothed the epidural hasnt taken fully were giving you a general anaesthetic it will all be over soon just relax stock phrases inside he was panicking breach birth with part of the umbilical cord wrapped around the babys neck pushing against the obstruction had obviously caused an internal rupture and the baby might already be strangled if the placenta had ruptured the baby would soon be dead if it was still alive if it was the uterus or womb he could lose the patient as well and he wouldnt even know where the rupture was until he opened up the nurses were making the last connections on the monitors floirat stepped forward and administered the thiopentone jouanard looked at his watch almost counting down the seconds the blood loss was heavy fresh swabs were being dumped in the dish every ten or fifteen seconds the patient was still alert responding to the nurse who was talking to check when she was fully under as the questions became totally mundane monique began to panic bringing her anxiety at the renewed activity and the doctors sudden urgent orders to a peak she asked the nurse whats happening only to receive a trite smile in response nothing dont worry just relax which only made her panic all the more she reached one hand up id like to see my husband please id like him here by me to help me yes dont worry well get him the same practised smile from the nurse knowing that the patient would be fully under any second waves of euphoria started to descend and suddenly the nurse was right there was nothing to worry about her body felt as if it was floating drifting away on the echoes and voices around her you see my husband will know just what to do she offered pathetically her last words before drifting completely into the darkness in the first moments of darkness she saw christians face he was running through a field waving and smiling to her but it wasnt the field by their house it was one she didnt recognize a wheat field the sheaves blowing gently in the wind and she thought yes it would be nice if it was a boy another christian shed take care of him this time love him keep him close to her side and never let him be harmed oh god please please just one more chance floirat checked the patients pupils for responsiveness with a penlight and nodded after a second jouanard made the first incision hed already resigned himself to the fact that hed probably lost the baby the challenge remaining was to save his patients life th april dominic fornier swung the black citreon through the narrow panier lanes beeping his horn to move some people aside as he negotiated a tight turn as he picked up speed the wind rush reverberated from the buildings close each side ahead he could now see the crowd most of them were congregated on the far side he parked behind two black citreons already there he recognized lasnel from forensics and detective inspector bennacer busy taking notes among the crowd the far side lasnel looked up from examining the body grabbed his attention first inspecteur fornier just in time another few minutes and the meat wagon might have taken him away dominic knelt beside lasnel been here long four or five minutes quite straightforward though looks as if the first blow was made here a straight lunge quite deep almost reaching the trachea then the blade was run across severing the jugular so we know at least it was a knife rather than a razor thatll narrow it down dominic smiled and patted lasnels shoulder the mans body lay face down the blood from his neck wound spreading out and now a dark maroon almost brown hed been dead now almost an hour dominic straightened up and lasnel too shifted to one side for a moment as a detective moved in and took some photos using flash though it was afternoon and bright sunshine the buildings each side heavily shaded the narrow lane dominic went over to bennacer any witnesses bennacer shook his head and pointed to a middle aged woman quite dark probably moroccan or algerian she was the first to find him two other men came up quickly afterwards one of them went to the nearest phone to make the initial emergency call the others here bennacer pointed to an old man not far behind the woman but nobody actually saw the attack dominic clarified with bennacer that the other man in his twenties hadnt appeared again but probably wasnt significant the victims wallet was missing there was no available identification but bennacer knew him a local club owner called emile vacheret the attack had been made to look like a robbery but bennacer doubted it it was probably a milieu hit dominic nodded now that bennacer had mentioned the name dominic remembered the file their main informant on milieu activities forterre had reported moves to set up stronger drug distribution networks using marseille clubs vacharet was one of the club owners in the file vacheret had for years used his clubs as fronts for packets of marijuana but there was pressure for him to start handling heroine as well emile vacheret was against the idea but his son francois now in his early thirties was known to be in favour so it looks as if they didnt want to wait the fifteen years for the old man to retire dominic commented sourly do you think his son might have actually been involved in the hit no i dont think so he might have disagreed with his father but he wouldnt have gone that far with emile out of the way theyd get what they wanted anyway with francois so no need to implicate him it also serves as a warning what better way to make sure the son tows the line the inner politics of the milieu thought dominic essential knowledge for much of his past nine years in marseille as the drugs market had burgeoned with marseille one of the main distillation and shipment centres for europe the incidence of reglas de compte settling of accounts had increased as with so many other similar cases there would be no murder weapon found no fingerprints no witnesses just the usual list of suspects bounced between departmental files and computers are any of his clubs near here the nearest is at least three blocks away nothing in the immediate streets dominic scanned the street beyond the small crowd eleven days eleven days before he cleared his desk in marseille and started his two year posting with interpol in paris the case wouldnt have progressed much in that time would no doubt end up with his chief inspector isnard where it would fester in one of his two usual piles unsolved cases and internal admin overload if he wanted some movement on the case some strong leg work while he was gone his best chance lay with bennacer dominic flicked back through his notepad too many loose ends to tie up in just eleven days cases in progress reminders before he left now he was adding more any work breaks had been filled with organizing packing and moving and rent contracts for their house in aubagne and their new house in corbeil twenty miles south of paris no doubt there would be a goodbye drink with his department and if there was time a last meal at pierre tetre in cannes with his wife and son theyd dined there the night he proposed to her then again six years back when he received his final exam results and his move from the marseille gendarmerie to the national police became official the two years at interpol was voluntary and his current ranking would remain the same but it would broaden his work experience and help his progress to chief inspector two or three years after he returned at most without clinking glasses first at pierre tetre the move to paris would seem somehow incomplete dominic looked up the ambulance was approaching forcing the crowds close to the walls each side in the narrow lane he wrote on a scrap of paper and handed it to bennacer im not sure how much ill be able to do on this before i leave but dont just let the case rot on isnards desk do the leg work yourself and work your milieu contact as best you can this will be my number in paris call me directly if anything comes up as dominic closed his notepad he saw the word machanaud written on the second to last page a year after gaining his inspectorate with the national police hed been driving through taragnon and was reminded of the case machanaud should have been released two years before might have even been paroled earlier he tried to contact molet through the palais de justice and his old law firm only to discover that he had moved practice to nice four phone calls later he gave up on tracking down a phone number he decided to try finding out what had happened to machanaud through perrimonds office after three calls to perrimonds secretary and none of them returned within a week a snowstorm of work had pushed it into the background and it was forgotten it sprang to mind again a year ago when he saw a press cutting about alain duclos hed seen nothing about duclos in the ten years since the murder it was a small sidebar talking about the new candidate for the rpr in limoges alain duclos and mentioned his position as chief prosecutor the past five years and some notable successes against companies for labour contract infringements mostly sweat shop use of illegal immigrants with duclos quoted that it not only imprisoned the immigrant in a cycle of modern day slavery but also robbed the french people of their workright champion of the people dominic thought cynically duclos and politics were obviously made for each other hed made a mental note then to try perrimond again but had forgotten about it then just the week before hed made the entry in his notepad along with the other loose ends of his life he wanted to deal with before leaving no doubt he was worrying for nothing machanaud had probably been paroled after four years and spent at most another year in an institution receiving therapy he would try perrimond again as soon as he got back to his office th february rain pattered against the side window of the car duclos looked anxiously at his watch chapeau was already five minutes late perhaps he was having trouble finding the new meeting place the idea had been forming slowly the past year though subconsciously it had probably been there far longer almost three years ago an old uncle of his had died and together with his cousin theyd handled the house clearance duclos knew a local antiques dealer but theyd decided to go through the house first to identify the curios be sure of their ground for when the dealer arrived in an old attic trunk together with a uniform brocade and medals duclos found an old service revolver an sacm mm his uncle had been an army officer during the vichy government regime but it wasnt the sort of thing the family would make public nor did vichy period army memorabilia have strong resale value the trunks contents would probably not be passed to the dealer and he doubted that his uncle had even made them known to his family yet the gun looked in surprisingly good condition had obviously been regularly oiled and cleaned was now tucked away neatly with a box of ammunition at its side duclos looked up and listened for a second his cousin was still busy downstairs before pocketing the gun and the shells the thought didnt hit him in that moment what he might want it for but in retrospect he recalled his eagerness to pocket the gun his worry that his cousin might come up and prevent him being able to take it perhaps the intent and purpose had been there subliminally all along but it wasnt until almost eighteen months later with the next demand from chapeau that the significance of the gun really struck him the demands came almost every year had worn him down bit by bit each step up the ladder each pay rise or increase in stature and chapeau would phone congratulations hed come almost to resent his own success felt physically sick with each press flashbulb and item printed knowing that chapeau would read the clipping and the phone would ring he began even to question his own motives for striving for such heights of ambition that secretly he wanted chapeau to call that only the continuing punishment might somehow rid him of the nightmares that still haunted him periodically waking up in a cold sweat as he saw the small boys piercing green eyes staring back pleading with him please dont kill me in the dreams the car boot and the final moments of attack had become one and the same the eyes shining back at him from the boots darkness just before he swung the rock down the first dream had come six months after the attack and sometimes he would get quick flashbacks as he opened the boot hed sold the car shortly after but at other times hed feel that hed suffered enough that the dreams were only still haunting him because each call from chapeau would remind him bring the incident alive again and in those moments hed want it all ended the nightmare of the continuing calls and demands the worry with his career progressing that each year he had more to lose the price on his head increased and he knew then why hed picked up the gun knew that there was only duclos thoughts were broken chapeaus car had pulled up to one side duclos got out hastily it was vital they werent inside his car when he pulled the trigger he felt light rain spots touch his face and prayed that chapeau didnt find it strange that he was standing outside chapeau got out and walked over new car duclos noticed citreon cx pallas with the money hed been paying to chapeau the past years hardly any wonder he could afford a better car than himself he put one hand in his coat pocket touched the cool metal of the gun butt i didnt know you were a country lover chapeau commented his breath showing on the cool damp air the weather was ideal hed purposely delayed the meeting until it turned damp and cool he could wear a coat without chapeau being suspicious chapeaus feet crunched on loose shale and stone as he shuffled close the track ran between a small area of woodland twenty miles north of montpelier it led to a picnic area further down which in summer would be busy at this time of year it was deserted duclos had made the excuse of not wanting to meet at the usual restaurant car park a waiter was looking out at intervals during our last meeting chapeau said he hadnt noticed but had agreed to the new meeting place chapeaus features had become heavier with the years his neck had a thick jowl and the bags under his eyes gave him the appearance of a sad malevolent bulldog he often wore dark or tinted glasses to hide his bad eye but today there were none the weather was too dull its cold out here chapeau said has the heater been on inside your car duclos glanced at the car thinking quickly before his hesitance gave him away probably but i wanted a bit of fresh air well be finished soon chapeau held his gaze for a second duclos hand tensed on the gun butt in his pocket was chapeau suspicious wondering why he wanted some fresh air when it was misty and raining chapeau looked down thoughtfully then to one side no worry of any nosy waiters here good choice if you like privacy then his gaze swivelled back until it rested on duclos duclos felt a faint trembling start to grip his legs he took the hand hastily out of his pocket you must be quite proud minister i read that recent press clipping impressive stuff if i didnt know you so well id be tempted to vote for you myself amazing how your private life can be so different to your public image through the years duclos had become used to reading behind chapeaus comments what he meant was now your public profile has been elevated yet again is even more polarized from your private life the threat of downfall has far higher value i can charge you more what a surprise theyd all get if they realized what a prick you really were chapeau laughed no more invites to boy scout or youth club hall openings and always ended on a rebuke a tease christ for that alone it was going to feel good to kill him duclos sneaked his hand back on the gun snaked one finger around until it was on the trigger no more teasing and mocking no more having to look into chapeaus sad fish eye to see that the only thing to bring some life into it some mirth was his own discomfort the first thought of killing chapeau had come as much as five years ago but getting someone else to do it then he quickly thought again that was what had landed him in this cycle of blackmail in the first place he could end up just replacing one blackmailer with another yet in that first moment of discovering his uncles gun he never dreamt that years later he would be standing on a damp and desolate lane with his own finger on the trigger each meeting each rebuke and insult each payment the fear of discovery and downfall stronger with each year had bit by bit built a patchwork quilt of hatred and resolve he would have to do it himself there was nobody else are you okay asked chapeau yes yes fine duclos stuttered he could feel his nerves returning as he steeled himself the trembling was back in his legs lets get it over with as you say its cold out here he passed the envelope to chapeau the gun and ammunition would be untraceable nobody had seen him come into the lane and the location was miles away for both of them there would be no possible connection he would have to make the first shot count hitting the chest or stomach with two or three in quick succession after a superficial wound or a miss and chapeau would start firing back chapeau was opening the envelope starting to count the money with vacharet now dead the last link between the two of them had also gone the last traces of would die with chapeau hed got away with it once he could do it again he tightened his grip felt his palm sweating on the gun butt the best moment was while chapeau was looking down distracted with counting the money thirty thousand wasnt it chapeau confirmed but he hardly looked up from counting yes twelve years focused into a single moment his legs were trembling uncontrollably and there was a tight constriction in his chest he swallowed to try and ease it hed thought initially of shooting chapeau through the coat pocket but then realized that with the mark and powder burns hed have to dump the coat it could be traced but now he began to worry that in lifting the gun out chapeau would see it a flicker in the corner of his eye while he was counting making him reach for his own gun chapeau was twothirds through counting the first bundle duclos knew the routine chapeau would count the first bundle fully then would flick quickly through the other bundles and measure them against the first there were six bundles in all francs each made up of franc notes all the months of preparation and now the moment was upon him he felt frozen into inaction hed even gone out to a deserted field near limoges one weekend to fire off a few rounds make sure the ammunition wasnt damp or faulty and get used to the feel of the gun but what use was that now this was no longer cardboard targets but pumping bullets through flesh and bone his nerves were racing his whole body starting to shake perhaps he should wait until chapeau had finished counting started to walk away shoot him in the back chapeau was finishing the second bundle but what if chapeau suddenly looked up and read into his expression that something was wrong chapeau would see that he was in a cold sweat with panic would reach for his gun before he even had the chance chapeau was flicking rapidly through the bundles starting on the fourth any second he could look up and the chance would be gone with one last silent prayer into the misty air duclos started to ease the gun from his pocket twentythree marseille rd october heartbeats their own pulses marking time all the three men in the car could hear as they waited for the full cover of darkness they watched as two more people left the bar how many would that leave now inside tomi the man behind the wheel asked maybe nine or ten twenty minutes earlier tomi had gone in the bar for a quick reconnaissance downed a pastis and left i doubt if well find a time with less people inside later on it will start filling up again the driver jaques took out the mm automatic from his shoulder holster in the back tomis fingers tapped nervously on the barrel of a pumpaction shotgun heartbeats it had all been agreed earlier they couldnt leave any possible witnesses when theyd been handed the photos and half the payment two days before theyd been told that this was the only place theyd find all three at the same time tomi had already checked that all three targets were there the sign bar du telephone was only partly visible between the trees which shadowed their car jaques looked ahead and in his mirror there was nobody approaching he nodded and they pulled on the stocking masks no more words were spoken between them as they followed him briskly into the bar only two people turned and stared as they walked in and raised their guns to fire surprise had hardly registered on their faces as the first volleys rang out deafening in the confined space tomi saw one of the targets towards the far end of the bar and picked him off quickly with a chest shot then swung to his right and fired at a man diving for cover jaques quickly found their second target and picked off two bystanders trying to escape among the pandemonium of chairs and tables overturning and glasses breaking as people tried frantically to escape the relentless volley of fire the three went through the bar as if it was a routine military exercize it had all been agreed beforehand chest shots floor as many people as possible quickly then finish off with head shots cries and screams mingled with the groans of those already wounded and the air was thick with smoke and the smell of burning cordite at one point jaques held one hand up in the few seconds lull taking stock of who was left to fell a small movement in the corner tomi swung and fired everyone else was already gravely wounded or dead jaques nodded and they moved in to finish off the wounded one man in his late twenties looked up and pleaded as jaques levelled his gun at him monsieur please no no pardon jaques pressed the gun barrel into the soft flesh below the mans ear and fired within another fifty seconds theyd delivered a head or neck shot to everyone in the bar jaques grimaced disdainfully with the carnage the tile floor was slippery with blood hed almost fallen over twice jaques signalled and they headed out less than three minutes had passed since theyd entered shortly after them leaving a faint liquid wheezing came from a man by the bar counter hed been shot twice in the neck but miraculously had survived the gunmen had also failed to notice a faint flicker of movement on the stairway at the back of the bar as theyd entered nicole leoni wife of the bars owner saw the lead gunman as she was walking downstairs quickly heading back up again and barricading herself in an upstairs bedroom she was unsure whether or not the gunman had seen her and stared nervously at the door as the shots rang out below fearful of it bursting open at any moment she stayed in that position for almost three minutes after the last shots fired still trembling as she finally ventured close to the door and listened afraid that it might be a trick and they were creeping up the stairs to surprise her five days since the shooting the main division responsible for the investigation was in north marseille where the incident took place but then quickly involved divisions covering the vieux port and panier districts where most of the interviews for suspects was centred and finally chief inspector forniers division in west marseille for liaison with paris and due to his past experience as an inspector in the panier district coordinating the investigation was divisional police commissioner pierre chatelain dominic had received calls practically every day from chatelain anxious that liaison with paris went smoothly dominic was keenly aware of the background gangland battles between rivals in nice and marseille had left almost sixty dead over the past two years not a blink from the politicians and police officials in the north but this was different along with three known criminals six innocents had also been killed nine dead two more than the st valentines day massacre apart from the obvious comparisons to chicago suddenly it was a concern that tourists might get cut down in a hail of bullets while sampling some local pastis holidays were cancelled or rearranged for the southwest coast italy or spain with tourism dropping foreign exchange would be effected too suddenly it was a national issue ministers and police commissioners wanted results fast the local crime network the milieu felt one of the coldest investigative draughts in years the message was clear kill each other by all means but never let it spread outside of that fraternity dominic and most of his division had been working virtually round the clock since being brought into the investigation and now a more concentrated vigil lay ahead phones and teleprinters went almost constantly and files arrived at regular intervals by messenger towards the end of the second night as a stack of files shifted and almost knocked the smiling family photo of his wife and two sons off his desk he was reminded to phone home just a couple of hours more ill be finished then his wife reminded him that it was their younger son geromes birthday in just three days hed be six try and leave at least some time over the next two days to put thought towards his present dont worry once ive filed this report tomorrow things will be easier the two hours turned into four by the time hed run the report through a phone preview with chatelain before sending it to commissioner aimeblanc the final report was sixteen pages long a complex and sordid saga of two rival gangs vying for control of casinos clubs racetracks and profitable extortion and prostitution rackets background and texture to the final massacre milieu revenge for the hijacking of a shipment of fake omega cartier and piaget watches from italy by three men andre leoni the bar du telephones owner and two associates present that fateful night all others killed were incidental details of the killings were gruesome all the victims had been hit first with chest or stomach shots then finished off executioner style miraculously one man francis fernandez was shot twice in the throat but survived but he was purely a casual visitor to the bar his descriptions of the three killers was vague apart from the fact that they all wore stocking masks and one had a beard three different calibre bullet were found at the scene mm mm and mm the last probably from a shotgun aimeblanc came back within three hours of viewing the report he wanted the suspect list narrowed with little firm evidence successful prosecution might hinge purely on confessions a more workable interview list was essential by late the same day dominic had narrowed it to just twelve names aimeblanc added his own two page summary and passed the file to interior minister bonnet with an additional foreword summary bonnet had the file copied and duly distributed fourteen ministerial departments were on his direct distribution list and another eighteen requests had been made some were due to ministerial involvement in regional or national crime commissions or because of the incidents grave reflection on overall crime trends others simply because of the concern of constituents who had business interests holiday homes or vacationed regularly in the area among the request list was the rpr minister for limoges alain duclos twentyfour was there much in the press about it a fair bit two or three clippings in la provencal at least it probably even hit le figaro or le monde at one stage though possibly lumped together with coverage or other child murders when will you know for sure marinella asked the concern had come through in her voice she sensed perhaps even sounded how she felt desperate deflated philippe described being bounced between libraries and news agencies half the morning but i think ive finally found a couple of reliable sources ive left them my fax number at the lse i should get the results of a search and copies from microfiche records within the next few hours there was nothing she could do but sit it out wait for philippe to receive his faxes david lambourne was in with a patient and she felt ill at ease sitting by the phone in his waiting area she wanted to bounce thoughts off him straightaway though was it purely to vent some of her frustrations or get an alternative viewpoint she glanced at the phone if it was later in the day she could have at least put through a call to sebastian and her father but it was only am in charlottesville besides shed called them just the day before her father had been preparing red snapper with peppers and bean rice for later and the night previous theyd had chicken arroz brut it was like a restaurant waiter reading out the menu sebastian would have been happy to stay with her father for a month and to phone the university catch up on activities the last few days and perhaps get some feedback from donaldson shed have to wait even longer almost four hours she decided on a walk burn off some of her restlessness she walked for almost half a mile and found herself on the edge of covent garden she decided to have a coffee in the piazza found a deli with outside tables in the ground floor courtyard a string quartet played vivaldi while she sipped her cappuccino just the day before shed been excited about the case a genuine rush at the first bit of tangible information philippe had traced the death certificate in the bauriac town hall register christian yves rosselot death registered at pm rd august parents monique and jeanluc address rue des rigouards taragnon the boy not only existed some of the main details checked out but the registrar had mentioned a coroners note on the certificate marinella asked philippe to check coroners notes were not in themselves unusual present in all manner of accidental deaths so she was not immediately alarmed towards the end of the same day having followed the trail through the coroners office and the ministere publique which had ordered the report philippe phoned her and dropped the bombshell the boy had been the victim of a murder quite a notable case in the region at the time it was too late for philippe to do any more checking that day libraries and town halls in france were already closed shed have to wait till the morning for the confirmations she feared were looming on the edge of the piazza a mime artist juggled with three red balls making them disappear dramatically behind his white gloved hands a bit like this case she thought now you see it now you dont if she continued and published a paper they would laugh at her back at virginia a prominent murder case that had been splashed across the press almost as bad as the boy claiming to be maurice chevalier or joan of arc all the details were there for him to regurgitate stock lines of defence rolled through her mind about the age of the press articles and the familys lack of knowledge of france but she knew that the scepticss barrage would be relentless old newspapers perhaps kept by relatives who had holidayed in the region current books with prominent murder cases from bygone years fresh news stories that reflected back to past cases she knew she couldnt even start to defend her corner until shed seen the news items from philippe weighed the full extent of damage she felt deflated despondent brought to the edge of what looked like an exciting case only for it to evaporate before her eyes yet again was this to be the pattern of her life each case that looked like it had real promise ending in disappointment perhaps she should just get the first flight back to virginia erase it quickly a fresh workload and new cases to occupy her mind she checked her watch lambournes session would have ended a few minutes ago she headed back david was sipping at a freshly made tea as she walked back in he offered her one but she declined with thanks ive just had coffee shed flagged her concerns the evening before and now fleshed out the details as she feared the case had been reported heavily shed know just how heavily by early afternoon theyd have to start thinking in terms of the case being completely fabricated or at best subliminally influenced if they didnt adopt that stance the critics certainly would the case and any resultant study papers were heading nowhere sorry david but if the news from philippe supports what i fear im bailing out ive already been four days away from my family theres no point in my staying on just to face another disappointment lambourne held one hand up trying to slow her down wait a minute putting aside the sceptics view what do you think do you think the boys fabricating i dont know she thought of the frail lost voice how convincing it had seemed she shook her head im not sure either way it looks suspicious thats all but i have to take a safe stance look at the downside if i dont someone else will theyll rap me over the head beat me senseless with it make me look foolish lambourne was about to comment is that the most important thing that you dont look foolish then thought better of it too harsh are you sure youre not reading too prematurely into the view the critics might only might take on this as donaldson commented playing too much to the gallery its okay for donaldson he never faces the critics like me never does personal interviews just goes on his jaunts to india or wherever compiles his papers and books and if they dont like his findings fine he just lets them stew in their own juices hes in his own little cocooned academic netherworld protected from it all unlike me he doesnt have to sit on panels and face professor novision a special study team of nerds from sceptics incorporated and flat earth preachers who conveniently forget that over half the worlds religions believe in reincarnation its okay for donaldson to pontificate about the gallery because he has absolutely no idea what marinella cut herself short as she read david lambournes expression shocked at the strength of her feelings or uncomfortable at her mention of ambivalence with donaldson she let out a long tired breath and apologized admitted that the stress of another promising case curtailed abruptly had got to her she hung her head slightly in submission donaldson has built up a body of work and a reputation within the profession that i can only but hope to emulate it was wrong of me to criticize im sorry lambourne held his palms out so what do you want to do anticipate the flak you might receive from sceptics and give up now or battle on i dont know marinella was thoughtful then suddenly she smiled you should worry if its all a scam at least your patients not ill misguided by some inventive headline seeking weirdo godparents perhaps but not psychologically disturbed lambourne grimaced meekly except one problem i happen to believe the boy and im fully committed to trying to help him through this problem marinella nodded slowly for what its worth i believe him too despite how it might all end up looking to the sceptics while the mood was right lambourne tried to buoy her spirits assured her that her concern about critics was both premature and probably unfounded the weight of evidence both from his own sessions and the initial report from dr torrens a lot of people to all be wrong what did the capels do fake the accident and the coma as well the statistics would probably also stack up on her side how many regressions have you experienced before where people have been murdered only one victim of a carpetbaggers raid just after the american civil war no records but i believe donaldson has had one or two cases i bet if you check the records youll find that regressions involving murder reflect almost exactly its incidence in real life compared with other forms of death one in five hundred one in a thousand whatever marinella knew that previous studies had shown that regressions accurately reflected real life women men regardless of the sex of the subject most from meagre or mundane backgrounds very few rich or notable figures she didnt recall any specific studies for murder victims and most murders since the turn of the century would have hit the press so its not that unusual lambourne raised an eyebrow have you ever heard of or read the east kent gazette or perhaps a mexican newspaper no well the capels would have had just about as much chance of seeing provincial newspapers from the south of france and from thirty years ago forget it but it might have also been in le monde perhaps even smaller items in the british press and then theres the possibility of books compiling various murder cases through the years for le monde youll have to wait on news from philippe but the rest you could check yourself theres a good library not far away on chancery lane in a couple of hours you could have done a full search marinella bit lightly at her lip its not just for them its also convincing myself building back the confidence and enthusiasm to continue lambourne wasnt sure whether hed convinced her or not when he went into his next session she was still there perhaps waiting for philippes call perhaps still balancing everything out in her mind though when he came out of the session she was gone two hours later just twenty minutes after philippe had called and left a message she phoned from the library you were right theres nothing in the british press ive searched everything the enthusiasm was back in her voice im just checking through books now ill know for sure in an hour or so lambourne gave her the message that philippe had called and marinella asked if he had mentioned le monde no he just left his number okay thanks ill call him she rang off abruptly lambourne didnt see her again until early evening she was in high spirits and brought him up to date quickly le monde did have an entry but it was only five lines on page twelve the day after the attack and mentioned only the boys name and the village no parents names no trimmings the boy was alive apparently for five days after that and his later death didnt appear in le monde three articles in la provencal one large two small and nothing at all in the british press or books you look relieved im ecstatic im also starving lets go eat over dinner david could hardly keep pace this was the marinella he remembered confident optimistic energetic eyes sparkling he felt glad now that hed calmed her earlier doubts though as she talked about the remaining steps ahead of finding the rosselots or close past friends who could corroborate eyrans account as christian rosselot he felt the first pang of uncertainty marinella was talking as if she was suddenly on an open freeway had been lost for a while on some annoying side road but now was full speed ahead not an obstacle in sight and he began to worry that he might have fired her up too much that if she suddenly hit an obstacle and was deflated again hed feel partly responsible having rekindled her enthusiasm if in a few sessions time he decided that continuing regressions were not in his patients interests it would seem heartless to suddenly pull the plug that enthusiasm carried marinella through the next two days the first stumbling block was that the rosselots could no longer be traced in the area one of the town hall clerks recommended philippe to the bauriac gendarmerie they conducted much of the investigation and someone there might know philippe could only find one person at the gendarmerie who remembered the investigation captain levacher while levacher personally had no knowledge of the rosselots or their current whereabouts he had another number for someone who might be able to help dominic fornier he assisted in the investigation thirty years ago he had a number also for captain poullain who headed the investigation but levacher explained why he thought dominic fornier might be more useful here it is national police panier district marseille thats the last number we have for him philippe phoned the number and they gave him another number for a division in west marseille the people in west marseille were more circumspect and gave no information merely asked his name logged his call and promised that someone would call back philippe didnt get the return call until the next morning a girl named therese giving him a number in lyon philippe phoned to be informed chief inspector fornier is in a meeting right now hell be free probably about midday philippe brought marinella up to date straightaway she checked her watch am france was an hour ahead so philippe planned to try again in almost two hours great ill be sitting by the phone waiting for news two more hours and they could hopefully piece together christian rosselots life but along with the excitement she suddenly felt restless ill at ease the last days of research and philippes paper chase across france had obviously told on her nerves though as she tried to settle the rising butterflies in her stomach it struck her that it might also be something else the portent of possible failure was suddenly there once again only two hours away twentyfive th december what is this hit man of the year nomination list close its the suspect list for the bar du telephone killings duclos watched brossards expression keenly as he scanned down and saw his own name on the list hardly a flicker of recognition you know what this means yes it means the police are going to waste their valuable time with nine suspects and im one of them it also means that your life will be difficult for the next month or so youll be watched perhaps brought in for questioning whenever it suits the police your life will be disrupted and it will be bad for business people wont go near you for a while with contracts except one thing im the only one on the list for whom the police have no firm identity just a vague photokit and an alias i once used they wont know where to start duclos nodded he knew the history it was partly why he thought brossard would be ideal it had taken him almost a week to set up the meeting through francois vacharet it was over three years since his last visit to vacharets not long after the death of his father vacharet had been keen to offer him a new boy from martinique but duclos had wanted to get straight down to business he showed vacharet the same list and asked him to pick out the ones he knew vacharet came up with three names forget tomas jaumard duclos prompted he didnt explain why that hed had an association with jaumard through his father emile vacharet of the other two which would you recommend the quick biography sounded ideal early thirties no arrests or convictions master of disguises little or nothing on police files except an identikit picture description and modus operandi brossard invariably wore different wigs and glasses to change his appearance the supposition was therefore that his normal hair style was short eugene brossard was a false name from a door buzzer tag for a flat brossard had vacated two days before a police raid he was always one step ahead duclos was sure the brossard before him was also heavily disguised thick blonde wig cut in beatles style rounded glasses with a mottled burgundy frame he looked like a david hockney caricature the only thing which had initially made brossard uncomfortable was the tape recorder running duclos explained why that any minute he was going to offer brossard f to have someone killed the reason for the hit was the blackmailing of a close friend duclos wanted to be sure that the blackmail wasnt repeated so the tape would serve as an insurance policy for both of them now that ive admitted a dark secret its your turn tell me about one of your hits brossard laughed at the suggestion at first but duclos was insistent the tape will never go out of my possession after all it would incriminate me as much as you what have you got to lose if you dont want to do it fine me and my hundred thousand will walk out of the room duclos listened as brossard described in bland monotones the murder of a chief planning regulator in nice three years previous duclos remembered the case a planning officer implicated in a milieu bribes scandal the milieu got to him before the state procureur he couldnt help wondering why brossard had chosen this particular story was it partly a warning not to misuse the tape ive already killed one government official fuck with me and one more wont make that much difference brossard stared coldly at duclos duclos could hardly see his eyes behind the dark glasses except when he blinked duclos felt an involuntary shiver run up his spine he hadnt felt this uncomfortable in someones presence since since the memory of his palm sweating on the gun butt was still vivid lifting it so slowly the birds suddenly alighting from a nearby tree making chapeau look up he feared for a minute that chapeau had seen the gun had thrust it quickly back in his pocket in the last seconds of their meeting that fear had stayed with him that chapeau would suddenly wheel around level his gun and fire he stayed vigilant as chapeau walked away but the moment to take the initiative had gone he said lamely that he wanted to stay in the lane for a bit more fresh air as chapeau drove off truth was he was shaking too much to be able to drive almost as soon as chapeau had disappeared from view he was physically sick he couldnt face going through that again it had taken him another eighteen months of suffering chapeaus blackmail and insults even to be able to summon up the courage to arrange this meeting but despite the precautions looking at brossards lips curled in a slight smile at his description of murder his deeply hooded eyes blinking behind dark glasses he couldnt help fearing that he might just be replacing one nightmare with another the room they were in smelt of pine disinfectant fighting hard to disguise the odour of musky bed linen and bad plumbing a seedy back street hotel which vacharet had recommended where clients took hookers francs to a cleaning lady for a room for an hour no questions asked shed just raised an eyebrow and grunted at the sight of two men entering one wearing a strange blonde wig duclos was eager to get out brossard looked back at the list so is the hundred thousand supposed to make me feel better about having my name on this list by the time you get the hundred thousand hopefully your name wont be on the list im paying vacharet another fifty thousand to spread the right noises in the right places that you were in a friends restaurant the night of the attack it happened too early for you to be in one of his clubs within a few weeks it should spread on the milieu network and hopefully your name will come off the list brossards eyes flickered he was impressed clients plans were normally clumsy most planning had to come from his own quarter to compensate so who is it you want hit and when thats another reason for the list hes there sixth name down you probably know him tomas jaumard brossards eyes flickered more rapidly hopefully hed disguised his initial flinch tomas jaumard alias chapeau one of the old reliable milieu die hards it wouldnt be the first time someone had tried to have jaumard killed of the last two hired guns sent one died instantly with a bullet through the head the other was shot in the stomach and groin and spent four hours with surgeons piecing together what was left of his manhood jaumard escaped from the fray with only a shoulder wound jaumard is a high risk target for that type of hit it will cost more its not worth doing under f duclos stared back is that because of allegiances possibly upsetting others within the milieu no i take work from the milieu strictly as an independent i owe no allegiances on any side its because of the extra risk jaumard is one of the few men on this list i have some professional respect for it will take more to set up duclos nodded strong allegiances with the milieu had been the one remaining area to concern him brossard asked where and when two months give some time for your name to come off this list said duclos so youre not quite so hot the where is up to you set it up the way you want they made the final arrangements and set the time for their next meeting by then brossard would have the outline of a plan and duclos would give him the first payment brossard left the room first and asked duclos not to leave for at least a few minutes after duclos assumed it was part of brossards obsession with protecting his identity but brossard offered no explanation walking down the corridor brossard thought a total of f to drop jaumard including the payment to vacharet and the client had hardly blinked almost twice what hed been paid to hit the nice city planner jaumard had obviously stepped on some important toes poor old chapeau a sly smile crossed brossards face after a moment at least it was nice to know people in his profession were so highly valued more than a city planner he could think of worse tombstone epitaphs alone in the dank room duclos started to feel uncomfortable after only a minute a sudden shiver of desolation that reminded him just how far hed sunk to be rid of chapeau he packed up the tape recorder and left the room marseille th january were jamming were jammin till the jammins through wer jammin to think that jammin was a thing of the past wer jammin and i hope this jammins goin to last the motorbike messenger bopped with the rhythm of the music on his walkman as he got off his bike kicked it on its stand and entered the cafe the package he was carrying was his arms length and half as wide the cafe was almost an exact ten metre square there were about fourteen or fifteen people inside four at the bar and the rest scattered at tables the messengers eyes behind dark motorcycle goggles scanned the room quickly he could see the two people he expected in the far corner but didnt dwell his attention shifted quickly to the approaching barman he lifted out his earpiece monsieur charot the barman pulled a face and shrugged the messenger tilted the package and read from the label monsieur charot thirtyeight rue baussenque puzzlement from the barman the address is right but i dont know a charot let me check with my wife the barman disappeared behind a bead curtain at the end of the bar brossard put back the earpiece behind the motorcycle goggles he let his eyes scan slowly across again he was interested only in one position the table in the corner with chapeau and marichel the local pimp hed paid to set things up he wanted it to look like a casual surveillance the bored messenger waiting to see if he had the right address head bobbing lightly to the rhythm on his walkman fingers tapping on the package we all defend the right that your children must unite life is worth much more than gold wer jammin jammin the barman was back by the bead curtain now with his wife the barman pointed his wife shrugged and returned to the back as the barman returned in the corner of his eye brossard could tell that marichel was looking over briefly dont look brossard silently screamed just let me blend in dont bring chapeaus attention to me hed made the arrangements with marichel just the week before ten thousand francs to set up the meeting with chapeau act as if he was a gobetween for a hit contract brossard had given marichel all the details had practically written the script for him with a contract on offer what better way to guarantee chapeaus attention but marichel was probably watching for the timing of the package being opened the moment he would have to suddenly jump aside brossard swivelled back the earpiece until it rested on his neck the barman was explaining that his wife didnt know the name either brossard pointed to the corner and asked if he could use the phone check back with my office to see what happened the barman nodded turned to the end of the bar by the door to serve another customer with the package under his arm brossard went towards the pay phone on the wall it was almost directly opposite chapeau and marichels table he noticed chapeau look up as he started across but he couldnt tell if chapeaus gaze had stayed with him as he approached the phone couldnt risk turning or glancing back to see he started to worry was there something in his disguise that didnt fit some small detail that chapeau might have picked up on hed tried on several long curly wigs but most were too bushy to fit comfortably under a crash helmet finally he found one that was slightly flatter on top with ringlet curls starting further down spilling out of the base of the helmet and onto his shoulders just another rockin messenger with some sounds to blot out the drone of city traffic brossards fingers tapped on the package as he set it down by the phone the tone was tinnier pulled away from his ear the love that now exists is the love i cant resist so jam by my side wer jammin jammin jammin he reached for the receiver his hand slightly damp as he imagined chapeaus eyes still burning into his back he started dialling fluffing the first numbers so that only the last three counted the speaking clock as it rang he turned and casually surveyed the room chapeau was looking back at marichel deep in conversation marichel drew hard on a cigarette exhaling smoke in staccato bursts as he talked it was then that brossard noticed the girl directly in line behind chapeau and cursed hed told marichel to choose seats by a wall the wall was behind them from the bar view but not from this angle the girl was fully obscured only when chapeau leant forward bob marley pulsed against his neck two inches below his earlobe as he listened to the talking clock it will be ninetwelve and twenty with the sweep of the gun it was going to be difficult not to hit her at the same time brossard wanted the hit to be clean for a moment brossard tensed a quick window of opportunity appearing as chapeau leant forward then just as quickly it was gone chapeau relaxed back again it was a tease brossard considered the possibility of stepping to one side as he fired sharpening the angle so that the wall was behind but would that split second delay make him more vulnerable chapeau was listening intently to marichel explain the hit it appeared straightforward enough but some of the details from marichel were becoming repetitive and he seemed slightly nervous hed noticed marichel look up at the motorcycle messenger at the bar and had glanced up briefly himself as the messenger had crossed to the phone before bringing his attention back to the business at hand but now he noticed that at intervals marichel would give the messenger a sideways glance as if trying to judge his position without staring overtly and he was suddenly conscious of the messenger looking across his attention shifting between them and the table behind all the other small signals suddenly gelled in that instant chapeau tried not to give away the sudden realization would have averted his eyes to give him a moment more to think but by the messengers reaction he knew it was already too late the alarm in his eyes had shown the messenger reached for the package as marichel leapt aside chapeaus impulse reaction was to raise one hand as he stood the other reaching inside his jacket for his gun he saw the package open the compact uzi machine gun swing up as the package was tossed aside but he was sure hed be able to level his gun first brossard knew hed passed the point of no return as soon as chapeau looked up he saw the hand raising in a stop motion a distraction from the other hand reaching for the gun but hed already committed himself to swing the arc of the uzi from the right the girl behind was suddenly forgotten he saw the first shots rip through chapeaus outstretched hand but the other hand was raising rapidly the gun barrel almost pointing straight at him chapeau could see the black leather figure clearly in his sights as the stinging pain hit with the top part of his hand ripped away he squeezed off his shot virtually at the same time wondering for a moment why the recoil was so heavy had tilted him sharply back until he was facing the ceiling the arc of brossards fire swung across and caught chapeau squarely in the chest throwing off his aim so that his bullet missed brossard by more than a yard marichel was now two yards clear of the table leering wildly with a mixture of surprise and raw excitement brossard paused only briefly then swung across again continuing the arc enjoying the moments total bewilderment that crossed marichels face the hail of bullets shattered marichels breastbone and removed the top part of one shoulder no witnesses or knowledge of the setup it was safer brossard had decided the action shortly after hiring marichel most people in the bar had dived for cover on the floor or behind tables and chairs hysterical screaming rose from somewhere near the door brossard moved closer to the sprawled bodies chapeau was still breathing faintly brossard could see his chest moving as it struggled for air from lungs filling rapidly with blood chapeaus shattered fingers lay several feet away brossard fired a quick final burst to chapeaus head then to marichels and ran out twentysix dominic looked anxiously at the map eight or nine kilometres past bourgoin jallieu the motorway branched into two the a to chambery and the a branching off to grenoble radio messages crackled back and forth to two operators to his side it had been one of those mornings hed seen the message to phone marinella calvan as soon as he came out of an early morning meeting a number in england he wondered whether it was something to do with his previous interpol work though the name didnt strike a chord but there were other more pressing emergencies there had been a bank robbery in the la guillotiere area of lyon and after a sighting a chase had ensued with three police cars on the a heading east but already events had gone tragically wrong bullets fired from the robbers car had struck one of the pursuing cars shattering its windscreen and causing it to careen into the central barrier two of the three officers inside had been seriously injured the only way to avoid more mayhem was to set up a road block preferably at a turnoff peage looks like theyre heading for grenoble one of the radio operators morand called out dominic looked up from the map we need a quiet junction next three turn offs somewhere where the peage wont be too busy suggestions eleven or twelve could be good said morand dominic checked the distances sixteen kilometres and thirtyfour it will have to be twelve well need time to put everything into place it took another nine minutes three police cars ahead took up all three lanes gradually slowing so that a visible jam built up just ahead of junction at the junction peage three slots would be blocked by queues of at least two vehicles a mixture of unmarked police cars and an old green van with crs guards in the back the fourth peage slot would be left empty all other traffic turning off meanwhile would be waved rapidly through the vacant peage slot without paying as the robbers car approached the empty slot at the last second the barrier would come down to slow them and as they burst through two teams of crs guards with rifles would put out the tyres dominic looked across sharply as the phone rang on his desk it could be news on the injured officers hed asked for anything urgent to be put through on his private line he picked it up the girl on desk duty informed him that it was marinella calvan phoning again from england and that she said it was urgent okay put her through hed probably have a spare two minutes as marinella introduced herself apologetically and started explaining the reason for her call for dominic it was as if the rest of the room and the activities in it had suddenly receded become little more than incidental background only the imperatives broke through at one point morand raising a thumbs up and shouting theyve gone for it theyve taken the bait and turned off theyre coming up to the peage on the far side of the peage four crs guards with flak jackets aimed their rifles at the empty slot ready for the car as it burst through when morand leapt into the air and a quick cheer went up from the radio desk dominic knew that everything had gone well he said one moment apologetically to marinella calvan as he hit the secrecy button and looked towards morand so one injured the others came out arms up no resistance no injuries our side dominic nodded and smiled but morand could tell that his attention was fractured dominic wasnt sure if he was more distracted through struggling to make sense of what marinella was saying a young boy in england hypnotic sessions and a possible link with christian rosselot or through his suspended belief the painful nostalgia as the years were stripped away dark and hazy memories which he thought had been long buried dominic unclicked the secrecy button sorry yes i think ill be able to help i do know someone who could verify christian rosselots background but having made the arrangements though intrigued as he put down the phone he was uncertain what ghosts might be unlocked by helping reawakening memories hed spent so much of his life struggling to forget he shook his head thirty years perhaps they had never been truly free of the events of twentyseven provence july in the two months after jeanluc rosselot died once again monique stayed on the farm hid away from the world the fievets helped out with her shopping and dominic didnt see her in the village the investigation into his death was short the postmortem over in ten days verdict of suicide jeanluc had started the tractor and then purposely shut the garage door had stayed inside until overcome by fumes the first thing to alert monique in the kitchen at the time was the throbbing sound of the motor through the walls as it continued without the tractor emerging from the garage she went into the courtyard and saw that the doors were closed clarisse had run out behind had seen her father slumped dead over the tractor steering wheel as the doors were swung open monique tried in vain for a few minutes to revive him then ran to the fievets to use their phone and call an ambulance running back seeing clarisse standing thoughtfully over the prone figure of her father hugging tight to a small doll as tears ran down her cheek had been the image to linger most with monique the doll practically all she had left dominic hadnt been involved directly in the investigation harrault went with servan assisting dominic was thankful he didnt want to be remembered as the friendly face from the gendarmerie always associated with death in her family calling at the door to tell her that her son was dead then twenty months later taking notes on her husbands suicide hed have hardly been able to face her when a few months later she did finally start venturing into the village dominic had his own crisis to cope with his mother had been in hospital the past two weeks her condition had deteriorated so much that the doctors felt sure that she wouldnt last more than another week she knew that she was dying too had begged dominic to take her home again said that she didnt want to die surrounded by old and ill people shed even managed a taut smile at the irony she wanted to be surrounded by some life and that which she held fondest the garden the sounds of the birds in the trees and her son close by her side the doctors argued that she might last longer where they could care for her better but dominic was insistent a few extra days to be surrounded by bed pans and the smell of disinfectant she was going home she lasted almost three weeks more it was almost as if she didnt want to leave the beauty and tranquillity of the garden september temperatures were still in the eighties bright sunshine practically every day and dominic watered the plants early each morning and sat her on the back covered porch with her favourite coffee javanese with a hint of chicory and cinnamon it reminded her of her childhood surrounded by the symbols that had marked the stages of her life the coffee the tangerine tree that her husband had planted the year before he died her son before she could truly feel at ease in leaving it all behind everything was in place it felt right it was a small ceremony dominics sister had travelled down just a few days before his mothers death and stayed for the funeral preparations her husband and children joined her for the funeral and dominics uncle on his mothers side was also there he lived in bordeaux and dominic had only seen him a handful of times in the past decade not long after he saw monique in a bauriac cafe she looked across and acknowledged him with a small nod eyes downcast perhaps she didnt want to greet him with anything nearing a smile thought it might seem inappropriate but he had the feeling in that fleeting second that she knew that her look said ive heard and im sorry nobody knows better than me how you feel weve both lost someone we love dominic wouldnt have been too surprised if she knew hed heard so much about her own plight through louis via madeleine and the fievets one point hed picked up on had been problems with a local bank though details were sketchy from louis at first all the fievets knew was that jeanluc had taken a bank loan for farm improvements and to buy equipment and had fallen behind with the payments they didnt know how far behind only that monique had become increasingly concerned about it it was also mooted as another possible reason behind jeanlucs suicide marc fievet helped out on moniques land when he could and they shared the profits at market but with him only being able to manage working it at less than thirty percent capacity only half the monthly bank repayments were covered with no possibility of making a dent on the back payments with each update from louis the situation seemed to get more desperate shed put the farm up for sale as soon as she was aware of problems at the bank but three months had passed with still no takers listening to louis explain moniques dilemma one day dominic was struck with an idea he remembered a farmer hed reprimanded a month or so back for parking badly on a narrow taragnon lane it transpired that he was a tenant farmer and the cottage hed rented was separated from the land because there were no tracks or pullins for his car along one side of the land the farmer had complained he was forced to stay on the road dominic tracked him down over the next week to find out if the proposition of renting a farm with residence adjoining would appeal a few details exchanged and the answer was yes dominic checked with louis and some others in the gendarmerie for character reference it appeared the farmer croignon was diligent worked the land efficiently and always paid his rent on time a few days later dominic missed the opportunity of broaching the subject with monique she was just inside the doorway of the local boulangerie as he was passing and he wasnt sure if it was because there were other people within earshot or because the subject was delicate and she might be embarrassed that he knew about her personal problems or that as before he found her beauty intimidating he felt awkward and shy in her presence by the time hed thought about it the moment had gone afterwards he even questioned his motives was he really trying to help or was he just using it as an opportunity to speak to her after a few too many drinks at louis one night with louis teasing and goading him he finally admitted with a sly smile that perhaps it was a bit of both louis offered to break the ice by getting a message through valerie and the fievets shes so desperate shes probably past caring where help comes from louis ribbed dominic smiled and spun a beer mat across the bar counter despite the groundlaying through the fievets dominic was still nervous when they met he neednt have worried after some initial stumbling and condolences exchanged it went well dominic felt at ease it was almost as if he was talking to a long lost sister they traded some background and details in between him explaining the proposition and it suddenly struck him how lonely she was not just now with the loss of her son and husband but that she had always been lonely in the village in particular from the way she asked about his mother whether shed found it difficult at times in the village it wasnt easy for outsiders to be accepted he agreed shortly after she asked how he had found settling down in the area he explained that his mother was only half indonesian and by the time it reached him it was barely perceptible but yes it had been difficult the first year or so purely because he was from outside others in the gendarmerie also resented him because of his past foreign legion and marseille experience that he wasnt and never could be completely one of them monique nodded in understanding her eyes warm and compassionate she looked down after a second as she met the steadiness of his gaze toying nervously with her coffee spoon perhaps that was how she viewed him he thought another outsider battling against the hostilities of the closeknit village community the two of them now also bonded by grief theyd both lost someone they loved she went back over some of the details of the proposition if this croignon rents my farm in its entirety are you sure about my staying at your mothers house dominic assured her that it was too big for him and besides hed prefer not to stay with the memories it held you probably feel the same way about your place theyd already discussed most of the main details she would move into his mothers house and he would stay in a small apartment above louis the only initial stumbling block had been that louis current tennant didnt vacate for another four months in the end the croignons offered that dominic could stay temporarily in the fourth bedroom above the garage repayment for broking the deal dominic wouldnt charge monique anything the first year then theyd discuss a peppercorn rent to cover his basic costs at louis monique reached out and clasped his hand with a smile thank you she was deeply appreciative of the help but had put up a bit of a fight that she should pay him something straightaway before seeing how strongly he was resolved he wouldnt hear of accepting anything the first year dominic flinched a little at the electricity of her touch felt his face flush slightly she was excited by the proposition not only was the farmer paying a good rent for the first two years he would share thirty percent of the profits on the fields already fully planted and cultivated she could cover the bank payments and start getting her life back in order a new house would also remove some of the memories and emotional burden but she wanted to sleep on it overnight and speak briefly with the fievets could they meet again the next day at the same time and place it took another two meetings to arrange everything the loan details were complex and although the rent would easily cover the fresh payments the back payments would need rescheduling dominic showed her a couple of rescheduling options but still monique looked slightly lost and awkward jeanluc always dealt with the accounts she asked dominic if he would mind coming to the bank with her to help explain everything to the manager so much of it had been his plan anyway and he would be better equipped to propose the rescheduling options she might fumble or leave out something vital dominic was eager to help contemplating a diary busy with reasons to see monique stretching out ahead by the next day he had an appointment arranged with the manager at banque agricole du vars bertrand entienne monique gripped his hand again and this time kissed him on both cheeks a handful of meetings and already his feelings for her were running strong not only was she beautiful but warm and compassionate sincere he hadnt met a woman like her before he wondered if she had any of the same feelings for him then quickly shook his head he was being ridiculous he hardly knew her nor she him it was a relationship so far based entirely on reliance and help if he failed with the bank manager and his little scheme evaporated there would hardly be any reason for her to see him again he reminded himself soberly bertrand entienne was in his early forties with dark brown hair greased back and a rounded slightly ruddied face he smoked a pipe and his gestures were curt and formal as he showed them into his office but at least he was smiling looked eager to help dominic thought hopefully it didnt take long for the smile to disappear as dominic explained the proposition im sorry we appear to be at crossed purposes entienne commented i thought you were here with a proposition to clear the loan in full some sort of sale or other arrangement going through i would have thought my last letters were quite clear that that is all the bank would be able to accept at this stage dominic ignored the rebuff and pressed on explaining politely that monique rosselot had tried for four months to sell the property with no success the market was severely depressed it could be many months before a buyer was found if at all surely its better to get something secure now get a rescheduled loan on track with the secure knowledge that all the future repayments will be met entienne rested his pipe in an ashtray to one side he opened his hands out i would if i could but its impossible the papers went through to the judiciaire department a few weeks ago my last letter i thought explained very clearly that this action was impending once the papers are with them theres nothing i can do its out of my hands arms folded again hands interclasped a closed gesture dominic was sure it was still just an opening gambit that entienne would soften his stance once hed seen some figures i managed to work everything out dominic passed across the folder hed worked on earlier as you will see all of the fresh payments are covered plus the back payments are amortized in either three or four years i suppose that could be adjusted to two years in the banks favour if need be but dominic could tell that entienne was paying scant attention as he pointed out the key figures on the schedule entienne shook his head im sorry but the intervention by the judiciaire department makes consideration of this sort of suggestion out of the question once the file is with them the loan is due in full as part of the preparation for court action also theres far higher interest accruing to cover the extra costs of the legal departments action so these figures are already inaccurate im afraid dominic asked what sort of levels of interest entienne opened a file before him and perched some glasses on the end of his nose as he scanned down the columns he picked up his pipe for another few pulls as he read out some figures dominic added them together and felt his stomach sink it was outrageous per annum almost as bad as a marseille loan shark and what other options are there apart from paying the loan in full before the papers are passed through for court action hardly any im afraid if all the back money and accrued higher interest are cleared straightaway a continuance on the existing schedule might be possible but it will still have to go before the banks loan committee with no guarantees and a week or so from now even that option will probably be gone the papers will be too far advanced you see in any court papers the bank is obliged to press for the full amount dominic was outraged but he remained outwardly calm explained that it would be virtually impossible for madame rosselot to find that sort of money at such short notice he tried yet again to sell the virtue of the rental and a rescheduled loan the tenant is extremely reliable it would give the bank a firm schedule now she could probably clear two back payments straightaway from the deposit as a gesture of good faith and everything would roll forward cleanly from that point entienne wouldnt budge clearly he wasnt bluffing im really sorry but theres nothing i can do perhaps if youd come here one or two months back things would have been different dominic felt deflated monique was glancing down at the floor embarrassed at the exchange hed let her down he tried one last desperate plea surely even from the banks point of view what i am suggesting is far better than waiting on for a sale in such an uncertain market there would be no guarantee at all of a buyer materializing before the due court date entiennes face flushed slightly impatient now at dominics persistence his hands unfolded and quickly back again that im afraid will be a problem to be resolved between madame rosselot and the banks judiciaire department as ive explained to you already monsieur fornier quite clearly i thought it really is all out of my hands now dominic saw red entiennes smug attitude the pipe the glasses the hands folded over the folder all defences against confrontation with real life and humanity how to ruin lives without getting involved he felt like leaping across and burying his fist in the middle of entiennes smug little face dominic took a long breath let me explain something to you monsieur entienne hopefully equally as clearly probably you know of the rosselots or at least as much as your little folder will tell you what you might or might not know is that two years ago monique rosselot lost her only son victim of a murder i was one of the investigating officers then just a few months ago she lost her husband to suicide either he couldnt face life without his beloved son or perhaps the demand letters you kept sending him pushed him over the brink i am quite aware of the situ dominic held one hand up sharply yes yes im quite sure that you are monsieur entienne that is obvious by your attitude today entienne already uncomfortable at the path the conversation was taking glowered at the sarcasm monsieur rosselot made a loan agreement with this bank almost three years ago but he is no longer here and his commitments have fallen behind and faced with that mrs rosselot has summoned both the bravery and the good faith to come here today not only her first visit but her first proposal to this bank a very clear and straightforward offer i might add with what she has suffered with the loss of her son and her husband she has had to make a lot of adjustments with her life and all that she is asking today is that the bank make some small adjustments and meet her halfway entienne continued glowering his hands were clasped even tighter than before im sorry as ive already explained there really is nothing i can do you put everything forward to the legal department what three or four weeks ago are you really trying to tell me that you dont have the power to reverse what you enacted in the first place its not as simple as that i would have to argue a strong case to get the file back from judiciaire and approved by the loan committee such as i mentioned to you before if all the money and penalty interest were cleared almost immediately and dont you think this is a strong enough case to argue a young mother who has lost her son and her husband entienne shrugged uncomfortably its difficult to introduce such personal situations at this level with other departments behind every file theres a story some sort of tragedy oh so now were getting closer to the truth its not impossible its just awkward youre willing to sacrifice whats left of a familys life so that youre not faced with any awkwardness anything that might look bad on your future record in front of the judiciaire and the loan committee entiennes glower had turned to abject hatred he smiled tightly as with you monsieur fornier i am just a functionary as you are bound to impose the rules of french law i have to follow the rules of the bank im sorry i wish things were different no options left thought dominic hed tried being nice both gentle and harsh cajolement the candy bar and the sledgehammer entienne wasnt going to shift they left shithead dominic spluttered under his breath once they were outside im sorry i probably did more harm than good in there monique gripped his hand and pecked him on each cheek said that she was touched by how he had stood up for her dont feel so bad you did your best but in the end it had all been impotent bravado he thought none of it had done an ounce of good worse still hed probably alienated entienne so strongly that hed block any chances of later compromises over the loan if they arose as she walked away he wondered how on earth she was going to cope with this new crisis on top of all else it also struck him with a sinking feeling that hed messed up so badly she might not want to see him again fucking shits all of them especially at the agricole du vars and that entiennes a prize dry prick i could have told you that for nothing before you went to see him louis insight into the world of local banking bauriacs regular standard and poors expletive version just what dominic needed to make him feel good especially since three beers and two brandy chasers had so far failed miserably his anger at entienne burned with a vengeance and louis happily stoked with stories about banks in general and agricole du var and entienne in particular i wouldnt be too surprised if one of the du var bank directors has his eye on the property they know shes a widow wont be able to find a lump sum easily louis had seen it all before it had happened to a friend of his the director after the property ensures its pushed it into the legal department early high interest mounts up the court fees add even more in the end its an impossible mountain of cash to find the prices at auction are rock bottom and the bank director picks it up at little more than half price its a legal racket what with the high interest and the court fees my friend was left with virtually nothing from the auction dominic looked into his drink for inspiration he could see practically the same scenario rolling out ahead for monique with nothing but an outright sale of the farm to stop it whats the average time for a farm to sell in this area the markets never been worse eight ten months sometimes a lot longer people have them on the market with no takers as much as two years before giving up and taking them back off again louis returned to his diatribe about the banks in particular entiennes hypocrisy because of his current situation with a young mistress dominic was only half listening eight months four had gone already could monique make it in the four remaining dominic suddenly snapped himself back to louis conversation what was that you said what the girl or about entienne being a fucking hypocrite the girl how long has it been going on practically a year now and does his wife know how many people do know his wife certainly has no idea the rests just a few guarded whispers around the village maybe it will get back to his wife eventually maybe it wont do they have any particular meeting places or does it change each time she works at the jewellers not far away from him but she walks around the opposite block from the bank and he usually picks her up there louis leant slightly across the bar apparently they head to the lespigoulier hotel on the way to aubagne he makes the excuse of having a long lunch with clients which days mondays and thursdays the following thursday lunch time dominic turned his solex into the car park of the lespigoulier hotel he had already identified entiennes citreon from in front of the bank and sure enough it was there dominic swung the solex out of the car park and fifty yards along to the first turnoff and waited it was a small slip road and very few cars passed him probably thought that he was checking for cars speeding it was over forty minutes before entiennes car emerged dominic revved up the solex he would have to time his exit perfectly too soon and he could go under entiennes wheels entiennes car turned out was starting to pick up speed okay now dominic flew out of the slip road and into the side of entiennes car in the end his worry about being too early had made him time it slightly too late instead of sprawling across the bonnet he hit the windshield one knee smashing through the passenger window as he spun dramatically over the top of the car and down the far side the fall looked good and dominic broke it with his hands the far side but hed connected badly with the windshield one shoulder felt stiff and his nose had banged against the glass it was bleeding profusely soaking his shirt still all the better for effect he thought as he straightened up dominic feigned dizziness for the first thirty seconds as if he was having trouble orienting what had happened and where he was entienne was in shock at first before turning his attention to the girl beside him her initial hysterical screams had subsided into sobbing entienne got out slowly as dominic took out a pad and started making notes in that instant beyond the blood and dominics dishevelled appearance he recognized dominic and mouthed oh its then quickly bit his tongue and fumbled into are you all right im sorry i just didnt see you you came out of nowhere apology quickly turned to anger what on earth were you thinking of coming out suddenly like that i could ask you the same question dominic said coldly dominic noted the registration and asked entienne for the cars papers what do you mean i mean that when i looked both ways from my turning the road was clear and then you came out suddenly from nowhere and hit me but that wasnt how it happened at all it was all clear ahead of me then suddenly you shot out i didnt even see you only heard the thud as you hit me dominic grimaced well youll get the opportunity of putting your side across in court papers please entiennes face glowed red this is outrageous you know full well thats not how it happened entienne spluttered but his tone was now more hesitant and uncertain i know nothing of the sort only that youre a menace on the roads and i could have been killed im laying charges for dangerous driving and if i dont have your papers in my hand in thirty seconds ill add obstruction of justice to the charge sheet entienne scampered back to the car and dug them out of the glove compartment suddenly he was not on familiar territory not in control unprotected by his office walls bank files his pipe and glasses he was vulnerable a little flustered boy dominic was enjoying every minute he leant over menacingly as entienne passed the papers out dominic noted the details and then asked entiennes full name and address entienne enunciated the last words between clenched teeth then said i know why youre doing this and you wont get away with it i have a witness dominic looked across to the girl now dabbing at her eyes with a handkerchief trying not to smudge more eye makeup oh yes i forgot your witness of course name and address please the girl and entienne exchanged glances entiennes face was now bright puce look does she really need to be involved in all this but shes your witness monsieur entienne shes the one person who can stand up in court and support your account of the accident why on earth wouldnt you want her to be involved dominic smiled its awkward thats all entiennes hands fumbled in his lap if she didnt appear in court on my behalf what would happen i would give my account youd give yours because im an officer of the law my account would no doubt stand and youd be charged with dangerous driving and vehicular assault three year driving ban and possibly an additional three to six months jail term depends on the judge im not sure how the bank would view such a charge dominic watched each word strike home mallets of realization and then finally acceptance as entiennes head slumped in the same way that entiennes words had beaten monique into submission just days before retribution at its most divine oh and i forgot one thing even though your friend wouldnt be speaking on your behalf as a witness id still need to take her details along with the time and the hotel you were driving away from essential background for the hearing i daresay some local reporter could also be arranged to cover the court case so mademoiselle your details please entienne slowly shook his head his voice low and dejected i dont think that will be necessary his eyes lifted up only fleetingly can we come to some other arrangement im sure having gone to all this trouble you have something in mind dominic looked sharply at entienne are we talking about bending the rules now monsieur entienne the very same rules which you told me just the other day in your bank couldnt be bent yes yes we are total defeat well i suppose we could have a meeting later this afternoon in your office to discuss the relative rules of our two professions i will still need to take all the girls details but if we reach agreement my file wont be going anywhere and im sure monsieur entienne you have a similar file entienne nodded without looking up they arranged to meet at fourthirty dominic let them drive off first and on the way back to bauriac on his solex he ignored the occasional stares from passing cars curious why the gendarme was smiling with such a badly bloodied nose the new loan schedule was approved within ten days dominic even managed to tweak the final conditions to allow five years on the back money and get the penalty interest struck off entienne totally erased the judiciaire period it was as if the file had never gone there they celebrated with a bottle of champagne at louis dominic had made light of it when he told monique mentioned only that entienne had a small skeleton in his closet which he used to advantage but as the drink flowed louis couldnt resist telling the full story monique looked horrified at louis dramatic account of dominic spinning over entiennes car bonnet you shouldnt have dominic you could have been seriously hurt he basked momentarily in the glory as she gripped his arm and kissed him the third in as many weeks croignon moved in a few days later the day before taken up with moving suitcases of clothes and personal items between their homes with louis helping out with his van when they came to the room above the garage with christians clothes and toys piled on the bed she looked on awkwardly do you mind if i take them to your place put them in one of the rooms no not at all theres three bedrooms its up to you how you use them dominic was more perplexed by the fact that two years had passed and she was still clinging to the memory and not just one or two personal items the room had been left as practically a shrine he also hadnt realized till that moment that the room he would be occupying temporarily had previously been christians two weeks later monique invited him over to dinner symbols of two cultures lamb and aubergine cassoulet with couscous he brought a bottle of chateauneuf red and a pinocchio colouring book for clarisse as things mellowed over dinner she mentioned that she still felt guilty about not paying him any rent the first year and wanted to make a concession by inviting him over to dinner once every week it would also she pointed out compensate for the fact that his own cooking arrangements were far from ideal having to fit in for those first months around the croignons it was the least she could do he initially shrugged off the need for any return gesture but she was insistent and besides it was an opportunity to see her regularly he accepted with gracious reluctance the dinners were every friday night or the first free weekend night if he had friday night duty it was difficult to mark the exact time when their friendship transformed first to strong affection then finally to love for him it was probably much earlier than her at first it was just small signs a look in her eyes a smile light kisses of thanks on his cheek for the wine or presents he brought even when her eyes seemed to openly invite him he could see the hurt and pain beneath and he held back felt suddenly fearful that he might be taking advantage was reminded how damaged and frail she might still be even the night when they first made love five months after the regular dinners started couldnt be taken as the main point of transition in their relationship shed had more to drink than normal that night was more affectionate after the meal over coffee and brandy when clarisse had gone to bed she sat on his lap and kissed him said that shed like to show him what shed done to his room she led him upstairs and before opening his door asked him to close his eyes and wait a second he opened his eyes to the soft glow of five night lights burning their flickering picked out a flokati rug on the floor and ikat fabric draped on the wall above the bed as his eyes adjusted she kissed him and they tumbled onto the bed his mumbled its beautiful quickly lost she broke off only to ask him to close his eyes again and when she prompted him to open them she was standing at the foot of the bed naked mocha and cream skin beneath the soft candlelight she leant across and started taking off his clothes planting soft butterfly kisses on his skin then finally rolled her body on top of his her body slithered easily against him glistening with the scented oil shed applied a slow and sensuous movement until he was fully aroused their lovemaking was slow and gentle at first gradually becoming more urgent her eyes were deep and soulful and he traced their contour the gentle almond slant at their corner running the same finger slowly down her cheek and her neck but there was something else in her eyes beyond the joy and abandon a faint flicker of ghosts from the past that seemed to be holding her back that the sudden urgency of her frenzy was as much to exorcize herself of them as to lose herself in joyous oblivion a race between the two and as his own climax came his head lolling breathlessly to one side the image of the night lights and the soft tears of ecstasy on her cheeks reminded him again of the hospital of her long nightly vigils praying that christian might live some look in his eye or perhaps the new tension she felt in his body made her roll away suddenly she too stared thoughtfully at the nightlights one finger at her lips in contemplation im sorry she murmured later that night back with the croignons in christians old room the wind rose steadily dominic could hear it rustling through the trees and the field at the back of the house he thought of the day that they were down by the river and the wind was high the gendarmes placed like markers in the field uncomfortable ghostly reminders it took him a while to get to sleep for the next three weeks monique came up with an excuse for each of their regular dinner dates on the fourth she phoned and said that she wanted him to come over but that it should be with them just as good friends as it was before im sorry i shouldnt have done what i did that night i wasnt ready and it wasnt fair on you id perfectly understand if you didnt want to see me again he came over it was a lesson that the ghosts from her past would sometimes stand between them and perhaps if hed read the signals deeply hed have realized that that would always be the case part of her heart her soul would forever be buried with christian and jeanluc it was another three months before they became lovers again monique promised that this time she wouldnt leave his bed but over the coming months as spring arrived there would still be times when she felt she just couldnt she would suddenly be cocooned again in the past the ghosts and memories ripping her apart and she would feel that she had nothing to give to the present to him and clarisse dominic was always understanding when those times came would phone her the next day to see if she was better her grey moods usually didnt last long a few days at most as the summer arrived they took to eating outside at night on the back patio monique had also found a babysitter nearby and they started to go out more he took her to see lawrence of arabia and they held hands and kissed in the back row like two teenagers on her birthday he took her to a new restaurant in cannes hed discovered pierre tetre it was on a narrow lane full of restaurants that meandered gently down to cannes harbour with small candlelit tables on each staged terrace monique found the atmosphere magical it was late summer when he finally proposed she looked concerned she reminded him not only that she had a daughter but the scars the past had left on her part of her heart might always be dragged back there could he live with that he said that he could but deep down he was thinking that she would gradually improve he had seen marked improvement already in the past months until finally the ghosts and the pain of her memories faded to insignificance or went completely and he felt very close to clarisse with gifts every few visits and occasional hugs if he was still some way from becoming a surrogate father he was at least a favourite uncle monique made him wait two months before she answered to be sure that any impulsiveness on his part had mellowed they were married the next february louis was best man and looked comical in a dress suit the small reception was also held at louis and he had trouble totally escaping from his proprietary role occasionally barking orders at the waiters harrault and levacher were the only ones present from the gendarmerie and dominic was right the ghosts from the past did subside until their first born a son apart from it being an horrific breach birth which could have cost moniques and the babys life dominic should have read the warnings when she first mentioned during pregnancy that she hoped for a boy the second sign that she might see it somehow as a replacement for christian was when she asked if it was a boy if they could call him yves christians middle name he began to wish that it was a girl purely to avoid any possible complications a gain to replace a past loss a macabre tangle of emotions that could only lead to problems but in the end he resigned himself to fate consoled himself that if it was a boy and somehow managed to bury moniques reliance on the past that in an obscure way it might be a godsend he didnt know how wrong he would be monique didnt tell him about the dream until two months after the birth that moments after urging the nurses that shed like her husband by her side when she was fully under the anaesthetic and the doctors were fighting to save her life shed seen christian in the dream they were dining at pierre tetre dominic had taken her there the night shed announced she was pregnant perhaps that was what had made the connection he thought she saw christian in the distance as she looked up the street as she left the table and walked towards christian the other people and the tables in the street seemed to fade into the background only the steps and the candlelight from the tables remained prominent guide lights marking the path to the solitary figure of christian ahead the harbour a misty silhouette far behind her shed seen his face clearly seen the gentle tears in his clear green eyes as she came closer she thought she heard him say its all right its all right but it was barely a whisper and in that moment she had reached out to touch him though their hands never quite connected shed awoken then a nurse was leaning over and telling her that everything was all right you have a little boy she hadnt mentioned the dream earlier she explained because at the time the joy of having yves had consumed all else for the first few years her absorption with yves seemed natural the love and affection of a doting mother to her newborn child but as the years progressed he began to notice how fearful and protective she was it became an obsession never letting yves out of her sight ensuring that there was never an unguarded moment in his life dominic railed against it it wasnt a natural childhood he argued yves was unable to have any freedom could not play with his friends out of sight of her for any length of time monique promised repeatedly that she would change but any easing in her protectiveness was minimal the only thing to help was the birth of gerome a few years later though mainly when gerome was old enough to play with yves keep him company they could partly watch and protect each other her intense protectiveness became a recurring argument through their years together she was well aware that it was a fault but i could never again go through the trauma of losing a child she and jeanluc partly blamed themselves for christians death felt theyd allowed him too much freedom hed been let loose to play in the fields or with friends most days only natural dominic supported he himself had enjoyed such a childhood in louviers she had stifled yves terribly and now gerome too was heavily under her protective wing in turn moniques advice with his career was equally as incisive drawing it out of him that hed only stayed in bauriac because of his ailing mother she pushed him to take a transfer a year after they were married careerwise he was stagnating in bauriac at heart part of him had recognized that fact but hed become numbed into acceptance by routine it had taken monique to bring it to the surface it was also moniques encouragement that led him to take his inspectorate exams not long after and she had advised on many of his career moves since her style was gentle no more than a series of questions so that in the end he felt he had all but arrived at the decision himself it was ironic dominic thought she had such intuitive views about his career in the same way that he could see the errors she was making as a mother a clear picture only gained by being detached from the problem taking an overview but in the case of yves he wished hed been wrong in his teens came the backlash effect of moniques protectiveness at fifteen he left home and got in with the wrong crowd he started off with sporadic promotional work for a chain of clubs and discotheques handing out cards on street corners he would turn up at the clubs late evening and started drinking heavily peppered later with some drugs marijuana at first then cocaine he started freebasing and took extra work as a drugs packet runner to some of the clubs to pay for his habit often he was paid half in cash half in cocaine dominic picked him up one night after one of the clubs had been raided yves had been lost to them for almost two years throughout monique had been inconsolable where had she gone wrong shed done everything to shield him to guide him on the right path but still hed drifted away not once did dominic say i told you so suggest that her obsessive protectiveness might have caused the problem made yves crave freedom and rebel dominic kept yves name clear of any charge sheets but added a condition that he remain with them at least six months and attempt to dry out before deciding what he wanted to do with his life in the end he stayed ten months a painful period of adjustment and regular visits to a drugs counsellor before embarking on his national service he joined the french navy the two years of discipline combined with the frisson of travel broadened yves outlook he came back a changed person and enrolled for another year taking a special course in maritime communications when he returned he joined the national police in marseille as a sergeant history was repeating itself within two years he was covering the vieux port area attached to narcotics his maritime communications background and his knowledge of the drugs trade was invaluable in an area where most shipments came in by sea gerome was at nice university studying pure maths with a second in it software architecture hoping later for a career in computer programming he had never been a problem monique had long ago ceased to view either of them as any form of replacement for christian but she still worried about yves especially with his current work that one day he might swing open the wrong warehouse door to face a milieu gun in the shadows throughout the years of arguing against her unreasonable protectiveness a recurring fear for dominic had been that one day he might be wrong that having urged her to loosen the reigns told her not to worry nothing would happen against all odds it might hed often contemplated how hed face her given such a circumstance for it to happen twice and him feel that he was partly to blame it was unthinkable when marinella calvans call caught up with dominic in lyon yves was a di still stationed in marseille and gerome was working for a computer company in sophia antipolis clarisse was married with three children two girls and a boy and lived with her husband a sales manager for an agricultural feed company near ales dominic maintained an apartment for himself and monique in lyon but six years ago had bought a four bedroom farmhouse just north of vidauban only thirtyfive kilometres from taragnon gerome stayed there and commuted to work and they came down at least every other weekend some weekends yves would also join them and clarisse and her family would visit every few months the words echoed in his mind yes i do know someone who could verify christian rosselots background but apart from the ghosts that might be awoken in moniques mind he had also buried his own secrets through the years hed never told monique that he had doubted machanauds guilt since the light sentence had been so controversial and monique felt that it was partly at the root of jeanlucs suicide it would have been insensitive and mocking it would have hinted that jeanlucs suicide was completely in vain rather than just misguided he couldnt do that to her for the same reason when years later he discovered just how long machanaud had been incarcerated fourteen years between prison and mental institutions he didnt tell monique the fact that jeanluc could have smiled from his grave because machanaud had received just punishment would have been scant compensation the overriding image would be that his suicide had been pointless marinella calvan said that she would send over a tape and accompanying transcript by messenger it would be with him early tomorrow his first reaction was that it was all nonsense would probably all quickly evaporate to no avail though he wondered if his underlying curiosity was because of the terrible injustice he suspected might have been wielded against machanaud compounded by his own guilt at discovering later too late the severity of that injustice but how many ghosts and secrets from the past would he need to trade to discover the truth twentyeight limoges may alain duclos picked up the smoked salmon on a small octagonal wedge of bread and popped it in his mouth the waiter paused to see if hed choose another caviar prawns or pate with chives duclos just nodded and the waiter moved on rpr celebrations for victory at the local elections the last bash two years ago had been held in a grand downtown civic hall replete with marble columns ornate chandeliers and filigreed plaster ceilings but parking had been atrocious so theyd opted for a modern hotel function room on the edge of town the waiters with their liveried costumes and silver trays looked somehow out of place in this room with its low ceilings and suffused fluorescent lighting for the first forty minutes of the reception duclos had done little more but nod like a toy dog on a cars back shelf at the incessant chain of congratulations thank you im so glad that you could make it and thank you for your support during our campaign once or twice hed even made the mistake of asking and hows business to be caught up in endless tales of corporate woe that invariably ended perhaps there might be some influence you could bring to bear trite smiles in response ill see what i can do but thought assholes even if he could affect entire industry sectors at the local level invariably an opposing sector would start whinging and lobbying just smile convince them theyre your friends look concerned really really concerned and if pressed tell them how theirs is an industry and an issue with the highest possible priority on your list but in the end do fuck all it was safer less friends and votes were lost keeping the statusquo as it was he was glad now of a moment alone at last a chance to survey the room fully rather than just surreptitious sweeps between nods and smiles at some fawning local businessman or chamber of commerce representative his wife was not far away just visible beyond a small group towards the bar talking to one of his main female pr aides friends from before they were married when the two girls worked together in his offices shed made few friends since eighteen months of marriage no euphoria or bliss that had certainly never even been expected by him and if hed troubled to ask possibly her too just convenient useful cut the right image for the electorate they looked good together and he had become increasingly aware that as he approached his midforties and still wasnt married questions were beginning to get asked shed been working in his offices almost fifteen months before he really noticed her and started asking about her before hed been too preoccupied with his problems with chapeau to think about anything else her application file also helped provide some background betina canadet thirtytwo years old single studied and gained a degree in social economics from the sorbonne worked mainly in civic offices in rouen where her family originally lived joined the rpr in and applied to the limoges party offices in late when her family moved to the area the rest he discovered from one of his main aides thierry what the ice maiden duclos was intrigued thierry was a mine of information on office gossip and politics two people in the office had already tried their luck and struck out thierry covered the obvious quickly no she wasnt a lesbian and certainly one of the men shed liked went out with him for three months before coming clean with her problem she just didnt like sex tragic case victim of a date rape in her early twenties it was many years afterwards before she could even bear to be in the company of men let alone start feeling comfortable with them or god forbid actually touching them had to give her time be gentle with her the relationship only lasted another six weeks who has time to spend as an emotional counsellor in the hope that after a year or so she might just might come in from the cold maybe she never will who knows duclos started dating her a month later what is this the ultimate challenge thierry teased him its not enough just to swing the electorate now the challenge is the ice maiden see if you can succeed where all others have failed duclos droll smile in return hinted that the north pole had already been conquered all it took was the right man to hit the defrost button some have it some dont in reality it was a relationship built almost entirely on her veneration of his political stature and power and his patience with her sexual and emotional instability she had never met anyone so patient and understanding he looked across at her now and she gave him a tight little smile shed hardly changed in the two years somewhere between twiggy and piaf with large blue eyes that pleaded help me save me im frail it was far from love it had been like taking some frightened little deer in from the forest making her feel comfortable and secure hed become her protection from the world outside from all those nasty grabbing men and their demands yet she carried guilt too was worried that she wasnt pleasing him the way she should despite his countless reassurances he didnt see her like that she shouldnt worry he loved her for her soul her character her kindness and vulnerability the sex was far less important when she was ready it was okay with him she would literally be tearful at his patience his understanding and between her summoning the effort the work that made him tired or him pleading that he felt uncomfortable because he sensed she was forcing herself just for him they made love at best once every other month he could manage that and from certain angles she even had a slight boyish quality perhaps that was what had made him first notice her and to cap it all his work colleagues were slightly in awe at his sexual prowess in melting the ice maiden succeeding where they had failed bringing out the woman in her his only worry was that one day she would thaw out she would look at him with those big eyes suddenly brimming with passion rather than vulnerability and uncertainty that as she became more insistent and demanding and he was still reluctant making excuses she would finally guess his secret the lie would be out he shook off a faint shiver that wasnt now or even in the near future hopefully never and hed had three years now out of the shadow of chapeau no calls or demands in the dead of night the constant bleeding him dry chapeaus goading smile and sly humour three years it felt as if ankle chains and a yoke had suddenly been removed hed never known such freedom or happiness he looked back towards his wife and smiled muffled sounds of the city faint drone of traffic the occasional car horn beeping somewhere in the distance a siren wailing dominic was more intent on the words on the tape that drifted through the half open door into the hallway madame arnand usually gives me some pan chocolat if her husband isnt there how many times a week do you call by there maybe two or three times but sometimes hes there and she doesnt give me any just winks when hes not looking as if to say next time and nods sideways madame arnand explained once that he was too mean shed get into trouble if she gave it away while he was there hed rather feed it to the chickens or let it rot and the boulangerie is on your way from school to the farm yes its only a few hundred metres from the school i have to walk almost another half kilometre to the farm but usually i have a friend with me monique was twothirds of the way through listening to the tape sent by calvan dominic had played it twice as soon as it arrived at the station then replayed some selected segments except for the main obvious details little of it meant anything to him and it struck him listening to the tape how little hed really known about christian hed dealt with the investigation typed up endless reports about the attack and murder had eaten slept and dreamt little but the case for months but really at heart he had known little or nothing about the boy hed been dealing with his death not his life christians life had taken up ten whole years of his wifes existence from her midteens to midtwenties and as he became immersed in the voice on the tape he realized how little he knew about those ten years ridiculous pathetic married to the same woman for thirty years and yet whole segments of her life were still strange to him and through the years hed never asked always thought it would be too painful too awkward something to be swept away and relegated to the past to history where it belonged yet this ten year old boy this boy whose last hours on earth he knew everything about every last shocking gory detail yet whose life was a complete void to him a tome of blank pages had always been with them at the birth of their first son yves at geromes birth at the two christenings at the moments they might drive past a field and monique would survey the shifting wheat thoughtfully at her gaze across a candlelit dinner table when she would suddenly focus on the flickering flame and he would be lost beyond it her eyes would water and he knew in that moment that the memory had drifted back each time it showed in her eyes as the years were stripped away a look burdened with pain and anguish yet with just a dash of joy and irony a thick emotional soup sieved through misty veils of time then finally serenity acceptance mellowing the sorrow a look that said of course i remember how could i forget sad lost memories the few pathetic tokens remaining of the love that was a love that dominic had never witnessed never been party to never asked about never been able to put flesh and blood and words and actions to except those looks in his wifes eyes through the years sudden threatening grey clouds that invariably as quickly drifted away until the tape and he thought oh god god could that really be the voice substance suddenly put to the ghost the memory that had lurked in the shadows of his life the past thirty years or was it just a hoax conflicting emotions wrenched at his gut made him feel empty inside yet strangely excited at the same time taragnon the village shops the farm at least those parts seemed accurate playing rewinding playing again agonizing over small nuances and phrases before finally settling back how could he be sure how could he possibly know he hardly knew anything about the boy he was nothing but a shadow a shadow of memory that only flickered alive again now and then in his wifes eyes but at least hed answered the main question it seemed real enough to be given a hearing by monique the main details were accurate it wasnt some ridiculous account which had fallen at the first hurdle over inaccurate village descriptions or the boy heading in the wrong direction back to the farm dominic wondered if deep down that was what hed hoped for something that meant he could pack the tape back to london without even troubling monique consign it back to history where hed so far safely corralled everything by not asking questions by not raising the issue by never mentioning the police investigation or the trial and its aftermath jeanluc or machanaud safe but another part of him wanted desperately for it to be real for what to know what really happened in to assuage his own guilt over machanaud was that the tradeoff satisfying his own guilt at the expense of moniques peace of mind reawakening the ghosts after all these years bringing the pain and shadows back to her eyes he sweated and agonized over the tape as it played was tempted to rip it out and sent it back at one point before the weight of detail and the small lost voice got to him grabbed hard at his insides and fired an intense burning curiosity he wanted to know he wanted desperately to know if it was real and that was when he started convincing himself that he was doing it equally for monique she would want to know too how would she feel if she discovered that hed covered up that hed sent the tape back without even letting her hear it to protect her from the horrors of memories past she would see only that she had been robbed of the opportunity of some link with her long lost son however tenuous and remote too many buried secrets it would be almost as bad as staying silent not speaking out in court on behalf of machanaud almost the tape was rewinding a button clicked a segment was being played over again when we finally did take the rubber ring to the beach it was so big i almost fell through the hole where was that nartelle beach near st maxime when hed first handed the tape to monique shed showered him with a deluge of questions where when who which psychiatrists hed answered mainly with stock terminology from marinella calvan hed called her back shortly after the first playing to clarify key points past life regressions university of virginia started as a standard psychiatric session young english boy of a similar age to christians lost both his parents in a car accident xenoglossy use of a foreign language unknown to the main subject the regional patois has already been authenticated but now they need to know about the main details on the tape as he spoke he could see monique become increasingly perplexed and confused staring at the tape blankly and in the end his shoulders slumped in exasperation he held his arms out look i know it sounds strange i have no idea if its real or just a hoax either but details of the village are at least accurate play the tape and lets talk afterwards well go into the details and background then if necessary you can phone this woman in england yourself let her explain everything directly click stop rewind click again the tyre was quite big as if it belonged to a van or truck my friend and me decided to pick it up and roll it home it took two of us to roll it home what was your friends name gregoire and he went to the same school yes a pause the boy swallowing his throat clearing when we finally got it home to the farm the inner tube only had one puncture my father was able to fix it easily so that we could take it to the beach one day i could use it as a big rubber ring dominic hovered halfway between the hallway and the kitchen listening he wanted to leave monique alone while she listened to the tape alone with her thoughts and emotions hadnt wanted to see the expression on her face or look on expectantly like some eager schoolboy waiting for exam results so so hed made an excuse about making a snack in the kitchen had got as far as spotting some brie in the fridge and some rye biscuits in the biscuit tin but had been drawn back into the hallway by the sound of the tape playing before putting the two together click stop rewind play the camps one of my favourite places i built it against the back of a stone wall in the field at the back of the house how far away from the house is it a hundred metres or so from there i can clearly see the back courtyard and the front door see if anyone ring ring ring ring the sudden loud jangling of the telephone in the hallway crashed abruptly into dominics thoughts made him jump he suddenly remembered hed asked to be phoned at home for any news from the hospital on the police officer one was out of danger but the other was still critical he picked it up nodding numbly to the first words his mind still on the tape and his wife i see i see when was this i see crippled you say he realized his voice sounded bland detached disinterested he injected more enthusiasm when will they know for sure the damage done by the shattered vertebrae can see my mother working in the kitchen and i know then that its time to come in i know if my father is in the garage because he always has the light on theres no windows theyre doing more xrays now then as soon as they have those back apparently theyre scheduling another operation they should know more soon after that i see so how long six hours twelve ten or twelve probably i doubt well know much more till tomorrow morning i always helped her if i could i missed her so much later as i did my parents i see dominics skin bristled distracted trying to take in the two voices together but dont expect any miracles theyre pretty sure he wont get the use of his legs back they just dont know yet how bad the rest might be and i remembered thinking my father my father why didnt he come and try to find me i understand scant relief no tricolours on coffins but a home visit nevertheless a hospital visit a meeting with his wife and close relatives stumbling condolences kept thinking how they couldnt face that id become lost from them that id somehow let them down their sorrow my mothers face so sadso so sad her click stop silence dominic listened out for the machine clicking again but there was nothing monique had obviously finished with the tape thats all theres left to know now whether the rest of his body will also be affected arms and upper body i see i understand attention completely gone now only one thing he wanted to know lets talk again tomorrow morning hopefully more will be known then dominic rang off walking back into the lounge to confront monique despite his wish not to pressure her or make her feel awkward in any way his impatience he was sure came through he probably did look like a schoolboy anxious for his exam results not saying anything but his eyes saying it all and thinking so so monique didnt answer for a moment looked down and away before finally lifting her gaze to speak but the words themselves were secondary he had already read it in her eyes the storm clouds the grey shadows had returned and this time he feared that they would take far far longer to drift away twentynine marseille october marc jaumard brother of tomas jaumard alias chapeau would the aforementioned or anyone with knowledge of the aforementioned or his current whereabouts please contact as a matter of urgency the offices of fourcot amp gauthereau rue andre isaia marseille tel marcelle gauthereau checked the small entry in the personal column of la provencal as he had done every six months for the past three and a half years he wondered why he bothered sometimes the copy was exactly the same as the first entry they were obviously just printing from the first plate still he found himself mechanically checking the address and phone number particularly the phone number then he would consider its position on the page see if it was placed well and didnt get lost too much among the heavier box adverts and the mass of pleas for instant romance the envelope had been signed sealed and left with the notary for six years now he had been the lawyer witnessing on behalf of his client tomas jaumard and it had also fallen to him to carry out jaumards instructions regarding the envelope in the event of his death tomass brother marc was to be notified and he marcelle gauthereau would then accompany marc to the notarys office where upon due presentation of identification and signing of a receipt marc would be handed the envelope left by his brother simple except that when he originally sent out the notification marc jaumard had moved his letter was returned with no forwarding address gauthereau sent a clerk by the building a week later to discover that marc had gone back to sea but not with his old company after phoning his old company and another number they recommended the trail petered out with a past work colleague and an old flat mate the only faint light that could be thrown on his whereabouts was that he might have joined up with a merchant company sailing out of genoa perhaps he maintains a place there when hes back on shore there were still some funds from the retainer tomas jaumard had left him to execute his will the will simply couldnt be executed without marc jaumard no other relatives were named gauthereau started placing the adverts one every six months in marseille one a year in a genoa paper in italian there was enough cash to cover a total of twelve insertions gauthereau was intrigued what might be in the envelope names dates and vital contacts drug routes and stashes details of chapeaus account in switzerland perhaps could he have earned that much as a milieu button man la provencal had peppered the account of his death with his nickname they seemed to all have nicknames tomi the wall boisset jaques tomcat imbert pierre the priest cattaneo somehow added to the mystique and fear chapeau the newspapers hadnt explained nor had he ever asked getting through their few brief business meetings had been torturous enough hed always found himself clockwatching towards the end uneasy under jaumards slow fish eye without adding superfluous questions two more insertions to go in marseille one in genoa before the retainer was finished after that the envelope would stay gathering dust in the notarys office with little chance of anyone knowing its contents session marinella calvan listened to lambournes voice in the background as he induced eyran capel into hypnosis the three questions dominic fornier wanted asked were on a piece of paper before her as before lambourne would spend the first ten minutes or so getting eyran comfortable and asking general everyday questions then would slowly regress eyran back and draw out gigio then philippe would take over in french and marinella would tap out her first question on the screen though forniers english was good the questions had originally been in french and philippe had translated she would start with her own questions first get christian rosselot settled more naturally into the mood and period then lead into forniers questions though fornier was sat at the back of the room just as a casual observer his presence created an added tension was it because of what he represented someone who had been close to had feelings for christian rosselot what was before just a detached voice was suddenly tangible real a young boy who people once cared about loved just as her with sebastian forniers presence and the background hed explained with his wife the boys mother brought it all suddenly home to her or was her concern that the voice and the details wouldnt stand up as real and in a few questions time she would know nothing left but to pack her bags and fly back to virginia that evening another disappointment perhaps it was just the number of them cramped in the small room hanging on each word of a young boy long since dead each laboured syllable not speaking themselves subduing even the faintest cough or sigh and all them except philippe with different hopes and ambitions of what might be gained from the session the differing aims of her and lambourne had been underlined acutely at their meeting over dinner the night before a discussion previously delayed it seemed pointless to air their respective views on the link between eyran and christian until they knew whether the regression was real fornier had called the previous morning and told them that the details on the tape seemed accurate both to him and his wife but there were a few extra questions to be totally sure these are more personal things which only christian would know david lambourne was particularly anxious after his recent conversation with stuart capel eyran is still having his dreams though not as intensely or frequently as before at most maybe one every other week but stuart capel is asking some pretty pointed questions about how we think putting an explanation to this regression will help eyran does gigio still feature as prominently in them marinella asked maybe not quite as much hes only in half of the dreams but eyran claims to be equally as distressed and frightened with gigio not there he doesnt have a friend to keep him company face the dangers and pitfalls alongside him or lead him astray lead him into danger lambourne shrugged the point is stuart capel is starting to question our exploration of the link between the two boys suggesting that it might not be helping i see amateur armchair analysis all they needed to add to the already contrasted principles between herself and lambourne the chasm between standard psychiatry and parapsychology with lambournes brief dabbling with plt as a rickety rope bridge between the two and in addition fornier was now asking oddlyangled questions fornier had seemed particularly curious if more accurate descriptions around the time of the murder might be gained beyond the sketchy and fractured details on the tape marinella explained that as fornier had no doubt gauged from the reaction on the tape it was an area which obviously disturbed christian the most and had therefore been almost totally blotted out as a result it would probably be one of the hardest areas in which to gain more information why fornier brushed it aside with an offhand nothing in particular but his tone and the way hed been hanging on her answer made marinella wonder they discussed briefly some of the general circumstances surrounding the murder sexual assault before the final attack blunt instrument probably a rock wheat field by a river coma for five days wheat field lambourne held the view that the coma and even the brief fiftyfour second period of death had fired the connection between the two boys why eyran had no previous recall of gigiochristian until after then it was a major physical event that linked both lives object loss opened the door was a shared emotional experience but the coma was the shared physical experience to swing it wide marinella agreed but felt that subliminally the link had been there long before eyran had a sense of deja vu with the wheat field when they first moved to the house in england he didnt dream of those fields purely due to fond memories of england or that he truly feels he might find his parents there but because of christian eyran knows deep down hes lost his parents on a californian highway whether he accepts it or not but the wheat field is clearly christian rosselot territory its christian who cant accept separation from his parents eyrans merely aboard for the ride lambourne shook his head he disagreed their respective views started to head in different directions lambourne threw at her the obvious that christians parents hadnt featured in any of the dreams eyrans had and that both boys focused only on finding eyrans parents wheareas she felt this theory supported that of the two boys battling with nonacceptance of loss christians was the strongest in his case it had been pushed further away eyrans had been tackled headon in practically every dream but with lambournes reluctance to accept her view at one point shed blurted out whats wrong are you afraid that by accepting the theory it pushes it further away from what you know best conventional analysis and immediately regretted it saw clearly that shed hit a raw nerve it threw too stark a spotlight on what they both knew as soon as gigio had been identified as christian rosselot a tangible past existence rather than a protective figment of eyrans psyche most of lambournes conventional theories went out of the window this was her territory past life regression versus freud the irreconcilable divide between psychiatrists and parapsychologists psychiatrists branding them hardly better than tribal witchdoctors and parapsychologists retaliating by labelling psychiatrists as too conventional and myopic far too many of hers and donaldsons critics through the years had been conventionalists but it was unfair to start taking it out now purely on lambourne she softened quickly with are you afraid that if im right i might be camping out in your office a bit longer lambourne raised his glass and smiled now that as you know i would never complain about perhaps it was her she was drawing the lines of divide too simplistically she dealt with the past lambourne with the present each of them sought the explanation where their knowledge was strongest but lambournes smile and comment brought uncomfortably close what shed feared at the outset that their views were poles apart and lambourne had only picked up the phone because he was suddenly out of his depth and it was a good excuse to see her again he liked her company but as soon as that novelty wore off the differences would start to show again it hadnt taken long she thought eight days but she was glad nevertheless that hed called she could be only three questions away from compiling one of the strongest case studies and papers of her career for that david lambourne could smile and ingratiate her as much as he pleased she brought her attention back to the session as david lambournes voice trailed off and he nodded towards her philippe leaned forward and she tapped out the first question on the pc screen dominic wasnt sure of the precise moment when the thought first struck him of being able to use information from the tapes to reexamine the details surrounding christian rosselots murder the first initial thoughts shortly after the first call from marinella calvan had been so fleeting and indistinct hed hardly paid it attention possibly a hoax obscure or unsubstantiated information discarded after the second hurdle with still the hurdles of insufficient detail to support a renewed investigation and legal complexities in the far distance and only paid scant consideration that consideration only arrived full force after seeing moniques reaction to the tape but after his last conversation with marinella calvan those hurdles appeared suddenly to have been raised and were now almost insurmountable due to it being an area which has obviously disturbed christian the most the murder has been largely blotted out details would be difficult to gain hed replayed those segments of tape the most and then there was a bright light so bright i couldnt see anything and the field i recognized it what could have caused a sudden blinding light it was a bright sunny day perhaps christian had been heavily concealed in bushes down the river bank then had suddenly emerged into the brightness of the lane and the wheat field or perhaps hed been blindfolded as well as tied up and it had suddenly been taken off there had also been an earlier reference to the light hurting his eyes not long before he was face down on the ground the sheaves were against the side of my face my own breathing against it all i could hear nothing else nothing the voice trailed off as breathing became heavier more sporadic i struggled to look back but couldnt couldnt i i after that the voice became increasingly catatonic and garbled philippes voice broke him quickly away it wasnt even clear if christian had fallen in the wheat or been pushed over whether hed already been struck or the blows were still to come calvan was right recall of the murder had been heavily erased dominic couldnt see how pressing on subsequent sessions would reveal anything more than the same garbled disjointed account someone with passing knowledge of the case primed by a handful of newspaper articles could have constructed a more detailed account even the few details that were fresh such as the sudden light were vague and could be interpreted any number of ways a reexamination of the case based on fresh information wasnt even a remote possibility and from a boy dead these past thirty years his voice speaking from the grave through another boy who had entered therapy because he was psychologically disturbed the first prosecutor he took it to would laugh him clean out of the room but the intense curiosity to know still nagged at him so in the end he removed that final hurdle blotted out consideration of a renewed official investigation convinced himself that he was eager to know for his own sake for the curiosity of an old police officer who wants to know the truth before he retires a final closing of the book and for machanaud or at least for philippes voice broke abruptly into his thoughts cest lete cest le mois de mai the year is nineteen sixtyone you are eight years old you worked with your father jeanluc towards the end of that month what did you help him with moniques first question dominic looked on expectantly felt his mouth dry with anticipation the atmosphere tense in the small room a frown a creasing of the boys brow as if he was scanning frantically back through images and memories long past the boy looked very different to how he remembered christian wavy light brown hair a few freckles across the bridge of his nose his eyes pale brown christians hair had been darker and curlier his skin tone olive his eyes a piercing green it was difficult to relate the two the thought lines in his forehead slowly eased we were clearing some long grass from the grapevines my father had planted at the beginning of the year marinella picked up on the frown wondered if eyran was thrown by the questions being suddenly more specific rather than the very generalized questions of the last session and what happened while you were helping your father in the field faint lines returned uncertainty with the question after a moment it was very hot i er i became worried at one point that i wasnt being of much help my father was working very fast i wasnt keeping up with him very well but something happened that day to make you finally stop working philippe prompted what was it gradual realization the lines easing again i was stung by a bee a pause marinella tapping at the keyboard philippe was about to prompt when eyran continued but my mother didnt have a plaster or any antiseptic she applied some vinegar then some baking powder on cotton wool it took out a lot of the sting she said that it was something shed learnt from her mother dominic felt the back of his neck tingle when hed gone through the questions with monique shed mentioned christian helping jeanluc and getting stung by a bee her applying vinegar and baking soda because they had no antiseptic dominic shivered involuntarily as the tingle spread down through his body it was christians voice there remained little doubt listening first hand was dramatically different to just the detached voice on the tape he thought seeing the small face struggling with the thoughts and images the brow knitted tongue gently moistening his lips as the words were finally found the words of another boy from another era the description of christian and jeanluc working side by side in the fields father and son both dead now these past thirty years cut a powerful and poignant image dominics hand clenched emotions of sadness and nostalgia gripping him hard hed arranged to fax the transcript to monique and wait in london for her to answer if her response was positive he wanted to stay to talk with marinella calvan in more depth but if little additional information surrounding the murder could be gained what would be the point the second question was about a game of boules in the village square one sunday christian was nine it was only a couple of months after his birthday philippe pinpointed the day christian had gone with jeanluc to watch the village boules games on several occasions but this particular sunday something had occurred there was an accident eyrans eyes flickered the right image finally falling into place nothing serious but two cars going around the square one went into the other the two drivers both men were very angry shouting loudly at each other most of the men playing were distracted it looked like any minute a fight might break out and what happened then eyran had settled into the rhythm of the more specific narrowly targeted questions pauses were now less marked one of the players alguine when he thought that everyone was looking towards the road moved to stand by his own boule then nudged it closer to the cochonnet with one foot what did you do looking around i realized that nobody had noticed but me alguine had moved quickly away from his boule so i moved gradually towards it and as the other players attention drifted back i looked down suddenly and apologized sorry i must have kicked this boule while i was looking at the accident ill put it back where it was i could see alguine glaring at me but he said nothing later when i told my father he couldnt stop laughing jeanluc had told monique dominic reflected then in turn monique had told him just the other day when shed prepared the questions batons passed down through the years a few faint brush strokes depicting an era of moniques life previously strange to him thirty years machanaud had died over ten years ago fourteen years in prison only six years of freedom in between a handful of twilight years to swill back some eau de vies and spin out his long forgotten glory days in the resistance poach a last few rivers rough justice if four years ago he hadnt bumped into molet machanauds lawyer in the recess halls at the lyon palais de justice he might never have known molet was there on a hearing for a nicebased client they both recognized each other straightaway but it took some prompting from dominic for molet to finally recall from where and when after some initial pleasantries they turned to the subject of machanaud molet did most of the talking while dominic registered in turn surprise guilt and finally outrage molet obviously read the guilt because he commented that he himself had not realized machanaud was still being held under psychiatric care until year eleven i thought he would have been released ages ago but it still took three years to press for his release there was a review only once a year molet went on to describe perrimonds undue influence with hospital governors and state psychiatrists to ensure machanaud was not released provence establishment favour swapping at the golf club or masonic lodge at its very worst each time a negative psychiatric report came through machanaud wasnt finally released until a year after perrimonds death i got a boule close to the white only a few centimetres away my father was quite surprised only one of the other players got so close and in the end they had to measure to see who had won dominic looked down it wasnt part of the prepared question sheet marinella calvan had obviously let him ramble perhaps happy of a diversion allowing christian to relax establish a more natural rhythm it was obviously also an incident he remembered with fondness the boys faint smile dominic found it vaguely disturbing a reminder of lost happiness lost years molet had looked sharply at dominic as if perhaps expecting a reciprocal disclosure of guilt but dominic said nothing what could he say that year seven had been the first time it had occurred to him to check on machanaud and when he couldnt trace molets number he had finally called perrimonds office three calls later with no reply his workload had quickly swamped his concern and on the few occasions since that the thought had arose hed convinced himself that machanaud had probably been released years back he had never troubled to pick up the phone and check too busy and even if he had explained all that molet would have questioned why he was concerned and he would have felt inclined to explain the rest his past doubts about machanauds guilt the police coverup over the car description how he had been pushed into going along with everything because of the veiled threat of being shipped off to a gendarmerie in northern france that his mother would have been left to die alone he could explain none of that so in the end he said nothing but dominic was sure that in that moment molet had seen it all in his face seen the quickly rising burden of guilt and shock as it struck him just how long machanaud had spent locked away it was on a trip to alassio we went there for a weekend and that was where you bought it yes i had some pocket money but it wasnt enough so i talked my parents into letting me have the rest of the money to buy it the third question dominic noted a trip to alassio in northern italy alassio portofino he remembered seeing a wall plaque for portofino on his first trip to the rosselots sitting in their kitchen asking questions about the last hours they saw their son how did you talk them into it i told them id read more that if i had a bedside lamp like that so nice id promise to read more every night what did the lamp look like it was made of shell in the shape of an old galleon the light inside made the shell almost luminescent and direct light would also shine through the portholes it was beautiful so in the end that promise convinced your parents to give you the extra money for it yes it did and did you keep your promise and read more yes practically every night in bed i did some reading before going to sleep dominic looked down and bit his lip he could hardly bear it he didnt realize that sitting in on the session would have such a profound affect on him christians voice all these years later telling them what a good boy hed been as if it was still somehow important to him thirty dominic was staying at the meridien waldorf half a mile from david lambournes office in holborn hed stayed over the previous night but hoped to leave without spending a second night he was therefore in hotel limbo bags packed and in a store room though still using their facilities particularly their fax it had taken philippe almost two hours to put the transcript back in its original french from the onscreen english and another fifty minutes for it to arrive by messenger at his hotel he scanned it through for any obvious errors and faxed it straight to monique in lyon hed already phoned her to expect its arrival could imagine her standing by the fax machine in his office at home practically ripping the pages out as they hummed through beep dominic waited a few minutes by the machine for a reply then telling the clerk where he would be if one came through he went to the bar downstairs and ordered an armagnac as the drink hit his stomach warming it soothing his nerves he started thinking about the transcript hed just read through the depth of detail came through even more than in the session itself the contrast to the fractured garbled descriptions around the murder itself was absolute he took another quick slug feeling it cut a warm path just his luck marvellous detail about games of boules pan chocolat and trips to alassio but little or nothing of use about the murder itself almost twenty minutes had passed when the office clerk came down with a fax dominic was on his second armagnac handwritten it read simply im convinced its christians voice nobody else could possibly know those personal details i dont know how or why but its his voice twenty minutes reading through the transcript would have taken only five minutes had monique cried caught up in a wave of emotions that stopped her putting pen to paper immediately or had she sat and laboured over the brief message she was going to send back eager not to show sentimentality or the mixture of suspicion and outrage shed voiced immediately after playing the tape that had now been boiled down to simply i dont know how or why when shed initially prepared the questions shed commented in a subdued almost acid tone i dont profess to understand the tape that has been sent but if these questions are answered correctly dominic for gods sake dont expect me to believe that this strange english boy is christian reborn some vague unexplained psychic link perhaps but thats as far as ill go dominic checked his watch timing phone through to marinella calvan and give her the news arrange a meeting forty minutes or so for the meeting itself then back to the hotel to collect his luggage and out to heathrow airport for pm it was going to be tight particularly if traffic was bad dominic wondered whether to forget the meeting with calvan just fax through moniques message a brief follow up phone call and head out to the airport when hed originally thought of a meeting it had been inspired by the foolhardy idea that he might be able to use the information to reopen the case now it was just his own curiosity but calvan would probably still insist that details surrounding the murder were too scant even that last vestige hed clung to salving whether all those years of doubt and guilt had been misplaced wouldnt be satisfied the meeting would have no purpose the decision made in a way dominic felt relieved he knocked back the last of his armagnac fine no meeting perhaps as well even if marinella calvan had complied hed have had to face monique and explain explain everything hed kept hidden the past thirty years hed been dreading that part and at least that would now also remain buried i dont understand a suspect was found charged and sentenced at least thats what came out of the few newspaper articles philippe translated for me i thought the case was closed all those years back youre right it was but there were discrepancies with the case that i was never happy with marinella was staring sharply at him still getting to grips with his suggestion of using information from the session to reopen the murder investigation discrepancies what could he say to this woman he hardly knew that hed been pressganged into joining a coverup so that he could stay with his dying mother the resultant years of guilt redoubling when hed learned how long a possibly innocent man had spent imprisoned yet proving machanauds innocence would only heighten that guilt and then his wife would know his part in the coverup and that her last husbands suicide had been in vain marinella calvans eyebrow would merely arch more acutely what did he want out of it all perhaps proving machanauds guilt closing the door once and for all on that chink of doubt in the end the only other useful thing he could find to say was i was very young then merely assisting in the investigation i had very little influence on the way it was conducted to me this is like a second chance how many of us really get a second chance second chance the poignancy of the phrase stung marinella for a second i can appreciate how much you would like to get to the truth even after all these years if i can i would love to help but youve listened to the tape of that first session when we stumbled on those final moments of the murder eyrans almost catatonic apart from the obvious risk of dragging him back through recall of the murder i just dont think well gain anything of any help most of it has been pushed away he doesnt want to think about it clatter of cutlery from two tables away a waitress with an australian accent talking to one of her colleagues dominic was distracted briefly when hed phoned at four oclock and spoken to marinella david lambourne had just started a fresh session hed mentioned how tight he was for time with his flight out and they arranged to meet twenty minutes later at cafe opera in covent garden detail the contrast between the depth of detail in the transcript and the vague garbled accounts surrounding the murder was what first gave dominic the clue what made him suddenly phone marinella calvan and arrange the meeting christian expanded detail was stronger relating stories where he felt more relaxed at ease this in turn explained why the murder account was so vague and fractured but forty minutes to an hour earlier when christian first met his murderer before either of the sexual attacks before christian even realized he might be in danger he would have been more relaxed at ease now explaining these thoughts to marinella calvan words he had already spun over in his mind on the way to the cafe he watched her expression closely if nothing else he would hopefully be able to give a clear accurate account of those moments the moments when he first met his murderer a chink of acceptance halfway through then something else doubt or intrigue dominic wasnt sure marinella shook her head i dont know its a possibility i suppose she felt her emotions tugged sharply an image of a young inexperienced gendarme on the edge of an investigation unable to wield any real influence yet harbouring a strong doubt nevertheless a doubt carefully tended through the years intensified and brought uncomfortably close to home by his marrying the dead boys mother like javert in les miserables never entirely giving up on the investigation until finally a generation later the opportunity arises to uncover the truth second chance wasnt that how she felt about the case a chance to prove herself after the cincinnati case and the other failures then reality hit simple and unequivocal david lambourne would never go for it let alone stuart capel unless she could build a strong case to convince them intrigue and her desire to help started to bite back but apart from forniers thumbnail account the day before to her the murder was just a chain of breathless disjointed words sifted through the decades via eyran capel tell me more about the investigation all i know so far is from the newspaper coverage and what you told us the other day the wheat field sexual assault blunt instrument and that christian was in a coma for five days before dying the man convicted what makes you doubt his guilt too circumstantial he was just a local casual farm labourer and poacher who happened to be there at the time no history of sexual assault or incidents with young boys no violence but the prosecution nevertheless built a convincing case out of that circumstance but i understand from the newspaper coverage that he wasnt convicted of murder in the end he got off with manslaughter got off with im afraid is not the most appropriate phrase given what finally happened to machanaud dominic related the sorry tale of perrimond playing favours with hospital governors and state psychiatrists machanaud ended up spending a total of fourteen years imprisoned between sips of coffee marinella intook breath sharply god thats ludicrous im sorry sounds almost like a personal vendetta and immediately wondered why she was saying sorry to fornier except that he seemed to care what had happened to machanaud it practically was dominic explained how it had quickly developed into an establishment protection case that the person he suspected was a young assistant prosecutor staying with one of the areas largest landowners a personal friend of the mayor it was unthinkable that such a person could possibly commit such an atrocity whereas machanaud was a lowlife poacher and village drunkard he was seen as a far easier target less troublesome and the weight of circumstantial evidence built up strongly against him what happened with the assistant prosecutor he was questioned only once the timing of his car being seen in a restaurant appeared to give him an alibi he went on to become a leading politician rpr candidate for limoges dominic raised his coffee cup as if saying salut and smiled now hes one of frances illustrious representatives in brussels an mep hes done very well has our dear monsieur alain duclos images of javert were back relentlessly pursuing through the decades and now a name had been attached alain duclos but marinella felt uncomfortable with dominics suddenly maudlin tone a lifetime of battling the odds against the police and the establishment and now she might let him down yet again what was she hoping for what niche to prise open the barricades she knew would confront her if she requested more sessions and machanaud what happened to him after he was finally let out he died eight years ago had only six years of freedom in between marinella grimaced her eyes flickering down slightly but she began to worry that like javert forniers pursuit of duclos might be equally unfounded if this duclos car was seen somewhere that supposedly gave him an alibi then what makes you suspect him dominic ran one finger absently down the side of his coffee cup how could he explain a look a glimmer in the eye from thirtytwo years ago something that told him duclos was nervous had something to hide or his supercilious prettyboy appearance that he looked like the type who might molest young boys calvan would just laugh at him in the same way poullain had all those years back in the end all he said was there were discrepancies with the car sightings some of the details i wasnt happy with discrepancies again his standard trench when shots fired stumbling through an account of the car sighting cover up even if marinella calvan might find sympathy with his motive of his ailing mother he was sure overall wouldnt aid his cause do you think the people who saw duclos car were lying no but machanaud said that he saw it passing on the lane while he was poaching just minutes before he left himself but he could have been lying to save his own neck yes thats what the prosecution said marinella forced a wan smile i see sorry she sensed there was more but dominic looked away awkwardly after a second they were silent the clatter of the cafe imposing whatever it was he obviously found it still worth keeping to himself after thirtytwo years if dominic fornier truly believed that more information could be gained by avoiding the murder and keeping to when christian rosselot first met his attacker then when and where all fornier had mentioned so far was forty minutes to an hour beforehand where do you think christian first met his attacker by the lane and the wheat field or somewhere else probably close by at least the supposition was that whoever he met they probably hid down by the river bank for most of the time a few cars passed on the lane if theyd stayed for any length of time in the wheat field theyd have been seen is that where the sexual assault also took place down by the river bank yes there were two assaults with a gap of anything from thirty to fifty minutes in between certainly the second took place by the lane and possibly the first close by if it was duclos not machanaud is that where you think christian met him i dont know thats one of the details i hoped further sessions might uncover faint shadows from a ceiling fan moved across the floor dominic glanced down memories of the reconstruction drifting stormclouds across the shifting white wheat machanaud admitted poaching in that same position for almost two hours that became one of the prosecutions strongest arguments if christian met someone else there machanaud would have seen them two assaults thirty to fifty minutes gap in between marinella was trying to assimilate the rest of the sequence of events get a clearer picture you realize that details regarding either of the sexual assaults would probably be equally as vague as with the murder christian has very likely blotted it out yes apart from the fact that they would have been deeply disturbing in their own right christian might have already suspected that his attacker would later kill him i understand probably the only clear detail well get as you have suggested is from when christian first met his attacker before he realized that anything might happen but that might only be a few minutes at most then youll help i dont know as i say its difficult marinella bit at her lip the possible obstacles came back full force lambournes and stuart capels reaction to the sessions suddenly becoming an appendage to a murder investigation she would be lucky to get to first base if it was just up to me fine id help but its not my colleague david lambourne has been given charge to cure eyran capels current condition and eyrans stepfather stuart probably wouldnt be too pleased knowing that eyrans course of therapy has been suddenly hijacked to head somewhere else but ill do what i can she could have added dont hold your breath but dominics shoulders had already slumped the eagerness in his eyes suddenly dulled she studied his face for a moment the dark hair greying heavily at the sides the enticing almost imperceptible slant at the corner of his eyes laughter lines as hed first greeted her now etching the pain of those long years it couldnt have been easy she thought marrying the dead boys mother and still harbouring the doubt through all those years ill do my best i promise thank you marinella flinched slightly as dominic touched her hand fleetingly in thanks it wasnt the touch itself but something she wasnt able to define until theyd parted and she watched him walk away shoulders still slumped or perhaps buoyed by her parting promise but it hit her then how much dominic was depending on her and again the worry came that she might end up letting him down there was only one session left to fill in some of the remaining details of christian rosselots life before her flight back to virginia and sebastian but even armed with this incredible story the quest of a man still searching for the truth in a murder from thirty years ago with both lambourne and stuart capel already railing against continued probing in the past she feared their reaction was a foregone conclusion forniers quest had touched her deeply but how was she even going to start to convince them genoa january marc jaumard looked at the brief entry in the newspaper personal column hed already read it twice and now read it through again trying to measure each word judge any hidden intent he only had the single page with the personals ripped out from la provencal and sent by a friend in marseille jaumard had been with the same genoabased company now for over four years away at sea when his brother died he hadnt even known until six weeks later when he returned to genoa folded clippings in an envelope from the same friend in marseille cafe slaying milieu war hots up cafe au sanguin the main report in la provencal described his brother as a known milieu associate quite flattering considering that he had mainly killed people for money and now this new clipping almost four years later jaumard wondered if it really was what it appeared on face value connected somehow with his brothers death hed left marseille in something of a rush rent unpaid for three months a bank loan on a car hed taken with him left hanging and his exwife screaming for maintenance the advert could be just a ruse by the bank or his wifes lawyer to flush him out create the illusion that it was somehow connected with his brothers death a small inheritance from blood money stashed away perhaps then slap an injunction on him a bit extreme for the bank playing on sympathies with his longburied brother but hed put nothing past his exwife he wondered he contemplated the nearby phone briefly before his eyes fell back to the advert dissecting sentences and then individual words silently mouthing trying to imagine his exwife across a lawyers desk as it was worded thirtyone shallow breathing half light from the hallway spilling across eyrans profile as he slept stuart capel stood over the bed contemplating in some lights at some angles he could see jeremys features in eyrans face remember jeremy as he was as a child the two of them playing together eyran was the last link with those memories lost now all so distant and pushed away even further by the confusion and nightmares running riot in eyrans mind still the eyran he remembered the carefree smiling boy from their trip to california before the accident was out of reach seven sessions in five weeks had eyrans state of mind improved certainly the frequency of dreams had diminished two a week had been the average before the sessions now they were at least a week or ten days apart and less violent and upsetting of the four dreams over those five weeks two dreams had been with gigio two without the latest development stuart found hardest to accept past life regressions gigio no longer an invented protective character from the part of eyrans psyche refusing to accept the loss of his parents but a real life in its own right a life that eyran had supposedly lived in france from to christian rosselot he shook his head it was unreal ludicrous another turnoff along the nightmarish road theyd been led down since jeremys death yet this one had no familiar landmarks no signposts dragged him abruptly away from the only tangible element with eyrans condition hed clung to eyrans nonacceptance of his parents death he could relate to that he had felt the emotion strongly himself had spent the last long weeks struggling to come to terms with jeremys death and had barely succeeded a friendly face in his dreams taking him to see jeremy he imagined could be quite reassuring soothing make him feel somehow that jeremy hadnt completely gone but his reservations about entering eyran into therapy had lingered until the second session when david lambourne brought up the possible danger of a predominant character pushing eyran over the edge into schizophrenia only then did he feel assured hed made the right decision his earlier fears were allayed now with that premise thrown out of the window stuarts doubts were back before the final session with marinella calvan hed voiced his concerns to lambourne of continued probing into eyrans past lambourne had defended that because the past real character of gigiochristian had also experienced sudden separation from his parents secondary influence was still significant how even apart from that core shared experienced of loss there were other elements linking the two lives a period of coma in both boys eyrans brief death the wheat field in eyrans dreams which was also the last place to feature in christians life by knowing more about christian rosselot they would be better armed to tackle eyrans current condition stuart had only been partially swayed and perhaps it had shown in his face because lambourne added with this one final session with mrs calvan the main forays into the past will be complete we can then assess afresh where we want future sessions to head though stuart didnt totally agree with calvans views he appreciated her courage of conviction after the last session shed thanked him and amanda for allowing her to delve into eyrans past and explained how she hoped it might help that it wasnt only a question of symbols it was determining where they had stronger relevance in which life was there stronger nonacceptance of loss and separation hopefully the two sessions and the notes and transcripts would provide the answers to that provide a stronger framework for conventional therapy to continue calvan had nodded towards lambourne at that point but stuart noted a slight clouding in lambournes eyes as if he disagreed or previously had had words with her on the subject but lambourne made no comment just smiled tightly at calvans nod the only time stuart had spoken with calvan before was for twenty minutes after her first session with eyran when shed provided some of her background with regressions children and xenoglossy she preferred cases of xenoglossy in children because of the unlikelihood of them learning the language by other means fluent spanish medieval german phoenician obscure regional dialects hundreds of authenticated case studies and papers compiled between herself and her mentor dr emmett donaldson impressive stuff incredible somehow too incredible to be real stuart hadnt voiced any doubt but calvan somehow sensed it had suddenly asked him if apart from eyran he knew anyone who had been in a coma no he hadnt but she pressed he had probably heard of people who after being in a coma had afterwards suffered amnesia memory loss yes hed answered calvan had succinctly pointed out that if a period of coma had the ability to wipe out memory then a death certainly would people tend not to believe in past lives simply because they themselves have no personal recall of a past life nothing tangible with which to relate but that doesnt mean they havent occurred most people under hypnosis do in fact recall past lives and my colleague dr donaldson has had great success in sessions with young boys up to the age of seven while awake after that the ability to recall diminishes stuart could just imagine calvan back in virginia pacing in front of first year students dazzling the class with the same graphic example why was he still so sceptical marinella calvans parting words after the last session still rang in his mind at least now we know its a real past life the danger of possible schizophrenia has gone no more worries about a secondary character taking over but stuart hadnt felt any relief replacing something tangible something with which he could strongly relate with a concept he still couldnt quite grasp just didnt sit right regardless of the obvious benefits stressed by calvan when hed first mentioned his doubts to amanda about the continuing sessions shed quickly thrown in his face that hed never been keen on them and now at the first obstacle the first turn in the road with which he didnt agree he was ready to throw in the towel leave it to the experts stuart its their problem why their walls are full of diplomas in psychoanalysis and yours arent youre never going to second guess them at their own game so that was how she saw it the age old argument while it was their problem he wasnt so obsessed with eyran he had more time to devote to his own family to tessa and herself eyran had conveniently been shoved off to the sidelines someone elses problem if stuart called an end to the sessions the problem of eyran was back fully in their laps but amandas comment however misguided threw a starker light on his own doubt he had originally hoped that the sessions would break down the barriers and imaginary characters in eyrans mind he would feel closer to eyran again the eyran he remembered but now the character was real not imaginary not one that would be shifted by a few couchside questions from lambourne and apart from worrying where the future sessions with eyran might now head he wondered whether at heart it wasnt scepticism but more that he didnt want to believe accept the reality of a secondary character who would always be with eyran however deeply buried in his subconscious yet again he would be sharing eyran time was too tight for the evening flight to lyon so dominic decided to stay over another night at the meridien he opted for an afternoon flight the next day so that he would be readily available through the morning for any news from marinella calvan they had the final session at eleven oclock and he imagined that she would broach what hed proposed either directly before or after the session while both the capels and lambourne were present though shed voiced caution and doubt her questions and keen interest had also displayed strong eagerness to help dominic was hopeful no call by eleven she either hadnt yet broached the subject or it was too awkward to hold up the session or make the call while the capels were still there or if she got agreement she might even plough straight in and ask some pertinent questions straight away another hour or so to wait dominic felt at a loose end hed earlier phoned his lyon office and gained an update on activities while he was away from inspector guidier his second in command he now phoned guidier back and asked him to make contact with the lyon public prosecutors office try verfraigne its just a hypothetical situation at this stage dominic explained what he wanted the likely prosecution procedure for a murder case reopened after over thirty years any obvious pitfalls and obstacles it wouldnt come under lyons jurisdiction but aixenprovence so the names of prosecutors and any likely chains of command for such a scenario there would also be helpful guidier was curious anything interesting could be could be dominic didnt want to say anything until marinella calvan had called didnt want to tempt fate but by starting the process at least he had the feeling something was in motion im leaving here at oneforty but i wont be back in the office in lyon until probably six or seven just time to pick up some files before i head down to vidauban for the weekend he gave the hotel telephone number for any immediate news dominics second call was to pierre lepoille at interpol lepoille was one of the best interpol intelligence officers he knew a researcher in his midtwenties when theyd worked together at interpol in paris now thirtyfour lepoille was a true scion of the electronic age a walking encyclopaedia of random knowledge with whatever he didnt know a few keystrokes away interpols own secure network the fbis ais programme minitel or surfing the internet lepoille was part of the permanent backbone of intelligence staff who supported the shifting quotas of officers like himself on two year assignments with interpol or liaised with the myriad of police forces worldwide gaining access breaking codes smashing deftly through virgin cyberspace barriers few secrets could be safely cocooned from lepoilles probing keystrokes the thought of a criminal being apprehended in kuala lumpur from an initial enquiry from a backwater police station in tupelo mississippi all through a succession of quickfire keystrokes lepoille found addictive his only other addiction was gauloise but since smoking was not allowed in the computer room lepoilles two vices were in serious conflict lepoille would grasp at any excuse to head to the canteen lighting up as soon as he was out of the computer room then would chain smoke practically lighting one from the embers of another but at some stage lepoilles withdrawal symptoms of being away from his computers would become stronger and hed be eager to return dominic recalled many a chainsmoking canteen meeting with lepoille dominic nice to hear from you been a while they spent a few minutes catching up on the eight months since their last meeting before dominic got to what he wanted psychics cases proven through psychic phenomena as well as failed cases involving the same with the latter any obvious legal obstacles that came out of why the cases failed in france or beyond mainly france but any big landmark cases outside might also be useful okay lepoille didnt ask what it was for countless intelligence enquiries every week had numbed him to the unusual lepoille had become used to not asking dominic left lepoille his number at vidauban for anything that might come through in the next day or two then took a long deep breath and sat back it was done everything put in motion nothing left but to see what came back in he looked at his watch am calvan would be finished in just eight minutes the phone could ring and he would know whether his efforts of the last fifty minutes had been wasted or not by twelvefifteen when there was still no call from marinella calvan dominics nerves were frazzled and his doubts returned full force he realized hed probably been foolish allowed his blind enthusiasm to take control burying the doubts calvan had flagged blot them out in the same way that christian didnt want to recall the murder alternative mostly lame excuses started to spring to mind of why she hadnt yet called and finally dominic picked up the phone the thought of another hours phonewatching before he headed off for his flight waiting anxiously to know was unbearable im afraid shes not here david lambournes voice shes gone shopping some bits and pieces she needed to pick up apparently before her flight back to virginia when is she preparing to leave later this evening sixthirty seven oclock brief silence anything i can help with inspector fornier it was just that she mentioned she might call me if lambourne knew anything hopefully hed speak up but he just responded blandly i see dominic didnt want to prompt by asking didnt she discuss the matter with you too clumsy do you expect to see her later or will she go straight back to her hotel she said that shed probably call by for half an hour or so between three and four theres some final notes shed like to go over with me before leaving final notes dominic wondered if that was when shed chosen to raise the subject with lambourne perhaps explained why she hadnt called so far but by then he realized hed either be waiting himself to board a flight or midair to lyon can you tell her i called its very important im flying out myself soon but she could leave a message at my office or reach me over the weekend on this number dominic gave lambourne his lyon hq and vidauban numbers and rang off over the next twentyfour hours dominic seesawed hopelessly between doubt and hope over what news might come from calvan there was no news or message when he arrived at his office in lyon at pm only an urgent file on his desk from guidier which needed to be checked before an instruction hearing monday and a note verfraigne is in court until monday more information then but his assistant knew the name of the aix chief prosecutor henri corbeix dominic picked up the file and the note and phoned monique to tell her he was on his way hed already phoned her once before boarding his flight prewarned her they would be heading down to vidauban for the weekend hopefully she would already have most things packed and prepared when he arrived the suitcases were by the door but shed pan fried some sea bass with peppers and dill on a bed of rice his favourite a glass of white bordeaux was at its side shed already had hers but she thought he might want something before the drive he grimaced apologetically im sorry i already ate on the flight im not that hungry he lied i should have told you when i phoned monique looked back towards the food he wasnt sure if she was put out by his refusal or simply working out what to do with the fish he was eager to get away see if there was a message on his vidauban answerphone from marinella calvan but now he felt guilty how long will you be five or six minutes i just need to finish my makeup and throw a few more things in the overnight bag well now that youve prepared it it looks too good to go to waste ill see what i can manage by the time monique was ready hed finished all of the fish twothirds of the rice and downed the last gulp of bordeaux as he picked up the first bags fire somewhere monique asked halfway through the drive dominic didnt realize till that moment how fast hed been driving kmph when his normal average was kmph he eased back to just over kmph after the flight and the days events dominic was tired the oncoming headlights stung his eyes towards the end of the drive particularly their stark glare on the unlit roads approaching vidauban and the farmhouse the drive had taken two hourstwenty minutes rather than the normal two hoursfifty but when he pressed the replay button on the answerphone there were no messages from calvan only one from lepoille psychics interesting subject nothing much come up in france yet but im still trying quite a lot from america though some of them big cases im on a short shift tomorrow four hours starting at midday well speak then monique caught his expression as he looked up from the machine anything wrong no nothing nothing it was probably more his anxiety she sensed than the short message on the tape calvan would be in the middle of a long flight back to virginia no more messages would come through that night and with the time difference the earliest he could now receive a call would be early afternoon the next day monique sensed his restlessness the next morning conversation was stilted over coffee and hot bread if it was warm enough monique usually served up outside but with this mornings early crispness she wore a thick towelling robe over a tshirt and jeans dominic wore a sweat shirt she wondered whether his tension was connected with the tape and transcript shed read and his trip to london analysts pastlife regressionists voices from the past and now messages on their answerphone about psychics possibly it was all as strange to him as to her with the first tape shed pushed whatever emotions she might have had away harboured doubts and used the mechanical exercise of preparing the questions both as a shield and to throw it back quickly in the lap of whoever sent it analysts hoaxers or whatever they were but with the transcript shed found herself wrestling with a fast changing range of emotions disbelief anger outrage that it might be a hoax rereading segments over and over and searching for fault or possible invention not wanting to believe before final acceptance an acceptance that cut through her and chilled her to the bone it was christians voice there was no doubt she didnt know how or why or even pretend to comprehend but it was him she did her duty after three attempts to express her thoughts in a few lines without rambling or being too sentimental she had faxed the short note back to london there had been no tears then they hadnt come till the next morning when she read back through the transcript the first time shed read it purely clinically objectively is this christians voice as if she was an expert character or voice analyst but the second time she actually attached christians voice recalled its soft tones its joy and vibrance so open and innocent it was made of shell in the shape of an old galleon the light inside made the shell almost luminescent and direct light would also shine through the portholes it was beautiful and in that moment she recalled christians face clearly full of joy as jeanluc paid the rest of the money and the shopkeeper took the galleon down from the shelf and handed it to christian and all the other moments of him smiling suddenly flooded back looking up at her with pride with one of his first drawings from school her sewing the arm back on his topo gigio doll and his kiss of thanks him asking for a story as she tucked him in bed bright green eyes sparkling up at her the soft touch of his small hands against her cheek all gone now gone gone for so many years so many the tears convulsed her in a sudden tidal wave heavy racking sobs that shook her whole body uncontrollably and shed rocked slightly with their rhythm muttering so many at intervals as if it was a mantra that would finally return some control some normality sudden grief rising up and mugging her after so many years felt strange to her she hadnt cried for christian for fourteen years since geromes tenth birthday party when shed suddenly recalled a similar party for christian his last but that didnt help the recalled shame of not having grieved for so many years merely added poignancy perhaps to cover her tears and confusion shed prepared one of dominics favourite dishes when he arrived there see everythings fine normal she didnt say much on the drive not wishing to bring up the subject in case her emotions and the tears welled up again shed read the transcript and identified the voice shed sent her fax back to london shed cried it was over but then she became aware that dominic wasnt saying much either and he seemed tense and anxious was driving faster than normal now this morning sipping his coffee she could feel the same tension did something happen in london you seem anxious as if youre waiting on some news just tired dominic forced a smile and now having to face catching up on work you know what its like whenever i go away things back up i thought it might have been something to do with the tapes and transcripts that theyd somehow upset you dominic looked back at her the stark morning light caught the lines of pain etched in her face lines hed hoped had mellowed years ago and wouldnt return she was still incredibly beautiful a dusky sophia loren with just a fleck of salt in her dark pepper hair and if he smiled she would smile in return and he could look upon them as laughter lines the pain and sad memories would suddenly melt away but he sensed she was speaking more for how she felt than for him the tapes and transcripts had upset her he reached one hand out and touched hers of course i was upset by them but it was more concern for the effect they might have on you i cried a bit but im okay now she forced a smile felt the eyes welling slightly again shed planned not to mention her crying some quick sympathy and a smile from dominic and suddenly the words were out he had that effect on her are you sure she just nodded looked down and sipped at her coffee dominic wondered whether hed done the right thing coming down to vidauban for the weekend it had seemed a good idea to get away both for him and monique but now having left his number with half the world hoping to just sit back and relax while the calls flooded back in he felt suddenly cut off restless four hours to wait before lepoille made contact five or six for anything from calvan he could start on guidiers file to kill the time but he wasnt sure hed be able to apply his mind effectively he was too preoccupied and for monique he wondered whether vidauban might be too nostalgic coming straight after her reading the transcript the thought hadnt hit him until the night before as he turned into the driveway as the farmhouse and its small courtyard were caught in the headlamps when theyd bought it six years ago time enough seemed to have passed from christian and taragnon for it not to be a reminder just a nostalgic link with an area they loved it had also looked different to the taragnon farmhouse the front facade was flat but three years ago hed added a small office that jutted out into the courtyard and from that moment it held a far stronger resemblance except that instead of the blank wall of the side of jeanlucs garage a large window looked from his office onto the courtyard and rather than looking out across open fields a small rockery garden sloped up to a few pine trees and a half stone wall twenty metres away separating them from the property next door the only open fields were beyond the garden the other side of the house after breakfast dominic retired to his office for lack of anything else to do he shuffled some papers and files and glanced through the first pages of guidiers file without it really grabbing his attention just after ten oclock gerome appeared on the patio for breakfast and dominic came back out to say hello work was fine jaqueline was fine gerome grimaced she hadnt come over because he was heading off to see a friend in montpelier he would be staying overnight in montpelier and would see them about midday the next day a couple of hours work on the computer and then im off computer dominic thought again of lepoille three hours before he was in his office dominic finally got into guidiers file motorbike mugging spree two youths on a bike averaging twelve muggings a week over seven months had caused practically a mini crime wave when they were finally apprehended reported driveby muggings dropped to no more than five a month when the phone rang at pm he was fully immersed in the report it broke his attention abruptly it was lepoille his enthusiasm was infectious but dominic found it hard to take it all in just over the phone several cases in america tracked down through psychics many of them notable son of sam killings the boston strangler the case of mona tinsley mansonbugliosi proving psychic influence over others to commit a murder some departments even had regulars they went to when everything else failed gerard croiset and peter hurkos were the names that came up the most but very little so far in france except relatives in the petit gregoire case contacting a psychic early on to discover if the boy was dead or just missing the police here hardly ever seem to involve psychics just relatives or sometimes the press and rarely does it feature in official police filing or trial evidence im tracking down a couple of leads in paris ill know more on monday theres a stack of interpol printouts and emails on my desk some arrived late yesterday but most of it came through this morning ill bike it over to you monday great ill look forward to going through it hopefully in the reading something would leap out nothing immediately had from lepoilles quick fire descriptions and thanks for the help pierre though six hours later when there was still no call from marinella calvan dominics excitement had dissipated doubt set in again though this time unlike before it was set in concrete midday now in virginia his urgent messages left with lambourne she wasnt going to call perhaps shed even been by the phone when hed called lambourne signalling to make an excuse when the package arrived from lepoille hed probably just throw it straight in the bin hed been foolish to build up his hopes marinella calvan was on a united airlines flight back to virginia in the next seat was an overweight and overfriendly sales manager named bob returning to richmond who shed finally managed to extricate herself from with a few curt smiles to get back into the file on her lap she made notes on a fresh sheet of paper as she scanned back through the transcripts depth of detail had been remarkable they effectively knew everything about christian rosselots life where he lived went to school daily and weekly habits and a variety of rich recollections some of which only the boy himself could have possibly known the last session shed used mostly to fill in any gaps but at one point shed sat up sharply her skin bristling as christian talked about his best friend stephan he also went to my school but he lived on the far side of the village it was stephan i was going to see the day i became lost in the wheat field i never made it to his house and did you ever see stephan again no no marinella was about to tap out tell me more about that day did you meet someone else what stopped you from reaching stephans house but lambourne was looking across sharply and even eyrans simple no had been nervous and hesitant his breathing more rapid she could almost feel fornier at her shoulder pushing urging but even if she got past the first question without lambourne cutting in any upset to eyrans mood and she might get nothing more the rest of the session her last opportunity she moved eyran away back to earlier happier times when hed played with stephan now she wrote the wheat field is not just a symbol for christians separation from his parents but also perhaps his best friend christian might see eyran as a replacement for that best friend the friend he never got to see that fateful day shed tried to broach the subject of forniers quest at first gently mentioning only that there might be a few more questions but lambourne looked immediately dismayed mentioned that on the last tape stuart capel had complained about the pointed angled questions making eyran hesitant almost defensive id assured him that this last session would be far more open allow eyran freer range what questions and shed fluffed that they were nothing important theyll wait with lambourne and stuart capel concerned about even a few pointed questions hoping to derail into a full murder investigation was hoplessly out of reach at least shed tried shortly after the last session shed been struck with another link there was a river running close to where christian rosselots body was found and in one of eyrans dreams the brook by broadhurst farm featured expanding into a large lake perhaps christian believed somehow that if hed have been able to cross that river he would have escaped his attacker and avoided his fate and in eyrans dream the lake symbolized separation from his parents but it is obviously christians separation which has the strongest connection with water the debate with lambourne over whose sense of separation was stronger christians or eyrans past or present was irrelevant the links were all there the freuddevotees and conventionalists were going to love it object loss symbols were classic and if they started to wriggle and defend she had more than enough information with which to bury them dr torrens initial recommendation to therapy his earlier eegs recording brain wave disturbance lambournes sessions his concern about dominance of the secondary character and schizophrenia then finally eyran speaking in french under hypnosis and her being called in over sixty pages of notes and files even before the three tapes and fortysix pages of transcript from her own sessions now fully corroborated by a french chief inspector and his wife not some fringe newwave religion nutcases who name their children rainbow or stardust it was going to be a good paper one of her strongest yet correction it was going to be a great paper marinella put on the headphones and flicked through the pop and comedy channels until she found some classical music offenbachs barcarolle was playing when she got back to lambournes from shopping shed heard that dominic fornier had called she felt guilty about not phoning him back the image of him walking away from their meeting the diehard detective shouldering the doubt through all those years now clinging to one last hope had stuck in her mind she reached tentatively for the phone just before leaving her hotel for the airport then decided against it shed call him tomorrow not sure immediately if she was just delaying facing his disappointment or hoping for better words of explanation to settle in the meantime griegs morning soothing relaxing hopefully shed doze off soon to her side bob was flicking through the inflight magazine but the next tunes brahms hungarian dance and tchaikovskys march slav broke her slightly out of her half slumber roused her spirits she found herself tapping the armrest to the rhythm of march slav as she imagined the key points of her final paper being pounded home to the army of sceptics who had plagued her through the years only when mozarts andante came on could she feel waves of calm and relaxation again descending sleep once more in sight but at the start of the third stanza the thought hit politician the man fornier had suspected was now a prominent politician an mep murder case reopened after thirty years implicating one of the countrys leading politicians if forniers suspicions were right then it was going to be a big case enormous case and one of the first ever proved through a pastlife regression the thoughts hit her in such quickfire succession that it took her breath away she could see it all rolling out ahead oprah winfrey was a given she was already reading clippings from the new york times and washington post in between make up for maury povich and larry king i understand that in france this case is as big as oj simpson but the added factor of core evidence coming from a past life regression has literally split the french legal establishment in two the case was already great but now within her grasp was the opportunity to make it phenomenal if forniers hunch was correct and she played it right it could dominate the american media throughout the trial eight months a year it would do more to aid the acceptance of plr than anything previously conceived the thoughts and images hit like so many cluster bombs speeches increased department funding books chat shows newsweek breathless as they pounded home suspended belief batting helplessly against the audaciousness the ridiculous magnitude of it all a laugh suddenly burst free a laugh that quickly lost its hesitance and became more raucous bob was looking over and mouthing something she pulled off her headphones is that the bill cosby he asked funny isnt he yeah but not half as funny as mozart he looked puzzled and quickly buried his face back into the flight magazine should keep him quiet for a while she thought marinella put back the headphones and sunk back into the mozart slowly closing her eyes even if it turned out not to be the politician fornier suspected proving the guilt or innocence of the person already charged would still grab a few good headlines be something of a first she had to at least try shed forever punish herself over the possibly lost opportunity if she didnt it was probably best to phone fornier after shed spoken with lambourne and stuart capel shed already raised his hopes once and let him down it wasnt going to be easy all the obstacles with lambourne and capel that had made her finally step back from a hard push with forniers proposal still held true she would need to be convincing thirtytwo marseille october marc jaurmard followed close behind marcelle gauthereau if it was to happen at all it would be inside thought jaumard he would sign everything gauthereau and the notary would nod courteously and then someone would slip from the shadows and slap down the summons stepping through the notarys door he glanced back to check that gauthereau didnt lock the door behind him hed also checked the brass plaque downstairs before following gauthereau up the two flights patrice roussel notarie roussel was in his late fifties wispy greying hair thin pinched features and tight economical gestures polite nods quick half smiles without showing teeth as he took details the same meaningless smile as he handed jaumards identity card back it was taking far longer than jaumard had expected the door to the reception had been half open at the beginning hed been able to keep one eye on the receptionist see if she made a move to lock the door see if anyone else suddenly came in but shed shut the connecting door on her way out from dropping a file on roussels desk halfway through the blood pounded through jaumards head as the papers were passed back and forth between him and the notary another question another line filled in another stamp and seal with the notarys elaborate signature on top jaumard found himself half looking at the closed door in between expecting it to burst open at any second and the summons be served he wiped the sweat from his palms on his trouser legs and suddenly the envelope was being passed across though maybe this was the summons he thought with a jolt he studied its front cautiously just his name and co of patrice roussel underneath it certainly looked like his brothers handwriting he hesitated suddenly deciding against opening it in front of these two sets of prying eyes he wanted to get out and away as fast as possible slipping it quickly into his back pocket he stood up thank you gentlemen i thought you might want to open it in my presence gauthereau invited in case theres something that needs my attention straightaway nono its okay jaumard backed away to the door ill call you if theres anything thank you he opened the door and was out quick smile to the receptionist another door and he was on the stairs taking them two and three at a time bounding frantically down the last flight until he was out on the street gauthereau stared bemusedly after jaumard for a second before saying his own goodbyes to roussel all those years of waiting contact not made until a year after his last advert and then all over in minutes gautheraus curiosity had grown over those years as to what was inside the envelope a hidden stash secret bank account drugs routes black book with key milieu contacts now he would probably never know only once sixty yards clear around the next corner did jaumard pause let out a long deep breath as he rested his back against a wall his nerves were still racing he decided not to risk opening the envelope even there and didnt do so until he was sequestered at the back of a small cafe almost half a mile away apart from the barman only three people were in the cafe the lunch time rush hadnt yet arrived jaumard felt safe from prying eyes as he opened the envelope he had to read it twice before its significance really hit him a smile slowly crossed his face quite a legacy his brother had left him alain duclos rpr minister for limoges child murder case from a hit contract that was never fulfilled incredible the three page letter even suggested two possible courses of action though he thought he knew already which he would take marinella calvan had been on the phone for over ten minutes with stuart capel and whatever hopes shed had earlier in the call she felt suddenly slipping away her thoughts had gelled over the weekend of how best to broach the subject telling the truth wouldnt work eyrans therapy diverted to aid a murder investigation just wouldnt be accepted but if she kept close to what she at heart believed that christians nonacceptance of separation was far stronger than eyrans she might succeed the sincerity and enthusiasm would come through in her voice it also did much to bury her initial apprehension on reflection over her motives by the time shed worked up the story in her mind adding embellishment from her notes it had become the lead chariot helping the murder investigation was merely tagging along behind but despite the strong case she put forward now to stuart capel christians almost total erasure of the last hour of his life the symbols in eyrans dreams of the lake and the wheat field having far stronger relevance in christians life than eyrans that before they could fully get to grips with eyrans acceptance of loss and detachment they first had to tackle christians he wasnt convinced he hadnt said no only that he wanted to think it over we should speak again tomorrow but she had the feeling that he was merely delaying so that he could let her down softly she needed to add support to her argument this isnt just my view but also that of my previous department head dr donaldson hes had more years of experience in this than myself and david lambourne put together donaldson might well support her view but during their earlier meeting he had merely nodded thoughtfully and passed a few minor comments she wouldnt know his full opinion for probably a few days when hed had a chance to study her notes and transcripts in more detail silence from the other end perhaps he was becoming swayed she pushed the advantage look it would just be for two weeks four sessions at the most i think that should do it then eyran would be back to conventional therapy with david lambourne it was actually david lambourne i wanted to speak to before i decided stuart commented have you spoken to him already no i havent if she had phoned lambourne hed have said no if stuart capel now contacted him put out by the fact that shed gone behind his back that no would be even stronger lambourne had given her stuart capels number after the last session purely for her to verify some of eyrans personal details for her paper last ditch hope brutal honesty i didnt speak to him because i already know his point of view he doesnt agree with my prognosis thats why i called you directly if you phone him hell only tell you the same i see swaying again or perturbed by her slight of hand at least the ball was back between them the main excuse for delay had gone stuart recalled the look that lambourne had fired calvan when shed broached the subject after the last session hed thought then theyd previously had words at least she was telling the truth about that since you seem to know already what lambournes objections are why dont you tell me its simple he thinks the solution is with eyran in the present i think its with christian in the past difference is i have a stronger case to back up my argument davids direction was floundering when i arrived and all weve discovered since is that the imaginary character is a real life nothing more wheres david going to head from here he doesnt even have the secondary character to explore any more conventional freud is out of the window and his expertise with plt is limited hes at a dead end what if youre wrong theres always that possibility but what is there to lose four sessions over two weeks and then im gone david lambourne has eyran back to pursue whatever he wants to pursue but if im right it could be the breakthrough weve been looking for hearing her own voice its enthusiasm she felt a sudden twinge of shame two weeks stuart reflected eyran had already been in therapy five weeks and they were virtually back to square one it didnt seem a lot to ask and calvans arguments were convincing but still he held strong reservations partly his reluctance to accept this past character partly the problems that might be caused with lambourne when another thought suddenly hit him amanda if she learned hed said no she would probably seen it as just another prime example of him being obstructive trying to be an armchair psychiatrist and map out what was best for eyran despite expert advice to the contrary okay ill agree to the sessions but just the four thats it and youll have to phone lambourne yourself and smooth the way with him if he phones me afterwards ill confirm what weve agreed but i dont want to get in the middle of any conflict between you stuart could tell by the brief pause at the other end that marinella calvan had been caught off guard by the sudden turn around yes yes certainly ill call him one more obstacle to go but marinella was sure that lambourne wouldnt roll over nearly so easily pm in lyon the session in london would already have started when the call had finally come through on tuesday dominic had practically given up on hearing from marinella calvan hed phoned lambournes office on monday only to get an answerphone he didnt leave a message marinella had started by apologizing for the delay shed wanted to work out what she was going to say develop a particular theory in her mind before approaching lambourne or stuart capel she explained the theory and the agreement that had resulted to dominic surprise suddenly tempered his enthusiasm they dont know its to aid a murder investigation no theyd have never agreed but id already been partly exploring this theory for the benefit of eyrans therapy anyway it was something id voiced previously to dr lambourne and later discussed with my colleague dr donaldson he agreed with my prognosis the main key lies with christian in the past not with eyran as much i was keen to help you at the outset im sure you can appreciate that ethically it would have been wrong to put your case before eyran capels mental stability and health its just fortunate that in the end those aims coincide calvan went on to explain that if it got out that it was to aid a murder investigation it would cause problems dr lambourne in particular had been difficult to persuade he would no doubt quickly claim the investigation had been the prime aim all along and try and halt the sessions later particularly if anything worthwhile was uncovered from the sessions details of the murder investigation would obviously come out though by then hopefully the sessions would either be over or far progressed even then it should be admitted to only as a byproduct of these extra sessions rather than the main feast that you only saw the possibility of a renewed investigation when you saw the first transcripts that is if anything is uncovered if if if dominic stared at the fax machine in the corner the arrangement was that shed fax through the transcript straight after the session thirty years of waiting to know and now only an hour remained while he understood the reasoning the duplicity of his little agreement with calvan somehow added to his nerves only the two of them knew it was almost incestuous in the same way that he was keeping the secret from his wife she in turn was duping lambourne and capel so many secrets something was bound to go wrong like two conspirational children playing hide and seek hunting cloak and dagger style through the shadows of memories from thirty years ago excited by their little secret as much as the adventure unable to tell the adults who would say that they knew better and stop their little game the night before hed had a clear opportunity to tell monique but still he put it off if nothing was uncovered by calvan or if it merely supported machanauds guilt there was no point if if if to support the theory calvan had sold he should be absent from the first sessions perhaps he could turn up at the third or fourth theyd discuss it later meanwhile shed fax transcripts through and would readily admit to doing so to lambourne and stuart capel on the pretext of authentication and gaining advice on questions for future sessions how to guide christian in the right direction if dominic then showed up for later sessions it wouldnt seem strange would follow more naturally that he had by then stumbled on information which might help the investigation but the forced detachment his purposely being kept away from the activities in london only made him more anxious his nerve ends bristling because something was happening in a small room four hundred miles away over which he had no control christians frail voice at that moment telling them the secrets of over thirty years ago and he wouldnt know for an hour or they would be close to finding out when christian suddenly headed off at a tangent and if he was there he could whisper sharply in calvans ear no no take him back ask him this the squad room was hectic phones ringing people calling across the room typewriters clattering dominic had shut his door to concentrate on the normal mornings mountain of papers that required his quick attention final approval of files to go to the procureurs office an enquiry from st etienne over a pattern of regional car thefts medical report on a rape case the noise of the squad room was muffled beyond his door but still dominic couldnt concentrate the most hed manage was a half page before his thoughts once again drifted wondering what was happening at that moment in london and he would glance back at the fax machine frustration because it symbolized his detachment and impotence at that moment yet also hope it was his only link with what was happening in the two days since marinella calvans call hed received even more papers from lepoille on cases involving psychics to add to mondays package hed hardly looked at them the last days hed been through a ridiculous seesaw of hope and disappointment without putting himself through it again to no avail verfraigne from the lyon procureurs office had called and given him the prosecution pecking order in aix en provence together with some names hed written them down but hadnt called anyone the list was tucked into the front of lepoilles top file at the edge of his desk a stack of papers and thirty years of doubt waiting on one fax session did you play much by the river with stephan yes quite a bit what sort of games did you play did you ever swim in it no it was too cold but we used to play on the river bank river bank where the police thought the boy was probably held between the sexual assaults the memories from before open carefree not yet linked in christians mind only minutes before hed mentioned the field close by marinella knew from her last session that stephan was one of his closest friends it seemed as good a place to start as any the first ten minutes of the session had been with lambourne taking eyran back before she took over perhaps it was her imagination but lambourne seemed to be taking longer than normal showing his resentment in the only way left to him shed started with other times hed played with stephan their favourite places and games introducing a general relaxed mood christian was free to ramble no constraints but ever so slowly she circled in like a cat stalking its prey the trick was that hopefully christian was never aware of it already shed struck out once and missed her target thinking that shed asked enough general questions shed asked what happened the day he headed off to see stephan but never made it did you meet up with someone else what happened again christian mentioned a searing bright light after a period of darkness knowing in that moment that he was close to stephans house as he recognized the field but as recall of the attack flooded back he quickly became incoherent eyrans head lolled his breathing becoming laboured shed sensed lambourne about to reach over to the keyboard as she broke christian hastily away she circled more warily now river bank she didnt want to pounce too early this time what sort of games did you play on the river bank we used to build a dam there was a small stream higher up that flowed down from the hillside and into the river in the summer it was usually dried up but in the spring it used to flow in quite fast how did you and stephan make the dam we would get sticks and leaves and pack them in with mud stephan would bring a spade with him so that we could dig a hollow one day we dug an enormous hole to one side then diverted the stream into it by blocking the way with sticks and leaves a fond memory speech animated excited eyrans eyes glistened the water built up and built up until finally it started overflowing it was incredible almost like a small lake marinella remembered a segment from one of lambournes earlier taped sessions the pond seemed suddenly to be much larger like a huge black lake she shot a meaningful glance at lambourne his face remained bland reluctance to admit any breakthrough or perhaps he simply hadnt picked up on the connection we would leave a narrow passage leading out then block it with sticks and mud then when it was full and almost overflowing we would break the dam and run down alongside the sudden torrent until it hit the river a pause excitement ebbing slightly eyrans expression more thoughtful my mother didnt like me playing there i would come back too muddy and dirty marinella let the moment settle did you ever play lower down the river bank only a few times were you often lower down the river bank on your own for instance when you cut across the fields and had to cross the bridge there yes sometimes gently gently and at any time did you meet anyone else there at the lower part of the river no no i dont think so eyrans brow creased i dont remember the day you left to meet stephan but never made it the day your bike broke down did you meet someone lower down the river that day no i didnt meet anyone there i didnt cross the river there i i there was eyran broke off swallowing hastily he looked for a moment as if he was about to say more but then the thought was lost strike two marinella could almost feel lambourne gloating behind her when hed discovered shed gone behind his back theyd had their worst argument yet she said a lot of things she immediately regretted too staid limited plt experience merely clinging to what he knew for safetys sake not for the patient confirming his conventional status or perhaps his englishness lambourne had been far less personal kept mainly to patientcounsel ethics it was his patient he should have been consulted first made the main decision it had been wrong of her to contact stuart capel directly to sell her theory fait accompli the argument about what was already done predictably headed nowhere she quickly put lambourne on the spot by asking pointedly where he planned the sessions to head next then in the face of a faltering and hesitant reply rammed in with her own solution if im wrong what have you lost two weeks after that youve got the patient back to explore what you like she wasnt doing this for her health she already had what she wanted more than enough to compile a paper and shed just been away from her son for a week i need another two weeks away like a hole in the head im only doing this because i strongly believe it will work gradual teetering with each blow lambourne was stuck for an answer but it was a reluctant submission with a cautionary note he was still far from convinced about her theory one footfault one hint that youre getting close to an area that might adversely affect my patient and ill stop the sessions she could feel lambourne hovering now gloating that he hadnt even needed to intervene shed made her own foot fault the session wasnt heading where she wanted hed been right shed been wrong she suddenly felt the pressure of the small room closing in on her lambournes gloating fornier waiting in a squad room in the middle of france for her fax the ridiculous chess game of secrets they were both playing philippe waiting expectantly to translate her next question her own ambitions now slipping away again by the second shed followed dominics cue to go back to when christian first met someone before the boy sensed any danger but all shed discovered was that dominic was right it probably wasnt machanaud unless christian met him later christian hadnt met anyone by the river but if not there where when your bike broke down did you cut across the fields behind the village where did you go i hid my bike in some long grass then i headed down towards the road then where i started walking along the road towards the village fornier had mentioned that nobody in the village had seen the boy did you reach the village did you see or meet anyone there no a car stopped a man offered me a lift marinella controlled her hands from shaking on the keys the information had in the end come up suddenly like a mugger in a dark alley she quickly hid her surprise lambourne wouldnt expect the information in itself to be particularly alarming it was only her what she knew it would signify to fornier what sort of car was he driving it was a sports car a green sports car what make was it i dont remember the man told me but i forgot marinellas hands paused on the keys perhaps she would return later the information was there somewhere and what did the man look like he was quite thin with dark hair was he young or old marinella noted eyrans brow creasing as philippe translated remembering that to a ten year old everyone seems old she added was he younger or older than your father younger at least five years younger what happened then did you drive through the village no he offered to drive me back to where the bike had broken down i told him it was all right but he insisted he stopped at the side turned and started driving back as christian described heading back along the road then them turning into the rough farm track which led to his bike marinella tried to imagine herself in the car alongside him this young boy from over thirty years ago who had less than an hour to live what did he see or notice that might now help faint beads of sweat had broken out on eyrans top lip she could sense his nervousness she asked him what the car was like inside the dashboard was wood and there was hardly any back seat just a narrow bench as you went up the lane did you see anyone else even in the distance no the field was empty i pointed where to stop my bike was was hidden in the long grass tension was thick in the small room eyrans breathing was laboured his eyes flickering slightly anticipation and fear of what lay ahead starting to grip him harder she feared that at any second lambourne would reach forward and stop her knew that if she pushed too hard pushed eyran over the edge into a catatonic state it could be the last session but the desire to know what happened next was too compelling like an incurable gambler she couldnt resist one last bet one last question when you reached the bike what happened the brake was jammed on the wheel the man tried to free it then suddenly he reached out and touched me then he he gripped me me haaarrd pulling i th theerrr marinella could see christians panic descending like an express elevator and went to break him away before lambourne intervened but christians expression suddenly changed settling slightly theerre was something something from before before we turned into the lane a truck passed us it took marinella a second to catch up with the sudden leap did the driver see you i dont know im not sure what did the truck look like what did it say on the side it was grey very long it had marseille on the side and the letters var n anything else can you see anything else no just marseille marseille i remember going there once with my father we went to the harbour and watched the fish being landed the fishermen with their nets marinella lost christian at that moment a day out in marseille with his father bright coloured fishing boats bouillabaisse in a harbourside cafe a pleasant rambling story happy memories again she was happy of a break in mood from the clawing tension but frustrated minutes later when letting the story run its course she wasnt able to get christian back again to the lane the thread had gone quite a move christian had shifted to where he knew she would be keen for more information jumped back a question then deftly skipped to where he felt more comfortable his influence over the direction of questions was stronger than shed given him credit for though twenty minutes later when she faxed the transcript to dominic fornier as pleased as she was with the information gained it struck her that between weaving around threatening chasms of panic and christian shifting scenes to suit it might be the only information they would get the transcript had arrived only minutes before and dominic was scanning frantically down a short handwritten note from marinella calvan was at the front breakthrough you were right it wasnt the poacher machanaud or at least it doesnt sound like him hope its helpful dominic was eager to get to the part that revealed it wasnt machanaud but his attention was wavering he could see guidier standing by the door expectantly its just the report from st etienne guidier said theres some urgency involved because they already have someone in custody theyve either got to file and charge him quickly or release him they need the comparison report on car thefts back from us straightaway the day your bike broke down did you meet someone lower down the river that day no i didnt meet anyone there i didnt cross the river there dominic looked up sharply only st etienne urgency and custody had registered yes yes i know ill deal with it but i need ten minutes alone ten minutes dominic made a pushing gesture with one hand shut the door behind you and make sure nobody else disturbs me and no calls dominic looked straight back to the transcript his mind screaming where who he hardly heard the click as guidier shut the door one finger tracing rapidly down the page christian walking down the road from where he left his bike theyd been wrong he hadnt cut across the fields until a few lines later the words hit him like a hammer blow sports car green car slim dark hair duclos duclos had picked up christian before he even reached the village dominic closed his eyes for a second hed always suspected though now it struck him that it had never been more than that hed buried his suspicion his doubt in the instruction and trial process in the witnesses who said theyd seen duclos in the restaurant in the general throng pushing towards machanaud and away from duclos and the thirty years since had buried it still further amazing that any glimmer of doubt had survived he thought sourly just enough to occupy his mind for a few minutes every decade pathetic if hed really believed had been convinced of duclos guilt then he wouldnt have been so shocked as he read the words felt suddenly cold and desolate his stomach sinking still further as he forced his eyes open again and read christians description of the car turning and heading back the rough farm track and him pointing to where his bike was hidden among the long grass christians growing panic as duclos reached out and touched him or was it his own guilt at staying silent suddenly hitting him machanauds innocence and the long years hed spent locked away until a moment ago that too had been no more than a nagging doubt varn marseillebased truck nothing immediately sprung to mind dominic read the remaining page of the transcript then went back honing in on where christian was with duclos rereading individual lines for finer detail and small nuances then he went back to the beginning of the transcript and read it through for anything else he might have missed at length he looked up rubbing his eyes the elation that he had something that put christian in duclos car finally after all these years rose slowly above the shock and emptiness and he clung to that forcing it home stronger yes rapped one hand sharply against the desk urging himself on the possible start of a new case where before he had nothing something he could send a prosecutor he drew on that new energy over the next hours immediately after dealing with the st etienne enquiry he tackled the mounting stack of papers from lepoille at the corner of his desk manson hurkos joseph chua geller berkowitz sifting through the murky depths of murder cases involving psychics searching for the few key points that might entice a prosecutors interest by late afternoon he had finished his notes and put them into a five page covering letter to henri corbeix after background of the original case and trial much of the letter was exploratory questioning seeking the best way forward procedural process what they should look for in the sessions remaining and requisite validation beyond moniques confirmation and the credentials of calvan and lambourne his reference notes to past cases involving psychics came at the end of the letter and he attached the relevant files from lepoille despite the exploratory tone of the letter it struck dominic that his underlying aim had still shone through convincing corbeix that this most unlikely of cases stood some chance of successful prosecution thirtythree limoges may large eyes full of passion willing him on light hazel with grey flecks the edges of the dream were less distinct hazy but the sensations burned through strongly alain duclos was excited the boy was quite young not yet twelve it was the boy hed been with on his last trip to paris he couldnt remember his name only that he was a half haitian half french mulatto he could see the faint sheen of sweat on the boys cream brown skin but the main excitement of the dream was that it was all so tactile he could feel the sweat feel its warm moistness as he slid back and forth and the boy looked back at him feel the smooth contours of the boys body the lean plane of his back one thumb sliding slowly up the ridge of his spine then spreading slowly out and around the stomach as he leant forward feeling the warmth of the body tight against him moving the hands slowly up the boys rib cage and onto his chest until he felt felt something something was wrong the chest was too developed too soft and fleshy he recoiled suddenly in horror the boy had breasts the boys smile turned slowly to a leer and as duclos looked closer through the haze of the dream he could see that the hair was not dark and wavy but short and blonde it was betina shed tricked him she slowly pouted and blew him a kiss but he felt suddenly repulsed sweat that smelt now like acid and roses its stickiness against his skin her attempt at a look of burning passion little more than leering stupidity she made him sick a sour bile rose in his stomach a sense of utter disgust and he mouthed you tricked me as he went to push her away but suddenly she was below him and holding tight looking up with big liquid eyes staring straight through him not saying anything but silently pleading i want you i want you give me a child gripping tight with her arms and legs wrapped solidly around his back pulling him closer into an embrace her tongue darting out and moistening her lips he couldnt get away the stickiness of her skin clung all around him the grip of her arms and legs like some slithering repulsive reptile the musty acrid smell of her sweat the darting snakes tongue and he started protesting screaming no no you tricked me let me go let me go let me duclos sat up in bed with a jolt his eyes slowly adjusting in the dark the sweat felt suddenly cold on his skin he looked over betina was still asleep he hadnt disturbed her i want a child the first time shed mentioned it had been almost three years ago she would be thirtysix next birthday if they didnt have one or two children by the time she was forty by then it might be too late two he was still struggling with the unthinkable of one shed misread his look fought to be reassuring i know it hasnt been easy for you with me at times and mostly my fault because of my past problem but this is important to me ill make an effort i promise a nightmare come true he was sick with flu for over two weeks probably psychosomatic but then he had to become more inventive headaches allergies sprained muscles sudden business trips stress and overwork the chain of excuses became laughable pathetic she wore him ragged he virtually broke out in a cold sweat each time she smiled at him approaching bedtime but between the various excuses and trips away miraculously he managed to succumb to sex no more than once every eight to ten weeks even then he would fail the occasional performance halfway through claiming that he was too tense or that he could sense she was nervous was perhaps trying too hard at most there would be three or four occasions a year where she could possibly conceive but it was probably the worst possible time for the problem to have arisen the calls from marc jaumard had started only ten months before her drastic bid to have a child five years with no calls then one out of nowhere duclos could hardly believe it only months after chapeaus death hed erased thoughts of any possible repercussions from his mind felt confident he was free of the problem once and for all all those years with no blackmail the first years of happiness with betina and now both problems were plaguing him at the same time duclos shook his head it was like some ridiculous cruel joke marc jaumard didnt have the same abrasive taunting style of his brother but on several occasions hed been drunk as if he needed dutch courage before making the call duclos didnt want jaumard calling his office so gave him his home number often the calls would come through at night probably after jaumard had staggered out of some bar and with him having to subdue his voice and often leaving for an impromptu meeting betina had become suspicious during one of their failed lovemaking sessions shed rolled over furiously and asked him if he was having an affair who was it that kept phoning the thought of him in bed with the unkempt overweight jaumard invariably pernodbreathed made him laugh out loud one time when jaumard woke them up with a am call and betina was staring at him accusingly hed thrust the phone out angrily see for yourself its just some drunken asshole a seconds silence from the other end as jaumard got over the surprise then slurringly jaumard apologized for phoning so late its jussst jusst some business with your husband hed thought the jealousy her concern that he might be having an affair could have partly been behind her new amorousness but removing that worry had made little difference she was as relentless as ever finally eight months later she became pregnant all his efforts had been to no avail she was now in her fourth month the first moment she told him a cold chill had crept up his spine his reaction perplexed him at first he should have been relieved the ordeal was over no more bedtime demands she finally had what she wanted what had worried him more his loathing of their having sex or her getting pregnant but months later when she suggested a scan to check that the baby was healthy he found himself about to protest the idea before realizing he had no good rational grounds against a scan except one in that moment the root of his worry suddenly hit him he was afraid to know it might be a boy a girl fine and even a boy in those early years but as it became older started to remind him of the boys he sneaked off to see in paris and marseille he would feel unsettled his own son those big innocent eyes staring straight through him somehow sensing his awful secret he could hardly think of a worse nightmare dominic spoke to corbeix late friday corbeix had been busy in court most of the day apologized that as yet hed only had half an hour to skim through the letter and the files sent it looks intriguing but give me the weekend to look through it in more detail lets speak monday shortly after sending everything to corbeix the questions started turning in dominics mind what happened immediately after christian was by his bike with duclos according to the original medical report the first sexual assault but where had duclos kept christian afterwards between the two attacks tied up somewhere near his bike or did duclos take him straight to where he was finally found perhaps hidden in the woods somewhere upstream from machanaud whichever the cafe in between had obviously been to create an alibi it never occurred to them that christian might have been tied up and left alone for all that time it was always assumed that his attacker had stayed with him throughout wouldnt risk leaving him to be found by someone else if the boy had been discovered his attacker could have returned straight into the arms of a gendarme welcoming party duclos had taken quite a risk but i didnt realize it till i came out of the darkness the field darkness mentioned again a period of darkness between the first and second attacks probably a blindfold hed discussed it on the phone with marinella calvan late thursday linking details from the transcript with what was known from the original investigation guide points for the next session green sports car christian hadnt said that it was an alfa romeo it could be argued that there were other green sports cars in the area at the time already he found himself preproposing the points that corbeix might raise by midafternoon monday with no call from corbeix other concerns sprang to mind perhaps corbeix was staunch rpr and wouldnt dream of going near the case he phoned verfraigne and at the end of a conversation about corbeix overall strength and track record as a prosecutor asked casually about his political leaning hes a socialist i think surely hed made allowances for the tenuous nature of the case in his opening letter he was just seeking guidance at this stage what they should be looking for in the remaining sessions what might help turn the case from something purely tentative exploratory into something prosecutable surely corbeix wouldnt just cast it aside at this first stage surely corbeix call came through finally at just after five oclock suggesting a meeting for eleventhirty the next day dominic remembered that at that time marinella calvan would be in the midst of the second session and suggested a delay until twothirty or three by then i could bring another transcript with me which might throw more light on the case corbeix agreed to three oclock no indication either way as to what he thought reflected dominic it had taken him a moment to recognize corbeix voice husky slightly breathless it was almost a different voice to that on friday corbeix had kept things short and seemed eager to get off the line when the transcript arrived the next day the period between the two attacks the darkness was no longer a mystery just a spare wheel space was very tight i was curled up around it i could hardly move dominics hands were trembling by the time he finished reading he closed his eyes and breathed deeply fighting to settle his nerves forcibly tried to return some calm and rationality before he left to see corbeix dominic had photocopied the transcript he followed down in his copy as corbeix read his lets move on to after when you were by the bike you mentioned a period of darkness why was it dark i was in the boot of the car the mans car the same man with you by the bike yes was there anything else in the boot with you any bags or luggage anything that you could see or feel no just a spare wheel space was very tight i was curled up around it i could hardly move were you tied up yes my hands and my feet and a cloth around my mouth could you move at all just a little backwards with my legs but i only tried once when wed stopped and i heard some voices outside i kicked against the side of the car do you think they heard you no after a second i heard a car door shut and the sound of a car starting and driving away was it a woman or a man you heard two women and while you were stopped did you hear anything else only traffic passing some other cars pulling up and leaving but most were more distant no other voices going back before before you stopped could you hear anything could you tell which way you were heading no not really after a moment i could tell that we were passing some buildings but i wasnt sure if it was taragnon or bauriac i couldnt tell which way wed headed when you stopped how long did it seem you were there for at least half an hour im not sure i became tired it was very hot inside there at one point i fell asleep i was thinking about my father as i fell asleep i started dreaming about him what did you dream i dreamt that i was in my camp at the farm and my father was in the courtyard at the bottom of the field i leapt up to surprise him and started waving but he couldnt see me were you upset that he couldnt see you yes i started running towards him waving more frantically and shouting but still he didnt see me and finally he just turned and walked back towards the house i felt that hed deserted me i kept thinking why doesnt my father come out and find me why doesnt he he was the camp somewhere you used to play often yes it was one of my favourite hideaways and did you ever take your friends there only stephan once but there was another place we used to go together a camp we made in a tree hollow not far from where he lived we would christian went off at a tangent describing his hideaway games with stephan which linked in turn to recall of other times christian had hidden the roof eaves at the farm a stock cupboard at school marinella calvan wasnt able to get him back to the car boot to discover what happened next the early part of the session had been general detail to settle christian into the mood then calvan had tried to continue from where christian had left off last time sitting by his bike with duclos touching him christians responses were mostly garbled incoherent and two aborted attempts later calvan changed tack abruptly to after the bike honing in on the period of darkness as corbeix came to that part dominic noticed him flinch slightly his mood discernibly darker and more intense dominic had felt his blood run cold at the thought of christian tied like a trussed chicken in the cramped darkness of the car boot while duclos sat in the restaurant and sipped at a glass of chilled chablis was it just for an alibi or was duclos calmly deciding while he sipped at his wine what he was going to do next with the boy kill him or perhaps a bit more buggery beforehand perhaps he should choose his dessert first and then decide bastard despite conscious effort to calm himself the past two hours dominic knew his reaction might still be volatile if corbeix started to propose soft options corbeix rubbed the bridge of his nose and looked up in your initial letter you mentioned that duclos main alibi was him being seen in the restaurant how long was he there an hour an hour and a quarter perhaps so in total the boy could have been in the car boot as much as an hour and a half yes as corbeix went back to reading for the first time dominic glanced around the room trophy for racquetball toulon three more trophies with inscriptions too small for him to read harbourside photo with corbeix his wife and two young girls presumably his daughters smiling proudly beside a speedboat that hardly looked big enough to carry them all family photo with corbeix wife and four young girls ranging from seven or eight to early teens corbeix the sportsman and family man late forties corbeix was a few inches smaller than dominic broad and quite lean a squat bullish figure a powerful presence in court according to verfraigne relentless if he strongly believed in a case he had thick wavy black hair swept back and piercing dark brown eyes his eyelids deeply hooded eyes that seemed to tire slightly with the reading or perhaps simply more sullen and grave as duclos actions sank home computer replacing the old black typewriter airconditioning instead of a fan beige carpet over the tile floor minitel and fax apart from that the palais de justice offices were much as they were thirty years before it seemed somehow surreal that all those years had passed since he sat in a similar office with perrimond poullain and naugier a young gendarme merely washed along on the tide of events this time he had the chance to make his mark but despite that he couldnt help reflecting ironically if today might not be that different he would still be a passenger aboard the direction corbeix chose when corbeix had finished reading the transcript he spent the first fifteen minutes going back between the two transcripts and dominics original letter and files sent mostly clarifying points with dominic from the original investigation timing of the attack forensics duclos reported movements before and after and the prosecution path and trial procedure pursued with machanaud finally returning to the current information and how it tied in when the file had initially arrived with corbeix hed started reading the attached transcript as if it was from a new witness before realizing it was meant to be the victims voice gained through a past life regression on a psychiatrists couch hed almost sent the file straight back with a note you must be joking but then he read beyond the first page of the covering letter from fornier and started through the attached files calvan and lambournes credentials medical and psychiatric evaluations past authenticated plr cases past investigations involving evidence from psychics struck not so much by the credibility they strived to lend the transcript but the strong plea he sensed behind fornier had gone to a lot of trouble to prove this case was prosecutable more effort than most investigators went to from the slough of mediocre police paperwork which crossed his desk and then he saw why fornier had married the victims mother the first hurdle to be tackled not sure how to broach the subject tactfully corbeix went through the thought processes very much as theyd hit him someone elses name should be on the file as leading the investigation if your names there it could be argued theres personal bias your judgement has been coloured corbeix suggested a name gerard malliene an aix based inspector fornier didnt know him corbeix quickly salved forniers look of concern it would still be very much your investigation its just a name to head the files its his jurisdiction and hes detached from any personal involvement youll be named in an advisory capacity for input from the original investigation in reality the investigation will run the other way around youll lead malliene will lend an impartial voice advise where he can initially put out by the suggestion dominic understood corbeix rationale at least it meant corbeix had been thinking seriously about the case so you think theres a chance of launching this case successfully corbeix held one hand up thats not what im saying theres grounds for an investigation no more enough to reopen the case for a rogatoire general which ill get an examining magistrate to sign off first thing tomorrow but a case for prosecution is another matter we dont have nearly enough yet and im still waiting on some outside input corbeix glanced towards the files dominic had sent one of them is the prosecutor mentioned in the petit gregoire case you sent through the other a legal expert at the sorbonne apparently strong on procedural structure for the unorthodox a weekend of notes and two twenty minute phone conversations earlier that day and the prospects looked dismal psychics were used but their testimonies rarely featured in case preparation in the yorkshire ripper case the suspect had already been interviewed and eliminated but a psychic later described his truck and the police returned to question him final trial papers were prepared on other evidence uncovered and subsequently a confession the psychics lead didnt feature the cases with le petit gregoire stanley holliday and son of sam were similar final prosecution relied almost exclusively on other evidence or a final confession as corbeix delivered his stark summary dominics expression clouded corbeix grimaced apologetically its almost as if investigators are afraid to mention the involvement of psychics in court i suppose going to a psychic is a sort of admission of defeat for them all our normal investigative skills and channels have failed so now were coming to you investigators are reluctant to admit that or perhaps theyre advised of the difficulty of convincing a jury by a prosecutor like myself but in the case of therese basta dominic tried to recall the name from his file notes a few days back i thought there was quite a lot of psychic evidence presented in court teresita basa joseph chua recalling details of her murder through voices in his dreams yes nearly all of his evidence was presented in court but the first hearing resulted in a hung jury if it hadnt been for the killers confession and a change of plea to guilty the case probably wouldnt have been successfully prosecuted corbeix observed dominic look down and to one side as if searching for a thought just out of reach i noticed a lot of your files were from interpol general reference corbeix knew that only central reference carried official police and court records general was from outside mostly newspapers independent reports or extracurricula police notes corbeix patted the files newspapers are often keen to report on cases involving psychics good copy in cases with no other leads the police will also admit to speaking with psychics but preparing for the trial the psychics invariably get forgotten what about the mansonbugliosi case dominic asked different more thought transference and influence than pure psychic evidence and even then still a very difficult case to prove a landmark case at the time the case was built mainly on the premise of one person strongly influencing others which is quite widely accepted whereas what we have here past lives and reincarnation is not theres never been a case like this before there has apparently two both in india dominic relished the brief surprise on corbeix face one small victory swimming against the increasing tide of defeat marinella calvan will get more information from her colleague dr donaldson and let me know tomorrow yes yes id be interested but im not sure how much it will help us corbeix shrugged india in a way it underlines my last point there reincarnation is accepted here it is not initially dominic thought corbeix was hopeful there was a case to answer now it seemed all the avenues were blocked they were almost back to where hed been at the outset thinking that approaching a prosecutor was pointless many of the cases youve mentioned appear to have succeeded through the police requestioning suspects and gaining confessions dominic commented with this new evidence we might be able confront duclos from the perspective that we know how he did it know that he sat in the restaurant with the child in the car boot between the two attacks the position is surely now far stronger to achieve that tone too venturesome tenuous thought dominic sounded how he felt clutching at straws it helps but in most of those cases there was usually some other hard evidence in place before the police pressured for a confession thats what were missing and in the case of duclos a wily politician and past prosecutor wed be lucky to get past his hotshot lawyer whod first review how we got all of this marvellous information even if we were lucky enough to get duclos in for questioning hed either say nothing or deny either way hed know we couldnt pursue with what we had dominic gripped tight at the transcript in his hand to get this far and let everything slip an image of duclos raising his glass gloating a sense of loss of despair that what before seemed so close within grasp was now slipping away a cold sinking pall that jarred against his nerves against every precept of true justice however much he should have been hardened the past thirtyfive years to the fact that the law and justice were so often at odds however much he realized corbeix was probably right at forniers crestfallen look corbeix felt the need to buoy his spirits hopefully in the next day or so we might get some useful input from the people ive been in touch with corbeix said concerned that forniers personal links and absorption with the case might lead to false expectancies hed accentuated the negative so there were no illusions about the enormous obstacles faced but now he feared he might have painted too dark a picture i prepared this earlier key points which i thought would help strengthen the case some are essential others merely desirable dominic took the single sheet from corbeix and read psychic evidence little or no presentation of it in trial papers or court strong angle required beyond purely authentication of plr fresh clues or tangible evidence uncovered from the sessions that clearly ties duclos in with the boy and can be corroborated independently perhaps someone who saw the boy in duclos car duclos background with young boys duclos is apparently married a claim that he has no history with young boys yet this one day totally out of the blue he sexually molests and kills this particular young boy would not appear credible to an examining magistrate or jury authentication of sessions taking place in london a french notary would have to sit in on one of the sessions confirm that in his view it was real and was conducted correctly within whatever guidelines prevail for hypnotic psychotherapy in other words not faked corbeix was leaning over pointing the first point weve mostly covered the last is essential if we want to present any of the tapes or transcripts in court ill arrange it when are the final two sessions next tuesday and then thursday tuesdays too tight ill lay it on for thursday phone you tomorrow with the details corbeix made a quick note on a pad but the main key to the case will rest with points two and three if you manage to get some background on duclos and young children then we might have a chance of pressuring him in an interview situation as you suggested earlier its unlikely hell confess to murder faced purely with child molestation but even if we get him on just that hes facing up to five years and even if hes finally cleared with the surrounding publicity it will certainly mean the end of his political career so they had a shot at destroying duclos career and possibly a few years prison if he could find something not the justice due scant consolation but a start minutes ago corbeix had been a stone wall now at least he was throwing down a lifeline however thin im sure you have your contacts to track down such things corbeix opened his hands out but our main hope rests with you finding some tangible clue in the remaining sessions something which can be corroborated then we might just might be able to successfully prosecute for murder go the full course a tangible clue dominic mimicked corbeix blandly as if saying it to himself would help and then the ludicrousness hit him thirty years what earthly chance was there even if they were lucky enough to uncover something half the people who could possibly corroborate were dead but for the first time that afternoon corbeix appeared hopeful enthusiastic so in the end as they went through the final details and next contact times and concluded their meeting dominic rode aboard that wave pushed his doubts and sense of hopelessness to the back of his mind applied a singular focus and let it shine through all else the daunting odds the potential drawbacks and obstacles until finally it was the only thing left in view a tangible clue and only two sessions left to find it thirtyfour limoges june a boy betina had gone ahead with the scan duclos focused his attention back as the windscreen wiper swung across the rain had been heavy earlier but now it was just light drizzle the wipers were on intermittent the lights had turned green but the car ahead was slow in moving off charity function the fourth already this year annoying but necessary betina was beside him in a satin blue evening dress which hid her five month pregnancy well until she sat down baby blue it would be all right he told himself any worries were years ahead while the boy was a baby he would be betinas responsibility something to keep her occupied she would be busy with nappies and feeding and he could use the excuse of the baby waking and crying to sleep in the second bedroom away from the occasional night time grabs that increasingly made his skin crawl the pregnancy had been marvellous she hadnt touched him in all of the five months the first eighteen months would probably be just like an extended pregnancy then when he was a toddler she would be busy knitting mittens and running after him to make sure he didnt fall down the stairs or stick his fingers in the electricity sockets father would retire to his study with the excuse of a heavy evening workload and lock the door solitude the whole sad saga might not be so bad might actually provide some good opportunities for him to keep his distance from betina traffic was moving faster along rue montmailler duclos picked up speed keeping up it wouldnt be until his son was older at least six or seven that he might be reminded of other boys and events hed rather not think about the secret life hed been so careful to keep away from home he never went with boys while in limoges and tried as much as possible not to even think about them it was only on his trips away to paris or marseille that he indulged himself everything kept away in thought and in deed from his own doorstep under his own roof a questioning or quizzical look and he would wonder if his son somehow knew he would flash back on the various times hed seen the boy changing or dressing from the bath or shower and wonder if on any of those occasions his gaze had lingered a second longer than it should unconsciously sparked off the boys suspicion and if he had been guilty of that he would torture himself whether it was because in that moment hed been reminded of someone else or some past pleasurable instant because surely he would never look at his own son in that way surely the brake lights loomed suddenly ahead blurred through the raindrops on the windshield a moment suspended and then he braked the wheels locked and the car started skidding he remembered most about the incident looking back at it he wasnt hurt badly just a bump on the head which had given him a few moments blackout betinas side of the car had received the brunt of the smash and as he rode with her in the ambulance in the moments she drifted back to consciousness she gripped his hand muttering my baby my baby please the bottom of her silk dress was soaked in blood and one of the medics had cut through it with scissors swabbing away the excess blood and feeling her stomach concernedly the final moment of the accident replayed in his mind and he kept wondering why had he been so late in braking and why at the last moment did he swing to one side let betinas side catch the main impact preoccupation the delay in detaching from his thoughts partly answered the first and some dumb throwback reflex from being used to driving alone the second but even in that moment as his guilt was at its zenith and he clutched his wifes hand and she clung in turn to the life inside her part of him some small part nesting the rest of the dark secrets and shadows of his life was already coming around to recognizing the real reason he pushed the thought away and clutched tighter at his wifes hand tired so tired the afternoons were usually worse than the mornings henri corbeix was still in his office the light on the past half hour as dusk approached sitting in the same position for so long making notes his back felt stiff he straightened up paced to one side to ease it but even with that effort his legs trembled uncertainly with the fresh weight he looked ruefully towards his office cabinet he hadnt played racquetball for more than two years hed battled on a year after the diagnosis before it had finally become too much at first hed felt it just on stretching for the low balls the ones almost beyond reach he had always previously been able to get but soon his legs started to twinge and spasm on even the easy shots and he would be breathless and exhausted after the first fifteen minutes he gave up before it became embarrassing for his opponents the only thing hed managed to keep up were the weekend summer outings on their boat moored at les leques a days fishing bread brie and pate a bottle of wine and some soft drinks in the polystyrene cooler for the girls maybe head across the bay to ile verte but this summer even that he feared might be out of the question the last time out hed felt the twinges and muscle spasms come on increasingly particularly if the sea was choppy hed hardly been able to brace his legs against the repetitive pounding a staccato reminder of how the disease had ravished his body bit by bit attacking his muscle tissue and nerves until finally the simplest action tired him moving around a courtroom a period of concentration and making notes ms multiple sclerosis the drugs to treat it were crammed in his bottom drawer steroids baclofen oxybutin methylprenistolne there was no cure but they would help him cope ease the muscle spasms when they struck according to the doctor some days were better than others he wondered why he still hid the drugs under papers in his bottom drawer habit from the first period of knowing he had the condition but now half of his department knew and had done so for almost the past year soon after hed announced his staged retirement full time up until the coming august recess in order to clear his current caseload then he would step down as chief prosecutor and work mornings only for a year in an advisory capacity to his successor herve galimbert at present his assistant then he would retire completely unless his illness went into remission unlikely the past few months had been the worst hed feel exhausted immediately upon waking up then would gain a burst of energy from his steroids which might if he was lucky last through till late afternoon but if he had a heavy day or courtroom appearances he would start to flag earlier often when he came home from a days work his youngest chantelle only seven would jump up in his arms and hed hardly have the strength to carry her more than a few feet the anguish of his disease would hit him strongest in those moments he was denying them his other three daughters hed been able to happily lift and swing around at leisure he would become increasingly a burden until finally there was nothing left but to sit quietly in the corner and occasionally rub his cramped legs while his daughters asked him if he wanted another coffee or something else to read his anger and defiance rose up strongly they were going out on the boat this year if it killed him corbeix sat down and looked at his notes the next session was tomorrow morning final session thursday notary arranged to travel with fornier to london he hadnt told fornier about his illness and that he wouldnt be able to pursue any trial cases beyond august no point whatever stage the case was at then he would merely hand over to galimbert who was perfectly capable fornier had enough on his plate with trying to track down paedophile leads and find tangible clues from the remaining two sessions without having to worry about a change of prosecutor halfway through corbeix looked at his calendar three weeks left in april august even if something came up quickly and he was able to file charges within a month they would be lucky to be through the first four or five instruction hearings by then going back through his notes and forniers files the enormity of the case struck him leading politician murder a landmark procedural case the first of its kind in france based on such unorthodox evidence it would make the tapie scandal look like a parking ticket but it was all so tenuous out of reach too many obstacles too many contingencies which was probably another reason why he hadnt mentioned anything to fornier he doubted that fornier would even cross the first hurdle there wouldnt be a case to prosecute yet a corner of his mind where he also contemplated what he would do if he won the lottery or woke up one morning with his illness suddenly gone realized that if fornier defied all odds and found something it would certainly be the biggest case of his career a fitting curtain bow it would be tempting to see it all the way through corbeix shook his head he would file and put it in motion set it on the right track then hand over to galimbert in august as hed originally planned he didnt have the energy left for glory session the tape rolled silently the sound of marinella calvan tapping on the computer keys and then phillipes voice in french with five of them in the room looking on expectantly at the lone figure of eyran capel on the couch the atmosphere was tense or perhaps it was because dominic knew this was their last chance did you go into the local village with your parents often yes but mostly at the weekend hardly ever in the week when i was at school what sort of places did you go in the village with your parents mostly the shops with my mother sometimes we would stop at a cafe for a drink and there was a farm provision store four kilometres beyond bauriac where i would sometimes go with my father at the back they dominic tuned it out marinella had mentioned the first moments were normally general background to settle christian into the mood dominic looked back at the transcript from the last session and his own notes in the margin when you finally came out of the darkness of the car boot and your eyes adjusted to the light what did you see the field the wheat field and the lane by the river anything else was there anyone that you could see there apart from yourself and the man whod taken you there in his car no there was nobody tell me what you heard there could you hear anything out of place no not really just the river running in the distance the sound of the wind through the trees think hard was there anything else even the smallest sound at any time while you were in the wheat field some other water running spilling on the ground anything else some bells faint in the distance but the light was fading and another light reaching out but i couldnt feel my hand the pain the garbled and incoherent here words mostly unintelligible eyran moved on dominic had scribbled in the margin church bellssound of water how far away he brought his attention back as he heard marinella mention church shed moved deftly from other places christian regularly visited in the village to church visits and while you were there with your parents either before or afterwards do you remember the sound of the church bells ringing yes sometimes usually before we went they were ringing can you fix that sound in your mind and remember it clearly now muted yes from eyran and going back again now back to when you had come out of the darkness of the car boot and into the light you mentioned the sound of a bell ringing was it the same sound you remember from the church or something else no it was different not so distant and higher pitched a tinkling sound goats bells dominic remembered machanaud in his statement leaving at that moment because a farmer was moving his goats into the adjoining field the same farmer had probably disturbed duclos and christian was obviously still conscious in those final few moments dominic was suddenly hit with a thought he scribbled a hasty note and passed it to marinella calvan she was halfway through tapping out a fresh question but realized it would be difficult to later backtrack to his she backdeleted and typed about that same time did you hear the mans car starting up or moving no i dont remember that i didnt hear anything else ith there was nothing so christian had blacked out between the farmer approaching and duclos moving his car a minute or two at most dominic had noticed lambourne look over sharply as hed passed marinella the note lambourne had appeared uncomfortable at the introduction of the notary fenouillet who made periodic notes while observing the interplay between marinella philippe and eyran capel dominic had claimed a desire to file some of the transcripts along with other official papers about the murder for that notary authentication was necessary it was the closest marinella felt they could come to the truth fenouillet didnt speak sufficient english for lambourne to question him directly and thankfully philippe had kept in the background before that you recalled clearly the sound of water running and splashing not the river running but something else how far away was that sound could you tell what it was it was quite close only a few yards water spilling from something onto the ground was the sound coming from where the man with the car was standing yes i think so memories of perrimond claiming machanaud had washed down the blood from his apron front with a bucket of water from the river but where had duclos got water from he hadnt left the boy long enough to go down to the river and back silence marinella flicking a page forward in some notes before tapping out again after those moments in the wheat field do you have any recall of incidents with your parents no cant remember rememm muted mumbling that faded away eyrans eyelids pulsed and he strained slightly as if images were there but he couldnt see them clearly and do you think thats why the wheat field has come to symbolize separation from your parents why you keep returning to it in your thoughts no no its not that not the pulsing settled images clearing its just that when i try to think beyond it i cant cant marinella pressed while she felt the advantage the first gambit had perhaps been too hopeful getting christian to admit the influence of the wheat field on eyrans dreams and your friend did the field become a symbol of separation from him too no i used to play there with stephan thats all it reminded me of that that was all i thought of when i saw the wheat field playing us playing there together do you go back to the wheat field in your thoughts to play with stephan no no more eyran swallowed slowly and since how do you feel about it now what do you feel when you think about the wheat field i dont know somm eyran looked away slightly nerve muscles tensed at his temples christians thoughts clawing up through three decades of darkness fighting to surface something warm bright but i cant feel the warmth cant feel eyrans head started shaking slowly from side to side ithh there was nothing after only a faint light beyond the darkness but i cant feel cant feee dominic noticed lambourne sit forward sharply marinella had told him about lambourne threatening to end the sessions if eyran looked in danger of verging into a catatonic state and she had already come close a few times now again she was walking the tightrope lets go back back break away marinella could sense lambournes hand hovering on the desk beside her about to reach out for the keyboard she didnt dare look around kept her eyes fixed between eyran and the keyboard marinella had explained that the field was central to eyrans therapy and how she had hoped to leap from there to a vital element dominic had related from corbeix getting christian to admit that the man with the car duclos had killed him if not the defence could wriggle out by claiming culpability only for the sexual assaults that the boy was left unharmed after that but as marinella had warned dominic initially it was the hardest possible thing to get the boy to admit and now any possible opportunities to make the leap had probably gone i understand that those memories are unpleasant that you dont wish to recall them but beneath that beneath the detail that i know is painful for you you know that something bad happened to you that day you know that dont you eyrans brows knitted a slight swallow yesi and you know that somehow the man in the car was responsible why you werent able to see your friend that day you know that the man hit you and stopped you from going marinella knew the word kill would produce another rush reaction do you remember the man hitting you dominic tensed as he realized she was going for it after all hed felt sure she would move eyran on to another memory he saw lambourne look incredulously between her and the computer as eyrans brow knitted harder if it wasnt the man with the car marinella pressed if it was someone else then tell us was it someone else who hit you eyrans head started shaking again small beads of sweat popped on his forehead no no it was him lambournes voice came almost immediately i cant believe you did that eyrans head tilted his brow creasing again he looked suddenly perplexed marinella tapped out on the screen and i cant believe you did that either broke the onevoice rule philippe looked up from the screen and shrugged smiling shed forgotten to put it in brackets but he knew not to translate marinella continued tapping weve already got the problem of nonacceptance with two children lets not add another to the list that you cant accept i might be right lambournes expression was thunderous he looked frustratedly between the screen and her this was great she thought argument by computer except that lambourne couldnt answer because she was hugging the keyboard and he couldnt risk speaking again just the sort of argument she liked dread gripped dominic as he expected lambourne to suddenly stop the session quickly overrode his brief amusement and admiration at calvans feistiness philippe was still beaming and fenouillet had merely paused in his notetaking had no idea what was going on but finally lambourne just shook his head and waved one hand dismissively as if the whole argument was suddenly unworthy though some last fleeting shadow in lambournes eye the way he looked quickly between marinella himself and fenouillet made dominic suspect lambourne might already be thinking so many questions around the murder and was a notary really necessary for just a filing going back to where you left your bike the field and the farm track did you hear anything there tell me what you heard there was nothing really just the wind slightly anything else are there any sounds in the background anything you can hear at all dominic noted the change from past to present tense are there after the last session marinella told him about a special new york based fbi unit which specialized in hypnotizing crime witnesses to gain more accurate descriptions the present tense put the witness directly back in the scene detail was usually far more accurate and in depth marinella had used the same technique in the last session with eyran but the results had been disappointing apart from the segment with the water running and the bells ringing theyd gained little of value shed asked christian if he remembered any shops theyd passed in the mans car if he saw anyone on the way to where his bike was if he saw anyone in the field or on the track by his bike if any other vehicles passed apart from the marseille truck nothing nothing nothing hed banged his desk and kicked filing cabinets in frustration reading the transcript now she was asking if he heard anything by his bike again nothing they were fast running out of areas to explore marinella went back to the marseille truck asking christian to concentrate on the letters on the side are there any other letters or words you can see le le something pont anything else it was hopeless thought dominic fragments of words from a truck from over thirty years ago even if by some miracle they traced it a driver flashing by just for a few seconds all those years back what on earth would he remember goats bells theyd interviewed the farmer shortly after machanaud mentioned him but hed seen nothing tree coverage was too thick by the river what else was there water splashing a womans voice in a car park pathetic dominic looked anxiously at the clock twenty minutes left the letters had fizzled out with an ei pontei not even a full word marinella was flicking back in her notes as if searching desperately where to head next and in that moment the realization finally struck him dissolved his anxiety and clinging expectation to a sinking hollowness concrete to jello they werent going to find anything shed exhausted all the main avenues and now was just scrambling around the edges at fragments he could almost imagine duclos smiling at them gloating marinella moved back to the subject of separation this time other people christian had felt separation from that day apart from his parents and his friend probably best dominic conceded dolefully with no new clues forthcoming at least she could satisfy the main aim of the therapy gloating as he sat in the restaurant sipping wine as he untied and assaulted christian for a second time as he smashed down the rock repeatedly on christians skull bludgeoning the life out of him dominic shook his head the images were unbearably intense because now they knew that duclos had done it but would have little choice but to sit back and watch him walk away and dominic would feel the same sense of loathing and disgust each time he saw duclos face in a newspaper smiling gloating as he opened some new industrial park smiling from a campaign rostrum gloating at them that hed got away with it his arm coming down repeatedly to strike home his campaign points in the same way that hed brought the rock down on christians head that day and he would hardly be able to bear to look knowing knowing that grandpapa andre the name cut abruptly into dominics thoughts one name among christians recital of separation he hadnt heard before father mother clarisse but not grandpapa andre dominic read the full line on the computer screen i remember thinking about grandpapa andre i clung to the luck he gave me dominic scribbled a frantic note what luck why where is he and handed it to marinella calvan she typed what luck was it that grandpapa andre gave you it was a coin a lucky coin and were you holding the coin when you thought about grandpapa andre yes i was gripping it tight in my hand before i fell asleep and then i realized suddenly when i awoke that it had dropped from my hand where were you when it dropped in the boot of the mans car and were you able to find the coin no it was dark i felt around but there was only the spare wheel i couldnt feel it on the wheel or around the sides i was still feeling for it when the boot opened the light stung my eyes and when you realized youd dropped the coin did it make you fear that something bad might happen yes yes in the darkness it helped me it was something i knew a reminder of home but then when it had gone as marinella returned to attachment and loss dominic touched her arm lightly silently nodded his excuse and left the room nothing else of interest was likely to come up and he couldnt bear waiting the ten minutes remaining to know he went through lambournes reception and out into the street dialling out on his mobile to monique in lyon on the third ring it answered and he cut quickly through the preambles a coin a lucky coin that christians grandfather gave him do you remember it yes i do hesitance flustered by the sudden jump to a memory from thirty years ago but why its important somethings come out of the sessions in london ill tell you later sudden chill as he realized he wouldnt be able to delay any longer that night he would have to tell her everything his buried doubts the car sighting machanaud jeanlucs wasted suicide what sort of coin was it an italian twenty lire silver was it rare fairly jeanlucs father had brought it back from italy years before he gave it to christian on his eighth birthday dominic was silent thoughtful if duclos had seen the coin hed have thrown it away straightaway but christian hadnt been able to feel for it what if it had dropped behind the spare wheel or some tools out of sight a chance just a chance he confirmed that monique hadnt found it later among any of christians things with all the confusion with the investigation and christian in the hospital it got forgotten i didnt notice it was missing till months later but its obviously important now very important why and again he assured her that hed tell her that night diverted quickly to pleasantries before signing off a generation of hiding the truth from his wife and still he was playing for time lucky coin dominic reflected ruefully the only luck might be thirtytwo years later it finally bringing some justice and vindication for christian rosselot thirtyfive limoges june a miracle duclos looked at the pathetic figure of his new born son through two layers of glass the first separating the observation room from intensive care the second the glass of the incubator scrawny hardly an adults forearm in length and purplish blue all that was keeping him alive was the oxygenated sanitized air of the incubator and the mass of pipes feeding and monitoring a miracle that would probably only last a few hours according to the doctors his son would be lucky to make it through the night those few hours strongly etched in his memory a glass case how he would forever remember his son timelessly preserved in a glass cabinet a freak of nature an exhibit betina still hadnt come round from the anaesthetic the only option left to save her and the baby had been caesarean intersection horrifically rushed the anaesthetist had hardly finished his countdown and response tests before the surgeon made his incision some monitors were still being attached as he cut betina had begged and pleaded for her babys life as theyd wheeled her frantically on a gurney towards the operating theatre the attending emergency medic had gripped her hand and assured dont worry youll be okay but entering surgery the graver atmosphere and more concerned expressions made her panic that everything might not be okay if theres a choice save my baby first put his life before mine we try our best not to make choices the surgeon commented unless god forces our hand betina was still struggling with the significance of this was about to press the surgeon for a clearer assurance when the anaesthetic bit she probably wouldnt awake for two or three hours yet duclos reflected what was he going to tell her hes alive but hell be dead soon doctors did their best shame or perhaps he would spend an hours more bedside vigil with his son then sneak away on the promise of returning a couple of hours later but get delayed leave it to the doctors to tell betina avoid the drama of seeing her in tears in the same way he had avoided every other drama and confrontation with betina through the years besides they were more expert than him were used to choosing the rights words in this sort of situation every day hed be hopeless worse still if the boy died before betina awoke it was best if he wasnt there he couldnt possibly face her given that circumstance at least with a few hours of life remaining shed cling to some hope some solace theyd even talked about a name joel hello joel he murmured and saw his breath mist the glass as he pressed his face closer the frail figure so pathetic and defenceless with all the tubes and monitors attached reminded him in that moment of christian rosselot in the hospital of him reaching out to stifle the last life from the boy he shivered involuntarily had he really been so desperate how could anyone anyone and in that moment as his eyes welled uncontrollably a tear trickling down it hit him that it might just as well be his hand reaching across and stifling joel realization that his turning the wheel at the last moment hadnt just been instinctive selfpreservation in part hed responded to some dark inner fear however irrational of future complications he wouldnt be able to face was that why he was crying now he thought tears of remorse the first he could remember flowing freely because the sight of his son an actual life rather than a shadow of shapes on a scan from his wifes womb had reached out and gripped him hard or was it because he knew now with certainty that his son would die as he was now would never grow beyond the pathetic shrivelled form before him the tears could be safely shed all worries whether real or ridiculously imagined in his own mind were over it hardly mattered now when all that remained was a few hours of life preserved in a glass case what else was there but pity sorrow he was a politician he knew the right emotion for every occasion between his other work dominics occasional glances towards the phone the past hour had become increasingly anxious after his initial call to lepoille theyd spoken again an hour later then nothing since almost half the day had gone now for lepoille to find something what had happened seven months duclos had obviously been keen to dispose of the car unpleasant memories the papers were strewn across his desk faxed pages from an alfa romeo owners club in paris users manual alfa romeo giulietta sprint car registration for the next owner after duclos maurice caugine an address in st junien thirty kilometres from limoges details of the car boot and position of the spare wheel and tool kit were on the seventh page faxed through the spare wheel had eight oval holes around its perimeter each one double the length of a large coin easily large enough for the lire coin to have fallen through hed gained a photocopied picture and details of the coin from a collectors catalogue italian lire silver g emanuele iii on head lictor hailing roma on reverse edition minted between and the spare wheel took up half the boot space as christian had described space would have been cramped even curled in almost a foetal position part of his body or at least his arms must have been pinned above the wheel if hed fallen asleep and dropped the coin it could have easily have landed on top of the wheel and through one of the oval holes or at first had fallen on top of the wheel then with the vibrations and movement of the car or christian shifting position found its way to one of the holes if the coin had fallen to the side of the wheel duclos would have spotted it easily and pocketed it or thrown it away but if it had fallen through one of the holes seven months what were the chances of duclos not changing his wheel in that time whoever had been the first to change the wheel would have seen the coin maurice caugine had kept the car for over three years the chances of him not changing the wheel in that time were remote either hed seen the coin or their only chance was probably gone lepoille had called back within the hour bad news maurice caugine had died eight years ago but it looks like he was survived by his wife im trying to track her down now since that call three hours ago nothing dominics spirits had slumped at the news another hurdle now they were dependant not only on maurice caugine having noticed the coin but him having mentioned it to his wife and forcefully enough for it to have stuck in her mind to recall thirty years later corbeix had been initially enthused about the coin lead sounds rare enough to argue that it couldnt have got there any other way than the boy being in duclos boot that day if you can find someone who saw it there let me know how it develops meanwhile ill send a note to malliene about the case theyd already discussed the procedural details dominic would provide a report every week or two weeks as the case dictated and would pass it to malliene to add any comment before he signed it off purely a safeguard so that malliene wasnt signing off anything he disagreed with ill ask him to contact you the next day or so to tie up the details corbeix finished by mentioning he was hoping for more information the next day or so on cases involving psychics from a specialist division of the paris procureurs office dominic was encouraged that the case was increasingly demanding corbeix attention but still it struck him that corbeix hadnt even contacted malliene until he heard about the coin lead and the examining magistrate who signed off the rogatoire general corbeix probably wouldnt call again until he was sure the case was prosecutable there was still some way to go dominic stared again at the phone having built up his own and corbeix hopes it could all be over with a single call madame caugine could have died as well or gone abroad and was practically untraceable or was senile or in a mental asylum couldnt remember anything from the day before let alone thirty years ago the possibilities spun through dominics mind pierre lepoille was on the home straight he tapped in jocelyn caugines identity card number hopefully the office where she cashed her pension would come up and her current address tracking maurice caugine had been easy his identity card number had been on the car registration papers and from there lepoille traced where he last drew his pension before dying la rochelle not far from st junien but madame caugine had been a different matter he had no record of her identity card number nor even her first name the few papers he found for maurice caugine didnt feature his wifes details tracking was therefore more tedious he tried all caugines drawing pension for that year in the area two men one woman the woman was a different address and her husband had died twenty years ago so caugines wife had probably moved out of the area after he died but where he tried several general searches and combinations before giving up some areas brought up far too many caugines for him to search effectively stumped for an immediate answer he went back to some other urgent work hed pushed aside when dominics enquiry came in almost another hour had passed before the thought hit him credit cards not current but any applied for within three years after she had moved most credit agencies had a stipulation of the previous address being noted where the current address was less than three years he searched entering caugine and dourennes the name of their previous street in la rochelle as key words bingo seven choices mostly paris only one in la rochelle jocelyn caugine had applied for a store card in arcachon south of bordeaux two more key strokes and he was able to call up her full details and identity card number he checked her current cashing address for her pension in case shed moved then called dominic it took dominic over two hours to finally get jocelyn caugine on the phone when he first called he was informed by another woman with the same surname josette caugine presumably her daughter that she was out shopping shouldnt be too long the murder case of the decade on hold while this little old lady picked up courgettes and cat food at the local continentale dominic mused he left his name purely as fornier no inspector didnt want to frighten her off hed call later the second call jocelyn caugine answered directly this time dominic introduced himself with his full title she sounded quite alert attentive showed no hesitance with recall yes she remembered the car quite well we often used to drive in it from st julien to la rochelle particularly at the weekends then her voice wavered slightly sounding concerned were not in some sort of trouble are we the we as if her husband was still there to partly shoulder responsibility no no not at all you or your husband have done nothing wrong but it is nevertheless a very important investigation were conducting and any assistance you can offer could be vital i see certainly in any way i can help the perkiness was back in her voice a little old lady helping out on a maigretstyle enquiry probably the most excitement shed had all year i want you to remember back madame caugine back to when your husband had the car do you ever remember him mentioning finding a coin in the car a coin dominic let the silence ride a second her tone was mostly rhetorical selfprompting she was thinking yes a silver coin from italy from italy you say not some french money left there she queried a quick mumbled no from dominic was it particularly valuable no not particularly but as i say its very significant to a case were handling now i dont know i dont seem to recall anything dominic could almost feel her at the other end grappling through the years straining for memories out of reach he sensed that she wanted to help he prompted it was quite a large silver coin twenty lire do you remember your husband finding anything unusual in the car boot brief silence as madame caugine thought deeper then a sigh im sorry no i just cant think of anything i havent been much help have i dominic felt the first twinge of alarm it was slipping away but how likely was it that her husband hadnt changed a wheel in three years he was sure that the memory could be drawn out if he hit the right chord your husband would have probably only seen the coin when he changed the car wheel do you remember him changing the wheel at any time yes yes i do faint hope returning to her voice when was that we were on the way to paris to see his brother we got a flat tyre on the way there did your husband mention seeing anything in the car boot when he took the new wheel out no or over the next few hours or days no not that i recall was it in the daytime was the light good dominic could almost hear the clinging desperation in his own voice yes it was midafternoon dominics mind spun desperately through the other options and do you remember your husband mentioning changing a wheel while he was on his own not that i remember no im sorry perhaps when he changed the wheel that second time he might have mentioned something perhaps doing it before seeing something unusual no nothing im afraid as i said i really cant recall my husband mentioning anything like that her voice was once again flustered now with just a hint of defence dominic felt guilty an image of him pinning the old lady back with increasing interrogation he eased off im sorry yes you did mention it already dominic looked up people busy on the phone keyboards clattering someone scanning the new roster on the notice board dominics gaze cannoned frantically around the squad room in search of inspiration for what he might say next but there was nowhere left to go hed covered everything perhaps you might recall something later stock phrase his mind was still desperately panning in case there was something hed overlooked nothing nothing he left his number if i do remember anything i certainly will inspector dominic thanked her and rang off but he knew she probably wouldnt ring was just being polite shed had perfect recall of the wheel being changed if the coin had been mentioned she would have remembered maurice caugine hadnt seen the coin it was all over dominic stayed late just in case she called packed up finally at almost pm but as he suspected nothing it was already dark as he headed out the spring night air fresh his shoulders were slumped in defeat though in a way he also felt strangely relieved the past two weeks had brought his nerves to the very edge hed hardly slept a full night since hearing the first tape a nightmare of juggling psychiatrists transcripts police and court files with the ghosts of his familys past that he should have known at the outset was best left alone he let out a deep breath felt it all suddenly washing away from him it was over a stiff brandy then he could mentally file it along with the other deep and bitter experiences through the years his life could go back to how it was before marinella calvan had called the phone was ringing as duclos walked in the house no lights were on he flicked on the hallway and lounge switches on the way to picking it up oh its you jaumard the disappointment came through in duclos voice i was expecting a call from somebody else anything important yes im waiting urgently on a call from the hospital i dont have time to talk now whats happened its my duclos stopped himself he didnt want to share the accident saga with jaumard curtailed version my wife shes premature theres been complications i didnt even know she was pregnant you wouldnt its none of your business flat tone impatient issst a boy or a girl duclos cringed he wished now he hadnt said anything boy he could pick up jaumards slurring as usual he had downed a few stiff ones before phoning i must go keep the line thats good you like boys dont you well i hope mother and son are both fffine duclos jaw set tight was this just standard drunken oafish jaumard or some attempt at his brothers line in acid banter he felt like leaping down the phone and battering out what few brains jaumard had left he should have had him killed years ago taken him out the same way as his brother except that he was sure brainless or not jaumard had taken a leaf out of his brothers book and left a similar insurance letter with a lawyer somewhere look as i said i dont have time to i know sssorry i only called now because im shipping out in a few days always the same thought duclos jaumard would hit him for some money just before a voyage the only compensation was that he wouldnt hear from him again for six months a year i see call me tomorrow night when youre sober well make the arrangements then whats his name eynard justin eynard the name meant nothing to dominic the world of parisian vice was strange to him his two years at interpol in paris had been devoted to international cases marseille would have been more familiar territory but nothing had come up through bennacer only this one lead now from deleauvre in paris whats his background started off with girlie bars then later a couple of sex accessory and video shops with under the counter material a lot of it paedophile magazines and videos then finally he opens up a gay disco but a lot of the boys there are under age fourteen fifteen sat in dark corner booths heavily made up so that you would hardly know and if you approach the barman and comment that they look a bit old hell give you an address eyrnard would run a discreet house nearby he also started supplying some of his kids to paedophile porn makers so what have we got on him were close to nailing him through one of his men a recent bust on a paedophile porn ring has led back to eynard their contact ricauve spends a lot of time in eynards disco says that hes not only seen duclos there but seen him go off with one of the barmen who normally escorts clients to their nearby house were cutting a deal with ricauve for information so we should be able to land on eynard like a ton of bricks hes got a lot to lose so were pretty sure hell roll over and finger duclos sounds encouraging dominic could feel his enthusiasm returning after the disappointment of the coin some hope duclos gets away with murder but they nail him for molesting underage boys drag him through the system ruin his career anything from a two to four year sentence it was something at least let me know how the ricauve interview goes dominic signed off lepoille had also tried to pep him up suggesting that it was worthwhile tracking down the car owner after caugine hed get on it right away dominic wasnt hopeful the coin not discovered until almost four years later escaping the notice of both duclos and caugine unlikely but the strongest encouragement had come from monique the night before if you really believe in this so strongly in fact that its haunted you for over thirty years how can you give up now dominics single brandy after work had turned into three it took a while for moniques comments to cut through his despondency perhaps im just tired he offered lamely or was it their sudden reversal of roles from the night before which had thrown him except for his complicity over the car sighting hed told her everything his doubts about machanaud his suspicion of duclos how he had just gone along with the investigative flow machanauds long prison sentence he hadnt mentioned anything through the years because it would have underlined that jeanlucs suicide had been in vain too painful besides it was just a suspicion even when he saw the possibility of gaining fresh evidence through the sessions the same reasons prevailed and he was also sceptical that anything tangible would materialize again there was no point in upsetting you if it was all to come to nothing until the coin the first moment he realized he had a chance of proving something against duclos shadows returning shifting clouds in her eyes doubt disbelief slow acceptance sensing her mood that in a few short sentences hed torn down so many of her long held beliefs about the crime and jeanlucs suicide compacted now by doubts about the openness of their own relationship the secrets harboured over so many years he felt the need to be dramatic its almost as if christian is guiding us through this other boy giving us the clues to track his killer yes uncanny dominic uncanny she was silent for a long while she asked a few mechanical questions about the procedure and the state of play then went to bed soon after her mood was sullen thoughtful little indication of how she felt he was sure it still hadnt fully hit her but when the night following his mood was grey and he felt the case was at a dead end she threw it all back in his face so christians voice is guiding you as if its all somehow ordained meant to be but now youre telling me its impossible ive never accepted what happened dominic but at least ive been able to come to terms with the justice such as it was jeanluc was never able to do even that and suddenly everything that happened then is meant to be wrong youve harboured the doubts for thirty years but you tell me just the other day then the very next you tell me its all over youve hit a dead end the possibility of justice i mentioned the other day forget it no dominic its not going to end like that dominic stressed the legal complexities of the case mostly stock lines repeated from corbeix that psychic evidence presented in court was virtually nonexistent in france without tangible evidence corroborated by a third party they were lost despite the accuracy of the tapes and transcripts and calvans credentials they just wouldnt stand up in court on their own moniques eyes darted frantically as he spoke but there must be something something to her this new situation was just one day old he realized she was invigorated by its freshness to him it was the end of a thirty year trail she had no idea how tired he felt he told her of the few weak options remaining shed knelt in front of him her arms on his thighs her eyes imploring him if thats all thats left dominic then grasp it with both hands chase the next car owner however remote the possibility and if you fail go for whatever remains try and prove duclos background with young boys drag him through the courts ruin his career do whatever you can youve waited thirty years dont give up now first thing dominic called bennacer deleauvre and lepoille things were starting to move again but just before four oclock lepoille called with bad news the car owner after caugine was dead he was a bachelor when he bought the car didnt marry till much later and his wifes dead now too theres a sister he shared an address with for a while though two years before he even bought the car i dont think shell be much use hardly any numbness this time with the events of the day before hed already half accepted that all chances of prosecuting duclos for murder were gone two days later deleauvre called to tell him that their initial visit to pressure eynard hadnt gone well he was very cagey defensive didnt want to say anything without his lawyer present weve arranged another unofficial meeting in one of his clubs with his lawyer present but getting him to roll over for a deal might not be as easy as we first thought depends how his lawyer reacts dominic had visions of even this last hope with duclos slipping through his grasp dominics spirits were still at a low ebb three hours later when the call came through the desk sergeant announced a woman and something about a coin dominics first thought was lepoille tracking down the second owners sister it was jocelyn caugine sorry to trouble you inspector but i did remember something i dont know whether its useful or not my husband bought the car from a garage near limoges they apparently did some sort of tradein with the previous owner perhaps they changed the wheel and saw the coin you mentioned dominic felt his spirits soar do you remember the name of the garage somethingbeau i cant remember exactly but its the only garage for quite a while about four kilometres out of limoges on the st julien road left hand side as you approach limoges madame caugine youre marvellous marvellous well i just hope its useful slightly flustered by his enthusiasm useful dominic smiled incredulously he wanted to hug jocelyn caugine until her cheeks flushed purple dominic ordered the biggest food hamper he could find cognac champagne select cheeses and pates truffles and chocolates and had it messengered to jocelyn caugine with a note from your favourite inspector then he phoned lepoille thirtysix the tgv train hurtled across the flat plain of the sologne three names left to trace dominic called lepoille on his mobile anything yet just bringing it up here we are the sound of lepoilles fingers on the keyboard one more found so far still alive limoges address and yes a telephone number lepoille read it out enunciating clearly so that dominic could hear above the noise of the train nothing as yet on the other two i dont think lepoilles voice drifted as he swung away calling out across the room some mumbled background conversation faint echoing clatter of the computer room imposing the room where dominic had spent so much time the past two days late evenings endless chains of coffees in plastic cups looking expectantly over lepoilles shoulder while he waited for the next internet or asf link instructions bouncing across the room as quick as the key strokes between lepoille and his two team helpers and then finally the names and telephone numbers lepoille was back nothing yet found a relative on one but nothing more well phone as soon as we get something what time will you get there dominic calculated just over an hour more to paris then the connection to rouen about six oclock he could have shaved fifty minutes by flying but it was vital he maintain contact by phone throughout dominic called the new number straight after signing off from lepoille it was engaged madness a boy under hypnosis mentioning a coin from over thirty years ago an old woman remembering the name of a garage and half of interpol division iis computer team had been tied up for two days hundreds of computer records searched nine names and matching identity numbers of the workers in a limoges garage from thirty years ago four traced three dead two left to find any casual workers not on the garage payroll list would be virtually impossible to track down of the four so far traced two were still in limoges one in narbonne and one in rouen not on the phone dominic decided to head to rouen while lepoille continued his search with the train he could stay in touch plus call directly any new traces which came in dominic dialled the number again in limoges serge roudele it answered dominic introduced himself and confirmed with roudele that he worked in the mirabeau garage in yes i did why it concerns an alfa romeo an alfa romeo giulietta sprint the other two workers dominic had spoken to earlier hadnt remembered the car among the hundreds of cars seen by a garage worker over the years how to throw a spotlight on this one car now i know that you probably saw a lot of cars but maybe not so many alfa romeos this was the coupe version quite a classic dark green brief silence then no sorry i dont seem to remember it owner was a young lawyer alain duclos went on to become your local mp rpr party im afraid i was just on the works floor i didnt deal with the owners i hardly knew whose car was whose quite a distinctive car sorry we dealt with so many classics and sports cars they were a strong line for the garage so i saw a lot of them i just cant place it as with the others thought dominic but still he asked about the coin one car among so many might be hard to place but it wasnt every day that a rare coin was found in a car boot an italian twenty lire silver quite large it would probably have fallen down and been concealed by the spare wheel a pause a long pause the sound of a dog barking somewhere in the distance im sorry inspector i really cant remember anything like that at all or do you remember anyone else in the garage finding such a coin any talk about it at all no nothing im afraid well if you do happen to recall anything later give me a call dominic gave his mobile number it would help us enormously in a very important murder case theres no possible recrimination against anyone who might have taken the coin and theres even a small reward francs about double what the coin is worth on todays market the script was practically the same each time setting the scene the car the coin the seriousness of the case the assurance of no recriminations in case of worries about a theft charge the reward as incentive dominic left a marked silence in hope of response but roudele merely repeated that unfortunately he didnt remember anything dominic thanked him and rang off madness hopeless thirty five minutes left to paris hurtling across france on a futile paper chase pursuing a few fragments of memories from decades ago one more lead to check and two more names to chase but despite the odds against them finding anything after all these years dominic felt this strange sense of control of him connected to lepoille and interpols central computer room while speeding towards their next lead at over kmph of lepoille in turn linked to networks of computers the length and breadth of the country searching sorting feeding the information back to him a web of control so wide and powerful it would somehow defeat the odds stacked against them modern france tracking down the clues to christian rosselots murder in a way that was impossible thirty years ago though just over an hour later sitting in a rouen cafe and sipping hot chocolate with a calvados chaser watching through the rain for guy leveque to return to his house one again it felt like good old detective work how it used to be pardon sorry at the sight of her boss with two other men in the cubicle the girl pulled the curtain closed again and went to the next cubicle with her client okay so what have we got asked sauquiere my client names this alain duclos says that he comes to perseus regularly and asks for young boys what does my client get in return deleauvre looked between sauquiere and eynard eynard with his ponytail and ridiculous purple satin shirt over his buddhalike figure sauquiere with his armani blazer furtive darting eyes and greased back hair it was difficult to decide who looked seedier the start of the meeting had been difficult until sauquiere realized the cards deleauvre was holding a clear testimony from ricauve implicating eynard in supplying boys for a child pornographer sauquiere suddenly showed interest in the benefits of his client in turn rolling over and naming somebody else deleauvre sighed hes still going to have to do some time but well make sure its only two rather than what hed face normally four or five with remission hell be out in fifteen months and the clubs perseus will probably have to close for six months sauquiere threw his hands up thats ludicrous its hardly worth cutting a deal deleauvre smiled tightly the closure had hit a sore spot the threat of eynards income squeezed fat retainers being reduced they argued the toss for a while three months one month and then deleauvre thought on an angle gay activists closing perseus could be sensitive if the claim arises that this whole thing has been engineered just to close down one of the main gay night spots it could become politically awkward something the judge would be eager to avoid given pressure from the right quarter fifteen minutes later the foundation of the deal was decided eighteen months to two years maximum for eynard perseus stays open or at worst a one month closure purely as a gesture current house for young boys to close if they wanted to open up discreetly elsewhere then deleauvre didnt want to know but no supply of boys for paedophile magazines and videos sauquiere looked at his diary i cant do tomorrow busy day in court they arranged for ten oclock the following morning session room at the police station taped interview sample statement to be preprepared you check it over then your client gives a statement along those lines in his own words everybodys happy deleauvre smiled and they all shook hands eynard had hardly spoken throughout sauquiere had him well trained a few words at the beginning then later a brief confirmation that his term would be in an open prison ive heard theyre practically like hotels i can still run my business from there catch up on my rabelais deleauvre weaved back through the bar and the girls plying their trade some wore silver satin shorts and black see through halter tops others nothing but a tanga one caught his eye as he passed dipped one finger in her champagne glass pulled her halter to one side to expose a breast and teased the droplet around one nipple provocatively she smiled she was beautiful and very sensuous a young denuevre tempting he smiled in return as if to say next time and made his way out into the street outside in pigalle a half smile lingered on deleauvres face as he took out his mobile fornier would be pleased they had duclos head on a platter dominic was scanning the ground as the voice broke through tails you lose and he looked up to see duclos standing there they were on the path by the wheat field but it wasnt a young duclos it was duclos from the last press photo hed seen duclos had the coin in his hand he opened his palm for a second allowing dominic a tantalizing glimpse of it duclos smiled dominic made a desperate lunge for it but duclos closed his palm tight and swivelled around quickly you lose fornier in the same motion throwing the coin high and wide dominic watched it sailing high over the bushes and trees bordering the lane realizing in sudden panic that if he didnt follow it see where it fell he wouldnt be able to find it later he started running following its path bursting through bushes and foliage feeling them lash across as he frantically ran down the river bank incline please god dont let it reach the river if it fell there they would never find it lost forever among the glint of rocks or beneath the river bed mud the coin sailed high ahead of him as he thrashed frantically through the bushes you lose you lose breathless as he ran a feeling of desolation as the coin soared almost out of sight monsieur coffee a feeling that he couldnt possibly catch up with it before it fell he wouldnt see where it fell wouldnt be able to monsieur coffee dominic woke up a female attendant was pouring a cup for the man across the aisle dominic rubbed his eyes caught her attention and nodded yes please he eased the stiffness from his back as he sat up straight the past few days activity and tension the late nights with lepoille were catching up with him he felt permanently tired the coffee cut through his dry throat cleared his thoughts perhaps that was how it happened duclos saw the coin and threw it straight into the woods or went to the edge of the bank so that it would reach the river or disposed of it later dumped it along with christians shirt and the bloodied rock only one lead left now one hope remaining out of the original nine lepoille had phoned with another name while he waited in the rouen cafe for leveques return home hed called straightaway nothing leveque had been equally as hopeless hardly even remembered the garage let alone the car or the coin portions of the five conversations spun randomly though his mind the man on the second call had commented a coin you say now thats interesting dominics pulse had raced only for the man to continue with a story about his nephew being a keen coin collector i think he has one of that type in his collection bought it not long ago dominic shook his head nearly all of them had appeared more alert at the mention of the coin was it valuable what type did you say was it from a robbery cars they expected to be asked about theyd handled little else for decades but a coin linked to a murder enquiry something different from their daily grind he had been so sure that one of them just one of them would have roudele the thought crashed in abruptly the pause the long pause when hed asked roudele about the coin and a dog had been barking in the distance roudele hadnt asked any questions about the coin showed no curiosity almost as if in that moment it had all come back to him he knew exactly what dominic was talking about he didnt need to ask the thought settled but then it could have been anything a distraction someone walking in the room something interesting on the tv roudele wondering why the dog was barking outside perhaps he should have visited each one personally read their expressions the look in their eyes a distraction or did roudele know something dominic closed his eyes momentarily sighing nothing underlined stronger how little hope he placed in the remaining lead a woman probably a secretary or receptionist certainly she wouldnt have worked on the car herself the only hope was if shed logged or recorded something found from one of the mechanics perhaps one of the three now dead but what were the chances of her knowing something which nobody else in the garage had shared dominic rested back tried to get back to sleep catch another hour before they arrived at lyon he was exhausted when his mobile rang twenty minutes later he was still drifting on the edge thoughts revolving preventing him falling fully under he reached for it expectantly it was deleauvre weve got duclos eynards going to name him the excitement suffused slowly he was still half asleep so tired thats great whens it happening day after tomorrow first thing in the morning deleauvre summarized the deal with sauquiere will any children come forward in support no too sensitive a lot of them are illegals or runaways its complicated eighteen months two years thought dominic the maximum of four or five could only be gained with a child testifying and the claim of abuse poor consolation for murder but at least duclos career would be ruined oh how the mighty fall he commented smiling he thanked deleauvre for his help and they arranged to speak again straight after eynards statement putting down his mobile dominic caught his own reflection in the train window eyes dark circled haunted the face of a man that looked like hed been chasing the same case for thirty years but intermittently electric sparks from the train cut through the darkness outside and his reflection how the investigation felt hurtling through darkness with just a few flashes of hope serge roudele remembered the coin straightaway hed forgotten it had been an alfa romeo coupe hadnt read where forniers questions were heading early in the conversation at the time hed been left his fathers coin collection but wasnt conversant himself with rarity and values the coin had simply looked nice and could have had the potential to be rare but when hed checked it hadnt been that valuable even when hed sold it along with the rest of his fathers collection just over ten years ago he doubted it had garnered more than five or six hundred francs and at todays rate the offer of francs was probably nearly four times its worth inspector fornier was obviously valuing it at almost mint condition his first thought had been theft but would the police really pursue someone over thirty years for a coin of such value and then fornier had mentioned murder and hed felt his blood run cold hed been eager to get off the line let his thoughts clear reward no recriminations but did they want the coin itself back or just to know that hed seen it what would they think when they realized hed sold it and could he really believe forniers assurance of no recriminations he remembered seeing a programme once about a police unit in america luring bail jumpers with letters promising lottery prizes part of a policemans job was to trick outwit criminals how else would they get people to come forward without some enticement the reward was tempting he could do with the money but would he be walking straight into a trap his greed in taking the coin in the first place had caused this problem now he reminded himself a second bite at the same cherry was probably tempting fate thirtyseven strasbourg april alain duclos hands shook as he addressed the eu assembly the medical debate of the decade and he was central rapporteur it all rested now on this final stage of the debate the case of john moore and the ruling of the california supreme court the vote taken today was vitally important the earlier call had come at the worst possible time theres been a few questions with your name arising somebodys curious bonoit a young limoges prosecutor now with the paris procureurs office bonoit initially called duclos brussels office mentioned it was delicate duclos had phoned him back ten minutes later from a call box reports were before each minister and duclos summarized the key points the university of california medical centre had developed a unique cell line from a cancerous spleen removed from john moore filed for patent then sold that development with resultant rights expected to yield over billion from the pharmaceutical industry mr moore subsequently sued claiming ownership of the body part from which the cell line had been developed but lost the case the main premise of that ruling was that as soon as the organ left mr moores body it ceased to become his property and so was patentable i understand though that in a first action taken by mr moore a court ruled in his favour duclos looked at the bank of translators beyond the meps semicircle pds italy yes but this was overruled by the california supreme court another factor which weighed was the many years of genetic research taken to develop the cell line a case of added value uniqueness if you will its not directly my office but because of the offbeat nature its being bounced around a few departments questions about past cases involving psychics something to do with an original investigation back in apparently another voice rose german green party that uniqueness i believe was quite evident when mr moores spleen was first removed mr moores argument is not only that he contributed the larger part of that uniqueness but that he was not even consulted that this was developed without his permission and he was as he described in his own words essence raped his body part had ceased to become his own and was suddenly an industry commodity low mumbling mixture of support and protest the green party had invited mr moore to speak at a brussels press conference during conciliation duclos recalled if he couldnt get justice in america then he could at least make history by influencing the future of european patent legislature but every possible interest group medical ethics body and science rights earth friendship mainstream and fringe religious groups had also come out strongly in support ownership of body parts was an emotive issue as the debates and arguments for and against flowed duclos rode the waves his role as rapporteur was to take an impartial stance merely present the facts and the varying arguments clearly though he knew already what he wanted rejection at first a daunting if not seemingly impossible task the eu commission had already strongly backed a patents directive the bill should sail through if it didnt it would be the first time a bill approved by the commission at the plenary session was rejected by the parliament the whole conciliation process could be brought into question hed pressed bonoit for more information about the renewed investigation but bonoit knew little else he promised to dig some more and duclos should call him back in a couple of days the waiting to know was killing duclos and now the tension of the current debate incredible that the years of blackmail had brought him to this swinging a key debate but with the size of the coup this one was as much for himself as for jaumard his retirement fund no trace of concern hopefully showed now in his face his hands pressed firm on his folder to control their trembling enigmatic geniality as he tackled the various questions the strength of the greens argument had laid a useful card in his hand closing his presentation duclos provided a distilled summary of the arguments aired a man whose cell line he claims is in itself unique a laboratory claiming its three years of cell line development was the largest contributor to that uniqueness but at what stage does research and industry expertise give the new claimant predominant rights duclos paused for emphasis yes research and industry does need due protection in order to flourish and the ruling in america should provide strong preeminent guidance to the assembly in that respect but the many controversial issues raised by that decision need also to be taken into account with the main question now can the assembly rest easy with such a ruling in europe and discard the arguments against based purely on the fact that industry requires due protection for its research furtherance of science or furtherance of the rights of the individual thank you duclos closed his folder he was sweating profusely hopefully hed struck the right tone without being too obvious but he couldnt be sure reactions looked mixed nothing left now but to wait for the votes to come in metz april duclos never felt comfortable calling marchand from either strasbourg or brussels so invariably he would stop at a call box half way in between he found one on a quiet road eight kilometres beyond metz marchand answered almost immediately what progress duclos asked the transfer was made three days ago it should be in the account now did you see the press coverage yes very encouraging they were very pleased to anyone listening in a totally nondescript conversation duclos reflected no names no subject discussed only the two of them knew the gaps to be filled in the eu parliament had rejected the biotechnology patents directive the commission and industry lobby groups had cried outrage and had started talking about tabling a new directive but the present directive had already been five years in preparation a new one even if successful could take up to three years a remarkable coup better even than theyd anticipated theyd agreed a months grace after the decision to let the dust settle then the transfer would be made additional transfers would then follow for each successive year without a successfully approved biotechnology patents directive looks like we might be in for a good run on this one anything from two to four years marchand commented lets hope so ill probably do some christmas shopping in geneva this year yes certainly it would be nice to see you again probably not thought duclos at their one meeting hed sensed that marchand hadnt liked him nor had he particularly liked marchand a swiss based rather than brussels lobbyist to duclos marchand typified the breed of self serving industry lawyers and lobbyists who constantly snapped at his and other politicians heels in return lobbyists were often resentful that politicians hadnt dealt with their clients issue effectively labelling them incompetent at every turn but the pecking order was always clear politicians looking down disdainfully lobbyists looking up resentfully except that duclos had broken from the mould was a corrupt politician one of the few marchand felt he could look down upon the air of mutual disdain could have been cut with a knife the only common ground arose from the money they were both gaining though their association strange how money of that size created its own inertia duclos reflected cut across most social divides duclos shook off an involuntary shiver telephone boxes the third in as many days more information at last from bonoit whos leading the enquiry duclos asked anxiously corbeix aixenprovence based chief prosecutor the name meant nothing to duclos what stage is the enquiry at as far as i know just initial rogatoire generale whos heading it theres two names malliene and fornier theyve also been doing a lot of digging with pimps and gay establishments in paris and marseille for some reason duclos sensed the unspoken questions strange he commented he felt his skin prickle fornier the name rang a bell from somewhere but he couldnt remember from where whats going on alain bonoit sounded suddenly concerned you know i shouldnt even be phoning you like this its just that well in the past i know and i appreciate it was bonoit fishing or seeking assurance duclos had given bonoit strong support during his fledgling years with the limoges prosecutors office eagerness for bonoit not to see his mentors image shattered or repayment of favours its nothing i was questioned for something several years ago and cleared they found and charged the real culprit sounds a bit like a political witch hunt to me old enemies coming out of the woodwork probably this biotech dispute seems to have upset a lot of people im not exactly flavour of the month right now bonoit muttered an agreement which hardly registered everything suddenly gelled for duclos paris his pulse started racing he couldnt wait to get off the line and make another call he quickly thanked bonoit and bonoit promised to call again if anything more came up duclos leafed through the back of his address book for the number it took him a while to find it he hadnt called the number for almost fifteen years the digits were jumbled and out of sequence with each set of two in reverse a number from the past he had long forgotten and didnt think he would ever have to call again a marseille back street bar which would pass a message to eugene brossard corbeix body invariably told him it was time to go home an hour before twilight as the effects of the steroids wore off the cramps and muscle spasms returned to his legs hed been free from it for almost five days then suddenly it had flared up again about the time that fornier had phoned to tell him all the coin leads had drawn a blank fornier had put in a lot of work on the case fornier also seemed to be able to pull favours at short notice getting half of an interpol department to back up his frantic nationwide search nine people from thirty years ago traced in just three days corbeix was impressed but despite forniers effort and ingenuity in the end nothing to have lived with the case for so long to get so close and then see it slip away cruel fate corbeix felt for fornier raking through what meagre hopes remained fornier had asked him if hed uncovered anything useful on past french cases involving psychics he didnt have the heart to tell fornier hed hit a similar dead end said that he was still waiting on news while five days of probing various departments in the paris prosecutors office had uncovered eight cases with relatives or the press involving psychics some of which had been entered in police files none of it ever made it into trial evidence the consensus was that even if a prosecutor believed he could convince a final jury with such evidence the examining magistrate was a different matter most dropped it for fear of jeopardizing the case through instruction a sorbonne law lecturer who advised the procureurs office on unorthodox cases had raised some useful points from relevant trials in america but still the bottom line was that psychic and plr testimony could only successfully be presented in france as background and texture without at least some hard evidence from the living rather than the dead i dont see any foundation on which to build with the last coin lead now gone their last hope of prosecuting duclos for murder went with it but at least from what fornier had mentioned there appeared to be strong hope in one area justin eynard a paris red light club owner if nothing else their chances of prosecuting duclos for child molestation looked bright some silver edging ten oclock tomorrow morning no doubt by eleven or eleventhirty fornier would have a result would phone him and then the fax would start whirring with eynards statement at least he could start moving things positively on one front justin eynard lay back on the bed while the girl undid his shirt buttons she smiled up at him lasciviously a sunshine smile with a hint of mischief juanita from santa domingo was all he knew an enticing mixture of negro and spanish dark cafe au lait skin tone and large brown eyes exquisite she watched his every emotion as she kissed slowly down his chest and stomach with each fresh button undone sampling the merchandise executive benefit of running a hookers bar eynard insisted in testing out all new girls judge their fighting weight for clients eynard tensed as she went lower a few slow licks and then she took him fully into her mouth eynard gasped god she was good she wore a white satin evening dress slit to the thigh which contrasted wonderfully with her skin tone as she sucked and rubbed him into her mouth with one hand the other reached back and pulled aside the bottom of her skirt to expose her bottom she arched it higher underneath she wore a peach coloured tanga two coffee ice cream scoops separated by a peach slice eynard watched in the mirror to one side as she deftly pulled the tanga aside and started rubbing herself in time with the motions of her mouth her fingernails were long and turquoise varnished with star bursts and intermittently she would slip a finger inside herself eynard was in heaven his breath started to come in short bursts and sensing his growing excitement with one last loving lick the girl rolled away peeling off her dress she bent away from eynard to accentuate her bottom then resumed playing with herself while sliding one finger in and out of her mouth in time eynard groaned in anticipation slowly she peeled down the tanga stepped out and leaned back over eynard her breasts were firm and cantaloupe sized with large brown nipples the size of cookies coffee ice cream and chocolate cookies all eynard could think of with a few more licks to resume acquaintance juanita swung one leg across and slowly sank down on eynard she reached back and grasped him gently by the balls as if to push him firmer inside as she started to get into the rhythm of the motions she closed her eyes in abandon sucking on the little finger of her other hand eynard felt his excitement mounting a raw tingle rising from the back of his heels jesus this girl knew what she was doing his clients were in for a rare treat he reached out a hand and stroked her breasts tweaked one nipple she writhed slowly and determinedly picking up the pace gradually control a virtuoso performance eynard felt his senses floating the tingle rising higher close your eyes i haff big treat the spanish came through in her accent a pleasant lilt eynard smiled and closed his eyes obediently he felt her finger slide into his mouth teasing his tongue and then the other hand was behind him again gently stroking urging him into her with each thrust so good good eynard felt something slide in beside her finger cool and longer plastic or metal the finger slipped out oh god a vibrator he should have told her he wasnt into that sort of thing his eyes snapped open and he went to shift his head away from the object but a hand clamped tight on his forehead the object suddenly came into focus the silencered barrel of a gun the girls arms were still on his chest someone was behind him panic seized eynard fear and the repellent feel of the gun metal against his tongue made him almost gag the girl lifted off and moved away he was already half limp the excitement gone eynard looked longingly towards her back as she headed for the bathroom knowing in that moment it was probably the last girl he would see its done i see fine i made the transfer as arranged brossard had already checked but didnt pass any comment another call box another conversation with no names or details duclos could imagine brossard at the other end in a similar call box in paris they hadnt even met this time to set everything up just a voice on the line he wondered what brossard looked like now then realized he hadnt even known what brossard looked like then fifteen years ago in his blonde wig and thick rimmed glasses duclos had called eynards bar only days before to set up a weekend in paris and one of the barmen apologized that justin was a bit pressured lately but that he should try again later anything serious duclos had asked no just some stupid mix up with the police over some child porno videos duclos knew as soon as bonoit mentioned the police hunting for background on pimps that eynard might be a problem but if the police kept digging for something on himself and under age boys eventually they were bound to find something next time he might have to be more inventive wheat shorter than dominic remembered spring over the next month or so it would no doubt grow alarmingly before being harvested thirty one years since hed stood in the same field the day of the reconstruction the wind had been high then the wheat shifting wildly unkempt and hardly harvested from one season to the next now it was neatly trimmed and cared for a half metre short from its full harvesting height and today there was no wind the air still a thin grey cloud layer with some diffused sunlight filtering through stillness sterile the crime scene washed clean by the shifting seasons and years the many different families whod owned the farm since no trace left only distant images struggling to replay in dominics mind originally dominic had intended just to stay in vidauban a half hour after hearing the news about eynard hed gone to the nearest bar for a quick brandy hed called guidier on his mobile from the bar ill be gone the rest of the day ill phone in for any messages early evening anything urgent get me on my mobile time to think clear his thoughts he would spend probably a day or two down at vidauban he needed the rest had hardly slept all week he was exhausted arriving at the farmhouse hed headed straight for the bedroom and lay flat on the bed solitude gerome was working probably wouldnt be back until six or seven monique was at the flat in lyon no doubt thought he was still at work he would phone later to tell her he was staying overnight perhaps he would take gerome to a local bar help drown his sorrows but hed been unable to sleep had stared blankly up at the ceiling with too many thoughts jumbling coin leads all gone eynard gone nothing left but that conclusion wouldnt settle just didnt feel right moniques words from a few days before there must be something something some small detail that perhaps hed overlooked from the hours of tapes and transcripts from eyran capel he felt angry this time could feel it coursing through his veins driving him on though it wasnt until two hours later after lunch and a chain of discarded notes headed coin truck restaurant lane questions with few answers that something useful finally came bottled water hed been in the shower when the thought hit the water swilling around him as he stood stock still for a moment some other water running spilling on the ground duclos had just come from a restaurant he didnt need to go down to the river where machanaud might have seen him dominic decided to head out to taragnon and the field he stood where he thought duclos must have been after the final assault on christian a few paces into the wheat his car parked just behind dominic summoned up the picture in his mind duclos clothes are off perhaps on the car seat or draped over the open boot the bloodied rock is in his hand his body splattered with blood he knows he cant stay on the lane long for risk of someone passing back to the car dominic walked the few paces his feet crunching on the wheat takes out the bottled water swills down dominic imagined the heat of the day a heat haze perhaps rising off the field then dabs dry with with a cloth or towel from his car or christians shirt perhaps that explained why christians shirt had been missing whichever duclos had obviously dumped it along with the rock somewhere and then the coin had duclos discovered the coin was that why none of the garage workers or the caugines had seen it and if so had he thrown it away immediately or later with the rock and christians shirt or had he been stupid enough to hang on to it as a memento a trophy dominic shook his head and smiled wryly a sudden image of a dawn raid on duclos house the coin found in a drawer under his underwear and silk cravats corbeix slapping his shoulder in congratulations bringing home how much he was reaching dominic crossed the lane and headed down the river bank the river was grey silent reflecting the mood of the sky above no glints reflecting from the rocks and shale dominic could hardly even make out the bottom then he was back looking past molets shoulder at some leaves drifting past the first realization that machanauds case was slipping away three decades melted away in an instant dominic looked down the river to where machanaud had stood that day then up the bank to where duclos had parked his car fourteen years in prison an afternoons poaching a few fish for machanauds supper dominic shook his head he decided to backtrack on everything else he timed it to the restaurant four minutes it was now a hardware store dominic stayed in the car park closed his eyes and imagined duclos playing for time inside making sure he was seen for his alibi selecting from the menu and eating at leisure sipping at his wine christian in the darkness of the boot probably only yards from where he was now trapped and afraid dreaming about his father and the farm wondering if he was going to be harmed dominic shuddered the two women come out of the restaurant christian hears their voices kicks back but a truck passes at that moment drowns out the sound their car doors open close they start driving away duclos settles his bill asks for a bottle of water to go dominic drove out headed back towards where christians bike had been left a citreon passed followed soon after by a mercedes van christians truck superimposed marseille varn and la pontei there was a small industrial park called la ponteille in marseilles but they hadnt looked hard a driver recalling a young boy in a passing sports car thirty years later desperately reaching again where the bike had been was now planted with vines only two rows of peach trees remained at the back of the field perhaps if only forensics had checked here as well dominic reflected no semen had been found in examining christian only ruptured vessels indicated a sexual assault duclos had obviously pulled out to ejaculate nothing was found by the wheat field but what would have been the chances here christians bike had by then been found and moved dominic wasnt even sure if he was standing in the right spot now between what might have been and what had come to pass dominic sighed probably they wouldnt have found anything he headed towards bauriac on the edge of town the tanneries were closed and derelict a sign announced the development of industrial units to be completed april no more acrid fumes stinging his eyes as he drove out to see monique to tell her dominic stopped in the square and looked across at louis old bar louis dead now these past seven years hed married and had three children with valerie and sold the bar almost twenty years ago bought a small hotel on the coast near mandelieu dominic had holidayed there en famille quite a few summers spent days out fishing and reminiscing on louis speedboat gerome had struck up a friendship with louis youngest xavier and they still kept in touch valerie still ran the hotel though theyd only been down to see her twice since louis death dominic got out and walked across to the bar he realized he hadnt been inside since louis sold it had hardly been back to taragnon or bauriac in all those years too painful even when theyd bought the farmhouse in vidauban and might pass through on the way to aix dominic would make sure to choose an alternate route black and chrome black velvet chairs black smoked glass table tops with chrome trim the bar counter was black and had three thick chrome strips facing it was almost empty with just a few stragglers at the bar and one table the new owner obviously went for the evening cocktail crowd or perhaps this is what teenagers and bikers liked nowadays dominic ordered a brandy no jukebox a powerful sound system played brian adams run to you some french rap followed the barman was young slim and had a ponytail as far removed from louis as you could get dominic smiled he drained his glass and ordered another brandy suddenly the alcohol felt good cut through the images louis dancing with valerie to the jukebox him driving out to tell monique tell her that the lorry flashing past christian trapped in the car boot the coin duclos raising his wine glass gloating dominic gripped his glass tight he knocked it back sharply ordered again some heavy rock followed dominic headed for the bathroom to escape the images were too vivid too harsh he wished now he hadnt come back he splashed some water on his face to freshen up catching his reflection in the mirror as he straightened suddenly it struck him he hadnt returned just to hunt clues but for himself to relive the memories then bury them once and for all at heart he knew it was all futile hopeless no startling revelations would be sparked off just by him being there again duclos had outwitted them all thirty years ago and hed done it again now had somehow got to eynard before them it was over over even if they did find something duclos would no doubt beat them to it yet again would ca va monsieur is everything okay dominic focused past his shoulder an old man turning from the urinal was looking on concernedly images of machanaud raising his eau de vie hows the investigation going fine just fine dominic muttered suddenly he had to get out he paid the barman knocked back his brandy and headed back to vidauban he slotted in a cd to drown out the heavy rock still ringing in his ears simply red gerome had introduced him his generations soul music years before hed introduced gerome to his own timewarped soul collection dominic felt the music soothing him the images and emotions started to settle he should never have gone back never he banged the wheel in annoyance nothing ever felt good because nothing ever could ill keep holding onkeep holding on as the words and rhythm flowed through him mouthing silently to some of the verses he wondered whether hed chosen it because it was one of his favourites or because subconsciously it just seemed to he bit at his lip tears welling suddenly gave him the answer and the rest of the emotions and images hed been fighting back bubbling like raw acid beneath the surface suddenly broke free monique in the hospital with the candle burning him calling at her door and saying that christian was dead dead the gendarmes tapping through the wheat field jeanlucs solitary figure at the back of the field louis smiling pouring him another brandy winking as a pretty girl passed his mother smiling in the fading light at the beauty of the garden and the tangerine tree all gone now all gone old friends loved ones the endless chain of work colleagues long buried with heart attacks or liver failure even the memories now dull and faded with the years all that was left now was a voice the lost and lonely voice of a small boy murdered over thirty years ago the welling tears stung his eyes and dominic thought stupidly im too old too cry seen too much buried too many friends too many but the long years of holding back the memories of fighting back the tears biting at his lip with each friend lost each funeral had built a veritable tidal wall and as his last defences were stripped away the barricades suddenly broken by that lone pathetic voice by the weeks activities and now the sudden recall and memories the rest flooded in a rush behind the wave crashing down relentlessly his whole body was suddenly racked with sobbing the road ahead blurred as his eyes watered a pastel abstract he had to pull over to the side of the road and stop he cried at the injustice cried for the lost years cried for the loved ones and friends long since buried and forgotten cried and cried and cried until his whole body started to tremble a ridiculous pathetic shaking that gradually struck him as amusing as much as sad and distressing and he found himself half laughing between the sobs as it continued as he glanced up and noticed a young man passing look towards him concernedly he wiped his eyes hurriedly as he fought to recover regain his composure for the rest of the drive to vidauban he felt strangely relaxed calm as if the sudden catharsis had washed away all the past bitter memories along with his false hopes and the frustrations of the past week it was in the past it was gone how could he have ever deluded himself that he could solve some past problem with something now thirty years on that barrier was probably never even meant to have been crossed his life put in order everything at last in perspective when dominic hit his bed back at vidauban the wave of exhaustion of the past days finally caught up with him he fell into a deep sleep almost immediately though some faint memories still replayed the tinkling of goats bells from the next field the church bells announcing the service for christian rosselot all that broke through his subconscious from his mobile ringing in his jacket pocket at the other end serge roudele counted off the third ring he decided to wait three more rings before giving up ever superstitious if it didnt answer by then he would read that as a clear message that he wasnt meant to make contact confirming his first assumption about forniers call it was a trick he wouldnt call again thirtyeight the tape recorder red light flicked on as the small bleep sounded the operator lassarde glanced up third recording of the night must be approaching the hundredth now over the past five days how long did bennacer intend to keep the line tap running he sipped at his coffee stared numbly at the reels turning what time will you be here about nine nine thirty on the saturday pretty much as usual you mentioned a new boy how does he compare with my usual jeanpierre is he as young a pause faint clearing of the throat look lets discuss all that when you get here dont worry you wont be disappointed lassarde sat up young boys aurillet the child pimp theyd tapped sounded nervous talking about their ages over the phone but who was at the other end from what hed been briefed he doubted it was duclos this sounded like a regular someone who visited practically every weekend duclos was apparently more a seasonal visitor but because duclos called rarely hopefully he might announce himself even though they might wait weeks for the call patience lassarde looked at the digital monitor as the number came up toulon exchange as he thought the caller was a local regular brussels strasbourg or limoges were what they expected with duclos the call finished with a few pleasantries nothing significant lassarde got bennacers attention from the main squad room and brought him in replayed the short segment bennacer looked up as it finished how many is that now with young boys mentioned seven or eight the rest has been just day to day stuff bar stock social calls accountant arranging builders to lay some new tiling in his main club nimbus pretty mundane and this is the first call where anyone has got close to talking about the age of the boys otherwise aurillet could claim that boys referred to sixteen or above thought bennacer legal age of consenting homosexuals it would be that much harder to nail aurillet and subsequently duclos even if a call came through linking the two three more days passed before another call came through which made lassarde sit up hes a runaway looking for a secure place he should be ideal for you cant be more than twelve or thirteen i dont know i dont know if i can get involved whats wrong you have before lassarde smiled a street pimp supplying to aurillet aurillets attempts to step back had put him in deeper water the rest of the conversation was stilted aurillet noncommittal before he signed off bring him around but i really cant promise anything though fourteen hours later lassarde once again disturbed bennacer urgently in the squad room reading the anxiousness in lassardes expression bennacer broke short his telephone conversation and followed lassarde hurriedly back into the small room the recording was halfway through probably three weeks from now i just wanted to make sure that bernard would be there yes he will everything will be arranged as usual do you know which day will it be the weekend as before yes i think so probably the saturday late afternoon bennacer looked at the digital display brussels number then sharply at lassarde is it him lassarde merely nodded drew hard on his cigarette fine look forward to seeing you then a click the red light went out as the tape stopped okay lets hear it from the beginning said bennacer rewind it dominic hit play its duclos is it all right to talk are you with anyone no its fine ill be coming down soon when will that be im not totally sure yet but probably three weeks from now i just wanted to make sure that bernard would be there yes he will everything will be arranged as a car horn blared to dominics side as he swung around the roundabout somebody filtering in from the right coming out of the roundabout traffic was slow a long tail back ahead dominic had already heard the cassette briefly when bennacer called dominic asked him to play it over the line so that one of his radio officers could make a cassette copy he was heading out urgently for a meeting with corbeix and hed like to take it with him dominic hovered over the operator anxiously while the tape was being made replayed it quickly once then grabbed a portable cassette player and the tape and headed for his car but he was worried that the extra ten minutes wait and now with traffic heavy heading out of lyon he would be late for corbeix three weeks no it wasnt worth waiting everything else on duclos was practically in place dominic made the decision there and then the traffic started to move ahead as he dialled bennacer on his mobile brief routing through the marseille station desk then bennacers voice go for it said dominic we cant afford to wait raid aurillets place now and haul him in grill him as hard as you can on duclos do you think weve got enough lets hope so i just dont think were going to get much more weve got under age boys on one call duclos on another lets just try and forge the two together as best we can good luck we were meant to service the car give it a thorough check over clean it up for display what particular duty were you given to check all the tyre treads and pressures check the wheel balance and alignment which included checking the spare tyre pressure dominic walked in nodded quickly to corbeix sorry im late he took a seat at the end of the table on the same side as corbeix and the notary corbeix leant over the tape machine chief inspector fornier enters the room at threetwelve pm interview resumes corbeix looked briefly at his notes now in checking the tyre pressure and wheel balance what would that involve it means taking off all the tyres and spinning them for balance and then testing with a gauge for pressure including the spare tyre which in this case was located in the boot dominic realized they had obviously already covered most of the preliminiaries including the year roudelle worked in the garage and the type of car details he had already gained on tape the same night after roudeles initial call eleven days and the whole nature of the case had changed surprise and elation with roudeles initial call had brought him quickly alert from his sleep a quick call to corbeix and he was booked on a flight to limoges the same night he taped an interview with roudele and a date was arranged for an official statement with corbeix and a notary two days later bennacers precinct received an anonymous tip off about duclos and a local child pimp vincent aurillet within twentyfour hours they had a line tap arranged with france telecom now that too had paid off dominic was elated the only drawback was that roudeles initial call had disturbed him barely an hour into his sleep and with the renewed activity his sleep pattern had been poor since three weeks on a frantic roller coaster bouncing between hope despair and back again his nerve ends were frayed raw hed never felt so tired only wild adrenaline drove him on and in removing the cars spare tyre what did you find that day a coin a silver coin can you please describe it to us it was from italy dated a silver twenty lire and was it particularly rare or valuable reasonably rare in france it was the first time i had come across one here at least but theyre obviously more common in italy because the value wasnt that high what did you do with the coin when you saw it i put it in the pocket of my overalls did anyone else see you take it no not that i was aware the atmosphere in the room was tense only corbeix and roudeles voice and the notary silently observing the sound of the tape whirring in the gaps between questions dominic noticed his hand rested on the table shaking slightly build up of tiredness and nerves and the traffic rush getting there having taken the coin what did you do with it how long did it stay in your possession i kept it with my fathers coin collection until ten or eleven years ago then it was sold along with the rest of his collection do you remember the name of the place where you sold it yes a coin shop in the centre of limoges bagoudets corbeix leant forward again let the record show that the coin shop in question was visited on the twenty sixth of april by chief inspector fornier an entry record was found for the coin in question dated october th a statement was taken from the coin shops proprietor and entered on form corbeix leafed through the papers before him found the statement form and read out the number the notary checked the statement form briefly passed it back after seeing roudele dominic had stayed overnight in limoges to visit the coin shop corbeix felt it was essential to back up roudeles statement in case duclos defence tried to rip holes in it suggest that he was fabricating purely to collect the reward offered the coin shop provided that last vital link the coin brought originally from italy by jeanlucs father passed to christian then duclos car and the garage worker the trail finally ended in a musty basement in limoges with an aged coin shop proprietor leafing through dusty files somehow appropriate and then suddenly everything was in rapid motion line taps statements and notaries a frantic flurry of paperwork crossing corbeix desk the strands spun wide weeks ago now fast pulling in everything converging dominic drew a slow breath trying to ease his jaded nerves aware that even now as he sat with corbeix and roudele over a hundred miles away in marseille bennacer and his men would be bursting into aurillets office i really cant help you im sorry i wish i could oh but i think you can bennacer had arranged the three most incriminating conversations in a loop so that they ran in succession he pressed play and sat closely observing aurillets expression the only other person in the small interview room was moudeux a lumbering di who aurillet had been handcuffed to in the back of a black citreon on the way down to the precinct a head taller than aurillet moudeux had spent much of the journey jibing you into bondage are you i understand you guys sometimes sample the merchandize do you test the boys yourself what do you do put these on them moudeux raised the handcuffs i suppose with an ugly shit like you theyd come in useful stop them getting away aurillet had stayed silent throughout the first few questions from bennacer he met with blank denials and now moudeux stayed silent just contemplated aurillet with his slow doleful eyes and smiled menacingly as the tape ran aurillet looked nervously down at the table aurillet looked faintly puzzled as the duclos segment came on unlike the other two children werent mentioned just a name bernard fine look forward to seeing you bennacer stopped the tape so weve got you clearly on supply of under age children and your connection with alain duclos what we want to know is how far your association goes back with duclos all the details i dont understand why are you so interested in him it concerns another investigation were running youre not the main focus here what were mainly concerned about is your involvement with duclos the wheres and whens of you supplying him with young boys through the years aurillet shook his head young boys he laughed nervously that marcus is crazy twelve and thirteen he knows i never take them that young but he keeps trying his luck keeps phoning bennacer stared at him blandly i dont have time to sit here while your credibility and my patience are stretched we know you trade in under age boys but as i said you are not i repeat not our main interest duclos is bennacer exhaled so lets try again once more duclos and young boys what do you know aurillet contemplated his shoes then the tape machine its awkward im not sure where all of this will lead i might incriminate myself i dont think i should say anything without my lawyer present bennacer lifted his eyes to the ceiling strained effort to keep his voice calm thats your prerogative if thats your wish then im afraid there is really nothing more for us to discuss at this juncture im going to break this interview for ten minutes and leave you to decide fully if when i return your decision is still the same then youll be held over until your lawyers arrival bennacer faced the mike interview suspended at threeeighteen pm bennacer stopped the tape aurillets eyes followed bennacer to the door darting back briefly to moudeux a surely youre not leaving me alone with him look moudeux smiled he reached over and touched aurillets hand dont worry ill keep you company aurillet recoiled sharply pulled his hand away the door shut bennacer stayed out of the room for sixteen minutes when he returned aurillets expression was strained haunted he got the impression that there had been silence between aurillet and moudeux for several minutes aurillet had reached his decision a while ago okay i agree to help what is it you want to know about duclos bennacer started the tape he didnt ask what had happened while he was out to make aurillet change his mind moudeux smug smile told him that everything had gone more or less according to their earlier plan was aurillet difficult no not too bad there was a sticky moment where he wanted to see his lawyer but i left him with one of my dis moudeux for a moment to contemplate the error of his ways moudeux explained the relative advantages of him cooperating official or unofficial was it recorded as part of the interview dominic asked no when i left the room i stopped the tape i dont think id like any of moudeux usual vernacular recorded officially but thankfully he usually doesnt have to say much he dwarfs most people and hes got this great smile makes jack nicholson look like mother teresa dominic laughed swirled the whisky in its tumbler bennacers call had come through on his mobile fifteen minutes after the session with roudele while he was still in corbeix office going through final notes corbeix had taken a bottle of southern comfort from his deskside cabinet and poured them both a third tumbler full interim celebration the successful conclusion to one stage salut to the stage ahead dominic signed off and filled in the details for corbeix on bennacers call ive asked him to fax over a copy of the statement to both our offices once its typed up should come through in an hour or so corbeix raised his glass another piece in place they sat silently drinking for a second dominic was exhausted he felt somehow awkward at a loose end with the past weeks of hectic activity it felt strange that now there was nothing left for him to do now it all rested with corbeix when would you hope to file and get a warrant lets see corbeix flicked through some papers i checked meps timetables the other day i dont want to serve in brussels administrative nightmare the next time duclos is in strasbourg is in nine days ill need six in any case to finish up paperwork and advise an examining magistrate so third or fourth of may id like to be there when hes arrested you dont have to two strasbourg judicial police will go serve and transport will be arranged for duclos back to aix id still like to be there dominic smiled outside of the press its been quite a while since ive seen alain duclos i was but a young gendarme should be quite nostalgic i know its been a long time for you corbeix grimaced as he swallowed another shot pain and sympathy are you sure youll be okay accompanying im not going to slug duclos on the parliament steps if thats what you mean as tempting as it might be dominic shrugged his smile subsiding thoughtful so much of this has been dealt with from a distance often its felt intangible unreal i need something physical to end the process the warrant being served the handcuffs being slapped on the expression on duclos face then ill know weve got him right now i still have to pinch myself that its all over and im only just starting corbeix thought but it wasnt the moment to remind fornier of the difficulties ahead that duclos heavyweight lawyers would bombard the case from so many angles hed hardly be given time to draw breath hopefully hed shored upon all their main areas of vulnerability but what if hed overlooked something one footfault and duclos could walk after the first few instruction hearings well at least theres nothing more for you to do now for nine days probably you can do with the rest you look tired a grimace that this time went awry for someone with ms bold comment ironic he looked down and away as he remembered his own plight the fact that he probably wouldnt even have enough energy to see the case through yes eight days of sleep one day of pure bliss after thirty years on this one case i daresay i deserve it salut dominic leant forward and they clinked glasses but beyond corbeix smile dominic could read the strong shadow of uncertainty his own sense of suspended belief with these closing stages hed answered with the fact that the case so far had been fraught with so many obstacles and difficulties that now with none in the way it was no longer familiar ground after so long it still felt somehow unreal that it was all finally within grasp but now looking at corbeix and downing the last slug of whisky he wondered whether it was because reality lurked just around the corner that something else would arise duclos would pull another rabbit from the hat to destroy their case and escape justice theyre pressing ahead with the case a part of duclos had feared they might had prompted the safeguards hed put into action but another had clung to doubt they would lack both the evidence and the audacity and it was this part that held sway wrestled with acceptance duclos went cold rigid he was in a call box on rue archimede two blocks from the parliament he watched blankly the traffic and people passing with the long silence bonoit was suddenly hesitant awkward you know i shouldnt even be calling certainly it will have to be my last call yes yes i understand duclos snapped out of his reverie what earthly basis is there what evidence i dont have all the details but something about a garage worker and a coin found in an old car of yours and still some background with psychics which i mentioned earlier a coin a coin left in his old car impossible surely invented hed searched every nook and crevice straight after the incident had driven the car for seven months afterwards without seeing anything sounds ridiculous to me as i said before some misguided political witchhunt that will probably blow over before its even started but duclos could hear the nervousness the strain in his own voice the sudden worry that he might have overlooked something would be facing the unknown for the first time he was frightened his hand shook his palm clammy on the receiver or was it sheer outrage anger thirty years of serving his country of fighting for bills and statutes for the benefit of all and they had the cheek to drag this up now that upstart fornier and a ragtag bunch of provence police and prosecutors outrageous two days of searching his memory after bonoits initial call and he finally recalled fornier the young gendarme assisting dour faced and doubting in the background when poullain had visited him at the vallons how on earth did someone like that rise to become chief inspector theres something else bonoit commented fornier was apparently involved in the initial investigation i see duclos feigned surprise his involvement now is meant to be purely because of that only someone involved then would know the gaps to fill in now but it goes deeper bonoit paused heavily a couple of years after the murder fornier married the victims mother monique rosselot theyre husband and wife duclos was numbed a tingling hollowness a void struggling with the ludicrousness of what hed just heard he wanted to shout but she was already married jeanluc rosselot i read it in the papers at the time but realized that might raise the question of why he had shown such strong interest in the case he sensed the need to say something beyond just another i see then it struck him personal involvement given that background should fornier really be involved now debatable point apparently that is why malliene is down as leading the investigation forniers meant to be just assisting and for background continuity between the old and new case but word has it that forniers doing most of the legwork malliene is merely checking and signing off possibly to avoid any claims of bias through personal involvement the smile came slowly to duclos face his concern dissipating something else that could probably be turned to advantage interesting he thanked bonoit i appreciate how youve stuck out your neck to try and help me bonoit said it was nothing for old friendship a quick bon chance before he rang off in the immediate silence following it struck duclos that he probably wouldnt hear from bonoit again when the arrest warrant came there would be a lot more old friends and colleagues who would suddenly want distance he thought ruefully coin the one thing that nagged disturbingly at the back of his mind everything else garage workers psychics sounded like the sort of nonsense thibault his lawyer would destroy in short order he would phone him tomorrow start shoring up his defence before the wolf pack arrived duclos could almost imagine fornier rubbing his hands together the incompetent hoping for final glory but with everything with aurillet already in place and now with this new information duclos still felt confident of winning through at the same time hopefully teaching dominic fornier a lesson he wouldnt quickly forget perhaps he shouldnt have had the whisky the effects of the steroids wore off in the afternoon the drink had probably only heightened the problem corbeix could feel the muscle twinges rising in his right thigh hed planned to stay at least an hour after fornier left and structure notes from the afternoon session but already he could feel the warning signals if he stayed more than another ten minutes he might have trouble making it even to the car park and in addition there was the twenty minute drive home a recurring worry was that his legs would seize up mid journey he wouldnt even be able to operate the clutch or the accelerator on bad days hed take a taxi in and back but this morning had started off good no twinges then shortly after the session with roudele hed felt the first almost as if his body was reminding him that the day had been gruelling while the session had been in full flow the adrenalin running hed hardly felt a thing was that what it would be like in the instruction hearings ahead sailing through on a sea of adrenalin and then completely demolished soon after but today had started off well he reminded himself what about those days when he felt exhausted just with the effort of getting out of bed and having breakfast corbeix packed his files in his brief case and headed out locking his office door the corridors were quiet most of the staff had left an hour ago all to do forniers road had ended his own was just starting and he knew now with certainty that hed get little or no help from galimbert hed sounded out galimbert a week ago then again when the coin lead came through sounds tenuous exploratory too much ground breaking that could go wrong especially against such a high profile figure objections objections with no hint of support in sight galimbert wasnt keen on the case if he handed it over to him to conclude after the summer recess galimbert would throw in the towel at the first serious onslaught from duclos lawyer corbeix shook his head as he started down the palais de justice steps rpr he recalled soon after their first discussion about duclos that galimbert was a staunch rpr supporter they were prosecutors functionaries of the law politics werent meant to come into it governing parties changed but they were always there serving holding the mantle of justice but he couldnt help wondering if galimberts lack of enthusiasm had been largely swayed by duclos rpr status one of galimberts heroes corbeix grimaced tautly it hardly mattered now he was on his own fighting one of the largest cases in french criminal history when he felt he hardly had the energy to make it to the car park at the bottom of the stairway corbeix paused to regain breath looking up briefly at the highceilinged entrance vestibule of the palais de justice and the motto above the doorway liberte egalite fraternite then continued his faltering step echoing starkly from the tiled floor and stone walls echoing feet on marble floors dominic followed the two strasbourg judiciare dis through the parliament vestibule from the elevators as they turned into the corridor leading to duclos office thick pile carpet met their feet cushioned silent as if to mask their final approach from duclos but a rather concerned guard at the entrance desk had spent time with badge checking register signing and phoning through to duclos secretary before letting them pass duclos knew they were coming they walked into the main office a secretary a clerk behind but no sign of duclos dominic stayed in the background while one of the dis paveinade explained the purpose of their visit to duclos secretary his sidekick caubert just nodded as she looked between the two halfway through the adjoining door opened and duclos stepped out he was open mouthed and stared paveinade up and down quizzically what on earth is all of this what is the meaning of this intrusion the same supercilious condescending expression thought dominic except now there were few remnants of duclos previous roundfaced pretty boy look the face was puffed and jowly lines and bags under duclos eyes betraying his age paveinade started again more hesitantly this time the warrant issued from aix the notification that morning in strasbourg for them to take him into custody i have the papers here i think youll find them all in order paveinade held them out but duclos just stared at them contemptuously what are your badge numbers duclos snapped and who is your commanding officer give all your details along with the arrest warrant and your commanding officers name to my secretary ill have her call him straightaway and sort out this mess obediently paveinade took out his badge and showed it to the secretary flustered slightly red faced caubert started to follow suit dominic glared at duclos hed agreed with corbeix just to stay in the background and observe he might too easily lose his temper hed hoped to catch up on sleep in the nine days wait but with the build up and expectancy towards the final issuing of the warrant it had still been fitful four five hours a night at most his nerves were still frayed and now duclos was trying to steal the thunder from his moment of glory suddenly it was as if they were under suspicion and arrest an inch more rope and duclos would reduce their visit to complete circus dominic saw red duclos arrogance in trying to reverse the tables and take control reminded him just why duclos had escaped justice for so long dominic put his hand over cauberts badge as it was laid on the secretarys desk that wont be necessary the arrest warrant is in order duly signed off by inspector malliene of aix en provence and an examining magistrate and as the most senior officer present it falls upon me to observe and ensure that these officers are allowed to do their duty and execute the warrant without impediment dominic stared at caubert his tone sharp now put away your badge and get on with what you came here for read the prisoner his rights and handcuff him so that he may be escorted to the car duclos looked between dominic caubert and paveinade a battle of wills though duclos looked suddenly uncertain which next action would have the strongest effect this is ridiculous absurd sensing that caubert and paveinade were still hesitant dominic prompted who has the handcuffs lets get on with it duclos eyes darted between them a moment more before turning to his secretary slow exhalation exasperation no energy left to argue with proles call jeanpaul thibault his number is in my database tell him whats happened then he rounded on the two dis and dominic one of the first things hell be doing is speaking to your respective commissioners in strasbourg and lyon i dont think you have any idea the magnitude of error youre making here i wouldnt hold your breath on any future promo save the speech minister dominic cut in damned if he was going to allow duclos this last frantic scramble for moral high ground im not one of your electorate nor if i have my way will you be soap boxing to any more electorate dominic nodded to paveinade and caubert now take the prisoner as paveinade raised duclos arms for the handcuffs he muttered a quick im sorry sir still observance of authority albeit now reluctant dominic couldnt imagine paveinade saying sorry to a street vagrant as he slapped on handcuffs this is outrageous duclos hissed you are making a tragic error dominic leant closer yes well you pay for your tragic errors and ill pay for mine they marched duclos away stares of curiosity surprise from people passing on the corridor whether because they recognized duclos or just the sight of a man in handcuffs dominic wasnt sure two people were in the elevator down from the third floor hesitant sideways glances at the handcuffs dominic enjoyed every minute he hadnt had so much fun since the taragnon bank manager duclos was subdued silent throughout eyes mostly downcast embarrassed not meeting those of people they passed duclos spoke only once more on their way out as they headed down the parliament steps towards the car you know i remember you fornier duclos was staring at him directly up until then hed been careful to avoid eye contact yes and ive never forgotten you dominic smiled tautly ill send you flowers in prison dominic sat in the front and stared resolutely ahead as they drove off he wished now that hed kept to his original plan stayed in the background and kept quiet his hands were clenched tight in fists on his knees he could still feel his anger bubbling the long years of waiting the intensity of the past weeks of investigation and all he could finish off with was a cheap gibe about duclos sexuality but there was a momentary flinch in duclos eyes that at least gave some satisfaction albeit slightly delayed not a recoil reaction of shock or surprise as if it had prompted some past unpleasant memory and it took duclos a second to link the two thirtynine jeanpaul thibault pushed through the throng of reporters on the courtroom steps cameras clicked microphones jostled for position at first they concentrated on duclos but as duclos held one hand up and thibaults assistant clerk madeleine led him hurriedly to the car they swung back towards thibault the lawyer touched his steelrimmed glasses moistened his lips the microphones moved in closer as you can appreciate my client doesnt wish to make any comment at this stage i can only say that i will seek to demonstrate my clients innocence in short order that these charges against him are totally unfounded and without merit a confused barrage of questions returned match le monde provencal when will what do you propose will monsieur duclos now thibault picked out one question why do you think these charges have arisen now so many years later girl at the back le figaro good question why now monsieur duclos provided a full unflinching statement when this case was originally heard he has nothing to hide a suspect i might add was found fully tried and convicted a reopening now is a complete legal sham especially on the evidence presented i think that given what monsieur duclos has been involved in lately politically might provide more of a clue to why it has arisen now thank you thibault started moving down the steps towards the car the pack followed more questions theyd taken the bait again thibault picked out just one which particular political involvement thibault turned just as he opened the car door reluctant admission as if the press were dragging it out of him thibault sighed as you probably know monsieur duclos has recently been rapporteur in a patents dispute which has gone the wrong way for the eu biotech industry if hes discredited the case could be reopened also id like to remind you that all of this comes rather soon after a scandal involving a certain socialist politician from marseille rather convenient one might say thibault smiled if i were you i would look no further than monsieur duclos political enemies for those behind this ridiculous fiasco thibault held a hand up behind him as he stepped into the car ignoring the continuing barrage of questions it had ended on the note he wanted madeleine drove off he smiled across at duclos a good days work i think should be interesting press tomorrow yes i think so well done though duclos smile in return was more hesitant he had half an eye on the black police citreon following his shadow for the next few months two days after the bail hearing came the first official rpr statement from the party secretary general and acting prime minister we have spoken at some length with minister duclos who completely repudiates these charges as false and unfounded he will fight them vigorously and the party will offer its moral support however it is minister duclos personal opinion that it would be improper for him to continue his duties representing the party as a regional constituent or in brussels while this case remains unresolved his resignation of today has been accepted with due regret by the party president the statement was as expected moral support meant that the party could offer no tangible support but their thoughts were with him good luck and bon voyage eight days all that duclos had spent behind bars before being bailed quite a contrast to machanaud dominic thought sourly the system at work egalite its middle name but it wasnt full bail corbeix was eager to point out more house arrest with a gendarme permanently in duclos shadow posted by his front door in limoges or his hotel room in aix when duclos travelled down for instruction hearings his passport surrendered his bank accounts frozen and practically all his assets tied up in bail funding it was the best we could hope for in the circumstances two days since the bail hearing a more sober meeting this time with corbeix no whisky not much to celebrate corbeix desk was strewn with the main newspapers most carried the story on the front page the bail decision hadnt been entirely a surprise as soon as corbeix heard about duclos appointed lawyer jeanpaul thibault corbeix was at least forewarned what to expect arrogance brashness cries of outrage at every opportunity thibaults firm was a leading paris cabinet with associate offices in brussels and washington heavy on corporate law their criminal law division was smaller but nevertheless competent and aggressive thibault was one of their youngest partners and had risen to prominence in the eighties representing a leading paris haute couture directors wife charged with murder a number of similar high profile cases followed making thibaults mark as a good celebrity lawyer thibaults steelrimmed glasses gelled back hair and double breasted suits had cut a good clean upandcoming yuppie lawyer image a decade ago but his image hadnt changed with the years and now in his late forties it made him look shady and sharp dominic was thoughtful as corbeix covered thibaults background doesnt sound too far removed from a younger duclos perhaps thats what endeared duclos to thibault sees a bit of himself in him predictably thibault had come in all guns blazing for his client at the bail hearing duclos status his long years as a publicly elected official his strong commitment to france corbeix had answered with the seriousness of the charges and the fact that duclos had money he had the means to escape they argued the toss for almost an hour before the examining magistrate claude barielle ruled bank accounts and assets frozen passport held house arrest counsels to be advised of the order of play for instruction hearings within ten days corbeix had initially been enthused with claude barielles appointment only thirtytwo and with a sharply inquisitive mind corbeix felt that barielle would be more openminded to the background of plr than some of the older examining magistrates but during the bail hearing he began to worry that barielle might turn out too much of a lightweight faced with someone like thibault a master manipulator thibault was used to ruling the roost in the main courtrooms of paris in a provincial aix courtroom with a young examining magistrate thibault could have barielle carrying his luggage in no time in most instruction hearings defence lawyers were mainly passengers aboard an examining magistrates inquisitorial flagship present only when his client was called defence could only demand presence when witnesses were called by posting a request to confront notice prosecutors too could if they wish coast along during instruction merely make notes and suggestions appear at only half the hearings generally let the examining magistrate do the running corbeix grimaced given his current condition such a stance would have probably suited him but he could see by the spread of newspapers on his desk that it wasnt going to be that type of instruction thibault was going to be posting a lot of request to confront notices calling foul at every turn i think were in for a rough ride and possibly earlier than i thought dominic too glanced at the newspapers one had already nicknamed duclos the biotech mep the rest made strong reference to it somewhere in the article the murder case and the biotech dispute had already been successfully fused in the publics mind what do you think thibaults tactic is on the surface just a convenient smokescreen a distraction but beneath its a very clever manipulation the biotech ruling is prolife pro rights of man at the same time we are expected to believe that the man responsible is also a murderer thibault is trying to paint duclos as a saint before it has even started hes going all out for an early kill any particular reason he has his client bailed so why the time pressure think about it thibault has made the bold claim that this whole case is unfounded but as the instruction drags on not only will people begin to doubt such a claim but win or lose duclos political career will be over only if thibault can get the case thrown out quickly does duclos have any chance of bouncing back theyd discussed the daunting task ahead at the last meeting shored up the final barricades dominic reflected now corbeix was raising the portent of an early defeat was corbeix just hardening him up against a possible let down or did he really see losing as a strong possibility twelve days later with the agenda for the first six instruction hearings in hand together with thibaults request to confront notices corbeix fears were confirmed it was going to be a gloves off fight at every stage though one confront notice surprised him he stared at it long and hard before laying the papers aside and wondered bluff or did thibault know something they didnt marinella calvan cradled the phone to her ear with her shoulder turning the top page of the official notice shed received yeah yeah the sixteenth just over three weeks from now her agent stephanie bruckmann was at the other end thats right yep the expense this time is on them no more pleading for departmental funding who told you what the notice said bruckmann asked that cute french tutor you mentioned finding on campus no inspector fornier phoned me directly went through it with me i use tom just for the newspaper articles there was something else just the other day marinella flicked through the copy of le figaro to one side first instruction hearing whatever that is next tuesday bit more about this duclos involvement with the biotech case the biotech stuffs good for us the john moore case was splashed across most of the papers here generated some great headlines spleenless in seattle was one of the best she heard marinella chuckle at the other end so it should help build up some national exposure lets hope so stephanie bruckmann was thoughtful shed spent the last month setting up lecture tours book deals and chat shows then held back the preliminaries done the market primed far stronger impact would be gained once the case hit the press and stronger still with the confirmation of marinella testifying at trial shed asked marinella to phone her as soon as she received trial notification from france look i think im going to go for larry king straightaway his office were on just a couple of days ago right after the washington post story lets save oprah and the rest till later right now its a strong internationalpolitical story but not yet a strong american story lets give it a couple more weeks to brew on that front but its great for king right now ill call his office first thing tomorrow thibault behaved himself at the first two instruction hearings sat for the most part taking notes with his assistant madeleine at his side peering imperiously above his glasses at anything questionable but generally saying little few objections or interruptions corbeix hadnt been sure what to expect because duclos presence was necessary at both initial hearings thibault didnt need to post confront requests in order to be present barielle sat with a greffier tapping notes into a computer to his left despite his years barielle had strong presence he was receding prematurely and had sharp piercing blue eyes broached no nonsense the hearing room was no more than eight metres by six the main purpose of the first hearing was for overall presentation of the case the main prosecution foundations in support and general aims followed by defence rebuttal corbeix started with the background to the investigation and trial though only the key points the main details would be presented by fornier at the third instruction then he came quickly onto the link between the two cases eyran capel and the final plr sessions corbeix was careful not to dwell he wanted to get swiftly to the coin the main tangible evidence without attracting objections and interruptions from thibault over plr thibault raised his eyebrows to the ceiling at its mention half smiled and leant over to whisper something to madeleine but no objection came still corbeix was keen to push plr as far out of reach as possible much evidence will be presented about the authenticity of plr work not just with this case with eyran capel and christian rosselot but hundreds of authenticated cases stretching back through the years countless eminent psychiatrists and psychologists all bearing testament to its authenticity hours of tapes and reams of transcripts available marinella calvan the main psychologist who conducted the sessions one of the worlds leading plr experts will also appear before us as will the initial psychiatrist who recommended plr sessions for eyran capel and finally a french notary who witnessed one of the closing sessions corbeix rested one hand firmly on his trial folder but despite all of that the prosecution case will not i repeat not be fought on the basis of such evidence all of that will be purely texture and background to the main evidence a coin discovered by a garage worker in the boot of alain duclos car plr is therefore only a means to an end but not the end itself and the coin is significant because it is not just any coin it is a relatively rare italian silver lire given to christian rosselot by his grandfather who brought it in turn from italy christian rosselot left his house that fateful day with the coin in his pocket and it was subsequently found in the boot of monsieur duclos car albeit only coming to light all these years later corbeix held out a hand towards thibault im sure your justice that much will be made in argument against plr by the defence purely because of its unusual and speculative nature especially in trial evidence but i can only emphasize again that in this case it is purely for texture and background however much the defence tries to discredit or throw doubt on plr it does not escape the simple irrevocable fact that the coin was there a physical not a mythical discovery and the only tangible explanation for it being there is that the boy christian rosselot was in the boot of alain duclos car on the day of his murder corbeix nodded abruptly to barielle then to thibault and sat down thibault spent the first ten minutes mainly with character references for his client almost a repeat of his bail pleas how it was unthinkable that anyone of duclos stature and contribution to the community at large could commit such a crime a ludicrous travesty of justice that charges should have even been brought to bare thibault jumped deftly to the background of plr and psychic evidence nothing else demonstrates stronger just how ludicrous shows fully the pathetic desperation of the prosecutions case but to corbeix relief and surprise thibault spent little time on the subject these elements are so obviously questionable as to hardly be worth my time in trying to discredit them as if already half assuming that barielle would also consider them obvious nonsense or perhaps saving his big guns for the hearing with marinella calvan thought corbeix thibault emphasized the sensitivity of his clients political position and the rather suspicious and convenient timing of all this now arising hot on the heels of a controversial biotechnology ruling every politician has enemies but when industry at large has been hit to the tune of eight billion dollars the incentive is suddenly there to crush those enemies so why this charge has suddenly materialized against my client should be very clear emerging out of the blue after over thirty years but the how is far more interesting how a ragtag collection of coincidences and falsehoods have been strung together by the prosecution with a few mystics thrown in for good measure in support of this ridiculous political witch hunt thibault stared resolutely at barielle certainly your justice in all my years i have not seen a more blatant case of fabrication of evidence and bias in support of a prosecution and i will see it as my pleasure to expose this for what it is a case totally without substance or merit thibault cast his eyes down for a second drawing a tired breath unfortunately for my client regardless of the outcome politics being what it is his career will probably be over his enemies will score their victory in any case which i think has been their intention all along knowing full well that such tenuous evidence would be thrown out in short order but let us hope at least that justice will be seen to be done on one front thank you thibaults only bout of band standing bold claims corbeix thought bias but overall tame by thibaults normal standards there was obviously much worse to come as thibault sat down barielle smiled yes well i think your aims in this case monsieur thibault have already been made clear to anyone reading the newspapers in future i would ask you to address your aims to me first before telling the world not the other way around thibault was redfaced but just nodded with a slight shrug couldnt quite wrap his tongue around an apology corbeix smiled in turn perhaps barielle wouldnt be such a walkover the first part of the second instruction hearing was taken up with serge roudele confirmation of his name the dates he worked in the limoges garage and then the reading of his statement about the coin duclos was present because later he would be asked to testify he looked uneasy as he listened to roudeles account and so he should thought corbeix the main physical evidence that could convict him duclos would have already known about the coin from the trial papers but not all the details corbeix felt a twinge of pleasure at duclos discomfort duclos probably thinking of the many times hed opened the boot in those seven months without seeing the coin or wondering why oh why couldnt he have had a flat tyre thibault waited for barielle to finish his questioning and then requested the right to confront but with only three questions barielle nodded and posed them did you steal the coin in question well yes i took it at least would you consider this an act of theft yes i suppose i would slight fluster uncomfortable and was there a reward offered for coming forward with information about the coin yes there was roudele was defensive but not excessive in comparison to its normal value thibault made no concluding remarks and roudele was dismissed but the points were in the file and corbeix was sure that thibault would make much of them later try and discredit roudele corbeix summarized with the statements from the coin shop owner reading out key segments of his statements then passed it to barielle and the greffier to note duclos testimony predictably stuck to his original account given in travelling through taragnon calling in at a restaurant a quick stopoff at a garage then on to juanlepins when duclos had finished barielle asked did you at any time meet a young boy travelling through taragnon no i didnt did you at any time have a young boy in your car either in the passenger seat or in the boot no how long did you spend in the restaurant in total an hour an hour and a quarter barielle continued with a series of straightforward mechanical questions eleven in all making short notes between each one he would ask the same questions from a dozen more angles before the instruction was over each time sharpening the angle or confronting with conflicting testimony from witnesses the main skill of an effective examining magistrate digging for the truth but corbeix could hardly imagine barielle commenting that according to the voice on tape of a boy long since dead a different account had been proposed what do you say to that monsieur duclos a reminder to corbeix listening to duclos account that his claim at the last instruction of plr just providing background and texture was in part inaccurate the case hinged on the physical evidence of the coin but eyran capels plr transcripts provided the complete picture of what really happened that day all the details duclos was now carefully omitting jeanpaul thibault had purposely coasted through the first instruction hearings first of all he liked to listen tune himself to the mood of the proceedings the sensitivities and nuances of the prosecutions and the examining magistrate their strengths and vulnerabilities where to hit and where to avoid when he knew where he would have most impact then he would start striking out but there was another strong reason for him biding his time research and background uncovering the most vulnerable areas of witnesses the day after receiving the main file hed assigned two of his best researchers to get information on roudele fornier and malliene in france lambourne and the capels in england and marinella calvan in america day by day the threads of information filtered in unfortunately there was nothing on roudele no past convictions for theft the coin possibly an isolated incident hed decide later if he would press the point but with dominic fornier theyd struck gold enough threads to weave a blanket a shroud to hopefully smother fornier nail him in grand style at the next instruction how did we fare dominic tapped a pencil on his desk papers and files telephones ringing interruptions the normal morning dominic had hardly been able to pay any of it strong attention hed phoned corbeix office twenty minutes before to learn that he was still not back still in instruction on the second call he was put through to corbeix were probably ahead after the second as well thibault tackled roudele over the theft of the coin but nothing serious and duclos gave the same lame ridiculous account of his movements that day as when you first took his statement back in i suppose we didnt expect any less suppose not corbeix was thoughtful voicing the ease with which theyd sailed through the first two hearings reminded him of the onslaught he feared was coming hed already warned fornier about the confront notice posted against him and malliene for the next hearing dominic had joked so either thibault is booking his ringside ticket and will just sit it out or wed better warn malliene what hes in for corbeix too had laughed but nervously they both knew who thibault was gunning for can i talk is your line secure duclos heart sank it was jaumard thibault was due out of court soon hed hoped it might be him news of how his assault on fornier and corbeix had gone yes its fine you can talk no bugs betina downstairs gendarme at the front door the phone was probably the only secure place thibault had made a big issue of it at the bail hearing emphasized that because his client was under house arrest by necessity many of their conversations would be by phone a secure line was therefore essential any linetapping would breach client lawyer confidentiality and he would immediately call for a mistrial barielle agreed no linetapping duclos suddenly pinched himself perhaps he should have said no its not safe the last person he wanted to hear from right now was jaumard but yet another part of him was morbidly curious still you shouldnt be phoning me here what do you want isnt it obvious ive read the papers youre going down for this arent you thats my old age pension straight out the fucking window no no its all complete nonsense the whole thing will get thrown out quickly maybe even at this instruction by the next at the latest my lawyers in court nailing them right now ive only got your word for that and im not prepared to wait just on the off chance as soon as you know youre going down for it youll stop paying me no point in a clumsy denial jaumards claim was patently true to both of them youve phoned early normally you phone at night yes well i wanted a clear head this involves my future i might only have one shot at it duclos sensed what was coming but he didnt want to ask invite it as with everything else delaying the ultimate though part of him also clung to hope that he was wrong long breath from jaumard i want to cash in my pension now half straight away the rest a week before your trial that way if you go down ive got something put away and if i dont get convicted you wont hear from me again for three years jaumard paused three hundred thousand francs now three hundred thousand just before the trial duclos spluttered thats outrageous i cant get you that sort of money in fact i cant get you any money at all all my bank accounts and assets have been frozen dont give me that shit people like you can always get their hands on money somewhere not when theyre on trial for murder ive had bail bondsmen and court officials crawling over every account and asset i cant shift a thing but jaumard was right despite everything he could get his hands on some money though the money in switzerland from marchands biotech people he dared not let anyone know about at the outset of conciliation another when the ruling had come through for each successive year without a new patents ruling to a maximum of seven years his escape fund if all went wrong jaumard was the last person hed let in on such a secret i dont care how you find the money just find it because im not waiting ill call you tomorrow and give you a bank account number for the transfer duclos stomach sank this was a new jaumard tense irrational but for once sober abstaining jaumard high octane mix of dts and raw tension its impossible i told you if i try to find it jaumard snapped if by the time i call you havent worked out how to get three hundred thousand transferred to me within twenty four hours then the very next day ill be on the phone to the police with my brothers little folder aix palais de justice isnt it jaumard left a brief silence then the line went dead corbeix saw where barielle was heading from the first few questions saw the problem approaching like a truck aimed head on more prehearing pressure from thibault and how long have you been married to the victims mother chief inspector fornier twentynine years was this involvement made clear to prosecutor corbeix when you first approached him with the case yes it was corbeix raised a hand to interrupt barielle broke off from asking questions and nodded much of this was entered in my initial file folder your justice corbeix halfraised thankfully no pains had hit at the previous instructions and the last few days had been clear but now he could feel the first onset of muscle cramps we have made no secret of chief inspector forniers involvement with monique rosselot i appreciate that but if you indulge me a moment more or in this case defence counsel barielle gestured towards thibault hopefully all will become clear barielle had already cleared the small hearing room for ten minutes private consultation with thibault before resuming with the questions all instruction questions had to be posed by the examining magistrate to avoid direct intimidation of witnesses what initially caused your involvement in the reopened investigation barielle asked dominic the fact that i was one of the only people still traceable connected with the original investigation when marinella calvan first made contact and the reason for your continuing involvement very much the same reason knowledge of the original investigation i was therefore in a far better position to piece things together from any new evidence uncovered at what point was the case handed over to inspector malliene to head after my discussing the case with prosecutor corbeix and what were the reasons for this partly because inspector malliene was under the aix jurisdiction from where the case would be prosecuted and partly because monsieur corbeix was concerned about any possible bias that i might bring because of my attachment to monique rosselot i see barielles tone was flat and not purely as a smoke screen a cover for any perceived bias no inspector malliene had full signingoff powers he was fully at liberty to discount or discard any portion of the investigative enquiry with which he didnt agree inspector malliene was controlling the investigation yes so as the chief investigative officer let us see what exactly did inspector malliene do in this case then let us compare with what his normal duties as someone leading the investigation should be as barielle continued with a chain of questions tying down mallienes and forniers respective investigative involvement corbeix looked down he doodled absently on a pad concentric diminishing squares everything closing in a cold tingle ran up the back of his neck the rest of his body was too numbed too cramped and bombarded by steroids to feel anything either thibault suspected malliene had been just a front or hed been tipped off internally and now hed convinced barielle who was like a fox with a rabbit now that hed gripped hold corbeix fist gripped tight on his pen damn thibault hed hardly been able to give thibault even a decent run for his money any minute now thibault would cry bias barielle would probably agree and thibault would call for a mistrial it could all be over before hed finished doodling at one point fornier fought back because so much of the later evidence linked to earlier findings obviously it fell upon me to do most of the legwork to run things any other way just wouldnt have worked but it did little good the overriding image was that it had been forniers investigation with malliene just a nominated figurehead barielle wasnt happy barielle asked forniers political persuasion and then dismissed him odd question thought corbeix looking up briefly malliene who had already appeared before fornier was recalled malliene tried to beef up his own role and involvement but as the questioning focused on what exactly hed done at each stage it was easy to read between the lines at one point corbeix half switched off there was nothing he could do he rubbed his eyes felt them stinging as the muscle spasms gripped harder often the two came together blurring of vision sometimes extreme vertigo and dizziness but now it was just a faint haze and a watery stinging through the haze the proceedings washed around him barielle would finish his questioning a quick summation and demand for a mistrial from thibault and barielle would rule hopefully forniers small fight back and mallienes attempts at claiming stronger involvement however transparent might at least cast some doubt if not corbeix looked up sharply as he heard his name called that was quick he thought malliene had been dismissed but surely thibault was just starting his summation he nodded and raised up but he could feel the pain jarring his legs the spasms biting sharper it took him a moment to refocus on what was being said i find this all highly irregular barielle commented under normal circumstances yes thibault agreed he held out a palm to indicate corbeix without looking across at him but as i think has already been clearly demonstrated these are not normal circumstances this is merely an extension of the earlier points raised about bias against my client though as i think you will see equally as valid barielle looked awkwardly towards corbeix and waved thibault towards him after a short spell in the clinches with thibault pointing to a page in his folder barielle waved for corbeix to sit down and shrugged apologetically sorry this could take a while or for what might be coming and suddenly it hit corbeix thibault was trying to get barielle to question him outrageous what on earth did thibault have up his sleeve what could he hope to achieve bias one chink of intense clarity struggling up through the haze at length thibault returned to his seat barielle looked up at corbeix im sorry counsellor corbeix i know that this is somewhat irregular but some questions have arisen regarding your involvement which require clarification barielle scanned the typewritten sheet thibault had left with him a moment longer i understand that you are ill counsellor corbeix can you tell me what is the nature of your illness i have multiple sclerosis and has this been diagnosed very long about three years now corbeix glared at thibault outraged that his illness should come under attack but this is no particular secret i informed the garde de sceaux at the palais as long ago as last october my semiretirement aiming towards full retirement has already been planned i just dont see the relevance of all this i know i know barielle held one hand up calming i know that your semiretirement has already been planned barielle read from the sheet and as part of that semiretirement you had planned to hand your case load over to prosecutor galimbert i understand yes thats correct except this case i believe barielle stared at corbeix directly this is the only case youre not handing over to him corbeix blinked heavily suddenly he could see where it was all heading god was there anything that thibault hadnt discovered yes what is the reason for that i discussed it with galimbert but he just wasnt keen i decided to continue myself even though you had previously decided that you might be too ill to continue with full case loads in court after the summer recess yes the final decision was perhaps against my better judgement but if galimbert wasnt keen what choice was there also there were the extreme complexities of the case curt nod and tight smile from barielle what political persuasion is prosecutor galimbert rpr rassemblement pour la republique why barielle rode the question and what political persuasion are you socialist suddenly it hit corbeix in a rush himself socialist fornier socialist thibault complaining about political bias against his client and now them both clearly spotlighted as having bent the rules give thibault his due bastard as he was hed sewn the package together well thibault raised one hand barielle acknowledged corbeix expected thibaults summation his coup de grace but thibault was holding out a booklet some interesting facts i think are also worthy of note about this particular illness your justice thibault started reading from the booklet in severe cases during episodic attacks this will lead in turn to eye strain vertigo and may effect vital functions of the brain causing memory loss and temporary fugue states corbeix felt his blood boil hed accepted that in a year or so he might be in a wheelchair accepted that increasingly hed lack the strength to lift his youngest daughter that hed have to soon sell his boat because even a short day trip would be too tiring but what he wouldnt accept was this smarmy paris advocate preaching what his illness entailed what he might or might not be facing and given the effects of this disease on the brain i think severe questions must be asked about monsieur corbeix mental competence thibault paused for effect or indeed in this case if he has allowed a combination of bias and mental impairment to colour his judgement in continuing but corbeix knew that to hammer home the point effectively hed have to stand and he could feel the spasms biting deeper as he raised he stole himself against the pain feeling it pop beads of sweat on his forehead he was determined not to let it show provide a physical demonstration to support thibaults claims fully upright the spasms in his legs screamed to drag him back down monsieur thibault is not a doctor and i resent him taking up instruction time with amateur diagnosis particularly when its my health that is at issue i was just trying to bring some clarity to i know what you were trying to do corbeix cut in you were challenging my mental competence to continue with this case as it so happens my mental competence is not affected the effects described are only in extreme cases i am far from that stage yet and perhaps god willing i might never be at that stage your pathetic amateur diagnosis is about as ridiculous and assumptive as me suggesting that three generations of inbreeding has made you the idiot you are today gentlemen please please barielle fought to regain order corbeix threw in one last point and as for counseller thibaults suggestion about political bias if your justice please this is as ridiculous as me challenging thibaults right to represent monsieur duclos purely because he too is rpr corbeix sat down a last second scrambled flourish but would it be enough certainly earlier thibault had done enough to convince barielle of sufficient bias to call a mistrial thibault quickly summarized the confronts hed raised personal bias through family ties political bias bias at every turn and finally a question of physical competence had corbeix judgement been sound and would it still be so in three months alain duclos rights to a fair and evenhanded trial had been severely compromised under the circumstances thibault would fully expect a mistrial to be ruled thibault sat down barielle nodded curtly and continued for a moment with some notes corbeix throat was dry he found it difficult to swallow finally barielle looked up to give his deliberation forty when is it that you are due to testify in france tuesday week i understand that the trial procedure is very different there and in effect this will be one of a series of preliminary hearings yes apparently so ill be asked to provide the background of plr to support the link between the two boys and later if the case goes to full trial ill be called to provide pretty much the same information in front of a jury lunch time at boehmier amp kemp washington dc the only quiet time of the day jennifer mcgill decided to have a quick sandwich and use the time to catch up on the mornings paperwork cnn flickered on a screen in the background the sound on low a name on the tv suddenly struck a chord but she couldnt remember from where she looked up abruptly from the file she was reading and turned up the sound larry king was on with a mary elizabeth mastrantonio lookalike who she hadnt seen before even the pretrial run up is apparently turning into something of a media circus in france claims of political bias have been made and of course then we have alain duclos central involvement with a landmark biotechnology case given this intense spotlight no doubt you will face quite hostile challenges regarding the tenuous nature of plr in evidence how will you answer these by keeping firmly to the evidence and the facts in hand the sessions i was involved with alone produced almost ninety pages of transcript and over sixty pages of notes and transcripts were prepared by an associate psychiatrist even before my arrival and then the name hit calvan it wasnt one of her cases it was being handled by gerry sterner but she remembered a researcher from paris being on to gerry just a few days back she picked up the phone and buzzed switchboard susan is gerry still there i think hes in the library ill ring through seconds later sterners voice came on the line yeah gerry jennifer here get to the nearest tv fast your calvan womans on with larry king garbled thanks as sterner darted two doors along to the coffee room two secretaries were watching pacific drive he grabbed the remote sorry sorry emergency larry kings image flicked on in profile trademark red braces to your knowledge have there been any previous incidences where plr evidence has been presented in a murder case two in india though only one made it to full trial but this is the first case of its type in a society which inherently rejects the concept of reincarnation and plr and so in that respect sterner rushed from the room grabbed the first telephone in the adjoining office his secretary was out to lunch so he raised reception susan can you get me jeanpaul thibault at guirannet amp fachaud in france theyll be winding down for the day there so youll have to be quick could it be could it really be monique had decided even after the second tape yes purely because she couldnt think of any other rational explanation nobody else but christian could possibly have known such depth of detail though still that initial wall of resistance berating dominic that she might accept some vague psychic link but not that it was christian reborn but with the continuing sessions and tapes and then the trial though never mentioning anything to dominic her view had slowly changed at first just through attaching christians voice to the descriptions on tape the many poignant memories flooding back but then shed become curious about eyran capel initially only casual questions when dominic talked about the progress of the sessions and the case what does the boy look like is there a resemblance to christian does he remember anything while awake no on every count no image or magic picture in her mind to cling to nothing except the voice on tape playing them repeatedly asking for each additional tape equally as casually trying not to give away the mounting intensity of her curiosity shed have asked to sit in on some sessions but that too might hint of growing obsession and dominic had complained about the difficulties of personally attending the secret game between him and marinella calvan hed only been able to swing one final session with himself and a notary then only a few days ago dominic had mentioned stuart and eyran capel travelling down for the next hearing theyd agreed to meet up beforehand she was sure in that moment shed have said id like to come if it wasnt for where they were meeting the wheat field the wheat field at taragnon suddenly her curiosity and everything shed pushed away for so long were in conflict she couldnt go back there she could never go back there and so she told herself it wasnt important clung to dominics earlier words that he was just a fresh faced english boy light brown hair a few freckles across his nose no resemblance to christian remembers nothing while awake what would she do stand next to this boy she didnt know and ask questions he couldnt answer her heart and soul ripped apart again by the memories perhaps she was never meant to meet this boy it was meant to stay a private thing just her alone with the tapes alone with christians voice she focused sharply back over the top of her wine glass at dominic dinner had been cleared away he looked equally as thoughtful for a moment problems she asked i dont know possibly it didnt go well today but we wont know the outcome for a few days yet when the doors to the hearing room finally swung open corbeix expression had been thunderous he explained to dominic the grilling hed been subjected to and what thibault was demanding breaking off briefly as they both watched thibault pass barielle wanted to consult the greffier notes before ruling counsels to be advised in four days what might happen dominic sighed its bad a mistrial could be called the whole case thrown out moniques eyes softened she grimaced tautly and reached out and touched the back of his hand im sorry dominic youve put so much into this case fought so hard for it but beneath his hesitant smile in return she could read the pain and anguish it was little comfort she gripped his hand tighter look dominic if the case fails you shouldnt feel bad about it because of me weve had a great life together youve given me two beautiful sons youve made me very happy nobody could ask for more i dont expect it of you to set the record straight on christian as well thanks dominic squeezed her hand back though he knew it was probably just to make him feel better about possibly failing like him she would no doubt like to see duclos nailed to the side of the arc de triomphe for what hed done to christian you dont need to do this for me i got over the ghosts of christian long ago but he was doing it as much for himself he thought to set the record straight though she would probably now never know his guilt over machanaud she was right theyd had a great life together shared everything except a few secrets does it bother you everything coming back now in any way awaken the ghosts obviously a little momentary flinch she didnt want to admit how much it had obsessed her he had enough worries and pressure but we shouldnt let it rule our lives if duclos is meant to be convicted then so be it if not the same applies whatever is meant to be is meant to be dont torture yourself trying to change it dominic dont punish yourself youve done everything you can on this case if its still not enough then let it go nobody would blame you think less of you and certainly not me as ever soft understanding her eyes too implored him added depth to her words soulful brown eyes that had melted him the first day he saw her had glimmered and sparkled at him across countless candlelit tables through the years at the birth of yves and gerome and the numerous birthdays and celebrations since a good life god how he loved her but beyond the softness and compassion in her eyes he could still see the pain see the shadows that had haunted her with christian through the decades shadows that belied her compassion that screamed get him get him bring christian justice dont let him get away betinas voice drifted from the kitchen im bringing in the cake now joel smiled duclos smiled awkwardly in return they sat at opposite ends of the dining table distance between them always more acute when betina wasnt present as if she was the only link between them they couldnt communicate effectively without her presence betina came in with the cake and the atmosphere eased white icing with blue piping happy birthday joelten candles a miracle five days skirting with death in an incubator then remarkably joel had started to gain strength another two months with worries about healthy bone formation and joel had never looked back delayed congratulations from colleagues once joel was out of danger cigars you must be overjoyed yes yes of course his best politicians smile inside he was too numbed to know what he really felt at least betina would be happy had been the overriding thought it would keep her occupied away from him some advantages blonde hair mop style blue eyes joel looked like his mother took after her in every way he could see very little of himself in the boy betina smiled appreciatively at the two of them above the cake its good to have you at home alain especially for occasions like this yes its nice to be back duclos forced a smile but thought stupid bitch gendarme posted at the front door his life and future hanging in the balance it was hardly the ideal homecoming but he knew what she meant between brussels and strasbourg the various business trips and weekends sneaked away also covered as business trips he hardly spent any time at home often he would see them only two or three days in as many months duclos laughed inwardly at the irony such was their relationship their sham of a marriage that it had taken a court order to get him to spend some time at home birthdays despite betinas comment one of the few times he was actually present he could only remember missing three of joels birthdays two hed forgotten and betina had barely forgiven him and another had clashed with a vital business trip hed left a present and phoned from prague to wish joel happy birthday a seven year olds sweet lost voice on the line thank you pappa probably hardly remembering from one month to the next what his father looked like he was hardly there and when he was distance he could feel it in the boys eyes whenever they settled on him perhaps he could expect no less with the time he spent away or was it the strong bond joel had with betina making him feel like a stranger an outsider to their activities outside their precious little circle but in his darker moments the boys gaze would unnerve him he would wonder if it wasnt just a questioning look because of his long absences but more knowing as if in that moment as hed feared through the long years the boy had seen through to his soul and guessed his dark secret but hed been so careful had consciously made an effort hed never looked at joel in that way never the boys blonde hair and fair skin had made it easier not the type he was attracted to but apart from that it was his son his son he would never never are you okay yes fine fine but he could feel his pulse racing his hands clenched in fists beneath the table betinas expression was contemplative concerned i know that all of this isnt easy for you but you should try and relax for just a moment youre at home now with your family among people who care about you he let out a long slow breath yes yes youre right tried to let the tension ease away slowly unclenching his hands three more days to know if the case had been thrown out if not then their next chance was with marinella calvan thibault had phoned just the day before to tell him of some juicy new leads he was tracking on calvan was confident that hed be able to crush her in grand style perhaps he shouldnt worry if it wasnt all over with good news from barielle in three days then it certainly would be by the next hearing but that wasnt the only worry he reminded himself later that afternoon no doubt jaumard would call again and hed have to spend time on the phone to geneva to arrange a transfer the court case jaumard his name in every newspaper a gendarme at his door a clutch of newspaper reporters beyond clicking and jostling at the first appearance at times it felt like everything was closing in with the first headlines hed assured betina that it was all ludicrously fabricated none of it true my lawyer will have the case thrown out in no time at all she hadnt asked but hed wanted to answer before any questions possibly came betina had accepted his answer without visible reservation but he couldnt help wondering if a part of her suspected the business trips the long weekends away his rarely sharing her bed just the pattern that would fit in with such a secret life betina was lighting the candles and smiling and joel was smiling too bright eyes above the gleam of the candles eyes that knew duclos shook the thought away as betina had suggested relax he was among family people who cared but through the years how much had he cared a son who felt at times like a stranger a wife who he hardly slept with eyes that sparkled with warmth and understanding and all hed done was spend the long years trying to avoid them and now he had been welcomed back family the tight family circle of betina and joel which hed stood outside for so long self exclusion he let the new feeling of welcome wash through him bathed in its warmth as he watched betina light the last candles betina smiling joel smiling family closeness and warmth he could hardly remember experiencing before but slowly beyond he began to see something else all the other smiles through his weeks at home tight smiles anxious smiles tension so acute that at times it could be cut with a knife moments when it had flashed through his mind uncharitably that hed be better off in prison than stuck at home with the two of them and the falseness beneath their smiles suddenly struck him the thought resurged they knew they both knew and here he was firmly embraced within their syrupy little family circle surrounded by candles and sweet smiles trapped sweet icing smiles blue piping ten oh god the same age christian rosselot had been when hed died the candles glimmered joels smiling face was above them eyes wide as he pouted but all duclos could see was the single candle burning in the hospital with monique rosselots face in profile christian rosselots eyes pleading up at him dont kill me dont kill me and as his son blew out the candles the rock came down he saw himself smashing the life from christian rosselot extinguishing the light feeling the small skull crush as the rock connected spurts of blood warm on his chest and then he was in the car with betina turning the wheel sharply her piercing scream just before they hit the truck duclos bit at his lip sharply and rushed from the room he headed for the bedroom and slammed the door shut behind him after a moment betina came in she sat beside him on the bed one arm across his shoulder in comfort duclos looked down at the floor found it hard to meet her eyes if things go badly it just hit me this could be the last of joels birthdays ill be here for for a while he lied tears would have been fitting but none came dry well of emotions i know i know betina soothed but he wondered at heart what she did know or suspect perhaps they were both lying corbeix phoned dominics office within minutes of the ruling coming through from barielles office weve got it but by the skin of our teeth barielle has made a strong reprimand which will be entered into notes for full trial may still be used by thibault to rap us over the head then but for the moment were still alive just though im sure if anything else comes up that even remotely smacks of the same barielle will throw the case out well hopeful news at least thanks putting down the phone dominic wondered marinella calvan thibault would no doubt give her a battering over plr but at least there should be no claims of bias calvan probably had little or no knowledge of french politics nor cared duclos picked up the phone after the first ring hed put down the phone from thibault only minutes before news of barielles ruling strategy for marinella calvan at the next hearing he thought thibault might have forgotten something was phoning back but it was georges marchand from switzerland after the preliminaries of can we talk freely and how are you coping marchand got to the purpose of his call i had a call a few days back from my people theyre not happy about all the talk in the papers bringing up the biotechnology ruling theyre extremely uncomfortable about the linking of your case to that and with obvious reason its just a ruse by my lawyer they shouldnt worry whats his aim the biotechnology ruling provides good background for his claim of political bias against me strong incentive for political enemies to start coming out of the woodwork we almost got the case thrown out at the last hearing but almost certainly it will be by the next then the whole thing will blow over quickly some new scandal will hit the headlines brief silence from the other end a few days ago they were merely worried but when news from todays le figaro reaches them theyre going to panic remember lenatisse yes lenatisse was a french socialist mp strongly outspoken about the biotech ruling making caustic remarks about duclos handling favouring the greens one journalist seems to be linking your lawyers comments with those of lenatisse have you seen it yet no no i havent he didnt get the papers early hardly ventured out with the gendarme and the press at the door he waited till later in the day for betina to bring the papers in with the shopping ill read it for you bold claims indeed from counsellor thibault of a political witchhunt against his client stemming from the biotechnology dispute but this raises other more intriguing issues in particular minister lenatisses earlier comment however flippantly made that alain duclos might be in the pocket of the greens because certainly if alain duclos is finally found guilty of murder then it doesnt take too extreme a stretch of the imagination to believe that he might also be a corrupt politician perhaps minister lenatisses comments might have some substance after all i see duclos went cold yet another dimension to his problems i can see why theyre worried at least it still only points to the greens your people would be the last to come under suspicion then realized it had sounded offhand but point taken ill mention to thibault to layoff no more mention of the biotechnology dispute and as i say the whole thing should be quashed soon anyway lets hope so marchand wouldnt be surprised if the journalist too was playing an angle for some industry lobby group at present if duclos was convicted of murder the biotechnology ruling still stood only if a connection was successfully made to possible corruption could the debate be retabled there was another reason for me making contact at this stage marchand sighed from his clients last call it was obviously a prime concern but the words just didnt sit right felt out of place with the relationship hed so far established with duclos i know that your lawyer is confident of clearing you but if anything should go wrong if you should feel the need for additional help just call its just so that you know that if the worst comes to the worst you have friends out there people who will help you yes yes certainly ill remember that marchand rang off duclos had sounded suitably nonplussed by the gesture probably its significance wouldnt hit him for a while or perhaps he was so confident his lawyer would clear him he hadnt even considered other possibilities not an entirely altruistic gesture by his client marchand realized the last thing they wanted was a convicted duclos eager to make deals and turn states evidence sink some industry big fish by telling all about his years as a corrupt politician fortyone stilted three way conversation questions from barielle through the translator to marinella calvan and in turn back again with calvans answers it reminded marinella of the sessions with philippe and eyran what is your preferred method for conducting sessions asked barielle hypnosis i understand that your predecessor dr donaldson preferred conducting sessions while people were awake what was the reason for this he felt that sometimes hypnosis could be suggestive could spark off unwarranted imaginations if used the wrong way i see so hypnosis could be used to suggest imaginative scenarios that werent real yes but as i say only if misused corbeix looked up the first hesitation from calvan the first half hour had already covered much of her background at the university of virginia and her working relationship with donaldson corbeix had spent almost an hour going over points in file notes in private chambers with barielle the day before he imagined that thibault had spent a similar time as the most unusual element in the case it was important that barielle gained a full grasp of the subject but equally its unorthodox nature would target it as the main area for thibault to try and discredit corbeix tried to pick up on his own questions and those influenced by thibault sometimes the dividing line was vague or they might be additional questions posed by barielle except now throwing doubt on hypnosis thibaults hand was on the rudder in working with children as donaldson did almost exclusively i felt that many would have vivid imaginations in any case particularly because he so often worked with children in india and asia where reincarnation is an accepted part of their culture and you generally have avoided working with children from those regions yes my main work has been with children in america and europe any particular reason for this marinella thought for a moment challenge i suppose it was more of a challenge to delve into past lives with children from a culture where reincarnation wasnt normally accepted rather than one where it was and of course this makes hypnosis all the more essential to drag out buried or heavily repressed memories fresh breath from barielle can you tell me what are the percentages of people that believe in past life regressions in europe and america in america the figures are going up all the time as much as thirty thirtyfive percent i now believe but in europe i understand that its slightly less twenty twentyfive percent but among the rest theres a lot of not sures and dont knows i see but in general in america and europe is it fair to say that most people do not fully accept or believe marinella cast her eyes down slightly reluctant admission yes it is in your own work has this been significant something you have seen as an obstacle that if possible you would like to change get more people to believe marinella shrugged and smiled yes of course its something that everyone working with plr and related fields is continually fighting for wider acceptance thats why we spend so much time building up strong case histories one eyebrow arched as if to say stupid question days and sometimes weeks spent compiling tapes and transcripts ninety pages alone from eyran capels sessions with her and donaldson up until am solidly for over a week to knock it into shape for a publishable paper for the university its a constant battle against scepticism much of it from within our own profession from the more staid and conventional areas of psychiatry and psychology so it would be true to say that your desire to convince a wider audience about the relevance of plr has been a strong driving force behind your career to date yes the first warning signs marinella felt the need to quickly redress the balance it was the main reason i specialized so strongly in xenoglossy use of a foreign language unknown to the main subject probably the strongest possible support for real regressions particularly with young children whove had little or no opportunity to learn the language in question this was the main reason why dr lambourne contacted me in the first place with the eyran capel case my work with xenoglossy eyran capel has been a particularly large and important case for you yes unequivocal shed had nothing else even nearing it barielle flicked through some notes but i understand that you had some relative success with a xenoglossy case a few years back a young boy in cincinnati can you tell me what happened there marinella looked sharply at corbeix she hadnt told him in her briefing that morning nor she was sure had she mentioned anything to fornier then her gaze shifted to thibaults telltale half smile he quickly averted his eyes to something indicated in a folder by his assistant jesus they had been digging i had a paper half published announcements prepared for a forthcoming full paper when the boys father pulled him from the sessions what were the reasons he gave that he didnt feel his son would benefit from continuing regressionary sessions was worried even that they might harm him as a result i daresay that this was something that you would not like to have happen again a subject being pulled away from sessions prematurely no i suppose not faint annoyance at the obviousness i dont think anyone would barielles blue eyes glared across purposefully so tell me what was the reaction of dr lambourne or eyran capels uncle and guardian stuart when you told them that the final sessions would be used to track down clues on christian rosselots murder marinellas mouth suddenly went dry she felt as if a trap door had suddenly opened she flustered well we just didnt know straightaway that was what we were looking for that didnt come out till later but i understand that chief inspector fornier was present at some of those final sessions yes but only the last one suddenly the fire exit was there and she bolted for it that was when he first saw the possibility of vital details coming out about the murder and decided to attend and for the other sessions i sent him transcripts and tapes so he nurtured and maintained an interest in the case throughout but didnt reveal the purpose of that interest until the last moment yes marinella shrugged i dont think he was even sure himself until the last moment i see barielle was brooding thoughtful he didnt look satisfied he flicked through some notes then looked across at corbeix what do you have in your file for the date the notary fenouillet was first contacted about travelling to london you might be able to find it easier than me corbeix was slightly flustered at the proceedings swinging suddenly to him he leafed quickly through his own notes here it is april third barielle asked the session dates in london and corbeix flicked through more pages finally march thirtieth april fourth april sixth and april the eleventh so just before the second session it would appear therefore that fornier was certainly aware of the possibility after even the first of those final sessions barielle turned again to marinella calvan and chief inspector fornier mentioned nothing to you at that stage about using the information to possibly further his investigation marinella changed tack realizing that if she stuck to her guns it would reflect badly on fornier well nothing directly but he certainly intimated it intimated could you possibly elaborate on exactly what was and wasnt said corbeix cringed as barielle and calvan argued over semantics of language was she aware that those final sessions were aiding an investigation or not after a few moments the most he was able to get from her was that she was made vaguely aware but certainly she didnt know for sure until the sessions were drawing to a close and this vague awareness was this at any time passed on to dr lambourne or stuart capel i might have hinted at something marinella fumbled i dont remember exactly we had quite a few conversations some elements of the case were extremely complicated as you appreciate barielle stared impatiently at calvan its a straightforward question ms calvan did lambourne or stuart capel know that these final sessions might aid a murder investigation not directly marinella bit back how could they if at that stage i didnt even know for sure myself as i mentioned even chief inspector fornier i dont think was totally sure until the final session barielle sighed calvans ambiguity was wearing him down the three way nature of the questioning made it all the more tedious well thankfully well soon be able to ask dr lambourne and stuart capel directly if they knew but to dispense with you for the time being ms calvan your final word is that you did not know for sure the sessions were being used to aid a murder investigation until the final session no thats correct and for a moment presuming that you had known and had informed dr lambourne and stuart capel what do you think would have been their reaction im not sure i dont know but she was trembling inside she did know she was sure then let me suggest something given your past experience with the cincinnati boy isnt it likely that your first assumption would have been that they would have pulled eyran from the sessions prematurely they wouldnt have agreed to continue i dont know marinella flustered thats purely speculative the thought never even really barielle steamrollered over her protests didnt even wait for the translation or certainly even if that wouldnt have happened thats what you would have feared which is why you ensured that nothing was mentioned to either dr lambourne or stuart capel you were afraid of losing one of the largest cases of your career corbeix cradled his head in one hand as barielle continued now emphasizing just how big a case this was for her speeches book contracts chat shows a spot on larry king just the other week which barielle had viewed on videotape thibaults people had been busy very busy thibault had fed barielle a particularly juicy rabbit this time and barielle obviously wasnt going to be satisfied until hed stripped the last inch of flesh it has been suggested by defence counsel that the enormity of this case and your pursuit of the possible fame and fortune derived from it has severely tainted your judgement that if dr lambourne and stuart capel had been informed of the purpose of those final sessions they would have never agreed to them and by not providing such information in effect the final sessions with eyran capel were gained under false pretences and resultantly none of the evidence gained therein should be accepted corbeix noticed barielle glancing at his folder perhaps referring to the exact text provided by thibault no doubt another mistrial demand and on the evidence so far before me im inclined to agree but before i conclude my decision as i say i will hear first from dr lambourne and stuart capel barielle flicked forward a page in his folder finally ms calvan when was it that the possible potential of this case struck you when did you start arranging lecture tours and chat shows an easy question at last thought calvan well obviously not until after the last session so mid april sometime yes about then then i would like you to listen to this barielle produced a tape recorder from beneath his desk top i will ask your comments afterwards a small cassette recorder barielle ceremoniously pressed play the sound was faint and tinny and barielle turned up the sound to ensure it carried across the room its a story were preparing for next weeks edition what paper did you say miami herald marinella recognized the voice straightaway her agent stephanie bruckmann stephanie had mentioned the miami herald calling we were hoping to combine a short bio on marinella calvan with a human interest piece on this case in france i saw kings interview a few days back sounds a fascinating case a mans voice whoever it was they were good the mood settled with general questions to start before honing in on finer detail answers were teased thick and fast out of bruckmann the two voices singing tinnily across the room marinella felt as if she had been raped shed come fully prepared for plr to be put on trial its credibility questioned and pummelled from every angle but in the end theyd attacked mainly her own credibility and now this was the final assault one of thibaults stateside goons posing as a reporter she felt as if hed broken into her home and rifled through her bedside drawer had picked out her private diary and was now reading it aloud to the courtroom underhand shit and when was it she first contacted you to start setting up possible speeches and interviews sometime in april i believe do you remember the exact day its important you see to get the biography accurate pause faint flicking of paper yes here we are i started setting things in motion on the the twentyfourth of april but she initially made contact what about three weeks before she phoned me from london told me what was in the pipeline with plr and the murder case then we talked a couple more times in between as the sessions progressed if marinella hadnt already guessed what was the crucial point on the tape she would have known from the way barielle that second stared up at her searing blue eyes she read it all in barielles face three weeks before the twentyfourth third of april only days after the first session crucifixion she wanted to scream its not fair it wasnt just for myself but for the acceptance of plr at large scream at the injustice and the tactics used to gain the tape at thibault and his goons and the slimy murderer of a politician who had hired them but the image that overrode was of dominic fornier walking away from her that day in covent garden shoulders slumped a lifetime of tracking down duclos and now her stupidity had let him down destroyed the case and now there was probably nothing she could say that barielle would believe it would only make matters worse so she just listened as the tape droned to a finish stood redfaced feeling powerless and cheated as the last of her credibility slipped away cold marble dominic could feel the chill of the corridor unlike the individual rooms the corridors in the palais de justice had hardly changed through the years timeless memories of perrimond of machanaud of every bold prosecutor and the many poor condemned souls who had sat in the cavernous hallways the past thirty years awaiting their fate sat as dominic was now on a wood bench staring down at the floor dirt ingrained in marble tiles the only remnants left of those who had waited on justice stained memories marinella calvan had come out only moments before and recounted the catalogue of disasters that had taken place inside im sorry it all went so terribly wrong i just dont know how they got hold of half the information dominic could see she was distraught she could have just rushed past him and headed straight down the palais de justice steps without taking the time out to say anything he placated its okay we gave it our best shot if its not meant to be then so be it moniques words even the publicity to date will have done duclos no good as marinella had come out david lambourne was called in she commented i dont think hell do us any particular favours beyond dominic on the bench were stuart and eyran capel stuart would appear straight after lambourne then eyran to close the afternoons proceedings since the boy had no direct recall of what took place under hypnosis he would be asked only his name date of birth and to confirm the times and dates he attended the sessions in question dominic wasnt sure how much stuart capel had overheard of his conversation with marinella calvan but when she went over in turn to say hello to stuart dominic noticed that at first stuart looked concerned a few words with both stuart and eyran a quick ruffle of eyrans hair and soon afterwards she was gone dominic recalled that she had a boy of her own about eyran capels age noticing dominic stare thoughtfully at the floor stuart commented i suppose it must come as something of a blow i dont know if its fully hit me yet dominic sighed so stuart had overheard something or marinella had mentioned it it just seems to have been such a long haul the past few weeks have felt like thirty years ive had to relive my past all over again pained smile all my sins they sat in silence for a moment respect for the dead trial stuart capel was the first to break it when is the hearing with your wife two hearings time probably about a month or so stuart nodded lambourne had sent him copies of the transcripts two weeks after the last sessions with calvan when eyrans condition started dramatically improving stuart was curious what had led to that turning point a haunting almost surreal quality to the transcripts which stuart had found hard to relate to eyran hardly any of that netherworld had broken through to eyrans life outside of the dreams stuart hadnt let eyran read the transcripts but had recounted the main foundations of the case eyrans first main excitement had been that he had been helping out on a reallife murder case then later the deeper relevance dawned that it was a past life and in that life he had been the victim pieces of a dark puzzle slotting finally into place the last stages in a long healing process acceptance and as part of that final closing of the book theyd arranged to go to the wheat field with fornier earlier that morning they were staying in cannes fornier in lyon they met at a cafe by the bauriac main square and drove out thirty minutes of walking through an empty field some extra colour and shapes put to the voice on tape but no real answers but part of eyrans rising curiosity had been monique rosselot and stuart had asked about her then would she be at the later hearing eyran had hoped to meet her and dominic had explained the sequence monique wouldnt appear until two hearings time to confirm the details on tape and corroborate the coin evidence that christian left that fateful day with it in his pocket theyd followed in a separate hire car to aix so hadnt discussed it further but now with its mention again dominic commented with all this happening i doubt her hearing will even take place now look leave me your number before you leave ill talk to monique stuart took out his wallet and fished out a card thats my work number in london dominic took it and tucked it into his own wallet when dominic had mentioned the meeting at taragnon to monique hed left a long pause after he hadnt wanted to ask directly if she wanted to go insensitive but shed just bit her lip and looked away her curiosity obviously didnt go that far it could have been taragnon or what memories the boy might stir how many sessions left now dominic asked stuart had earlier mentioned them winding down only three more then that should be it dominic smiled at eyran coy smile in return hesitant stuart said that hed improved a lot but he was probably anxious now about testifying thought dominic dont worry the magistrates quite tame really they feed him fresh bananas and nuts every hour wider smile in response from eyran all reservation gone the boy looked well at least one good thing to have come out of the whole mess just remember that he was also eleven once and youll be fine stuart too smiled and nodded appreciative of the brief pep comment there was a bit of disagreement between lambourne and marinella calvan about the root cause of eyrans problem but in the end it appears calvans theory was right eyrans accident and period of coma linked to that previous period of coma opened up the past until the events that led up to that previous coma are fully confronted and exorcised eyran cant start getting to grips with the problems from his own life facing and tackling his own grief but the recall reminded stuart of the calamity that had just been wrought due to calvan shame about what just happened with her nice lady i like her im sure she meant well im sure she did feisty wellmeaning marinella calvan one woman with a plr banner against a world of disbelievers her cause was obviously far grander and nobler than his all hed wanted was to find justice for a ten year old boy dominic shook off his anger quickly she wasnt to know the lengths that thibault and his henchmen would go to just another in a long chain of calamities though theyd scraped through the last hearing corbeix had admitted what had caused one of the main stumbling blocks his illness theyd been kidding themselves all along dominic mused the lost voice of a ten year old boy on tape an ageing detective trying to prove one last big case before late retirement a case that had haunted him through three decades and a halfcrippled prosecutor up against one of the top paris law firms and a leading politician theyd never even had a chance corbeix felt the cramps bite deeper as he saw the case slipping away but he felt powerless as he watched barielle question lambourne nothing left to do but to sit and nurse his painful legs so to recap at no point were you informed by ms calvan that information from the sessions might be used for a murder investigation no i was not we have heard earlier from doctor calvan that in fact this was intimated or suggested by her was even this perhaps done no i dont remember any such sort of suggestion lambourne had made it patently clear that he wasnt aware with some earlier displays of annoyance other objectives put before his clients interests he considered a serious ethical breach his patients progress could have been adversely affected recalling the comment corbeix saw a last minute chance to fight back his leg muscles protested as he rose a few minutes back and forth with barielle and the questions were posed as prosecutor corbeix has suggested dr lambourne in regard to your comment about the possible adverse affects to your patient is it not true that this tactic of getting eyran capel to face events surrounding this past life murder finally led to a breakthrough in his treatment yes it did reluctant admission though i think this might have been more by good fortune than design you were also i believe clearly informed that inspector fornier and a notary would be present for one of the final sessions yes but i was told that this was purely for filing of possible additional information about the murder did it at no time occur to you that this filing might have also included a reinvestigation of the murder no im afraid it didnt but lambournes final tone had been lame tentative thought corbeix a couple of weak strikes back but corbeix doubted it would be enough lambourne was dismissed and stuart capel called as corbeix watched stuart capel go through the preliminaries of his name age and relationship with eyran capel his earlier sense of hopelessness settled deeper barielle would ask capel if hed been aware that the final sessions were aiding a murder investigation and capel would say he hadnt corbeix would raise a few small points and objections but would it make any difference he doubted it theyd been lucky to scrape through the last hearing and barielle had warned that if any such circumstance arose again you and your wife were given charge of your brothers son as godparents is that correct yes it is and at what point did you become aware that eyran might be mentally disturbed and need treatment about two to three weeks after i took him out of the hospital in california the questions brought back the memories vapoured breath on mist air as jeremy was lowered into the ground the first bad dreams racing upstairs as he heard eyran screaming the first indication that the boy might be disturbed i understand was because of a series of dreams is that correct yes it was and as a result of the disturbing nature of those dreams you finally entered the boy into sessions with dr lambourne yes dr lambourne had been recommended by eyrans surgeon in california dr torrens christmas in oceanside just him and eyran taco dips and turkey distant hesitant looks the first moment it struck him this isnt the eyran i remember barielle made quick work of the reasons calvan was finally called in the switch over from conventional to regressionary therapy this was ground hed already covered in detail with lambourne and calvan but at the mention of her name stuart thought shed come up with the main theory for the breakthrough with eyran brought back the eyran he remembered and yet now there were two stages to the sessions with calvan i understand barielle confirmed the first was just general exploratory but in the second coming just over a week later dr calvan apparently proposed a theory that she thought might help eyrans progress yes she did and she was right thought stuart her theory had worked and now they wanted him to betray her plunge home the final knife and as those final sessions were approached did doctor calvan at any time make you aware that they might be used to further a murder investigation but all stuart could think of was calvans expression as shed come out of the courtroom fornier crestfallen as she told him betrayal it was wrong he fumbled hesitantly im not sure i believe she did thibault looked up sharply adjusted his steelrimmed glasses and squinted barielle stared at him intently doubt disbelief are you sure about this mr capel this is quite a crucial point fornier looking despondently at the floor the distant hopeful light hed seen in forniers eye earlier in the wheat field suddenly gone defeat sat now on a bench in the coolness of the corridor next to eyran two survivors the last fleeting image before hed entered the hearing room more confidently yes im quite certain she mentioned it at the outset of those final sessions thibault was on his feet but this is preposterous we have heard from both dr lambourne and even from doctor calvans own mouth that this in fact was not the case if anything is indeed preposterous then it will be for me to suggest barielle admonished he asked thibault to sit down and refrain from further interruptions then he couched the same question to capel less confrontationally can you explain these apparent discrepancies in testimony doctor lambourne im afraid might be my fault perhaps i did neglect to mention it but if doctor calvan claims not to have said anything then shes selling herself short perhaps she truly forgot that shed mentioned it to me a lot of other issues at the time were far more pressing not least of all finding a cure for eyran its easy for something like that to get buried corbeix observed thibaults silent fury and gloated due deserts for his tactics initial disbelief from barielle then finally acceptance as a functionary of the law his first duty was to record testimony not interpret it regardless of any doubts barielle still harboured the file would show that marinella calvan had preadvised of the final sessions being used in a murder investigation no mistrial corbeix was almost sure that stuart capel had lied but why perhaps best in the end if he didnt know no possible later selfrecriminations that hed nailed duclos partly through unfair advantage all he knew was that the cramps in his legs were suddenly gone he was steering his boat towards port and all he could see ahead was clear flat water fortytwo un cocacola et une biere the waiter put down their drinks stuart capel nodded and he walked away eyran sipped at his coke and looked towards the beach are you okay now stuart asked yes fine stuart had promised eyran a visit to the beach after the ordeal of testifying and le lavandou was one of the first they came to on their way back from aix eyran had been fine at first swimming floating on his back feeling all the tension drift from his body but as hed come to sit next to stuart on the beach the outline of the harbour and headland somehow seemed familiar a sense of deja vu have we been here before hed asked no only to the beach at cannes but you came with your mum and dad to the south of france a couple of years before you went to america youd have been what five or six maybe thats it but eyran knew in that instant it wasnt he remembered other things from that holiday but not this beach the voices around people talking and calling out the excitable screeches of children playing and splashing in the shallows echoed and rattled inside his head and then the other familiar images suddenly flashed through the wheat field the nearby village square some men playing boules theyd passed it was almost as if his nervousness with the trial had blocked everything then as soon as he relaxed the gap in his mind opened stuart had asked if he was okay and hed fluffed that it was probably just the trial and having to speak in front of the judge but seeing his eyes dart anxiously at the people around stuart seemed keen to get him away he suggested they get a drink now again he was checking one thing at least with which hed been fortunate hed always liked his uncle stuart and he could tell that his uncle really cared his fostering wasnt just an obligation felt to his father it was something about the beach something i then eyran stopped himself even his recall now of the wheat field was pleasant perhaps that was why hed had a block before the emphasis had been on him remembering anything bad yet all he felt was warmth it reminded him of the fields by broadhurst farm where he played when he was younger stuart was looking at him curiously one eyebrow raised are you sure everythings fine eyran nodded hastily and sipped at his coke he got on well now with tessa hed settled in at his new school and made some new friends the nightmares had stopped and only a few sessions remained everything was fine yet he knew that if he mentioned some fresh recall stuart might start to worry and think about extending the sessions and probably that would bother stuart more than himself whatever images still replayed after the sessions remaining hed just have to sort out himself theyd remain his own private domain like the copse at broadhust farm yes i feel better now eyran said and quickly turned away from stuart searching into his eyes for the truth looked again towards the beach he recalled from another time dominic was on the a heading south towards the fourth instruction at aix en provence clear water corbeix view from the two meetings dominic had with him in the twelve days leading up to the next hearing thibault had fired his main ammunition and failed there would obviously still be some obstacles ahead but corbeix saw them as more clearly flagged he knew what to expect it should be more or less plain sailing now through the remaining instruction hearings towards full trial in particular the next hearing should be an easy run vincent aurillet and bennacer on duclos background with young boys then later barielle with a summary of evidence to date from dominic and corbeix the main feast would be aurillet thibault would be wise to keep his head down corbeix commented aurillets evidence is unshakeable duclos voice is on tape and aurillet will spill forth chapter and verse about duclos sordid history with young boys i doubt well see a confront notice but at the last minute just three days before the hearing one was posted the only thing corbeix could think of was thibault possibly attacking aurillets seedy background trying to discredit him through that i cant imagine hell get much else worthwhile but dominic wondered all the other confronts had been posted at least ten days in advance this time it was almost as if theyd only discovered something new at the last moment or purposely wanted to post late so as not to allow time for the shoring up of defences the thought preyed on dominics mind dominic glanced at his car clock pm he wanted to give himself at least twenty minutes before the pm hearing with bennacer and corbeix bennacer was escorting aurillet up from marseille after losing eynard theyd taken no chances and had kept him under police guard in a hotel room press coverage had gained momentum the past two weeks a copy of le monde was on the seat beside dominic duclos haunted face staring out on the front page snapped through a car side window one of the few occasions duclos had ventured out during house arrest one of the more considered articles though still along similar lines comparisons to the tapie case and to medecin the exmayor of nice selfexiled in uruguay due to corruption charges new france against the old north against the south new france thirty years ago in provence it could take up to a year to have a new phone installed now a new minitel system could be installed in hours a train then took ten hours to paris now a tgv sped through in less than half the time but france was proud also of its political evolution in that period past bureaucracy had been streamlined the past old boy networks of favouritism and protectionism torn down corruption combatted particularly in the provinces with the south always considered as one of the worst offenders the fact that duclos was from limoges was conveniently overlooked the crime had taken place in provence and the original trial and now the retrial were also there crime and corruption in the south slotted into a popular and familiar image good copy only this time it had been given a slightly different spin the old trial and its failure to prosecute duclos that instead a poor vagrant and poacher had been convicted was seen as typical of the protectionist attitude to officialdom endemic then symbol of past corruption and the new trial was seen as the fresh broom part of the new tide that had swept away past corruption increasingly the past decade figurehead of just what had been torn down in rebuilding the new france the trial of the decade it had all the ingredients a leading politician a detective stalking him relentlessly through three decades regressionists and psychics on chat shows a multibillion dollar biotechnology dispute and endemic corruption and political sidetaking no doubt he and corbeix were both now viewed as champions of the new france battling against endemic southern provincial corruption dominic shook his head at heart the issue should have been so simple could justice finally be found for the murder of a ten year old boy dominic eased his foot down touching kmph that justice was surely now closer he pushed his concern about thibaults late confront notice to the back of his mind i thought you said that it would all be over at the last instruction hearing if it wasnt for something that came up unexpectedly at the last minute it would have been duclos defended but it certainly will by the next first the last now the next my people are becoming anxious and with good reason marchands tone was impatient despite the fact that your lawyer might have stopped mentioning the subject the biotechnology dispute has come up again as they say in the media one of those stories that will run and run panic everyone panicking everything closing in duclos rubbed his strained eyes his sleep had been poor for weeks now even hed panicked after the last hearing collapsed began to worry that this would be the pattern at every hearing hopes built up of winning through getting the case thrown out then at the very last minute everything crushed hed started to think of last ditch options if all else failed and had finally put through a call to brossard two more people who might need to go the same way as eynard he would phone again if he had to finally go ahead with the action in the end he doubted it would be necessary but it was comforting to know there was a final failsafe option if all else went wrong brossard already checking the movements of the people concerned primed and ready to move if he had to call again the only one not panicking was jaumard hed called duclos at five oclock one morning from tacloban in the southern philippines thasss amazing its almost lunch time here hed remarked to duclos complaint about the time its just to let you know your transfer arrived okay im busy spending it here with a couple of friends duclos could tell that jaumard had been drinking could hear a couple of girls giggling in the background well its nice to hear your voice minister nice to know that youre still alive they havent guillotined you yet a quick guffaw and jaumard rang off the call put duclos in a foul mood for hours he was unable to get back to sleep jaumard off in the philippines spending his money with a couple of tarts while he was trapped in his own house with betina joel a gendarme and half the nations press at the gate finally hed managed to calm himself it would soon all be over he reminded himself of the strength of the ace card they were holding with aurillet at the next hearing this time there was a virtual guarantee he placated marchand dont worry the hearing coming up now is a completely different situation we have almost total control over whats going to happen but if you want to wait till after the hearing to assure your people fine we should know in a few hours what makes you so sure of success at first duclos wasnt going to tell marchand he could have just glossed over the issue avoided answering but he felt the need to put marchands mind at ease once and for all and he was also proud found himself almost gloating over the ingenuity of the scheme as he explained it to marchand at least one touch of genius among the whole mess marchands reaction was almost as breathless as thibaults when hed explained the ruse four days earlier what you mean aurillet is practically in your pocket when in fact the prosecution think hes one of their most important assets got it in one marchand at least seemed more settled and assured as he signed off in contrast thibault had been quite agitated the sheer audacity of the scheme or its implications the fact that as his lawyer unless he wanted to drop the case he had little choice but to ride along with it id better post a confront notice straight away do what you have to duclos had commented flatly but thought if thibault had delivered what hed promised earlier he wouldnt have even had to play the ruse and tell thibault worry his delicate legal sensibilities thibault should have been thankful it had all been laid on a plate for him all he had to do was sit back and watch the case explode in corbeix face dominics hand trembled on his mobile phone as he dialled please god let me be wrong let me be wrong past thoughts flashing as hed sped fast traffic snippets of conversations the phone started ringing motorway layby the first dominic had come to large trucks passing rocked his car slightly bennacer answered after two rings background noise of traffic bennacer was on his mobile obviously en route to aix im surprised in a way that his pimp is aurillet part of a conversation from over a week ago that dominic hadnt pursued at the time dominic asked bennacer about it now what led you to make that comment it was just that looking at the details of the case the boy killed in taragnon was dusky mixture of french and north african also eyrnard in paris specializes in a lot of that type but as far as i know aurillet mostly deals with fairskinned boys bennacer glanced back towards aurillet handcuffed to a sergeant in the back seat aurillet looked uncomfortable possibly at the conversation taking place as if he wasnt there he turned away glanced through the side window is there a marseillebased pimp who specializes in dusky boys dominic asked a couple but the main one that springs to mind is francois vacharet place in the panier district used to be run by his father emile you should remember the father we investigated his murder together back when you were on our patch looked like a milieu hit yes yes i do hazy memory from twenty years ago thats the other thing vacharets was one of the few places also operating back in bennacer turned back to aurillet too far back for you vince huh still in nappies aurillet sat tightjawed staring through the window probably stung by the jibe though bennacer thought for a moment he saw something beyond aurillet looked genuinely perturbed so if duclos did have a pimp back then it wasnt aurillet have you got a number for vacharet not on me but if you call my assistant moudeux hell pull something up from the file thanks dominic rang off dialled straight out to the marseille station and was put through to moudeux thirty seconds of moudeux tapping through a computer file and he had the number dominic dialled it straightaway a mans voice answered after the second ring dominic asked for francois vacharet hes on the other line right now who may i say is calling victor im an associate of alain duclos acting as liaison between him and his lawyer jeanpaul thibault one moment dominic felt his nerves racing in the wait if anything had been done to disguise duclos activities then it was a strong bet it had been arranged through his real pimp but dominic knew that hed have to be assumptive take the initiative to get to the truth francois vacharet can i help you dominic announced himself again im phoning on behalf of alain duclos he doesnt like to use his line at home too freely while hes under house arrest were just going into the session with aurillet and we wondered if theres anything we need to know from your perspective i dont know not really vacharet sounded vaguely perplexed my name shouldnt even come into it we understand that dominics heart was pounding vacharet hadnt denied knowledge of aurillet he knew something its just to ensure that aurillet has everything straight to ensure that your name is kept clear he should do since one of the main aims was to make the police look bad i made things pretty clear on that front flat tone as if stupid question besides i understand he has a tape that should be the main thing to swing it tape dominic went ice cold yes yes of course fought to keep his voice nonchalant so from your point of view nothing particular that we should know no not really thanks for your time anyway just thought it was safest to check dominic rang off a juggernaut went close by its air rush buffeting the car he shook off a faint shiver and phoned bennacer back its a set up dominic said i dont know how yet but whatever you do dont let aurillet go into the hearing find corbeix straightaway and get him to arrange a half hour postponement and a private room for aurillet ill be there as soon as i can youve already been told youre not our main interest duclos is well ive only got your word for that id rather wait until i can be represented by my lawyer we can do this a couple of ways to start with i can bounce you off every wall in this room ill claim that you became hysterical started throwing yourself and furniture around so i had to restrain you silence no response from aurillet dominic sat with corbeix bennacer and aurillet listening to the tape it was a small flat memo tape the type that slots neatly into a wallet aurillet had taped the time he was left in the questioning room with moudeux then we can start contacting your clients inform them youre under police surveillance you cant do that i dont know public duty i would have thought they wouldnt want to get caught up in your mess weve got five days of clients on tape then we can spread the word through our milieu contacts you bastard by the time were finished whether you want to talk to us or not will be immaterial youll be out of business the few minutes remaining on the tape were in a similar vein threats intimidation protests from aurillet before reluctant agreement to cooperate not far different from what theyd had to employ in the first ten minutes with aurillet now to get him to come clean dominic thought sourly the fact that they already knew from vacharet that a tape existed gave the initial vantage threat of prosecution for deception and perjury on one hand with virtual immunity on the other tipped the remaining balance so what was the plan dominic asked getting a strike against the police for intimidation not only that aurillet said flatly the voice you have on tape that you think is duclos its not him close but not his voice his lawyer was going to contest that evidence too call in a voice analyst it wouldnt have passed the test dominic was incredulous as the full details of the plan unravelled duclos was desperately afraid of his background with young children emerging vacharet was also concerned about being implicated so agreed to help aurillet had a gambling debt of francs which was troubling him and in the end that was the fee agreed for his part in the plan they knew that the police had been trying to unearth child pimp background on duclos through milieu informants so it wouldnt come as a surprise when an anonymous tipoff came through about aurillet with that they knew that it was likely that aurillets line would be tapped though made sure by having their own sound engineer check a decent gap of a few days and then someone posing as duclos phones aurillet is hauled in for questioning but doesnt admit anything until unduly pressured when the case comes to court aurillet concluded i deny everything and produce the tape duclos lawyer has already been claiming that the case against his client is falsified and all of this then ties in perfectly dominic was breathless at the audacity of the scheme it would have appeared that the police had manufactured the tipoff and the taped call from duclos with a curtain call of intimidation of aurillet false tipoff false tape intimidation game set and match theyd only just scraped through the recent hearings with claims of bias there would have been no possibility of surviving this last onslaught last minute reprieve dominic let out a long breath and looked up at the ceiling jesus he looked back sharply at aurillet was thibault in on this i dont know stupid question thought dominic certainly thibault had to have been aware before the hearing now dominic stormed out into the corridor he looked its length three or four people milling thibault beyond them at the corridors end on a wall pay phone dominic felt his anger boil over as he paced towards thibault theyd been in the small room with aurillet for over twenty minutes and now thibault was on the phone no doubt warning duclos that something had gone wrong seething anger at duclos manipulation through the years manipulating the evidence and his timing in the cafe thirty years ago fooling poullain and perrimond that he was straightlaced and squeaky clean manipulating an electorate through all the years since and now aurillet and thibault good upright duclos champion of the people it was the police and all around him that were manipulative dishonest thibault didnt see him approach until the last minute all dominic overheard was good question but i really dont know it could be that thibault glanced around saw dominic muttered ive got to go now and went to put the phone down dominic grabbed it before it hit the cradle who were you speaking to was it duclos thibault shuffled nervously looked down didnt answer dominic spoke into the mouthpiece duclos duclos is that you faint sound of breathing some background noises then the line went dead dominic slammed down the receiver and pushed thibault back against the wall you were in on this seedy little scheme werent you dominic grabbed thibaults jacket by the shoulder balled it tight so that it pulled against his neck and now you were on the phone to duclos warning him it might have all gone wrong havent you heard of clientlawyer privilege thibault spluttered mixture of fear and outrage pathetic just like duclos clinging to moral high ground to the last dominic thought of thibaults assault on calvan the attack on both his own and corbeix credibility and it was suddenly tempting to bury his fist in thibaults face wipe away his selfsatisfied smile once and for all but in the end he just gave thibault a last push against the wall and let him go he wasnt worth it bennacer had followed out only seconds later was now behind him looking concerned corbeix had stayed in the room with aurillet dominics main worry was that thibault had managed to warn duclos they had aurillet but now they also knew that vacharet was the main link to duclos and young boys something duclos would be eager to remove at all costs if hed been desperate enough to take out eynard then suddenly it hit dominic that even if duclos hadnt already been warned by thibaults call hed have guessed something was wrong by him suddenly snatching the phone and calling out his name dominic turned to bennacer call your station get a squad car out to vacharets and fast duclos duclos is that you duclos recognized the voice immediately a cold shiver spread through his body something had gone wrong desperately wrong duclos went over to the window and looked out joel was in the garden kicking a football the view from the front was probably much the same as it had been twenty minutes ago gendarme by the front door and thirty metres beyond two reporters by the gate life chez duclos less reporters than a few weeks back but no doubt the rat pack would increase again closer to the full trial joels movements in the garden hardly registered beyond his thoughts but hed hardly noticed the boy anyway through all the years he thought ruefully why should now be any different especially now full trial with everything now fallen apart his last ace card destroyed there would almost certainly be a full trial and nothing to stand between him and conviction but two people two key people around which all else hinged duclos fists balled tight his face was flushed raw acid anger surging beneath it was hardly believable that fornier and his ragtag bunch had got this far would end up pushing him to these limits had they forgotten who he was hed already half guessed something was wrong twenty minutes before thibaults call vacharet had phoned mentioned hed just had a call from someone called victor said that he acted as liaison between you and your lawyer just struck me afterwards to check he was kosher asshole the time to check is beforehand its a bit late now when pressed vacharet claimed that he hadnt said much but duclos had sensed his defensive tone his nervousness with thibaults call duclos knew that whatever it was had been enough the police had woven the strands together the problem was vacharet probably also now knew he might panic and do something foolish at any minute duclos picked up the phone and dialled brossards number francois vacharet stared at the phone for a full minute after his call to duclos jesus he had put his foot in it though hopefully he hadnt given away to duclos just how badly his mind grappled for other possible options perhaps it hadnt been the police just some obscure clerk in thibaults office duclos wasnt aware of victor but as duclos had protested thibault knew that his home line was secure theyd spoken several times on it and for anything as sensitive as that thibault would have phoned directly no it had been the police or someone in the prosecutors office there remained little doubt once theyd uncovered the full extent of his little ruse with aurillet theyd be at his door in no time and once duclos knew vacharet shuddered he recalled one of his last conversations with duclos when hed discovered through the milieu grapevine about the hit on eynard hed protested that if hed known about the hit hed never have offered to help with aurillet what is this paedophile pimps solidarity week duclos teased duclos went on to assure how he saw vacharet in a totally different light reliable and trusted whereas eyrnard had been a rat ready to tell all at the drop of the first wad of notes very comforting but no more killings duclos had assured that there would have only been one more planned in any case and only then as a last ditch failsafe now with this little scheme in place that wont be necessary vacharet cradled his head in his hands he wished now he hadnt asked that one last question asked out of morbid curiosity who that intended person had been but duclos almost seemed to relish telling him remarked that in a way it was only fair he should know after all you recommended me to the hit man yourself all those years back eugene brossard butterfly nerves danced in vacharets stomach with the scheme fallen apart that target would no doubt be back on brossards hit list with his own name now probably alongside vacharet jumped up and hurriedly packed a briefcase he wasnt going to hang around to see who got there first the police or brossard he mumbled to his barman on the way out any calls ive gone fishing you dont know where i am ill phone you later a quick stop off at home to pick up a suitcase then he would head straight for the airport as he came to the junction with rue de la republique a police car with moudeux and a sergeant passed heading towards the panier brossard called back within forty minutes as before duclos had left a message at a bar for brossard duclos picked it up on the first ring those two names we discussed i want you to move on them now duclos said theres no time to lose which one should i aim for first asked brossard im not sure let me think for a second vacharet was probably more urgent but he wondered if there was something hed overlooked brossard had phoned him back the day after his first call already he knew the movements of both targets the next few days as ever efficient brossard chuckled at his hesitance decisions decisions not like shopping is it deciding which shirt to choose not quite the same when youre deciding on someones life memories of chapeau and jaumard the many jibes through the years hit mans revenge how often did they get the chance to rib establishment figures duclos ignored it vacharets more urgent but you should try and take out both within hours of each other if possible because once one has been hit the police will tighten everything on the other fine ill aim to do both tonight they made money transfer arrangements and brossard rang off but duclos thought he heard a faint echo on the line and then a second click as if someone else had been listening in duclos heart froze he thought that thibault had assured the line wouldnt be tapped vacharets more urgent but you should try and take out both within hours of each other if possible because once one has been hit the police will tighten everything up on the other fine ill aim to do both tonight betina had picked up the phone not long after it rang she thought that it was strange that it had only rung once then stopped wondered if there might be a fault on the line but picking it up she heard alains voice she was in the downstairs drawing room hed obviously answered it upstairs she was about to put it straight back down when part of the conversation grabbed her not quite the same when youre deciding on someones life an icy hand gripped her stomach as she listened to the rest of the conversation at its end she stood stock still numbed frozen too shocked to admit the reality of what shed just heard but the futility of grasping for other explanations also dawning her mind trapped between the two she shook her head too many years already spent fooling herself telling herself that the trips away had just been business nothing more that his rarely touching her had been in respect of her past problem her frigidity but part of her had always suspected the first thought had been that he was having an affair he wouldnt be the first politician to keep a mistress and perhaps given her past problem shed in part brought it on herself not acceptable but at least understandable betina walked towards the stairs started her way up but even that chink of realization shed in the end pushed away hid behind her love her absorption with joel the day that alain told her that he was leaving her and wanted a divorce she would worry about it then with the first newspaper reports shed pushed it even stronger away young boys alain ridiculous betina reached the top of the stairs but now she knew alain had done it he had killed the boy and now he was sending a hit man to remove the key witnesses all the past denial came suddenly crashing back in the trips away him cringing at her touch she shuddered at the thought of the monster shed lived with for eighteen years under the same roof with her and joel joel shed read the papers my god that poor boy had hardly been older than joel was now her heart pounded as she reached for the bedroom door handle her mouth was dry with a final swallow of resolve she turned it and opened the door it took a second for duclos to notice her standing there he was still wondering about the click on the line he heard her say its true isnt it all true you did kill that boy she was ashen faced and duclos saw that she was trembling it had been betina on the line shed overheard his conversation with brossard his mind spun judging from her expression the stock lines of defence and denial that had tripped of his tongue since the first newspaper reports just wouldnt wash this time if shed overheard him with brossard she knew she knew everything he looked down at the floor blinked slowly in the end said nothing his panic waned he owed her no explanation all a lie wasnt it the boy our marriage all the weekends away the nights when you shrinked at my touch she moved closer but stopped a metre away as if bridging that last distance between them would somehow contaminate her her voice was raising a pathetic sham a lie and i thought at one time that you loved me if only for those first few years she shook her head her face contorted duclos looked up at her pitiable clinging to the hope that he might have once loved her a few measly years among their lifetime together as if reconciling that might make the rest not so bad acceptable he didnt feel like giving her even that satisfaction he sneered of course i never loved you you just looked good at all the dinner parties and functions and your ridiculous problem with frigidity from a date rape was ideal the last thing i wanted was you touching me she moved closer then her eyes darted youre pathetic he taunted and felt the stinging slap strike his face a second later if hed said nothing shed have probably just stared a second longer eyes searching for an explanation that wasnt there then turned away but perversely a part of him wanted the confrontation a catharsis for his own anger and frustration take it all out on poor pathetic betina she was such an easy target my skin crawled at every single touch through the years id rather have fucked mitterrand but this time he caught her arm in midflight wrenched it hard and levered himself up he lashed at her face with the back of his free hand betina flew back crumpled quickly to the floor she glared back eyes wild raw hatred a red welt and speck of blood showed high on her left cheekbone what about joel her voice trembled it took a woman to give you him not out buggering young boys exactly duclos smiled crookedly a decade too late shed finally got the message he was the last thing i wanted the images crashed in on him unwarranted her scream as the car crashed joel in an incubator the intensity of her stare unnerved him he looked away he felt suddenly claustrophobic stifled he had to get away from her away from her clinging eyes as if she was searching deep for something that had never been there some remnant of fondness for her and joel so that she didnt have to believe that her whole life had been wasted pathetic he headed for the door some movement behind him rustling in a drawer he was in a half daze hardly paid any attention to it until he heard her call alain a harsh chill whisper that made him turn he saw the half open bedside drawer at the same time as the gun a beretta automatic they kept in case of burglars betina pointed it at him shakily betinas eyes were stinging and bleary as she looked at her husband above the gun she fought to control her trembling her husband he was a monster a murderer of young boys shed be doing everyone a favour if she pumped him full of bullets her finger tensed on the trigger would feel good so good repayment for the years of betrayal of her and joel revenge for the little boy in taragnon but she should see him squirm a bit first so do you still claim you dont love me or is begging for your life more appropriate perhaps theyre one and the same but instead of moving away he took a step closer she shook her head the trembling biting deeper in her arms it was all somehow wrong shed seen it in the films this was when they started backing away holding one hand up and pleading duclos smiled as he stepped closer perhaps she would be doing him a favour the end to all his problems why dont you im sick of it all you can face it all then public humiliation the police at your door a trial a murder conviction hanging over your head yes go on he taunted pull the trigger you sit in my seat betinas finger trembled on the trigger a monster he deserved to die but he was smiling almost as if he welcomed it and what would happen to joel while she was in prison duclos saw the hesitation and leapt in took the last two steps quickly jolted her gun arm away the gun flew free fell a few yards to one side he cocked back his arm and smashed it hard into her face betina fell back heavily on the floor her eyes were startled a gout of blood spreading from her nose duclos dived on top of her straddling her thighs anger coursed red hot through his veins shed pulled a gun the stupid bitch actually had the guts the audacity she was going to kill me he cocked his arm to punch her again in the face then decided against it at the last minute shifted down and hit her in the stomach she screamed and groaned he hit her again her screams only driving on his frenzy the long years of pent up anger and frustration washing away as he struck out for all the times hed cringed at her touch for the boring predictability and monotony of her conversation for the son hed never wanted for the little clique of her and joel excluding him through the years he hit and hit at her stomach until footsteps pounding up the stairs barely broke through his consciousness his frenzy then it struck him how loud betinas groans and screams had been the gendarme hed heard the screams and run around to the open back door duclos scanned frantically around the gun was not far from his fight foot he kicked it further away just out of sight under the bed he straightened up as the gendarme burst into the room the gendarmes eyes darted between him and betina his hand was poised by his gun holster but it wasnt drawn she became hysterical duclos spluttered i was trying to calm her she fell and hit herself badly on the bedside drawer give me a hand to lift her up on the bed the gendarmes gun arm relaxed he came over half stooped to lift betina betinas eyes were clearing from her daze settling on the gendarme she was about to speak duclos saw his only splitsecond chance lunged for the gun under the bed he turned and trained it on the gendarme now give me your gun left hand ever so slowly just two fingers on the butt the gendarme reached across and lifted the gun out awkwardly held it out duclos grabbed it now turn around the gendarme turned uneasily trying to keep one eye on duclos duclos raised the gun and smashed the butt against the base of the gendarmes head but the first didnt connect properly and it took a second to fell him knock him out duclos rustled in the top drawer of the dressing table for car keys and his wallet then bolted for the door joel was standing in the doorway taking in the scene with his mother and the gendarme those same searching knowing eyes which had haunted him through the years the boy moved as if to block duclos exit duclos sneered at how ridiculous and pathetic the boy looked just like his mother and barged brusquely past him almost knocking the boy over down the stairs out the front door feet on the gravel of the driveway one of the reporters by the gate noticed him was looking over curiously duclos ran to the garage past betinas renault parked to the side he would have taken the mercedes but it was too distinctive hed bought a peugeot on leasing not long before leaving strasbourg the registration was probably still going through perfect duclos jumped in started her up and swung around he was shaking heavily raw adrenalin surging a dull pounding in his head afterrush of betina and the gendarme he felt it powering him on foot hard on the accelerator out the driveway a last sharp turn through the gate cameras clicked and flashed as he sped past the gate onto the road catching his crooked and desperate smile but duclos was past caring freedom fortythree dominic spread out a map of france where where two of them now to find vacharet and duclos no registration two gendarmes taking it in turns to guard duclos the past weeks and neither had taken duclos car numbers the garage door was always closed our station commander never asked us to the only number we know is the car they used regularly when going out the renault dominic shook his head hed put out a registration search through lepoille and interpol national over an hour ago no answer yet duclos could be halfway to paris by now or to the swiss border or heading due south one of those sleepy pyrenees border posts with spain where guards just wave people through without a registration number they couldnt conduct a national search or a border alert and vacharet had been on the run almost two hours longer no trace yet either on where he was headed two hits planned betina duclos said shed overheard vacharet was mentioned as one explaining his sudden flight but the other hadnt been named theyd put additional pressure on the only other person in hand aurillet two hits what did he know aurillet said that vacharet had voiced concern following the eynard hit and about another planned but no name it was more in the vein of at least some good coming out of their plan now at least that hit wont be made one life saved but vacharet obviously knew it could be another child pimp like vacharet or eynard but what if duclos had sent a hit man after roudele to bury the coin evidence or to england after eyran capel dominic clenched a fist tight twenty minutes passed with no return calls and his impatience grew he could have phoned his lyon station but he had no wish to hear the days panics and emergencies only one thing now that he wanted to know he called monique to ease his tension she was at vidauban spent more time there now in the summer months shed travelled down by train the night before gerome had picked her up at the station ill be quite late tonight he said could be a long one will you go back to lyon or come here probably vidauban he was better off staying in aix or marseille for news on vacharet vidauban was closer but dont expect me much before ten or eleven she started some small talk about gerome but he was only half listening and cut her off early anxious in case calls were trying to get through unsettling silence again the phone inert dominics thoughts fighting to move but in the end equally inert the clock on the wall provided an ominous pulsing reminder that things elsewhere were in motion while he sat there duclos racing across the country a hit man heading for his targets ghosts skittering across a map with no discernible form or direction but how far could duclos get no passport assets frozen money perhaps just for food petrol and a few nights pension seven minutes before the phone rang again though it seemed far longer it was lepoille weve found something on vacharet air france flight to corsica can we get the ajaccio airport police to stop him too late he landed over twenty minutes ago hes in a taxi and away could be anywhere on the island momentary hope fading perhaps bennacer could dig something up from the lead anything yet on duclos and car registration nothing yet could be a long haul theres nothing in his name and apparently he got the car recently on leasing through a company weve got to find the company and hope that the registrations already through otherwise well find nothing a quick good luck and keep hunting and dominic phoned bennacer vacharets in corsica anything spring to mind not immediately let me see if anyone else here has any ideas dominic could hear bennacer calling out vacharet any friends or contacts in corsica mumble of background voices after a moment doesnt seem so im afraid maybe moudeux could go to vacharets say that we know hes in corsica explain that a hit mans chasing him if weve got the information of where he is then its a good bet so has the hit man perhaps with a bit of pressure on his barman or manager then bennacer cut in wait a minute dominic one of my people working the panier has remembered another club owner that vacharets friendly with bennacers voice faded second conversation in the background before returning guy called courchon owns a villa in bussaglia on the northwest coast long shot but it might be worth a try dominic thought things through quickly he was in a temporary office in the aix palais de justice that corbeix had arranged for him but flight connections were better from marseille im coming down to you i should be with you in half an hour meanwhile get the bussaglia police to head out to courchons villa and check the next flight time to ajaccio dominic glanced at his watch pm he gave bennacer his mobile number for anything urgent coming up on duclos en route then left a similar message for lepoille nothing dominic could do sitting where he was to aid the search for duclos registration that was a game now being batted between the nations network of computers duclos headed east towards st etienne and givors he was unsure at first where to go in the end deciding to join the n near givors it was the busiest and most faceless of frances motorways and from there he could head north to paris south for the cote dazur and spain or east at valence for switzerland and italy hed been left one current account unfrozen for monthly expenses he stopped at the first cash machine outside of limoges and drew the days maximum together with what he had in his wallet francs with food and petrol enough to keep him going for five days or maybe a week if he stayed in cheap hotels he knew he couldnt risk stopping again at a cash machine even if they hadnt by then frozen the account his movements could be tracked his car was inconspicuous and didnt draw attention just one of countless thousands of blue peugeot s nationwide and the police probably hadnt been able to trace the registration but he felt conspicuous selfconscious himself was desperately afraid people would recognize him hed stopped only once for petrol just after st etienne and kept looking down as he went to pay at the counter at the last moment he saw a baseball cap for sale to one side and grabbed it along with some sweets the caps peak would at least shield part of his face at future stops he hit the motorway again and at the givors junction headed south speed steady between kmph not too fast to draw attention but not too slow either still the occasional truck would push him over to the slow lane and rumble past then it hit him pm he glanced at his watch pm at six the main news bulletins would come on the case had been in the press but the only recent photo had been hazy and distorted through a car window few people would recognize him but for the main news that night theyd probably have a full face portrait shot from then on hed hardly be able to stop anywhere without being recognized hed planned originally to stop to eat later but suddenly changed his plan he pulled into the first motorway service station he chose a burger and fries at the selfservice grill counter the girl looked up at him and smiled merci a baseball cap not too dissimilar to his own a have a nice day smile or had there been a glimmer of recognition duclos nerves were racing by the time he paid and took his tray over to a table by the far wall he took a seat facing the wall his back to the restaurant it was a large sprawling complex with supermarket shops and a bar on a bridge structure spanning the motorway a television was on in the bar area beyond the restaurant but hardly anyone was at the bar counter paying it attention he let out a slow breath tried to relax eat his burger it felt dry difficult to swallow his nerves had killed his appetite but he forced himself realizing that it might be his last meal for several hours he laboured over each mouthful it was like trying to chew and swallow cardboard hed made the decision to head south just after clermont ferrand he had to get to provence before brossard made the hits if brossard made the hits he was sunk betina had overheard him order them minutes after the thought hit hed stopped and phoned brossards number fifteen minutes later when hed stopped for petrol hed phoned again still no brossard or message brossard was probably already heading towards the targets ill aim to do both tonight obviously brossard didnt want to risk the hits in daylight duclos looked at his watch two and a half hours of daylight left if brossard wasnt contactable would he make it down there by then if he could get there in time and they never happened he could claim it had been betinas neurotic ramblings faced with just the rest the tenuous coin and psychic evidence and the questionable testimony of two child pimps thibault could still pull a few rabbits out of the hat perhaps brossard could make a deal with vacharet his life for silence faced with just aurillet their chances in court were good options angles play counterplay duclos thoughts bounced between hope and desperation skittering along a tightrope of possibilities as a bleepbleep crashed in abruptly two kids had started playing on a nearby space wars machine duclos was nervous with them so close but they paid him little attention bleepbleep zap crash bleepbleep it was more the noise that grated bringing his already fevered nerves to boiling pitch his hands were shaking uncontrollably hed eaten two thirds of the burger and a third of the fries he put the burger down suddenly he couldnt stomach another bite he remembered another restaurant from thirty years ago staring out at the boot of his car wondering what to do with the boy inside and suddenly everything else around came crashing in the space wars machine the clatter of plates and cutlery the noise and bustle the news report coming up on the tv people standing up and pointing shouting its duclos duclos hes there over there the child murderer duclos stood up abruptly turned away he was dizzy disorientated for a moment wasnt sure what he should be doing next he felt like screaming help help out loud above the bleepbleep of the space machine and the general clatter and commotion he was shaking chill sweat and goose bumps on his skin he started making his way out hurriedly away from the noise the people then stopped abruptly by the prepared food display he knew that he couldnt go through this ordeal again of sitting in a cafe with people around he grabbed five packs of wrapped sandwiches three bags of crisps and a large bottled water and dumped them on the check out wry smile from the girl at the mountain of food as she totted it up large family in the car he smiled back but he was sure it came out wrong he could feel her eyes still on him as he moved away he looked at his watch pm in a few minutes the news item would come up and then everyone would be staring a moments recognition and the girl would reach for the phone start dialling the police help help it was then that he remembered marchands words if you should feel the need for additional help just call its just so that you know that if the worst comes to the worst you have friends out there people who will help you but he knew that he couldnt risk making the call to switzerland from there risk the news item coming up and someone grabbing his shoulder while he was still on the phone and still he had to hope that he could make it down to provence in time to stop brossard the view along the bussaglia coastline was breathtaking rugged and undulating mountains a rich green shroud of mediterranean pines clinging to sheer rock against the azure sea but francois vacharet hardly looked at the view from the villas front terrace his eyes were pinned to the short snakelike stretch of road far below the only warning of a car approaching the road led to only nine villas courchon had already told him all the regular cars to expect hed written them down on a piece of paper any cars sighted not on the list and he would race in and warn courchon then head across the road twenty metres along steps meandered down the cliffside to a small shingle beach and a boat house cut in under the rock courchon would greet whoever it was then come down and tell vacharet when they had gone vacharet had mentioned his concern about the other hit to courchon duclos was out of control partly unhinged courchon hissed in breath sharply when he heard who the target was jesus could be trouble duclos doesnt have to live in marseille you do courchon went on to explain the problem wasnt just with the police but with the local milieu vacharets heart sank as he envisioned years on the run of him having to sell his clubs and property without returning to marseille if he lived that long for now his main worry was surviving the next few days being stalked by the hit man hed originally introduced he might have found the irony amusing if he wasnt so desperately frightened brossard was an unstoppable killing machine as far as he knew had never missed a contract he jumped at practically every noise or car sighting on the road below only three had so far approached all local villa owners but what was he going to do as it became dark sit out there all night even if he did the road was unlit there would be no warning except noise indiscernible from any of the other owners cars but seeing his concern at least courchon had offered one ray of hope ive got some good contacts in the milieu i can certainly clear your name on that front of any repercussions theyll be pleased too of the warning great so brossard might still get to him but at least hed die with a clean bill of health as far as the milieu were concerned comforting vacharets nerves tensed a white car was snaking its way along the road below he trained the binoculars citroen bs there was only one on the list metallic grey vacharet darted inside to warn courchon where is he now heading down towards provence said marchand apparently hes hoping to meet up with someone there urgently marchand hadnt asked why nor did duclos offer any explanation duclos call had come only minutes after marchand had seen him on the geneva news fifth item on though he was sure it was the top story in france minister on the run marchand had spent the last few minutes explaining the sorry mess at the other end miguel perello was thoughtful theyd only met once before in panama perello ran the panama associate office of a californiabased law firm that was what had made marchand suspect it was a consortium of california biotech companies trying to throw the eu debate though it could equally be the japanese using a california linked company as a smokescreen all marchand knew was that they were happy when the finger was pointed at the greens industry protectionism at its best knock an billion hole in a rival market by swinging a crucial debate sounds messy perello said duclos could be too much of a loose cannon now too dangerous i thought that was the whole idea of offering him help if things went wrong get him away from the whole mess yes of course moments silence crackling on the line between panama and geneva but how long can we effectively ensure a safe haven for a prominent figure such as duclos it might be worth considering again the other option we discussed marchand went cold the subject had come up at the same time theyd discussed offering duclos help to get away marchand had voiced his protest strongly duclos suddenly killed in the midst of such a high profile investigation however well disguised as an accident could rebound badly too risky he reiterated the protest now i know but now look at others like medecin perello commented every so often he makes the threat of coming back to france and telling all bringing everyone else down with him if his hand is forced im not sure my people would be happy with that sort of threat hanging over them indefinitely i still dont like it but the protest now sounded lame perello sensed marchands discomfort with the thought of duclos being hit swiss lawyers watches chocolate and money no blood he shifted its portent to one side its certainly not a decision that would be taken lightly or right at this moment and whatevers finally decided it should in any case appear that we wish to help duclos escape so let us keep our eye on that for now marchand was once again a willing participant they discussed a few options before deciding private aircraft to portugal scheduled airline under new identity from there perello confirmed fund lines and they divided duties for the final arrangements when duclos phoned forty minutes later as arranged from somewhere near avignon marchand gave him an airfield name and time luc et du cannet pm the pickup will be quick three minutes at most youll know its him because he wont show lights the last few hundred metres of descent moudeux tried to shield his mobile from the echoing bustle of the airport and the intermittent tannoy i see yeah yeah so no show on vacharet yeah one moment he turned to dominic sensed his eagerness to be brought up to date the local police called courchon met them at the door said he hadnt seen anything of vacharet they searched the villa anyway asked a few questions such as was courchon aware of any other friends vacharet had on the island but blanks at every turn they left bennacers asking what you want the local police to do next if anything dominic nodded and held out his hand moudeux passed him the phone did the police believe him or do they think he was covering up they thought he acted a bit cagey but nothing too suspicious dominic glanced up at the flicker board fourteen minutes left to boarding no duclos no vacharet deafening tannoy bombarding what few clear thoughts remained hustle bustle everyone heading somewhere except them yet another dead end dominics eyes darted searching for inspiration but all that crashed in was people noise suitcases cameras flight bags finally get the local police to head back out to courchons and park fifty metres down the road sit there a couple of hours then knock again on courchons door vacharet might yet show or at least it might rattle courchon into remembering something but it was mainly because it felt wrong just giving up on vacharet and dominic couldnt think of a better plan okay ill phone them back are you catching the flight still i dont know yet theres still a few minutes to decide though dominic knew the answer already theyd headed to the airport because if positive news on vacharet came through no time was left to catch the next flight but corsica without vacharet had little appeal too remote if cameras the thought suddenly spun back dominics eyes fixed on another passing tourist with a pentax slung over one shoulder he was only half listening as bennacer signed off yes fine he mumbled thoughts clearing focusing his breath caught slightly in his throat as they finally gelled fresh adrenalin rush after the disappointment of vacharet fresh hope he tapped out straightaway to lepoilles number lepoille had phoned while he was en route between aix and marseille company traced that duclos had leased under two years ago but nothing registered since he would keep looking still nothing lepoille confirmed he sounded resigned defeated i just dont think its been registered yet dont worry i think i might have hit on a solution cameras silence from lepoille dominic explained apparently duclos home has been dogged by the press the last few weeks when he made his break no doubt a few will have tried to get a clear shot of him one of them might at the same time have caught his registration number quick enlargement and weve got it lepoille agreed chances were reasonable to good ill get on it straightaway five main national papers it shouldnt take long to find out who was outside duclos gate that afternoon milieu crime boss andre girouves listened carefully as his lieutenant related the message from courchon in corsica and this other club owner his friend vacharet is the one involved with duclos and brossard girouves clarified yes vacharet apparently recommended duclos to brossard for something else years ago girouves pondered everything was clear so far duclos had involved vacharet in a scheme which had backfired and now duclos was using brossard to bury the traces standard practice even high flying politicians werent too different to himself he mused hed seen the duclos items on the news politician fallen from grace loved it they were in one of girouves favourite cafes on quai de la tourette to one side was his main business adviser to the other a lumbering lieutenant serving as bodyguard business talks over late afternoon coffee and pastis but its the other hit planned which was the main reason for courchons call his lieutenant said he shuffled nervously looked down slightly as he told girouves who it was girouves eyes closed for a moment he rubbed his forehead with one hand courchon was right to have warned them a chief inspectors wife the repercussions could be enormous part of the strength of the crime empire girouves had built up along the coast the past two decades had been stability a departure from the muddied dividing lines and powervacuum struggles of the seventies and part of that stability had been gained through not crossing certain lines with the police no more bar du telephon massacres even amongst their own was the strict rule of never involving family in hits a chief inspectors wife hit by a regular milieu freelancer favours would be cancelled clubs and bars raided licences revoked all suspected milieu businesses would come under brutal scrutiny the clock could be set back years brossard if it had been practically anyone else he could have just picked up the phone and said dont go ahead but brossard prided himself on fierce independence wouldnt swear allegiance to either side no gang war hits only internal enforcement or external contracts brossard worked all sides with equal ease a true independent professional girouves asked a few questions about the hit but his lieutenant knew little beyond what hed already passed on okay phone courchon straight back try and pump him for more information girouves took a quick slug of pastis as his lieutenant dialled out on his mobile if they didnt learn more from courchon hed have to get a few men busy phoning around monique fornier shouldnt be too hard to find out where she was then he would probably have to call tomi the only person he knew that would stand any chance against brossard in a world full of people theres only some want to fly because theyre not crazy theyre not crazy crazy ohooho now were never gonna survive unlesss brossard rapped his hands on the steering wheel to the pounding beat he particularly liked the organ backbeat the way it seemed to slip away his finger tensing on the trigger shadows of figures falling back as he fired slipping away but he could never picture any of their faces probably best no ghosts dented and rusty citroen dianne which had seen better days nobody would pay him any attention hed chosen a blue workmans overall which was worn and slightly stained from field work hed used it for a hit six years ago though this time he chose a white cap instead of a beret turning the peak so that it covered the back of his neck favoured uniform of so many fieldworkers he planned to stay low in the fields but if by chance somebody saw him he would blend in brossard pulled the dianne into a track in the woodland that bordered the back of the field to anyone passing a farmer or someone having a woodland picnic he turned off the cassette player took a knapsack out of the car and headed deeper into the woods instead of sandwiches inside the knapsack was a llama magnum with silencer binoculars and infra red night goggles after eighty metres the woods cleared and the field lay ahead to one side were a few olive and carob trees but most of the field was long grass now starting to yellow with the summer heat at the end of the field two hundred metres away was a short stone wall and beyond that the farmhouse brossard walked ten paces into the long grass and sat down with his knapsack as soon as it was dark he would move in the sun was already low threatening to fall behind the westerly ridge beyond the farmhouse it would be dark soon vacharet watched the gentle surf lapping against the beach half pebble half sand it was no more than fifteen metres wide nestled under the sheer rock face above vacharet sat inside the boat shelter at the back of the beach cut in under a heavy rock overhang he was completely concealed from the road above lap swish lap swish soothing at first now after more than half an hour the sound was driving him mad what could have happened with courchon fifteen minutes after courchon had first come down to give him the all clear the same police car was snaking its way back up the road again what was courchon doing letting them camp the night or perhaps theyd taken him down to the station for questioning vacharet sighed heavily the first grey and red wisps of sunset were showing on the horizon he could end up on the beach half the night without knowing what had happened he pictured the police pacing around firing question after question at courchon at the villa or down at the station it was immaterial the police were obviously determined and in the end would catch up with him courchon might have cleared the slate with the milieu but with the police it would be a different matter he would have to stay away for months longer if the realization suddenly hit him like a hammer at first hed clung to the hope that brossard would head first for monique fornier that might at least give him a bit more breathing space but now it hit him that he could be implicated hed recommended duclos to brossard being involved with the ruse with aurillet was one thing but conspiring to murder a chief inspectors wife they would throw away the key perhaps if he helped them warned them in some way but what if brossard had already made the hit and his call merely confirmed his knowledge of it his involvement vacharet came out from his hideaway below the rocks and looked thoughtfully at the steps winding up to the road above what time was he there lepoille asked got there about ten in the morning normally the time they might show to do some shopping if theyre going to come out at all which has been rare third on lepoilles list gaston contarge pictures editor at le figaro hed already crossed out le monde and le matin so he was there when duclos made his break yep got the whole thing itll be front page of tomorrows edition a tingle of anticipation ran down lepoilles spine he told contarge what he wanted and why contarge was quick to mirror lepoilles excitement breathless slightly hoarse amazing look ill check with the editor but im sure well help the only thing he might ask is an exclusive for our part in all this any objections no not as far as i can see ive got three more newspapers on my list whoever comes up with the photo first gets the story seems fair enough lepoille smiled as he hung up he knew that contarge would be sprinting for the darkroom he phoned dominic straightaway with the news three more to phone but at least weve got one hopeful already dominic was on the motorway just approaching gardanne fifteen minutes out from marseille hed stayed at the airport bar with moudeux for a coffee and brandy while waiting on news then decided to head back to vidauban with duclos and vacharet by now anywhere in france it was as good a command centre as any thats great news let me know the minute anything comes up im heading back to vidauban but you can ring at any time ill be up till late waiting on news eight minutes later when his mobile rang again he thought it might be lepoille with an update but it was bennacer his voice was urgent frantic dominic we just had a call seconds ago from corsica we now know the hit mans second target and brace yourself dominic its monique your wife monique shes the other target numbness then blind fear rage when dominic asked tremulously vacharet didnt know any time it could have even happened already look ill mobilize the nearest station straightaway get someone out there but dominic was hardly listening a quick mumbled fine a pounding in his head drowning out all else as he pushed his foot flat to the floor kmph as he flashed past cars and trucks at breackneck speed he dialled out his home number at vidauban but it was engaged bennacer looked briefly at a wall map and phoned the station house at draguignan it was on an answerphone he slammed the phone down and dialled toulon girls voice un moment ne quittez pas then a radio operator checking positions as bennacer explained what he needed and stressed the urgency the nearest car we have is just outside cuers theyre engaged now but should be free in five or ten minutes otherwise well have to pull someone up from the motorway section this side of sollies pont how many men in the sollies pont car two two rookies up against an expert hit man send both cars dispatch them now and warn them they could be up against some heavy firepower bennacer glanced back at the map in fifteen twenty minutes they should be there dominics speed held steady at just under kmph with any luck he should be there in just under fifteen minutes his lights had been on for the last ten minutes and now he flashed wildly at anyone in his way the last greyred remnants of twilight faded over the hills in his rear view mirror beyond the beam of his headlights was pitch darkness fortyfour as the grey skyline turned to black brossard moved in closer fifty metres from the short stone wall he could see the farmhouse clearly one light on downstairs he trained the binoculars and after a moment saw a woman come into their frame brief profile lateforties first wisps of salt in black hair attractive she moved out of sight again for a second going deeper into the drawing room brossards anticipation surged but only a trace of what he felt when going up against experienced guns a woman alone in a remote farmhouse a cakewalk hed put on the infrared goggles switch off or cut the mains electricity from the garage and break in through a downstairs window the woman would still be fumbling for candles and nightlights when the bullet hit one head shot maybe two and out it would all be over in seconds brossard kept low as he moved through the last fifty metres of grass towards the stone wall then he stopped again studying the farmhouse closer and trying to work out the likely position of rooms he quickly checked his gun and silencer then took out the nighttime goggles and put them on waiting a moment for his eyes to adjust to their greygreen light he slid over the wall and started the last distance towards the farmhouse what time would you hope to get here monique was speaking to yves her eldest son hed phoned to tell her he would be coming up from marseille for the weekend she hadnt heard from him for almost two months so theyd spent a few minutes catching up on news before returning to when he would be arriving im on a late shift at the station tomorrow night finishing at ten ill leave straight after that so probably close to eleven but ive got saturday and sunday free thats good gerome will be here hes not going anywhere this weekend as far as i know itll be nice to have a house full already she was thinking of food and preparation steamed cap roig with couscous pate en croute to start a few bottles of wine on the terrace it was going to be a good weekend gerome should be back soon you might get a chance to speak to him its okay ive got to go now but ill see him tomorrow anyway ill try and make sure your father relaxes a bit as well at least one full day without calls see you tomorrow monique looked thoughtfully at the phone as she put it down family new family old family with the tapes shed played repeatedly shed found herself thinking more about christian and jeanluc memories that had plagued her the first few years sapped her strength before shed pushed them harshly away selfpreservation for the sake of both her sanity and her new marriage she couldnt give all to her new family while burdened by ghosts from the past the only vestige dominic had complained about at times pointedly had been her obsessive protectiveness with yves and gerome the ghosts of the past might have been buried but a shadow had remained she could never face losing another child going through what shed suffered with christian again but the tapes and transcripts had brought it all back with each playing images of christian and jeanluc had grown stronger shed resisted going out to the wheat field the day dominic had met eyran and stuart capel shed always vowed shed never go there the memories were too harsh but knowing the three of them had stood in the empty filed searching for long lost answers had raised her curiosity about taragnon perhaps the farm would be different the memories there happy as well as sad alone at vidauban that afternoon looking out across the farm fields at the back shed finally made the decision shed taken the old simca left permanently at the farm for transporting garden pots and plants and driven out to taragnon though it was only thirtyfive kilometres away she hadnt been back to the area for over twentyfive years after theyd finally sold the old farm she parked in the road outside the old farm and looked up apart from some modernization with new windows and doors it had changed little the outside stonework was much the same as she looked a small boy of no more than four or five came out of the back door and started peddling a toy car around the courtyard and in that moment as she closed her eyes she pictured christian in the courtyard at little more than that age laughing and playing his gentle highpitched voice echoing slightly from the walls and jeanluc coming in from the fields picking christian up on his shoulders and swinging him around playfully smiling the proud father tears streamed unashamedly down her face as she drove back to vidauban shed cried bitter tears for both of them for so many years but not recently and then not long after returning at six oclock the news item had come on about duclos shed found herself honing in on the face flashed up on the screen as if drawn by a magnet a face suddenly put to this new suspect dominic had talked about almost incessantly the past weeks christians real murderer a rounded slightly bloated face with thinning black hair and dark green almost black eyes thirty years she tried to imagine in that moment what he looked like then when hed murdered christian but it was the one leap back through the years her mind wasnt able to make as it grew dark she took out a nightlight and lit it in the small alcove by the telephone at the back of the drawing room in the first glow of its light shed seen christians face clearly the memories of those last nights of hospital vigil flooding back she could almost feel his presence as if he was partly with her now guiding her actions willing her to light the nightlight she hadnt prayed for christian and jeanluc for years but she would that night she felt that by purposely casting them from her thoughts shed also in a way abandoned them it was time to make some amends now putting down the phone from yves she looked thoughtfully towards the light she remembered the night that yves was born the joy shed felt the doctors had told her later shed been lucky to live at least shed been given a second chance at happiness some people didnt get even that with a last slow sigh she knelt down before the light gently closed her eyes and started to pray for christians and jeanlucs souls for the many memories for the happiness that once was for the final justice that might now be so close suddenly the lights went out the quietly murmured prayers caught at the back of her throat her eyes flickered open a sound outside the house faint rustling or was she imagining it she listened harder but could hear nothing more only stillness silence pitch darkness beyond the weak glow of the nightlight she wondered what had happened with the electricity sometimes there were power cuts when there was a storm but the weather had been fine she straightened up deciding to take the nightlight with her to investigate but barely two paces away the phone rang startling her she turned to pick it up dull greygreen light it took a second for each shape to become clear brossard moved stealthily away from the garage after switching off the mains hed already worked out the geography of the house drawing room with an office leading off centre hallway then a kitchen and dining room the far end bedrooms upstairs the woman was in the drawing room but he didnt want to enter from that side possibly alarm her while he fumbled to break in he would go in at the far end the kitchen window was too small so he chose the dining room looking through he could see that the connecting door to the hallway was closed sound wouldnt travel easily he took the glass cutter and sucker from his knapsack cut a neat hole reached in and turned the window latch he was in within twenty seconds eyes adjusting orientating objects became clear quickly but it took a second longer to judge distance long table six chairs cabinet side table archway through to the kitchen he focused on the door ahead the door to the hallway and the drawing room beyond only the sound of his own breathing as he moved sudden noise alarming deafeningly loud among the silence and darkness phone ringing beyond the hall in the drawing room where the woman was brossard judged it stopped it had been picked up good she would be talking he could move into the hallway without worry and he made the last distance swiftly turned the handle and went through and waited again crouching listening but as he fought to pick out her voice and movements beyond the door another sound came without warning drowning it out a car swinging into the courtyard its lights flashing briefly across a small window by the front door brossards nerves tensed an anticipatory thrill rose up from his spine and bunched the muscles at the back of his neck his jaw set tight every nerve end suddenly alive tingling this was more like it two targets and only seconds to decide which to drop first the womans voice beyond the door was staccato alarmed you mean now this minute car door shutting footsteps approaching key in the door but thats probably gerome now i could go straight off with as the door swung open and the figure took a step forward brossard took his first clear shot towards the centre of its chest and saw the figure fall brossard jumped up quickly from his crouch no time to lose the woman would have been alerted by the noise and burst into the drawing room quick flash image the woman the phone receiver held out slightly in defence her panicked expression a nightlight beyond searing his eyes slightly five seconds more and he would be finished and away monique youre in grave danger get out of the house now dominic flashed furiously as a car stayed obstinately in the fast lane hed phoned at two minute intervals and on the third try had finally got through the pentup frustration and fear came through in his voice whats happening dominic whats going on no questions monique just go you mean now this minute yes now dominic screamed get out quickly and run to the nearest neighbours house sound in the background car engine wheels turning but thats probably gerome now i could go straight off with him whatever monique but just go get away from there as soon as another sound then a dull thud and something dropping as if gerome had dropped a heavy kit bag in the hallway a sharp intake of breath from monique then a shriek as dominic heard movement in the background the door bursting open monique get out of there get out dominics voice was shrill his throat almost bursting as he screamed into his mobile the sound of scuffling and light banging as if the receiver had been dropped for a second at the other end then a mans voice deeper not geromes its too late and in that moment with searing pain and lights bursting through his head in rhythm with his now almost constant flashing of the road ahead the hollow nauseating reality hit dominic that the voice was right he was too late to save moniques life he knew it even before he heard the gunshot and the sickening thud of the body hitting the floor then the line went dead duclos was in a panic hed gone down to vidauban with half an hour of daylight to spare and had spent the time since scouting vainly for brossard hed looked first half a mile in each direction along the road leading to the farmhouse nothing suspicious out of place then hed decided to park a few hundred metres along the road leading to the motorway junction the most likely direction that brossard would approach after a few minutes he realized that a bend in the road obscured the entrance to the farmhouse and became concerned just in case brossard approached from the other direction he moved closer to within a hundred metres of the entrance the closest he dare park and waited the hit had seemed a good idea originally without monique fornier there was no case she was the only one who could vouch that the boy had left that day with the coin in his pocket or that the tapes and transcripts bore any relevance to the life of her son without the coin or the tapes and transcripts the case collapsed but now he just felt foolish standing on a remote provence lane hoping to stop the hit hed ordered in the first place he didnt even know which car brossard would be driving though of the three cars which had so far passed hed been able to catch a fleeting glimpse of their drivers no brossard yet with the last dusk light fading he realized that even that would be difficult another car approached and he was hardly able to discern anything beyond the glare of its headlamps until it was almost past him he shuffled anxiously was this how he wanted to spend his last hour in france he knew that all of this was only because one day he might want to return he might be happy sitting in south america for a while but forever times changed the trial would slip from prominence corbeix would retire a new prosecutor might not be so keen might see through the evidence for the tenuous nonsense that it was faced with no more than a weak exploratory case against him he might be tempted to return but if monique fornier was killed he would never be able to come back another set of headlamps glimpse of a young man in profile as the car passed the car slowed it was turning into the farmhouse probably forniers son or a family friend duclos thought with him there would brossard still make the hit perhaps brossard would delay till the next night and he could then reach brossard tomorrow from portugal tell him not to go ahead listening to his own wheedling pathetically hopeful inner voice it suddenly hit him apart from his own neck what did it matter what did he care if brossard dynamited the whole farmhouse with them all inside damn fornier damn the lot of them theyd brought him to this standing on a lonely backwater lane in the dead of night tired and afraid his nerves frazzled his career and life in ruins running for his life from half the nations police to catch a flight in just over an hour and now he was almost as worried about saving their necks as his own his anger brought back his earlier pounding tension his hands were shaking and he rested back against the peugeot bonnet to try and brace steady them but after a few more minutes with no cars passing standing alone in the darkness with only some crickets breaking the silence he couldnt bare it any longer he slammed one hand on his bonnet no no more hed waited long enough as far as he was concerned brossard could a set of headlamps appeared suddenly startling him with the speed of their approach and for a second he was caught in their glare quick flash glimpse as the car sped past but enough it was fornier duclos jumped in the peugeot and started her up his heart was pounding hard fornier had probably seen him a moment for the realization to hit fornier and then the car would do a uturn and head out after him duclos bit hard at his lip what a fool hed been to come down here he swung the peugeot out quickly and put his foot down hard he kept his eyes glued to the rearview mirror as he sped away fearful that at any second forniers headlamps would reappear at the farmhouse entrance and turn out six minutes all that it had taken from the phone going dead for dominic to reach the farmhouse he screeched to a halt leapt out almost before hed stopped taking his gun out in the few quick paces to the front door it was slightly ajar he pushed it but there was a weight the other side keeping it from opening his nerves jumped thinking for a moment that the hit man was still there pushing from the other side before his eyes adjusted to the dark and made out the ghostly white face on the floor gerome he recoiled back in horror he couldnt risk forcing the door moving the body in case gerome was still alive he ran around the house saw the dining room window open and scrambled in dominic realized he was probably following in the path the hit man had taken alive hed accepted in the last few minutes of frantic driving fragments of hope and desperation fighting against hollow bewilderment that monique was probably already dead but gerome as well he felt as if his stomach had been scooped out by a cold claw salt tears stung his eyes his vision suddenly blurred but fear overrode his hands trembling as he held his gun out double beat pulse skittering across his cold dark sea of bewilderment six minutes a lifetime for a professional hit man but still he might be lurking in the shadows waiting dominic part of the contract along with monique dominic moved stealthily cautiously alert to the slightest movement across the dining room through the half open door into the hallway eyes adjusting taking in the crumpled figure of gerome at its end he bit hard at his lip please god dont let him be dead but he knew it was little more than a wishful desperate prayer most professionals finished off with head shots to the side the door to the dining room was open dominic kept very still consciously holding his breath listening for sounds from the room nothing he eased up turned into the room quickly gun held straight out his eyes fell on moniques sprawled figure immediately to the right by the telephone then with sudden panic as shapes became clearer in the darkness he realized that it was two figures and one of them was rising the hit man was still alive hed used moniques body as a shield dominic aimed square at the figure started to squeeze off the shot dominic the voice and the shape hit him at the same time monique he lowered the gun rushed towards her he hugged her tight kissing her cheek repeatedly youre all right youre all right breathless tone disbelieving the tension washing away from him he felt dampness stickiness on her cheek as he kissed her and touched with one hand youre bleeding youve been hit no no i dont think so she reached up to her face still partly dazed i think its his blood it happened so so quickly while you were on the phone he grabbed me said something into the phone monique fought for breath words gasped on staccato exhalations as the thoughts hit her then the shot us both falling back then i dont remember anything until i heard you moving in the hallway she shook her head looked back at the body behind her dominic would have checked the mans pulse but he could see bone fragments among the dark patch spreading out from the head half the skull had been blown away did you see anyone else come in the room no no i didnt i monique touched her head thoughtfully she could feel a bruise a dull ache to one side i must have have hit my head or fainted i thought i heard geromes car but it was all confusing everything happening so i then the dam of her emotions finally broke she burst into tears heavy racking sobs as she clutched back tight against dominic its so good to see you so good dominic felt her body quaking against him who had fired the bullet to save her where had it come from though no time to find out now no time gerome but it felt wrong to just push her brusquely away or was it more that he was dreading breaking the news destroying her while she was still in shock from her own ordeal telling her the one thing he knew shed feared most through all the years it felt like a lifetime but in the end was only seconds before he muttered its gerome he felt her pull back her eyes were darting searching and even in the darkness he could see that she had read the panic and apprehension in his own eyes he gripped moniques shoulders briefly a gesture that said please be strong and darted into the hallway with monique following tomi straightened up from crouching in the field detached the telescopic sights and slid the rifle back into its long case everything had come through late at the last minute the location his instructions it had been a mad rush up from marseille with very little daylight left in which to scout the area hed almost missed what he believed was brossards dianne parked deep in a woodland track realizing with a shock that brossard might have been there for some time it might already be over it was fully dark as tomi ran across the farm field and positioned himself by the short stone wall light on downstairs tomi attached the sights clear view of the drawing room a woman kneeling down by a small alcove at the back seconds later the light went out tomi panned the sights sharply to each side and up to see if any other lights had come on but there were none the electricity had been cut he had no night sights he would have to move in and brossard was no doubt already there and would have prepared with it was then that he picked up the faint glow at the back of the drawing room in his sights a small nightlight he could just pick out the silhouette of the woman she was standing talking on the phone then only seconds later another shape came swiftly into frame gripping the woman around the neck with one arm taking the telephone tomi focused his sights saw the man say something into the receiver and then the gun in his hand levelled at the womans temple tomi trained the crosshairs at the centre of the mans head and squeezed off the shot saw it connect cleanly both figures falling back he packed up the rifle and ran back across the field to his car girouves would be pleased harmony kept with the police and quite a favour they owed girouves if ever he had need to call it in contarge looked at the photo developing in the trough of liquid cm x cm print the car number plate looked quite clear bit more bit more the darkroom assistant yanked it out pinned it on a wire next to two smaller prints contarge put his eyeglass close up to the damp dripping paper even in the faint orange light of the darkroom he thought he could make out the first five numbers its probably the best well get hed picked it out from three possible negatives of duclos car heading towards the gate then theyd worked through a succession of frame croppings and enlargements the assistant nodded i think so any more and the resolution will start to break up contarge gave it a quick pass through under the blow dryer then headed out the darkroom and back to his desk in daylight it was even better than he thought all but the last two numbers could be easily read he picked up the phone and dialled lepoille fortyfive the police siren screamed through the night still alive alive dominic had shrieked the word above moniques wailing cry as shed looked on over his shoulder at geromes crumpled body the chest and lower part of the neck had been a mass of blood and it had been hard to find the pulse at first dominic knew that he would need light for what he had to do and rushed to the garage to switch back on the electricity then he took a large bed sheet from the linen cupboard he felt for the entry wound through geromes right breastbone a few centimetres off centre slightly more to the left and it would have hit his heart but he knew that shattered bone could still have severed vital arteries or be sitting close to the heart and blood loss was so heavy that gerome could easily still die from that alone ripping the sheet in two with one part hed mopped up the excess blood and with the other tied a bandage and part tourniquet around the upper chest wrapping under the right arm a police car with two gendarmes had arrived at that moment it would have taken too long to get an ambulance so dominic arranged that one gendarme drive the police car as a lead while the other drove dominics car following behind dominic would meanwhile tend to gerome in the back of the car the second police car arrived just as they had gerome in and ready to go dominic suggested they stay and phone for a meat wagon and forensics for brossard dominic grabbed another sheet to help stem any extra blood flow monique was to go in the lead car but shed insisted on staying close to gerome shed stayed turned from the seat constantly her eyes darting concernedly with each movement as he tended gerome blood stark against the white sheet binding in the intermittent glare from the police cars flashing light ahead the pulsing glare and the siren added an urgency to every movement dont die please dont die dominic made sure to keep the airway free kept gerome turned slightly to one side he hardly took his eyes off gerome all the time not only the constant need to tend and watch for any changes in breathing and pulse but because he didnt want to meet moniques eyes frantic pleading surely it couldnt be all the years shed feared something like this happening though mainly with yves because of his work and in the end it had been gerome dominic could almost feel her thoughts coming across in waves without looking up and it had all been due to his obsession with justice for christian no no it was unthinkable he couldnt let it happen gerome wouldnt die yet from the blood loss and the weakness of geromes pulse and breathing he knew that they would be lucky to save gerome it would be a desperate race against time how far now to the hospital at draguignan he asked the gendarme driving fourteen fifteen kilometres five six minutes at most gerome hadnt at any time regained consciousness and dominic started to think of the many equally as unacceptable alternatives coma mental impairment paralysis a pall of hopelessness descending as he took in the full horror of his sons shattered bloodied body he scrunched his eyes tight and suddenly he had an image of gerome as a young child playing in the sea and him lifting gerome above a wave that threatened to swamp him lifting him out of danger and planting kisses on his smiling cheek as gerome shrieked with excitement feeling the slight tremble in geromes small body and he wished he could do that now just lift him free of the danger but as he opened his eyes he was back with the stark flashing glare and horror blurred now from his tears welling seeing his anguish monique commented well be there soon her first words since asking is he going to live as her initial wailing panic had subsided dominic had responded hastily yes not even thinking whether he might be lying reflected his wish in that moment more than what he believed minutes later as they burst through swing doors at draguignan hospital with gerome alongside on a gurney led by two medics dominics mobile phone started ringing he didnt answer it his other life as a policeman could wait a while all that mattered was gerome guy lepoille viewed the photo sent from contarge at le figaro on his computer screen hed asked contarge to send through a scanned image by modem to interpols x server so that he could pull it up a few keyboard taps and he blew it up to x image enlargement cropping in on the number plate as contarge mentioned all visible except the last two numbers he deliberated for only a second before deciding to put out the nationwide alert first he phoned through to ncb division ii from where it would be routed through to interpol national and within minutes would be broadcast to regional stations and police cars throughout france then he dialled dominics number tell him the good news everything was already in motion the hunt for duclos was on in earnest but the number rang without answering lepoille looked back thoughtfully at his computer screen as he hung up those last two numbers bothered him some impressive image recognition equipment had been installed the past few years by division primarily for counterfeit bill or art theft and fraud detection if he put the image through its paces he wondered if he might pull up the last two numbers a or a a or an all lepoille could make out were vague shadows he enlarged to x magnification and started piecing together the likely shape that the blurred dots remaining might have taken then he asked the computer for percentage likelihoods for each suggestion after seven minutes he had an on a on one number and on an on the other with all other choices scoring less than full house got the bastard lepoille let out a little yelp and clapped his hands causing a few people in the computer room to look over lepoille put through an update to the ncb division then tried dominic again duclos sat in the car park of the motorway services at brignolescambarette as hed raced up to the n junction only two kilometres from forniers farmhouse hed had to decide quickly what to do he didnt want to head straight for the airfield there was almost an hour to spare and besides if fornier was following the last thing he wanted to do was lead him straight there but which way to head he hadnt seen any lights turn out but what if the realization hit fornier a minute later and he decided to give chase he decided on west heading deeper into france east towards nice and the italian border would be the more obvious choice for anyone following five kilometres along some headlamps looming up quickly in his rearview mirror worried him and he took the e motorway turnoff they didnt follow he continued heading west and a few kilometres further on pondered what to do he didnt want to head too far away from the airfield yet didnt want to stop on the hard shoulder too open too conspicuous for any passing police cars he also needed a main junction turn off in order to turn and head back the way hed come it was then that hed decided on the next motorway services at brignolescambarette another twentyone kilometres it would take him less than ten minutes and only be fifteensixteen minutes away from the airfield duclos looked at his watch pm sixteen minutes into his thirty minute wait in the car park it had felt like a lifetime hed parked at the very back of the car park where few people passed and might notice him only two cars had so far come around the back in search of parking spaces and hed ducked down out of sight he could see the hub of activity of people parking and entering the service complex of shops and restaurants forty metres ahead hed parked facing so that hed be forewarned of anything suspicious any out of place movements or cars approaching his nerves had bristled as a police car approached but it went straight through without hardly pausing looking on at the activity the hustle bustle ahead brought home to him more acutely the fugitive the outcast he had become mothers and fathers with their children young couples old couples teenagers people on holiday from the north dining buying souvenirs and gifts grabbing a few snacks and groceries a tableau a microcosm of life in france and he was sitting outside it all alone in the dark at the back of the car park sitting outside their merry little circle in the same way that he had sat outside betinas and joels life all through the years damn them betina joel corbeix fornier especially fornier damn the lot of you duclos shouted sure that his voice had carried no more than a few metres away nobody had heard him perhaps that was why fornier hadnt reappeared to chase him brossard had been lying in wait had already blasted the wife and then the son and then put a hole clean through fornier as soon as he appeared the thought put a thin smile on duclos lips the first all day kervrooom bap bap duclos jumped his heart pounding eyes darting sharply towards the sound five cars to the right battered old opel bad exhaust by the sound of it duclos nerves slowly settled back as he watched it pull out and away but he was still anxious that he hadnt noticed anyone approach they must have come from the petrol pumps to one side and circled around the back he would have to be more alert he could have looked up to see a gendarme standing by his side window but in the remaining minutes though he was more vigilant in keeping an eye on all directions the incident had unnerved him the events of the day had slowboiled his nerves but it was as if the car starting had suddenly turned the flame up high each sound leaves rustling a car door slamming rows away footsteps on gravel in the distance voices by the main services entrance cut straight through him his nerves thrumming like taut piano wire his hands were shaking his palms sweaty he steadied them on the steering wheel only to discover that his whole body was trembling duclos slowly closed his eyes the sounds ahead the people milling around the succession of cars passing in and out everything seemed to be closing in there was a ringing in his ears a dull ache at the back of his head even when he opened his eyes again he could hear his own pounding pulse he suddenly felt the way he had earlier in the service cafe that someone among the throng ahead would see him pick him out sitting in the shadows at the back of the car park and start walking towards him pointing and suddenly there would be a crowd following all pointing shouting duclos duclos his face would have been on news bulletins at least twice by now he shook his head tried to shake off his clawing fear the only thing which helped was looking down upon them clinging to the moral high ground which he felt had separated him from the masses over the years look at them nondescript rabble hed done so much for them for france and now theyd turned their backs on him as far as he was concerned they could all rot perhaps he would be better off in south america but within minutes the trembling was back a pounding in his head that said go go get away as far from the rabble as possible as if they might be unpredictable a bastille mob that could suddenly turn and steal away his escape at the last second he hastily started the peugeot and headed away four minutes earlier than originally planned he looked at the people receding in his rear view mirror and let out a long slow sigh fighting to relax again swallowing back the butterfly nerves and nauseousness rising in his stomach picking up speed on the slipway to rejoin the motorway he didnt notice the police car hed seen earlier now parked on a ramp to one side he was busy looking at the approaching traffic one of the gendarmes only noticed the blue peugeot at the last minute they too were more preoccupied with the oncoming traffic but he was unsure and by the time hed confirmed the registration with his central dispatch as the one broadcast earlier the peugeot was out of sight dispatch would radio ahead what here here near vidauban dominics tone was incredulous disbelieving the second time his mobile had rung hed answered and lepoille had told him about them coming up with duclos car number the newspaper photo ploy had worked and a nationwide search was already in full swing great good news well done but now with this second call from lepoille twenty minutes later it hit him that the chase had been brought to his doorstep why what on earth is he doing down here no idea the sighting we have the only one so far was from near brignoles which way is he heading west towards you hes on the e motorway and should hit the junction down the road from you just past le luc in no more than eight or nine minutes perhaps some sort of meeting to pay off brossard was the only explanation dominic could think of and then the image suddenly flickered back from his subconscious a blue peugeot parked up on the road side a distant face caught for a split second in the stark glare of the spotlights duclos duclos had been waiting by the approach to his house while brossard was inside the fleeting image so totally out of place at the time it hadnt registered the last place hed expected duclos but why was duclos now heading back towards him rather than away that was why im calling now lepoille said youre the nearest car north of the junction suddenly it hit dominic with a jolt what they wanted to join the chase help apprehend duclos at any other time he would already be running for his car but not now not while his sons life was still hanging in the balance in the next room but i left a squad car at the farm at vidauban what about that i dont know the closest cars that could be raised apart from you was one heading south just past pugetvalle which was turned straight around and another seven kilometres into the e heading east from the le luc junction theyve been told to stay where they are the next turn off is almost eighteen kilometres they wouldnt get back in time to cover the junction either one could be the cars sent earlier to vidauban dominic reflected but lepoille obviously didnt know about the drama at the farmhouse on lepoilles first call hed mentioned where he was but not why too personal the conversation would have become maudlin dominic had been sitting next to monique on the nearest hospital corridor bench to emergency but after the first few words he stood up started pacing away with what she had on her mind now insensitive for her to be bothered with police logistics but the pugetvalle car wont they make it up to the junction in time no theyll be about five or six kilometres short you wont make it to the motorway junction by then either but you should be able to make the n junction easily that will effectively cut duclos off from heading east on the n or north through grasse with the motorway and south already covered well have him cornered impossible choice desert monique and gerome at such a moment or let the man who had wreaked these horrors on his family escape the thought of duclos so close made his adrenalin surge with a mixture of anger and excitement the prospect of personally hunting down duclos felt somehow fitting right but he couldnt just couldnt isnt there another car you can send dominics voice was pleading desperate no afraid not weve already checked all the options dominic was half turned away and glanced back as he sensed monique looking over more pointedly seeing the pain and anguish etched deep in her face made the decision for him long sigh im sorry i just cant do it dominic briefly outlined the events at the farmhouse geromes still in emergency were waiting on news any minute i just cant leave now im sorry dominic if id known i wouldnt have asked its okay how could you know look let me know how if you dont go will he get away this from monique cutting in im sorry i for a second dominic was confused not sure who to address first then guy ill call you back in a second moniques expression was taut fobbing her off with a lie seemed pointless the n was one of duclos main escape route options dominic shrugged yes i suppose so he might and this is the same man responsible for christian and now gerome yes flat tone one word denoting so much of her lifes anguish her jawline tightened she contemplated the floor for a second before looking back at dominic then i think you should go im here for gerome and the doctors are doing their best theres nothing you can do for him by staying dominic shook his head no no i couldnt possibly leave you and gerome at a moment like this i wouldnt be able to face either of you squarely again or myself for that matter i cant go monique looked at him steadily eyes piercing and if gerome should die do you think it will be any easier to face me knowing that youve let the man responsible get away dominic felt the words like a knife if she wanted to punish him for what had happened that was it now those words but as he met her eyes he could see that she was resolute determined beyond the barb she wanted him to go arguing looked futile the same message hed read before get him get him dont let him get away dominic started to hit back with more protests but monique was insistent practically screaming at him to go as she became frantic that vital seconds were being lost with a last defeated shrug and an elicited promise from monique that she call him the second there was any news on gerome he turned hastily away already dialling out to lepoille monique closed her eyes a tear rolling down one cheek gerome near death and it had sounded as if she partly blamed dominic but she knew that if she hadnt taken that stance he wouldnt have gone she could live without seeing justice done had already done so for so many years but dominic despite his protests she could see that part of him desperately wanted to track down duclos exact justice shed seen it in his indecision on the phone in the hunted frantic look in his eyes when he discovered duclos was so close the plea in his voice isnt there another car you can send she knew that until he caught duclos the past would never be fully laid to rest monique looked thoughtfully at the closed doors of the emergency room a cold desolate chill crept over her once again she would be alone praying for the life of a son though this time at least the choice had been hers the first thrill the anticipation of the chase hit dominic as he felt the surge of his car engine powering away from the hospital then it built layer by layer as he continued his conversation by mobile with lepoille and switched on his police radio to patch in and make contact with the other two vehicles brn east of the le luc motorway junction and tln heading north from pugetvalle lepoille had already confirmed the le luc car was in position so dominic asked tln its current location hoarse voice through airwaves surf were just about running parallel with pignan we should make it to the junction in about seven minutes dominic glanced at the map hed spread out on the passenger seat he spoke into his mobile when do you expect duclos to reach the junction about four or five minutes then back to the radio expect him to pass you at about four or five kilometres your side of the junction if hes heading your way keep your eyes sharp then dominic clicked off the radio but kept the mobile on to lepoille he checked his speed kmph parts of the road were winding and it was difficult to go faster i should reach the n in about five minutes and duclos was eight or nine minutes away from that point he estimated eleven kilometres beyond the motorway junction he should be able to head duclos off in plenty of time ill phone you again when i reach there dominic glanced again at the map picturing their triangular formation as dots closing in they had him there was no way out almost unreal that after all these years he was finally so close and now there was nothing tentative venturesome about the case they had betina duclos testimony they would throw away the key with duclos so close he felt the earlier rush of anticipation grow stronger as the trees and hedgerows flashed by in the stark beam of his headlamps shadows marking his progress tombstones for duclos he hit a flat stretch and edged his speed up to kmph the past weeks of activity had left him tired and jaded but now the adrenalin rush made him alert again he could feel it touching every nerve end as he sped on the kilometres starting to zip by seven six dominic flicked the radio back on he raised the motorway car aware that duclos would probably reach them first he should be passing you in no more than two or three minutes if hes heading straight on if so give immediate pursuit and well radio ahead keep the airwaves open throughout he left a similar message with the second car heading north but with a four minute timing less than a minute later as the n junction loomed ahead he called lepoille and brought him up to date about two minutes now on the motorway three if hes heading south dominic turned at the n heading toward the motorway closing the triangle tighter and maybe four minutes for him to pass me if he comes this way dominic tapped his fingers on the steering wheel anxious as it came up to the minute mark for duclos to pass the motorway car then looked towards the radio as he silently counted down fifty seconds forty thirty at ten seconds he prompted anything yet no beats of silence forty fifty a minute over duclos must have headed south or was coming north towards him tln he could be heading down towards you if so he should be passing any second okay but his radio stayed obstinately silent as the seconds passed a minute over heading south two heading north the chances that duclos was heading his way increased and dominic slowed honing in closer on each passing car type colour and finally number among the glare of oncoming headlamps still silence from the radio duclos must be heading towards him hed have reached either of the other points by now dominic pulled over at the first farm turning on a flat stretch and backed in so that he was sideon to the traffic ready to turn out quickly dominics nerves tensed any second now scrutinizing each passing car looking ahead two and three cars at the first hint of shape and form on the horizon lights and shapes becoming a blur headlamp star bursts as his eyes watered come on come on he knew that if he saw duclos now there would be little subtlety left he would just ram his car broadside and yank him out at gun point but each car that at first looked hopeful then finally when closer he saw wasnt duclos raised his panic another notch and sunk him deeper into despondency duclos smug face seeming to rise up increasingly out of each set of passing lights fooled you fooled you again dominic made a final check with the other two cars nothing then looked at his watch pm duclos wasnt going to show dominic became frantic he banged his fist on the steering wheel where for gods sake where he stared blankly at the map theyd had duclos cornered and hed disappeared into thin air there was hardly anything in the triangle left worth duclos heading for le luc and small nearby villages such as le cannet a few small roads leading to farms unless duclos had taken the n doubling back so that dominic froze airfield the small yellow square to the right of the triangle suddenly leapt out at him the tb trinidad banked at feet as it came over the last stretch of the alpes maritimes there was a thin cloud layer ghostly mist racing towards them and clinging to the windscreen then after a minute they were through and the lights of the cote dazur were ahead the pilot started a descent to feet as he prepared to bank again his passenger had hardly said a word throughout and his presence had increasingly unnerved him a stocky man in his late thirties named hector whose swiss french had an italian or spanish accent wearing a padded leather jacket which made him look even bulkier the only bit of good news was that hector would be staying in portugal with his pickup at least he would have the journey back without his company ft he dropped in stages following the lights along the coast then as he saw the lights of toulon ahead banked sharply for the final descent darkness all they could see was the shape of three grey hangars at the far end of the airfield and another two to their far right by a small office building nine aircraft in total two to their right four spread between the more distant hangars and three on a flat tarmac area at the end of the main runway but there were no lights no movement or activity dominic had arrived at the airfield at pm a minute after the le luc car with two gendarmes the driver a sergeant named pierre giverny informed him that it was much the same now as when he had arrived total darkness no sign of activity what giverny hadnt noticed as hed pulled in was one of the three planes on the tarmac beyond the runway taxiing slowly starting to move to position to take off it braked and stood motionless as soon as his lights appeared duclos car was out of sight tucked behind the back of the furthest hangar dominic was parked next to the gendarmes car two sets of headlamps on full beam probing expectantly into the darkness though most of their effectiveness faded less than halfway along the main runway everything beyond was just vague grey shadow perhaps i was wrong said dominic he looked thoughtfully towards the distant hangars and planes in the darkness of the planes cockpit hector commented give them a moment more and theyll probably go the pilot nodded with a pained smile hector had suddenly found his voice police and nighttime raids probably familiar ground duclos consciously held his breath as he looked on at the figures in the distance shadowy silhouettes alongside the headlamp beams his nerves were racing out of control one of the cars he was sure was forniers he saw the figures huddled together talking looking towards them a shiver ran up his spine his whole body suddenly shuddering then after a second they turned seemed to be making their way back towards their cars see whispered almost breathless exclamation from hector duclos thought hector might have been a navigator until hed slipped in the back when duclos had first got in hectors presence behind him made him uneasy a final soupcon of tension he could have done without after the mounting panic of the day duclos felt his stomach in knots his nerves breaking close to the edge dominic got back into his car starting her up he moved forward starting to turn then suddenly stopped he looked thoughtfully back at the runway fifty metres ahead its long expanse of darkness and the planes and hangars at its end whats he doing duclos hissed a frozen silence with no answer between them in the confined darkness of the cockpit only slow breathing waiting then oh god jesus as duclos saw the lights straighten start to head towards them go go hector shouted get going he took out a gun and waved it though the pilot was unsure if it was as a threat or to fire at the oncoming car the pilot started up and jolted forward completing the turn quickly so that they were in line with the runway then he throttled up high starting to roll forward furiously the car had almost covered the fifty metres of tarmac beyond was approaching the beginning of the runway the plane shook and rattled as they picked up speed the pilot knew that once the car had covered half of the runway it would be too late they would be blocked from take off he bit at his lip it was going to be close he watched the speedometer climb quickly to over kmph but he could see that the car had already covered almost quarter of the runway are we going to make it asked duclos he was trembling though he wasnt sure if it was more fear of collision or them not getting away i dont know as the reach of the cars beam hit them the pilot switched on his own lights a stronger marker of their own presence hopefully intimidating a deterrent the car seemed to falter slightly before picking up speed again the second car had also now started following was just touching the start of the runway dont worry hector said as soon as he sees were serious were not stopping hell back off but his undertone wavered even hector now wasnt sure as the airplane lights hit dominic hed braked slightly on impulse it suddenly appeared more ominous threatening before steeling himself again his first intention had been purely to investigate the planes and hangars ahead so one of the planes moving suddenly from the group had surprised him turning quickly to panic as he realized it was turning positioning was starting along the runway making a bid for escape he knew in that second with certainty that duclos was inside if he could get close enough to block their passage they would be forced to abort take off but he could see now that they werent easing back his own speed was edging over kmph and the plane was probably nearing rolling furiously towards take off the first twinge of fear gripped him if they collided at that speed there would be little chance of survival but moniques words rang in his ear do you think that it would be any easier to face me knowing that youve let the man responsible escape but it wasnt just monique the other faces long etched in his mind burned home stronger in the glare of the planes lights christian machanaud as if they too were somehow depending on him no no hed chased duclos for too long too many lives affected he couldnt let him go now he kept his foot down hard powering on hes crazy hector screamed as the car lights raced towards them duclos said nothing was too afraid his simmering panic of the day reaching a crescendo almost catatonic a nervous dribble crept from the corner of his mouth his whole body seeming to tremble in time with the shuddering of the plane as it screamed forward the engines roar the fast approaching lights the shaking and rumbling a cacophony of sound and light which suddenly made him realize it was all going to end here here on this runway in a ball of flame his whole body was bathed in sweat but part of him perversely almost welcomed the oblivion an end to all the panic and madness the running and hiding and chasing he couldnt go on any more nerves screaming end it yes end it i cant face another second a crooked smile crossing his face as it dawned on him that fornier would also be consumed in the fireball were not going to make it the pilot screamed keep going keep going hector shrieked pointing his gun this time it was a threat ninety metres eighty seventy the distance closed rapidly between them gerome monique duclos standing outside his house waiting to give the assassin his blood money dominic gripped the steering wheel tight the pilot suddenly saw a niche a slim chance if he turned a fraction at the last second the car would hopefully sweep past under the wing he looked to the side judging height quickly it would be close but probably their only chance now a monster all those lives so much destroyed duclos escaping was unthinkable dominic headed straight for the airplanes searing lights the pilot tilted the wheel slightly to the right and felt the first lift under the wings practically at the same second forty metres thirty dominic saw the veering in direction almost too late to react sudden panic that the plane might sweep past him and escape and he turned the wheel sharply too sharply he felt the back swing around and the car slide into a spin tilting heavily it skidded inexorably forward with tyres screaming for almost ten metres before the tilt finally verged into a sickening roll and dominic saw everything spinning the planes lights the car roof and side window the seat and floor shards of glass suddenly showering down around him and swirling as he thought gerome monique the first roll of the car cut sharply into the side of the planes windscreen view but with the second roll the pilot could see the car was heading straight for them its frame starting to fill the windscreen but they were lifting lifting the nose edging up above the dark ominous shape the pilot felt the thud as the car hit something below them then the violent shuddering and shaking through the joystick fighting to keep control as the plane dipped and wavered he thought for a second they were going to nosedive straight down and crash but the wavering quickly righted they started to lift again oh god monique dominics last thought as darkness finally swallowed up the cataclysm swirling around him if anything happened to gerome and now him she could never face it she would be practically alone ft steadily climbing the lights of the coast starting to appear in the distance below the pilot looked out briefly for damage he could see fuel dripping back from below one wing and checked his gauge it was probably a slow leak but enough to stop them making it to portugal they might have to put down beforehand but the thud had been one of the struts or possibly the landing wheel if damage was bad they might not be able to put down an electrical spark caught on the fumes from dominics carburettor a small fire starting but in his inner darkness all he could see was the single candle flame burning flickering across moniques gentle profile and as the flames became more intense starting to catch the dripping petrol all around him he was back in the wheat field searching for duclos the gendarmes were tapping forward with their canes but poullain had ordered them to torch the wheat field ahead he was sure that christians murderer was still hiding in the field and the flames and smoke would help flush him out but dominic was also concealed among the long sheaves on his knees searching for the coin as the flames came close starting to lick all around him growing panic as he felt the searing heat and realized the fire had surrounded him there was no way out as the plane touched ft they saw the cars explosion in the distance below as if someone had lit a runway bonfire to mark a landing point a slow smile crossed duclos face as the explosion came a jolt went through moniques body a feeling of dread as if something terrible had happened to gerome in the emergency room at that second she looked up anxiously towards the emergency room doors expecting a doctor to come out with a drawn face at any moment but with the passing seconds and nobody appearing she went back to her silent prayers of the past hour thinking please please not this second time surely god couldnt be so cruel as to let another of her sons die it never occurred to her in that moment that her prayers should have been for dominic epilogue praia do forte brazil january duclos sipped at the caipirissima as he swung on a hammock on the covered terrace from the beach in front of the villa came the gentle swish of surf darkness had fallen almost three hours ago and it showed only as a white frothing line in the moonlight theyd finally landed over three hundred kilometres further north than planned close to oporto due to loss of fuel a nightmarish skidding landing with a damaged wheel but they made it two days in portugal with hector to arrange a new identity and passport and then he was on a scheduled flight to salvador bahia he was met there by a local jorge cergara who drove him the eighty kilometres north to praia do forte and the beach villa his new identity was gerard belmeau a swissfrench businessman taking early retirement his hair had been dyed a red sandy blonde and he had started cultivating a moustache which was tinged every few days to match the papers for the house were already prepared in the name of belmeau and praia do forte was increasingly popular with foreign tourists no eyebrows would be raised cergara assured and if at any time they were both the mayor and police chief were in their pockets from payoffs on their hotel and resort investments in the area gerard belmeau his new life duclos had rolled it around his tongue for days tried to force it into his mind so that if anyone called out his new name he might actually respond except nobody did nobody knew him he was just a shadowy quiet figure who shuffled into town occasionally to eat and buy groceries and visited the beach some weekdays at the weekends it was too crowded and invariably hed stay on his terrace and nurse a caiparissima catch up on the latest news from france in the newspapers there was only one place in town hed found where he could get them and normally hed buy le figaro and le monde the only two available at the same time hed filled the french press the first two months of escape front page at first then later further back with background and new angle items rise and fall in politics or thrown in with a soup of other political scandals tapie medecin now duclos duclos had smiled at the articles attacking the general bungling surrounding his escape barielle for allowing house arrest corbeix for not protesting stronger against it the entire examination process for not uncovering the fact that he very obviously had funds outside of those frozen and finally the keystone collection of provence cops who let him slip through their grasp a circus of finger pointing and mud slinging sitting eight thousand miles away on a palm fringed beach duclos found it all laughable pathetic a lot of ranting and political rhetoric his name used primarily for ministers to score points off each other as they grasped at air with empty hands screaming for justice duclos sneered justice what did they know they had no idea what hed suffered through the years for those few dark moments three decades ago plagued for years by blackmail from chapeau then in turn his brother his secret life with betina and joel sometimes it had felt like a hell on earth in repayment for what hed done one incident linking to another through the long years that was why hed felt so outraged when the case had resurfaced he felt as if hed already paid his penance served his term except one part of the link in the chain of fateful circumstances through the years had finally led to his salvation if it hadnt been for the blackmail he probably wouldnt have taken political bribes the slush fund and contacts which had finally allowed him to escape he raised his glass to an imaginary france and smiled crookedly at least hed had the last laugh there salut the first few months had been particularly idyllic almost like an extended holiday any sense of isolation didnt set in till later perhaps coinciding with him slipping from prominence in the french press he decided he was sick of brazilian tv with its endless lambada and game shows with scantily clad hostesses and invested in a large satellite dish to get french tv it helped but also in part felt like nostalgic voyeurism he was able to look at all that he loved and was familiar food fashion lifestyle from a distance but couldnt touch it feel it not long after he discovered the caipirissimas white rum with lime sugar and crushed ice when brazilian tv became too painful or french tv too nostalgic he would retire to the terrace and his cocktail shaker his name had come back into prominence with the news that corbeix was continuing with the case in absentia watching the proceedings from a distance it suddenly hit him why he felt such satisfaction when his name was in the news not only a reminder of what hed got away with but a sense that at least he was still in france in spirit if not in body hed also been into salvador a few times and recently made a contact for young boys and cergara had phoned and invited him to the rio carnival next month his next annual biotech payment was due soon and some new banking arrangements had been made their lawyer thought it was best to meet him in person to explain the new arrangements and he could take in the carnival at the same time all expenses on them things were looking up the effect of the four caipirissimas that night began to bite he could feel their warmth coursing through him a distant glow on the beach slowly pierced his blurred vision focusing the four candles became clearer a woman and small child silhouetted kneeling before them probably a candomble ceremony hed seen one before candles and a collection of seashells on a white cloth flowers and rice thrown into the sea to appease their gods exu and iemanja but in the distant flickering flames he suddenly saw monique rosselots face her reflection in the glass as she prayed for her dying son the receding flames of forniers burning wreckage as theyd climbed up high above the lights of the cote dazur he shook his head freeing the ghosts was easier now it all felt so far away in time and distance almost another lifetime duclos closed his eyes and let the lapping surf and the nighttime pulsing of cicadas and crickets wash over him as he thought ahead to the rio carnival drums and dancing and colourful star bursts of costumes gradually matched the rhythm lulling him gently into another caipirissimainduced sleep tudo bem voce gosta de carnival among the clatter and riot of noise and movement duclos would have hardly noticed the young boy if he hadnt greeted him almost as soon as he walked out of the hotel after meeting perello not unusual the street kids abandanados regularly worked the tourist hotels seeing duclos quizzical expression the boy switched to broken english you want guide for carnival i very good only five dollars merican show you everything duclos noticed then how beautiful the boy was one of the most exquisite mulattos hed ever seen coffee cream skin brown curls with a tinge of light gold soft brown eyes the thought of spending an hour or two with the boy made his mouth suddenly dry the boy was right he was a good guide they took in the main ipanema processions at praca general osorio and heading along avenida visc de piraja then ended up at il veronese where he bought the boy a pizza the boy whose name hed discovered was paulo tucked in as if he hadnt eaten in weeks duclos smiled he felt a warm glow in the boys company it felt gratifying to spend his money like this so much pleasure gained for so little he ended up giving the boy almost thirty dollars to ensure he stayed in his company the boy was still looking longingly at the menu after his pizza so duclos treated him to an ice cream as the boy finished the last few scoops he looked up thoughtfully directly you want spend longer with me alone duclos stared back into the boys innocent eyes except they werent so innocent they were knowing senses honed sharp by years of street life perhaps the boy had guessed with him being so kind and attentive or the fact that hed hardly paid any attention to the writhing tanga bottoms and starnippled breasts of the carnival girls his eyes had hardly left the boy throughout the boy knew but at least he could now dispense with the subterfuge how much the boy thought for a second plucking a figure out of the air sixty dollars duclos smiled it was probably twice what the boy normally charged but duclos would have gladly paid double this was great perello had just confirmed bank transfer details for his next payment and here he was in the middle of bargainbasement street kid heaven perhaps hed make a trip back to rio every few months exile was starting to look better by the day where he asked sneaking an abandanado past his hotel reception was too risky i know somewhere near duclos contemplated briefly before nodding though hed known what his answer would be from the first second the boy made the proposal he paid the bill and they left the frenetic activity of carnival hit them again outside fifty yards along they turned and the noise started to recede then another turn away from the main processions and finally into a small back alley almost three blocks away carnival activity was now no more than dull background drumming and whistling crowds and people had also diminished with each successive turn the back alley was deserted paulo indicated a small door almost halfway along and led the way in a deserted storehouse old packing crates served as tables and chairs and some makeshift beds had been made with cardboard on the dusty concrete floor it was obviously where some of the abandanados spent the night paulo wedged a long block of wood between the floor and door handle the only light came in from a high dusty window duclos handed over the money and the boy tucked it in his shoe and started taking off his clothes duclos was slow in taking off his own clothes enjoying watching the boy strip the lean taut lines of the boys body his slim hips an indefinable colour somewhere between teak and copper duclos pulse raced with anticipation and then the boy was leaning over going down on all fours one finger beckoning the blood pounded through duclos head positioning himself behind the boy he saw the faint film of sweat covering the body and slid one finger slowly down the groove of the boys spine then slowly caressing with his whole hand spreading around and up again exquisite duclos closed his eyes felt himself sailing on a wave of pleasure jahlep jeanpaul pascal the many boys who had pleasured him through the years but as he opened his eyes again the boy was turned back towards him his eyes caught in a shaft of light from the window above tan brown with small flecks of green soulful imploring and suddenly they reminded him of the boy in the wheat field sweet acid sweat mixed with the smell of peaches and ripe wheat the wind rustling gently through the trees behind only as he looked deeper he could see that the boy wasnt looking back directly into his own eyes but at something beyond slightly behind him and the boys body was suddenly tense something was wrong terribly wrong a faint shuffling was the only other warning as the man stepped from the shadows behind and ran the blade deftly across duclos throat severing his jugular the boy scampered up quickly and grabbed his clothes eager to get them clear of duclos blood spilling the man wiped his blade on duclos shirt draped over a packing crate and took the wallet from his trousers alongside as the boy dressed he watched as duclos slumped to the ground as if ensuring that the wound had been fatal and then the boy and him left together as duclos clutched at his throat his life blood ebbing away the image of the boys soulful brown eyes stayed with him only in his minds eye they were staring straight at him not beyond miguel perello made his call from an ipanema phone box it was picked up on the second ring the person answering in california was expecting the call its done perello said any complications no none he took the bait and it went smoothly good take care of the rest of the clean up with the bank accounts and transfers then thats the whole thing wrapped fine hanging up perello decided to join the carnival procession he could hear a block away he felt like celebrating they could have kept duclos hidden for a while but eventually someone would have traced him and duclos first option would have been to trade juicy secrets in return for a lighter sentence not worth the risk when at stake was the biotechnology coup of the century but it was marchand who had unconsciously given them clues to the best game plan marchand had been right duclos was too prominent a figure in france and killing him in the middle of a high profile murder trial wellplanned accident or not would have attracted far too much attention letting the dust settle for a while and removing duclos far from the central spotlight had been a much better plan now he was just gerard belmeau a swiss tourist mugged and killed in a rio back alley during carnival it happened every year provence august dominic felt the late sun on his back as he inspected the tangerine tree hed originally bought it not long after coming out of hospital part nostalgia part symbol of his and geromes survival christmas past there had been only four tangerines on the tree now he could count eleven blossoms the day had been busy the capels had left just over an hour before hed been in the garden when they arrived and now returned to do a bit more tending before it got dark the last skin graft for the burns on his arm had been that february and his leg had been out of plaster now for over three months even his small limp had now gone giverny and his partner had been racing up the runway not far behind him and had managed to drag him free only eight seconds before the explosion his only injury was a broken leg and burns to one arm gerome had been more serious the initial operation was successful but hed spent another two weeks in hospital for monitoring then two months later had returned for reconstructive surgery to his breastbone and the insertion of a plastic plate yves had ribbed him at least youll probably be the only man on the coast with an implant not a bad novelty line for chatting up on the beach at cannes there was a period of convalescence for them both at home but despite moniques fussing and small complaints that at times it was like having two babies again dominic could see her silent pleasure her prayers had been answered this time after two weeks gerome went back to work but dominic stayed at home the incident had been a stern prompt that it was time to take retirement the pension was good there was an invalidity topup and he had enough money put away he was getting too old to chase villains along runways a month before hed seen a bar in juanlespins for sale and made contact with valerie louis wife for advice she knew the bars and hotel scene on the coast themed bars were popular and his idea was late s or s with period memorabilia such as an old juke box and pop and movie posters he had nearly all the period soul records for the juke box already in the end valerie was so enthused she offered to go in with him the thought of the milieu possibly visiting one day for protection money particularly tickled her just leave it to me dominic winked papers were ready to sign the next month and the refit would see the bar open just before christmas it was mostly summer trade but weekends were good with another slight spurt at christmas and easter the only cautionary note from monique was that while behind the bar he stick mostly to perrier dominic wasnt sure what was his main motive reliving his youth keeping himself occupied or making some money if he got two out of three he wouldnt complain sipping perrier while listening to sam cooke with the lapping waters of juan les pins less than fifty metres away heaven early march lepoille had phoned him to tell him the news about duclos in brazil the swiss embassys efforts to trace and contact relatives of gerard belmeau had unearthed the false identity and photofit and dental chart checking through interpol had brought up the duclos match soon after corbeix had by then finished the instruction process of his in absentia case against duclos with a final trial date set for july corbeix had claimed that his main reason for continuing was the cases complexity and to prove to himself that he had the ability and stamina to see it through a good note on which to finish my career and prove that bastard thibault wrong at the same time but dominic suspected that an equally strong reason was something corbeix mentioned soon before posting for an in absentia continuation corbeix had made application to the garde des sceaux for machanauds old conviction to be struck off but when it was passed to the cour de cassation for review they decided that such action could only be taken if a conclusive case was proven against an alternate suspect corbeix wanted to set the record straight reparation for injustices past cest pret dominic was disturbed monique was by the lounge door calling out dinner was ready duck pot au feu with spinach asparagus and white beans yves and gerome were already at the table when dominic sat down he opened the wine and poured cote rotie les jumelles between the clatter of cutlery of monique serving he raised his glass salut just two weeks before corbeix had phoned him with the trial verdict on duclos guilty nice to see everyone raised glasses in return awkward smile from yves he was usually the main one absent but theyd all made an effort knowing in advance the capels would be visiting that day conversation was light at first small talk from yves and gerome surrounding their work a bar in st maxim that they were planning to head to later monique was never happier than with her family around her and dominic basked in her glow then after a brief lull she looked across thoughtfully eyran seems like a nice boy quite talkative yes he is very much so monique had asked him a few questions after the capels left but a lot had been relayed during a frantic three way conversation while they were there geromes english was limited moniques and yves nonexistent and so dominic had ended up as interpreter sudden flashback to the small room with calvan and eyran and philippe translating but dominic knew why monique was making the comment now after stuart mentioning eyrans interest in seeing monique the summer past the accident and period of hospitalization had pushed back even its mention and then when he finally broached the subject monique took almost another month to answer slow acceptance hed told her before that the boy bore little or no resemblance to christian but still the same questions came this time filling in more detail is he talkative friendly does he know any french dominic had answered that he was a nice boy but shy reserved that though out of therapy now losing his parents had obviously still left its mark when she finally agreed to the meeting hed phoned stuart capel stuart arranged that they would visit one day in the summer combine it as part of their holiday but the eyran capel that arrived that day was almost a different boy talkative attentive eyes sparkling questions every other minute which is the nearest beach do you go there often do you have a boat hes improved a lot since i saw him dominic commented or maybe its just that hes that bit older more confident stuart had arrived alone with eyran leaving his wife and daughter on a st tropez beach during the three way conversation dominic noticed the way monique had at times looked intently at the boy hed never been able to see anything of christian in the boy but maybe in that moment she had at one point as stuart brought dominic up to date on events with marinella calvan monique tried conversing directly with eyran a lot of stilted half sentences with the few english words she knew arm waving and eye contact finally she invited eyran to look at the garden safety of the universal language of trees and plants with some occasional pointing and smiling calvan had phoned stuart capel to thank him for saving her neck in court she also had a proposition she was writing a book which would be far stronger with some personal interviews with eyran she would pay of the royalties she was taking the same with the rest going to the universitys plr studies section stuart had agreed it would help pay eyrans school fees the book was due out in seven months ill send you a copy in turn dominic brought stuart up to date with duclos the trial and corbeix when theyd caught up with monique and eyran they were standing at the back of the garden with monique pointing out over the low stone wall towards the field and the woods in the distance after theyd left monique had asked more questions filling in on what she might have missed since the accident shed hardly mentioned eyran and christian and he had the feeling that shed purposely pushed the thoughts away as a form of selfprotection now it was as if the visit had bought it all back and she was frantically reassimilating catching back up again shed asked the question are you sure he doesnt recall anything while awake only under hypnosis sudden concern that she might have been struggling to communicate while everything was already half familiar to eyran the conversation returned to light incidentals for most of the rest of the dinner then with the dishes cleared away yves and gerome left for st maxim and dominic sipping at a brandy monique asked when did eyran finish therapy when i saw him with stuart last year at the palais de justice apparently he had just three more sessions to go so perhaps a month after at most monique was thoughtful from what youve mentioned hes obviously a lot happier now more settled the past year has made a big difference it looks that way and suddenly looking back at monique it struck dominic why it was important to her shed initially pushed away full acceptance of a plr bond between the two boys some vague unexplained psychic link was as far as she would go but if she was now finally going to accept it was important for her to know that eyran was also happy her pain and grief as with any mother who had lost a young child was not only the personal loss but the thought that that young life had ended with so much ahead a tragic waste which flew in the face of all precepts of balance and order in life yet if she could believe that there was some continuance some hope beyond then it might help salve some of the pain and sense of loss a single nightlight flickered on the table between them in the background crickets clicked softly a calm and balmy night almost surreal that just a year ago it had been the scene of so much mayhem he reached out and gripped moniques hand and smiled he could see how desperately she was now clinging to that hope and he knew that if she could finally believe it might quell the last lingering shadows in her eyes yes he said i think youre right he is very happy now that night as dominic started to drift off to sleep the events of the day all jumbled together the capels yves and gerome the news swapped about duclos corbeix and calvan and moniques final fight with acceptance but the image that lingered strongest in his mind was of monique and eyran standing by the back wall looking out over the field beyond for a moment he was concerned as he had been the year before standing in the wheat field with stuart and eyran that future nightmares might be sparked off in eyrans mind that the field might somehow unlock past buried memories of taragnon but the images that flashed through his mind were from his own past dreams the gendarmes tapping across the field alight and burning around him the assassin stalking through bright burning lights which seared at the back of his eyes as the stinging light faded and he pictured clearly again the two of them standing by the wall now beckoning towards him he knew that there was finally nothing to fear and in that moment looking on he saw moniques hand join with eyrans or was he already dreaming
