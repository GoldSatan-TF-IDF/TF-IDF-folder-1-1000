active in the arts in the nineteenthirties like shirley graham as part of the background of the novel all characters who actually play a role in the story as well as events like the destruction of the fourth amendment are solely the fabrication of a brain made frenzied by chronic insomnia any resemblance to any real person institution government or legislation is purely coincidental chapter a walk on the wild side the clouds across the face of the moon made it hard for me to find my way id been over the grounds yesterday morning but in the dark everything is different i kept stumbling on tree roots and chunks o brick from the crumbling walks i was trying not to make any noise on the chance that someone really was lurking about but i was more concerned about my safety i didnt want to sprain an ankle and have to crawl all the way back to the road at one point i tripped on a loose brick and landed smack on my tailbone my eyes teared with pain i sucked in air to keep from crying out as i rubbed the sore spot i wondered whether geraldine graham had seen me fall her eyes werent that good but her binoculars held both image stabilizers and nightvision enablers fatigue was making it hard for me to concentrate it was midnight usually not late on my clock but i was sleeping badly these daysi was anxious and feeling alone right after the trade center id been as numbed and fearful as everyone else in america after a while when wed driven the taliban into hiding and the anthrax looked like the work of some homegrown maniac most people seemed to wrap themselves in redwhiteandblue and return to normal i couldnt though while morrell remained in afghanistaneven though he seemed ecstatic to be sleeping in caves as he trailed after warlordsturneddiplomatsturnedwarlords when the medical group humane medicine went to kabul in the summer of morrell tagged along with a contract for a book about daily life under the taliban ive survived so much worse he would say when i worried that he might run afoul of the talibans notorious bureau for the prevention of vice that was before september afterward morrell disappeared for ten days i stopped sleeping then although someone with humane medicine called me from peshawar to say morrell was simply in an area without access to phone hookups most of the team had fled to pakistan immediately after the trade center attack but morrell had wangled a ride with an old friend heading to uzbekistan so he could cover the refugees fleeing north a chance of a lifetime my caller told me morrell had saidthe same thing hed said about kosovo perhaps that had been the chance of a different lifetime when we started bombing in october morrell first stayed on in afghanistan to cover the war up close and personal and then to follow the new coalition government margent online the web version of the old philadelphia monthly margent was paying him for field reports which he was scrambling to turn into a book the guardian newspaper also occasionally bought his stories id even watched him on cnn a few times strange to see your lovers face beamed from twelve thousand miles away strange to know that a hundred million people are listening to the voice that whispers endearments into your hair that used to whisper endearments when he resurfaced in kandahar i first sobbed in relief then shrieked at him across the satellites but darling he protested im in a war zone im in a place without electricity or cell phone towers didnt rudy call you from peshawar in the following months he kept on the move so i never really knew where he was at least he stayed in better touch mostly when he needed help vi can you check on why ahmed hazziz was put in isolation out at coolis prison vi can you find out whether the fbi told hazzizs family where theyd sent him im running nowhot interview with local chiefs third wifes oldest son fill you in later i was a little miffed at being treated like a free research station id never thought of morrell as an adrenaline junkieone of those journalists who lives on the high of being in the middle of disasterbut i sent him a snappish email asking him what he was trying to prove over a dozen western journalists have been murdered since the war began i wrote at one point every time i turn on the television i brace myself for the worst his eresponse zipped back within minutes victoria my beloved detective if i come home tomorrow will you faithfully promise to withdraw from every investigation where i worry about your safety a message which made me angrier because i knew he was righti was being manipulative not playing fair i needed to see him though touch him hear himlive not in cyberspace i took to wearing myself out running i certainly wore out the two dogs i share with my downstairs neighbor they started retreating to mr contrerass bedroom when they saw me arrive in my sweats despite my long runsid go ten miles most days instead of my usual five or sixi couldnt wear myself out enough to sleep i lost ten pounds in the six months after the trade center which worried my downstairs neighbor mr contreras took to frying up french toast and bacon when i came in from my runs and finally bullied me into going to lotty herschel for a complete physical lotty said i was fine physically just suffering as so many were from exhaustion of the spirit whatever name you gave it i only had half a mind for my work these days i specialize in financial and industrial crime it used to be that i spent a lot of time on foot going to government buildings to look at records doing physical surveillance and so on but in the days of the internet you traipse from website to website you need to be able to concentrate in front of a computer for long hours and concentration wasnt something i was good at right now which is why i was wandering around larchmont hall in the dark when my most important client asked me to look for intruders who might be breaking in there at night i was so eager to do something physical that i would even have scrubbed the crumbling stone benches around the houses ornamental pond darraugh graham has been with me almost since the day i opened my agency the new york office of his company continental united had lost three people in the trade center disaster darraugh had taken it hard but he was flinty chalklike in grief more moving than the bluster we were hearing from too many mouths these days he wouldnt dwell on his loss or the aftermath but took me to his conference room where he unrolled a detail map of the western suburbs i asked you here for personal reasons not business he snapped his middle finger onto a green splodge northwest of naperville in unincorporated new solway all this is private land big mansions belonging to old families out here you know the ebbersleys felittis and so on theyve been able to keep the land intactlike a private forest preserve this brown finger is where taverner sold ten acres to a developer back in seventytwo there was an uproar at the time but he was within his rights he had to meet his legal fees i think i followed darraughs long index finger as he traced a brown patch that cut into the green like a carrot east is a golf course south the complex where my mother lives at the best of times darraugh is a wintry distant man it was hard to picture him in normal situations like being born mothers ninetyone she manages on her own with help and anyway i dont wantshe doesnt want to live with me she lives in a development hereanodyne park town houses apartments little shopping center nursing home if she needs medical help she seems to like it shes gregarious like my sonsociability skips generations in my family his bleak smile appeared briefly ridiculous name for a development anodyne park offensive when you think about the alzheimers wing at the nursing homemother tells me the word means something like soothing or healing her condo overlooks the grounds of larchmont hall one of the grand mansions big grounds its been empty for a yearthe original owners were the drummond family the heirs sold the place three years ago but the new buyers went bankrupt felitti was talking about buying so he could keep more developers out of the area but so far thats fallen through he stopped i waited for him to get to the point which he is never shy about but when a minute went by i said you want me to find a plutocrat to buy the place so it doesnt get divided up for the merely affluent he scowled i didnt call you in for ridicule mother thinks she sees people going in and out of the place at night she doesnt want to call the police the police came out a couple of times but found no one the agent that manages the place for the holding company has a security system in place it hasnt been breached any of the neighbors seen anything point of the area vic neighbors dont see each other here are the houses and all this is hundred years worth of trees gardens so forth you could talk to the neighbors of course he snapped his finger on the map again showing me the distances but his tone was uncertainmost unlike him whats your interest in this darraugh are you thinking of buying the place yourself good god no he didnt say anything else but walked to the windows to look down at the construction on wacker drive i stared in bewilderment even when hed asked me to help his son beat a drug rap several years ago he hadnt danced around the floor like this mothers always been a law unto herself he muttered to the window of course people in herin ourmilieu always get better attention from the law than people likewell than others but shes affronted that the police arent taking her seriously of course its possible that she might be imaginingshes over ninety after allbut shes taken to calling me every day to complain about lack of police attention ill see if i can uncover something the police arent seeing i said gently his shoulders relaxed and he turned back to me your usual fee vic see caroline about your contract shell give you mothers details as well he took me out to his personal assistant who told him his conference call with kuala lumpur was waiting wed talked on a friday afternoon the dreary first day of march on saturday morning i made the first of what turned into many long treks to new solway before driving out i stopped in my office for my ordnance maps of the western suburbs i looked at my computer and then resolutely turned my back to it id already logged on three times since ten last night without word from morrell i felt like an alcoholic with the bottle in reach but i locked my office without checking my email and began the fortyfivemile haul to the land of the rich and powerful that westward drive always makes me feel like im following the ascent into heaven at least into capitalist heaven it starts along chicagos smoky industrial corridor passing old bluecollar neighborhoods that resemble the one where i grew uptiny bungalows where women look old at forty and men work and eat themselves to early heart attacks you move past them to the hardscrabble towns on the citys edgecicero berwyn places where you can still get pretty well beat up for a dollar then the air begins to clear and the affluence rises by the time i reached new solway i was practically hydroplaning on waves of stock certificates i pulled off at the tollway exit to examine my maps coverdale lane was the main road that meandered through new solway it started at the northwest corner of the township and made a giant kind of quarter circle opening on dirksen road at the southeast end at dirksen you could go south to powell road which divided new solway from anodyne park where geraldine graham was living i followed the route to the northwest entrance since that looked like the main one on the map i hadnt traveled fifty feet down coverdale lane before getting darraughs point neighbors couldnt spy on each other here horses grazed in paddocks orchards held a few desiccated apples from last fall with the trees bare a few mansions were visible from the road but most were set far behind imposing carriageways poorer folk might actually see each others driveways from their side windows but most of the houses sat on substantial property perhaps ten or twelve acres and most were old no new money here no mcmansions flashing their thirty thousand square feet on tiny lots after going south about a mile and a half coverdale lane bent into a hook that pointed east i followed the hook almost to its end before a discreet sign on a stone pillar announced larchmont hall i drove on past the gates to dirksen road at the east end of coverdale and made a loop south and west so i could look at the complex where darraughs mother was living i wanted to know if she really could see into the larchmont estate a hedge blocked any view into the new solway mansions from street level but ms graham was on the fourth floor of a small apartment building from that vantage she might be able to see into the property i returned to coverdale lane and drove up a winding carriageway to larchmont hall leaving the car where anyone could see it if they came onto the land i armed myself with that most perfect disguise a hard hat and a clipboard a hard hat makes people assume youre doing something with the airconditioning or the foundations theyre used to service in places like this they dont ask for credentials i hoped as i got my bearings i whistled under my breath the original owners had done things on a grand scale besides the mansion itself the property held a garage stables greenhouse even a cottage which i assumed was for the staff who tended the groundsor would tend the grounds if someone could afford to have the work done the estate agent wasnt putting much into maintenancean ornamental pond which lay between the mansion and the outbuildings was clogged with leaves and dead lilies i even saw a carp floating bellyup in the middle a series of formal gardens was overgrown with weeds while no one had mowed the meadows for some time the neglect and the number of buildings was oppressive if you were grandiose enough to buy such a place how could you possibly take care of it circling each building trying to see if there were holes in foundations or windows looked overwhelming i squared my shoulders whining doubles the job my mother used to say when i balked at washing dishes i decided to work from smallest to largest which meant inspecting the cottage first by the time id finished prying at windows balancing on fence posts to see if any of the roof glass of the greenhouse was broken and making sure that the doors to the stables and garage were not just secure but showed no recent signs of tampering it was past noon i was hungry and thirsty but dark still comes early the first week in march i didnt want to waste daylight searching for food so i grimly set about circling the house it was an enormous building from a distance it looked graceful vaguely federal in design with its slender columns and square facades but all i cared about was four floors worth of windows doors at ground level on all four sides doors leading off upperlevel balconiesa burglars paradise still all the windows on the two lower floors held the telltale markers of a security system i checked some on the ground floor with a meter but didnt see anyplace where the current was interrupted people did come onto the land beer bottles the silver foil from potato chip bags crumpled cigarette packs the inevitable condom told their tales maybe ms graham was only seeing local kids looking for privacy i was debating whether to shinny up the pillars to check the balcony doors when a squad car pulled up a middleaged cop came over to me at an unhurried gait you got some reason to be out here probably the same one you do i waved my meter toward the house im with florey and kapper the mechanical engineers we heard some woman thinks little green men are hovering around here in the night im just checking the circuits you set something off in the garage the cop said i smiled oh dear i was trying brute force they warned us against that at iit but i wanted to see if someone could actually lift those doors sorry to bring you out here for nothing not to worry you saved me from our eightythird call to look at suspicious mail its a hassle isnt it i said hoping he wouldnt ask for my id ive got friends in the chicago pd who feel stretched to the limit these days same out here weve got the reservoir and a bunch of power stations we have to keep an eye on its about time the fbi nailed this anthrax bastardwe waste an unbelievable amount of manpower responding to hysterical calls about letters from old aunt madge who forgot to put her return address on the envelope we hashed over the current situation the way everyone did these days police forces were badly affected because they had to gear up for incalculable terror attacks and couldnt keep up with their local crime loads driveby shootings which had dropped to their lowest level in decades had jumped in the last six months the cops cell phone rang he grunted into it id better be going you okay out here yeah im taking off too place looks clean to me except for the usual garbage i pointed a toe at an empty cigarette wrapper near the foundation i dont see how anyone could be using the place you find osama bin laden in the attic give me a call i could use the extra credit he waved goodbye and got back into his squad car i couldnt think of anything else to look for and anyway it was getting too dark to see clearly i walked to the edge of the gardens where they faded into a substantial woods and looked up at the house from here i could see the attic windows but they presented a blank face to the sky chapter the iron dowager i had to go through various security checkpoints to reach geraldine graham anodyne park was a wellgated community with a guard at the entrance who wrote down my license plate number and asked my business before phoning ms graham for permission to let me enter as i snaked along the curved road that suburban developers relish i saw that the complex was bigger than it appeared from the outside besides the town houses apartment buildings and a nursing home the size of a small hospital it held a little row of shops several golfing quartets undeterred by the dreary weather were leaving their carts outside a bar at the edge of the shops i ran into a grocery store designed like an alpine chalet for a bottle of overpriced water and a banana getting my blood sugar up would help me interview my clients mother when she opened the door i was disconcerted geraldine graham looked so much like her son that i could almost believe it was darraugh in the doorway dressed in rose silk she had his long face and prominent nose and eyes of the same frosty blue although hers were clouded now with age the only real difference was her hair over the years darraughs blond has bleached to white hers was dark a whitestreaked nutbrown that owed nothing to a bottle she held herself as ramrod straight as her son i pictured her mother tying her to a victorian backboard which she then passed on to darraugh it was only when geraldine graham moved away from the doorway and the light caught her face that i saw how deeply lined it was youre the young woman my son sent out to see who is breaking into larchmont hall eh she had the high fluting voice of deep age i wondered whether that policeman was going to arrest you but you seemed to talk your way out of it what made him arrive you were watching me maam the hobbies of the elderly peeping through windows prying into locks although i suppose my hobby is your livelihood im making a cup of tea i can offer you one or i have bourbon i know detectives are used to stronger beverages than tea i laughed thats only philip marlowe we modern detectives cant drink in the middle of the day it puts us to sleep she moved down the short hallway to her kitchen i followed and felt a stab of envy when i saw the doubledoor refrigerator and the porcelain cooktop my own kitchen was last remodeled two tenants back i wondered what it would cost to install an island cooktop like this one with sleek electrical burners that looked painted into the surface probably two years of mortgage payments ms graham saw me staring and said those are designed to keep the old from burning down the house they turn off automatically if theres no pan on them or after some minutes if you havent set a special timer although were told the old should burn and rave at the end of day when she slowly pushed a small stepladder into position to reach her tea bags i moved forward to help she waved me off with a brusqueness like her sons just because im old and slow doesnt mean the young and swift need muscle me away my son keeps wanting to install a housekeeper here so i can vegetate in front of the television or behind my binoculars as you can see wed be tripping over each other all day in this tiny space i was glad to give up all that nonsense when i moved out of the big house housekeepers gardeners you cant take a step without consulting someone elses feelings and timetables one of my old maids comes every day to tidy and prepare mealsand to make sure i havent died in the night thats enough intrusion she poured hot water over tea bags into slender porcelain mugs my mother would be shocked to see me use tea bags or to drink my tea out of a great mug even when she was ninety herself we had to get down the crown derby every afternoon mugs and tea bags feel like freedom but im never sure whether its freedom or laxity these cups with their goldleaf rims and intricate stencils werent exactly pacific gardens mission service when ms graham nodded at me to pick them up i could hardly get my fingers into their slender handles the tea scalded my fingers through the eggshellthin china following her slow tread down the hall to her sitting room felt like some kind of biblical ordeal involving furnaces if geraldine graham had been living in a mansion like those across the street the apartment might seem like tiny space but the sitting room alone was about the size of my whole apartment in chicago pale chinese rugs floated on the polished wood floor armchairs covered in straw satin straddled a fireplace in the middle of the wall but ms graham led me to an alcove facing larchmont hall where an upholstered chair stood next to a piecrust table this seemed to be where she lived books reading glasses her binoculars a phone covered most of the tabletop an oil painting of a woman in edwardian dress hung behind the chair i studied the face for a resemblance to my hostess and her son but it was the oval of a classic beauty only the coldness in the blue eyes made me think of darraugh my mother it was a great disappointment to her that i inherited my fathers looks she was considered the most beautiful woman in chicago when she was young with her deliberate motions geraldine graham moved the binoculars and glasses onto the books then placed coasters for our mugs settling herself in her chair she told me i might bring over one of those by the fireplace for myself her fluting voice started while i was still around the corner in the main part of the room i probably shouldnt have bought a unit facing the house my daughter warned me i would find it hard to see strangers in the place but of course i havent except for the few months that they could afford the payments a computer baron who melted like snow in last years business upheavals so humiliating for the children i always think when their horses are sold but since they left i havent seen anyone until these last few days nights i see nothing out of the ordinary during the day although my son hasnt said so he seems to think i have alzheimers at least i assume he does since he actually drove out to visit me thursday evening which is a rare occurrence i am not demented however i know what im seeing i saw you there this afternoon after all i ignored the end of her statement larchmont hall was your home darraugh didnt tell me that i was born in that house i grew up in it but neither of my children wanted the burden of looking after such a property not even to hold in trust for their own children of course my daughter doesnt live here shes in new york with her husband they have his familys property in rhinebeck but i thought darraugh might want his son to have the chance to live in larchmont he was adamant however and when darraugh has made up his mind he is as hard as any diamond why hadnt darraugh told me he grew up here anger at feeling blindsided distracted me from what she was saying what else had he concealed still i could see that looking after larchmont hall would be a fulltime job not something a widower wedded to his business would take on willingly i pictured darraugh in a daphne du maurier childhood learning to ride to hunt to play hideandseek in the stables perhaps its only bluecollar kids like me who imagine that youd feel nostalgia for such a childhood and find it hard to give up so you watch the place to see how its faring without you and youve noticed someone hanging around there not exactly she swallowed noisily and set the mug down on her coaster with a jolt that sprayed drops onto the wood when youre old you dont sleep long hours at a time i wake in the night i go to the bathroom i read a little and doze in my chair here perhaps a week ago she stopped to count backward on her fingers last tuesday it would be i was up around one i saw a light glow and go out at first i assumed it was a car on coverdale lane you cant see the lane from here but you can see the reflection of the headlights along the facades reflection along the facades her precise speech made her sound even more formidable than her commanding manner i stood at the window and cupped my hands around my eyes to peer through the wintry twilight across powell road i could just make out the hedge that shielded new solway from the vulgar larchmont hall lay on the far side in a direct line from where i was standing it was back far enough from the road that even in the dusk i could make out the whole house take the binoculars young woman they allow one to see in the dark even an old woman like me the binoculars were a lovely set of rigel compact optics with a nightvision feature usually used by hunters did you buy these so you could see in the dark maam i didnt buy them originally to spy on my old home if thats what youre asking my grandson mackenzie gave them to me when i still managed larchmont he thought they would be helpful to me since my vision was deteriorating and he was correct the glasses brought the dormers of the attic into sharp relief i couldnt make out great detail in the dark but enough to see the skylight cut into the steep roof the small windows underneath the eaves were uncurtained the main entrance where the local cop and i had both parked was to the left at right angles to the side facing anodyne park anyone coming onto the property from the road would be easy to spot from here if you were looking but if someone approached from the meadows at the rear they would be shielded from view by the stable and greenhouse i found empty bottles and so on when i was walking around i said still scanning the house for any signs of light or life people are clearly coming onto the property now that its vacant do you think thats who youre seeing oh i suppose working people feel a certain triumph in having sex on the old drummond grounds she said dismissively but i have seen lights flicker in the attic late at night the skylight is revealing of whats inside as well as whats out it was the servants common room when my mother managed larchmont as a child i used to go up there and watch the maids play poker she didnt know about their card games but children and servants are natural allies after mother died i shut up the attic and moved the remaining staff to the third floor i wasnt entertaining on a grand scale i didnt use those bedrooms or all those servants mother thought essential for running larchmont as if it were blenheim palace its been most odd to see those lights as if my mothers servants had returned to play poker up there my son assured me you were a competent investigator i do expect you to take my complaint seriously unlike our local police force after all my son is paying you i turned back to her laying the binoculars on the piecrust table did you or darraugh report this business to the titleholder or the estate agents theyd be the ones most concerned julius arnoff hes courteous but he doesnt quite believe me i realize that i no longer own the house she said but i still feel a keen interest in its wellbeing i told darraugh when the police were so unhelpful that i would prefer my own investigator who would owe me the necessity of reports which reminds me i dont believe you told me your name young woman darraugh did but ive forgotten it warshawski v warshawski oh these polish names theyre like eels sliding around the tongue what did my son tell me he calls you vic i will call you victoria will you write your phone number on this pad in large numbers i dont want to have to use a magnifying glass if i need to summon you in a hurry horrifying visions of ms graham feeling free to call me at three in the morning when she had insomnia or at odd moments during the day when loneliness overtook her made me give her only my office number my answering service would deflect her most of the time i hope darraugh hasnt exaggerated your abilities i will watch for you tonight i shook my head i cant stay out here tonight but ill be back tomorrow that didnt please her at all if her son was employing me it was my duty to work the hours that they set and if someone else hires me tomorrow should i drop my work for darraugh to respond to that clients demands i said the heavy lines around her nose deepened she tried to demand what obligation could possibly take precedence over her needs but i wasnt about to tell her to her credit she didnt waste a long time on argument when she saw i wasnt giving in but you will tell me personally what you find out i dont want to have to get reports from darraugh there are times when i wish he was more like his father her tone didnt make that sound like a compliment when i stood to leave she asked meordered reallyto take the cups back to the kitchen i turned them over before putting them in the sink coalport bone china mugs indeed i spent the drive to chicago going over her surprising remarks i wondered why darraugh hated larchmont so much i found myself constructing gothic scenarios darraugh was a widower perhaps his beloved wife had died there while his wastrel father absconded with darraughs wifes diamonds and his own secretary or perhaps darraugh suspected geraldine of drowning his wifeor even his fatherin the ornamental pond and had vowed never to set foot on drummond land again as i returned to the small bungalows of chicagos west side i realized the situation was probably something far less dramatic darraugh and his mother no doubt merely had the the usual frictions of any family whatever their history ms graham resented her sons failure to visit her as often as she wanted i wondered if phantom lights in the upper windows were a way of forcing darraugh to pay attention to her i foresaw the possibility of getting squeezed between these two strong personalities at least it beat fretting about morrell chapter hands across the water it was the thought of geraldine grahams binoculars that determined me to slide through the grounds around larchmont hall sunday night without showing a light or making the kind o ruckus id set up if i tripped and broke an ankle she had called once already during the day to make sure i was coming out i asked if shed seen her flickering lights the night before she hadnt she said but she didnt spend the whole night looking for them as i would just as i was stiffening at being treated like a hired hand she disarmed me saying even ten years ago i was still strong enough to spend the night looking for intruders i cant now i wore my nightprowlers costume black jeans dark windbreaker over a sweater black cap pulling my hair flat against my head charcoal on my cheeks to keep the moonlight from reflecting off my skin ms grahams eyes would have to be good to find me even with her rigel optics for tonights trip i parked on one of the residential streets on the northeast corner of the new solway township i walked the two miles south along dirksen the road that divided new solway from a golf course on its eastern boundary dirksen road didnt have any sidewalks the idea of people on foot apparently being beyond new solways budget or maybe their imagination i kept having to duck into a ditch to get out of the way of traffic when i finally reached the entrance to coverdale lane i was out of breath and peevish i leaned against one of the pervasive stone pillars to pick burrs out of my jeans once i left dirksen road i was enveloped in night the lights of the suburbsthe houses the streetlamps the relentless trafficfaded coverdale lane was far enough from the hedge that guarded new solway to block out both the streetlamps and the traffic beyond the dark silence made me feel untethered from the world the moon provided some light but clouds shrouded it making it hard to stay on the asphalt i kept veering into the weeds growing alongside the road id measured the distance from dirksen road to the mansion in my car yesterday morning twothirds of a mile about twelve hundred paces for me but i lost count after six hundred something and the dark distorted my sense of distance the night creatures moving about on their own errands began to loom large in my mind i froze at a rustling in the underbrush it stopped when i stopped but started again after a few minutes my palms grew wet on the flashlight as the rustling came closer i gripped the stock so i could use it as a weapon and switched the beam on at its narrowest focus a raccoon halted at the light stared at me for a full minute then sauntered back into the bushes with what seemed an insolent shrug of furry shoulders a few paces later larchmont hall suddenly appeared its pale brick making it loom like a ghostly galleon in the moonlight i used my own nightvision binoculars now but didnt see anyone in front of me i circled the outbuildings cautiously disturbing more raccoons and a fox but didnt see any people i picked my way to the edge of the garden where i could get a bit of a vantage point for the back of the house the attic windows were dark i perched on a bench to wait id been curious enough about darraughs family history to do a little research spending the afternoon in the chicago historical societys library where i pored over old society columns and news stories it felt soothing to be in a library handling actual pieces of paper with people around me instead of perching alone in front of a blinking cursor id learned a lot of local history but i wasnt sure how much of it illuminated darraughs life geraldine grahams grandfather had started a paper mill on the illinois river in which hed turned into a fortune before the century ended the drummond mills in georgia and south carolina once employed nine thousand people theyd shut most of those plants in the downturn of the last decade but still had one major mill going in georgia in fact i had once done some work down there for darraugh but he hadnt mentioned its ties to his mothers family drummond paper had merged with continental industries in the drummond name remained only on the paper division geraldines father had built larchmont for his wife in geraldine her brother stuart and a sister who died young had been born there the chicago american had reported on the gala around the housewarming where the taverners the mccormicks armors and other chicago luminaries had spent a festive evening the whole story was like one of those period pieces on public television your roving correspondent had to rove with a vengeance to get to the opening of larchmont hall riding the tram to the train and the train to its farthest reaches where a charabanc obligingly scooped her up along with the men delivering plants lobsters and all manner else of delightful edibles to adorn the fete she arrived perforce in advance of the more regal guests and had plenty of time to scope the grounds where tables and chairs were set up for taking tea alfresco dinner of course was served in the grand dining room whose carved walnut table seats thirty the tessellated entrance floor took the italian workers eight months to complete but it is worth the effort the green and sienna and palest ecru of the tiles forming a rich yet unobtrusive foretaste of the splendors within your correspondent peeped into mr drummonds study a most masculine sanctum redolent of leather with deep red curtains drawn across the mullioned windows so that the great man isnt tempted by the beauties of nature to abandon his important tasks of course the greatest beauty of all is within mrs matthew drummond nee miss laura taverner was the cynosure of all eyes when she appeared in her embroidered tulle over pale cornflower satin the gold chiffon tunic edged with rhinestones from worths own hands my dears as mrs drummonds maid whispered arrived last week from paris with a display of ostrich plumes and diamonds that were the envy of every other lady mrs michael taverner mrs drummonds sisterinlaw seemed almost to faint with misery when she saw how commonplace her rose charmeuse appeared of course mrs edwards bayard has a mind above dress as everyone who has seen that mauve bombazine a thousand times or so could testifyor perhaps her husbands extradomestic activities are funded from her clothes budget the coy correspondent recounted with a wealth of description the thirteen bedrooms the billiard room the music room where mrs drummonds spectacular performance on the piano held dinner guests spellbound the ornamental pool lined with blue clay and the three motorcars which mr drummond had installed in the new garage as we hear the english are calling the structure for housing these modern conveyances how very modern of old matthew drummond the garage which loomed to my right could hold six modern motorcars with room for a machine shop to repair them then as now vast wealth needed flaunting how else did others know you had it after reading about larchmonts wonders id searched various indices looking for news of geraldine i wanted actually to see who darraughs father had been or what had happened to engender the contempt in geraldines voice when she mentioned him it was more than idle curiosity i wanted to know what currents lay beneath my clients surface so i could avoid falling in them and getting swept away i found geraldines birth in a happy event as the language of a century ago put it a baby sister to keep little stuart drummond company the next report was of her comingout party in with other girls from the vina fields academy her poiret tulle gown was described in detail including the diamond chips bordering the front drapery apparently the crash in the market hadnt kept the family from pulling out all the stops after all some people did make money from the disastermaybe matthew drummond had been among them the next family news was a clip welcoming geraldine home from switzerland in the spring of this time in a white balenciaga suit looking interestingly thin after her recent illness i raised my brows at this was it tb or had laura taverner drummond hustled her daughter to europe to deal with an unwelcome pregnancy thered been a major depression on in the thirties but you wouldnt know that from the society pages descriptions of gowns costing five or even ten thousand dollars dotted the gossip columns money like that would have supported my fathers family in comfort for a year hed been nine in delivering coal in the mornings before school to help the family eke out a living after his father got laid off id never met my grandfather whose health deteriorated under the strain of not being able to support his family hed died in right after my parents were married no considerations like that marred geraldine drummonds wedding to mackenzie graham the ceremony was a noholdsbarred affair at fourth presbyterian church on north michigan avenueeight attendants two young ring bearers followed by a reception at the larchmont estate so lavish that i was surpised the mansion hadnt collapsed from the weight of the caviar the happy couple left for two months in south americathe european war precluded a french destination reading between the lines it sounded as though geraldine had been forcefed to the son of some business crony of her fathers her one brother stuart had died in a car wreck without leaving any children so geraldine was presumably the heir to all the drummond enterprises maybe matthew and laura drummond chose a soninlaw they thought could manage the family holdings or maybe laura had chosen someone she could control herselfin the wedding photos the bridegroom looked hunted and unhappy mackenzie graham stayed at larchmont hall until his death in tidy obituaries in all the papers death at home of natural causes which could mean anything from cancer to bleeding to death from a shooting accident maybe that was what had turned darraugh against larchmont seeing his father die here cold was seeping through my layers of jacket and sweatshirt despite the unsettling mildness of the weatherhere it was early march with no snow and no hard freeze all winterit was still too cold to sit for long i got up from the bench and backed up to the meadow so i could see the upper windows nothing i made another circuit of the building stubbing my toe on the same loose brick id hit the previous two times cursing i sat on a step by the pool and listened to the night around me for a time i heard only the skittering of night creatures in the underbrush beyond larchmonts perimeter every now and then a car would drive down coverdale lane but no one stopped a deer tiptoed across the lawn when it saw me move in the moonlight it bolted back across the meadow suddenly over the wind i heard a louder crashing in the undergrowth beyond the garage that wasnt a fox or raccoon adrenaline rushed through my body i jumped to my feet the crashing stopped had the newcomer seen me i tried to melt into the shrubbery lining the ornamental garden tried not to breathe after a moment i heard the whicking of feet on brick the newcomer had moved from dead leaves to walkway two feet not four a person who knew his way coming purposefully forward i dropped to my belly and slithered around the pool toward the house sticking to the paths so i wouldnt announce myself on dead leaves when i reached the shelter of a great beech i cautiously lifted my head straining at the shadows of the trees and bushes all at once a darker shadow appeared ectoplasmic limbs floating and wavering in the moonlight a slight figure with a backpack making a hump in the silhouette moving with the ease of youth i put my face back down in the turf so that moonlight wouldnt glint from the white of my nose the figure passed a couple of yards from my head but didnt pause when i heard him at the north wall of the house i got up and tiptoed after him he must have seen the movement reflected in the french doors because he whirled on his heel before he could bolt i was running full tilt tackling him around the knees he cried out and fell underneath my weight it wasnt a youth at all but a girl with a pale narrow face and dark hair pulled back into a long braid her skin gave off the sour sweat of fear i rolled away from her but kept a strong grip on her shoulder when she tried to break away i tightened my hold what are you doing here i demanded what are you doing here she hissed terrified but fierce our breath made little white puffs in the night air im a detective im following up a report of housebreakers oh i see you work for the pigs fear muted her scorn that insult was old when i was your age are you patty hearst stealing from your fellow robber barons to give to the terrorists or joan of arc rescuing the nation the moon was riding high in the sky now its cold light shone on the girl turning her soft young face to marble she scowled at my mockery but didnt rise to the bait im minding my own business why dont you mind yours are you the person whos flashing a light in this house in the middle of the night its hard to read expressions in the moonlight but i thought she looked startled even afraid and she said quickly i came here on a dare the other kids thought i was too chicken to go through this big deserted place at night and theyre lurking on the perimeter to see you make good on your word try another story you dont have any right to question me im not breaking any law thats true not yet anyway although it looked as though breaking and entering was going to be your next step is this where you and your boyfriend come to make out her eyes squinched shut in disgust are you with the sex police if i want to fuck my boyfriend ill do it in comfort at home not squirreling around in some abandoned attic so you know that the light is coming from the attic thats interesting she gasped but rallied you said it was the attic no i said the house but you and i both know you know whats going on in here so lets not dance that dance her soft mouth puckered into a scowl im not breaking any laws so let me go then i wont sue you for assaulting me youre too young to sue me yourself but i suppose your parents will do it for you since you came on foot youre probably from one of these mansions i suppose youre like all the other rich kids ive ever met so overindulged you never have to take responsibility for anything you do that did rouse her i am responsible she shouted she wriggled out of my slackened grasp and rolled over i grabbed at her arm but only got her backpack a furry wad came loose in my hands as she wrenched herself free she sprinted through the opening to the gardens i jumped up after her stuffing the furry thing into my jeans as i ran as i crashed through the garden she disappeared around the pond heading for the woods behind the outbuildings i charged up the path and tripped again on the loose brick i was going too fast to catch my balance i flapped my arms desperately trying to keep upright but tumbled sideways into the water weeds and leaves clogged the surface the water was only five feet deep but i panicked terrified that i wouldnt be able to push my head through the tangled roots when i finally broke through the rotting mass i was several yards from the edge i was freezing my clothes so heavy with the brackish water that they pinned me like an iron shroud my feet slipped on the clay bottom and i grabbed at the plants to stay upright instead my numb fingers closed around clammy flesh one of the dead carp i backed away in disgust so fast i fell over again as i righted myself i realized it wasnt a fish id seized but a human hand chapter once more unto the pokey dear friends i worked my way around to the head it was a man weighted down by his clothes kept on the surface only by the tangle of weeds underneath him i thrust my arm under his armpits and started dragging him holding his head out of the water in case he wasnt really dead my feet kept slipping on the clay bottom pulling his waterlogged weight through that muck made my heart hammer after some enormity of time i managed to haul him to the pools edge the water was half a foot below the pools perimeter i took a deep breath squatted in the rank plants and did a dead lift to get him out my arm and leg muscles burned with fatigue my own legs weighed about a ton each now i lay my torso across the marble tiles surrounding the pool and managed to swing my legs over the side my teeth were chattering so violently that my whole body shook i lay on the sharp stone for a minute but i couldnt afford to stay here i was remote from help id die of cold if i didnt move i got to my hands and knees and crawled to the man i rolled him onto his back and cleaned the weeds out of his mouth and undid his tie and pushed on his chest and blew cold trembly gusts into his mouth and after five minutes he was still as dead as hed been when id clutched his hand in the water by now i was so cold i felt as though someone was slicing my skull with knives i pried the zipper of my windbreaker open and dug my cell phone out of one of the pockets i couldnt believe my luck the little screen blinked its green lights at me and i was able to connect to the emergency network the dispatcher had trouble understanding me my teeth were chattering so loudly larchmont hall could i identify that the first house you came to off the dirksen road entrance to coverdale lane could i turn on my car lights or the house lights so the emergency crew could find me id come on foot just what was i doing there just tell the new solway cops to come to larchmont hall i croaked theyll find it i severed the connection and looked wistfully at the house behind me maybe the dotcom millionaires had forgotten a bathrobe or even a kitchen towel when they left i was halfway to the house when i realized that this would be my one chance alone with the dead man larchmont hall was sealed like fortress america without tools with my hands frozen id be lucky to have a door open before the cops arrived but id have enough time to look for some id on the body i found my flashlight near the french doors where id wrestled with the girl i took it back with me to the dead man was this my teenagers boyfriend despite her smart remark about the sex police were they meeting in the abandoned housesomehow bypassing the security system maybe he hadnt made tonights rendezvous because hed tripped over the same brick id stumbled on fallen into the pond and hadnt been able to fight free of the weeds he hadnt tried to take off his shoes or his clothes id undone his tie and unbuttoned his shirt to give him cpr but he had on a suit belt fly button and zipper were all tidily done up the suit looked as though it had been a good one a brown wool basket weave hed been wearing wing tips not an outfit for the woods at night i moved my flashlight along the length of his body he was about six feet tall lean not particularly athletic looking his skin was a nutbrown his hair african which might explain the need for secret meetings in an abandoned house or maybe it was his agehe looked to be in his thirties i could picture the girl attracted to an affair with an africanamerican the need to do something dramatic something daring was clearly strong in her who was he who would meet his end in such a remote and dreadful way i dug gingerly into the pockets like my own they had clammed shut from the weight of the water i had a hard job of it as cold as i was and i wasnt rewarded with much when i finished there was nothing in his jacket or his front trouser pockets but a handful of change i gritted my teeth and stuck my hand under his buttocks the back pockets were empty too except for a pencil and a matchbook no one in the modern age goes out in a suit and tie without a wallet or at least a drivers license but where was his car had he done like me parked two miles away and come on foot for a secret rendezvous my head was aching so with cold i couldnt think clearly but id have been bewildered even if i were warm and dry i know people drown in their baths in panic and i myself had had a moments terror when i couldnt get my head through those weeds but why had he left all his papers at home had he come here on purpose to die was this some dramatic event planned for my teenager come out in the open about me or ill kill myself he looked in repose like a steady man not the person for such dramatic actions it was hard to picture him as romeo to my young heroines juliet when the emergency crew arrived i was still holding his matchbook and pencil i stuck them into my own jacket pocket so i wouldnt be caught in the act of stripping the body besides a fire department ambulance the dispatcher had sent both the new solway cops and the dupage county sheriffs police the body had turned up in unincorporated new solway that technically meant it belonged to the dupage county sheriff but the dispatcher had also notified the new solway police even in my frozen state i could understand why the houses along coverdale lane were a whos who of greater chicago big money new solway cops would want an inside track on who to blame if the local baronsor baronessesgot testy the two groups jockeyed for dominance in inspecting the body they wanted to know who i was and what i was doing there through my chattering teeth i told them my name but said i couldnt talk until i was some place warm the two forces bickered for another long minute while i shivered uncontrollably then compromised by letting the new solway police ride along while the sheriffs deputies took me to wheaton my god you stink the sheriffs deputy said when i climbed into his squad car thats just the rotting vegetation i muttered im clean inside he wanted to open the windows to air out the smell but i told him if i ended up with pneumonia id see he footed the medical bills you have a blanket or an old jacket or something in the trunk i added im wet and freezing and your pals waiting for the shift change so they wouldnt have to take the call didnt help any its been over forty minutes since i phoned yeah bastards he said then cut off the rest of the sentence annoyed with me for voicing his grievance he stomped around to the trunk and fished out an old towel it couldnt be any dirtier than i was i draped it around my head and was asleep before the car left the yard when we got to the sheriffs headquarters in wheaton i was so far gone i didnt wake up until some strong young deputy yanked me out of the backseat and braced me on my feet i stumbled into the building joints stiff in my clammy clothes wake up sleeping beauty the deputy snapped you need to tell us what you were doing on private property out here not until im clean and dry i mumbled through cracked and swollen lips you must have some clothes out here i can borrow the deputy whod brought me in said that was highly irregular they didnt treat housebreakers like hotel guests in dupage county i sat on a bench and began undoing the zipper on my windbreaker a chunk of some dead plant had worked its way around the pull my fingers were thick with cold and i worked slowly while the deputy stood over me wanting to know what in hell i thought i was doing the zipper took all my attention when i finally had the jacket undone i pulled off the wet sweater underneath i was starting to take off my bottom layer a tshirt when he grabbed my shoulder and yanked me back to my feet what are you doing what it looks like taking off my wet clothes you cant do that out here you produce some id and some reason for being on private property in the middle of the night by now a number of other officers including a couple of women had joined him i looked past him and said to them darraugh graham asked me to check on larchmont hall you know the old drummond estate where his mother lived until the year before last its been standing empty and she thought she was seeing housebreakers i found a dead man in the pool behind the house and got thoroughly soaked pulling him out and thats all i can say until i get clean and dry and how you planning on proving that story my deputy sneered one of the women gave him a sour look be your age barney you never heard of darraugh graham come along she added to me my eyes were swelling with the onset of a head cold i squinted at her badge s protheroe protheroe led me to the womens locker room where i toweled myself dry she even dug up an old set of uniform trousers and a sweatshirt a size or two too big on me but clean we keep spares out here for officers whove been through the wringer you can sign for em on your way out and get em back to us in the next week you want to tell me your name and what you were really doing out here i pulled on clean socks and looked with disgust at my shoes the tiled floor was cold but my shoes would have been worse i sat on the locker room bench and told her my name my relationship to darraugh his mothers belief that there were intruders in her old home my fruitless surveillanceand the body id stumbled on i dont know why i didnt feed her my young juliet native caution maybe or maybe because i like ardent young women i dug my wallet out of my windbreaker and showed her my pi license fortunately walled in laminate protheroe handed it back to me without comment except to say the states attorney would want some formal statement about finding the dead man when she saw me rolling my foul clothes into a bundle she even found a plastic bag in a supply cupboard protheroe took me to a room on the second floor and called someone on her cell phone lieutenant schorr will be along in a minute you do much work out here no well i know the cook county sheriffs office is a cesspool of democratic patronage and favors out here its different out here its a cesspool of republican patronage so dont mind the boys theyre not all real well trained lieutenant schorr arrived with a couple of male sidekicks and a woman who announced she was vanna landau the assistant states attorney one of the new solway police officers had stayed for the meeting as well a fifth man came hurrying in a minute later straightening the knot in his tie he was introduced as larry yosano a member of the law firm that had handled larchmonts saleapparently a very junior member thanks stephanie schorr dismissed my guide she gave me a discreet thumbsup and left i was used to chicago police interrogation rooms with their scarred tables and peeling paint and where strong disinfectants dont quite cover the traces of vomit stephanie protheroe had brought me to something like a modern boardroom with a television and camcorder ruling over blond furniture behind the modern facade though the smell of disinfectant and stale fear rose to greet me like an unwelcome neighbor vanna landau the asa was a small woman who leaned across the table as if trying to make herself bigger by taking up as much room as possible now just what were you doing on the land in between coughs and sneezes i explained in as mild a voice as i could summon spying on larchmont hall in the middle of the night landau said that is trespassing at a minimum i pinched the skin between my eyebrows in an effort to stay awake would it have been better if id done it in daylight geraldine graham was worried when she saw intruders around the house late at night at her sons request i went over to take a look larry yosano the young lawyer was trying to rub sleep out of his own eyes technically of course its trespass but if youve ever dealt with mrs graham youd know that shes never really acknowledged that she no longer owns larchmont shes a strong personality difficult to say no to he turned to me lyons trust is the titleholder theyre he ones you should call if mrs graham sees a problem with the property i didnt say anything except to ask for a kleenex one of the deputies found some paper napkins in a drawer and tossed them across the table at me or the police lieutenant schorr said did that ever occur to you ms private eye ms graham called the new solway police several times they thought she was a crazy old woman making stuff up the new solway cop whose name i hadnt heard bristled we went out there three times and saw nothing yesterday when someone really was on the property we responded to the alarm within fifteen minutes her own son even says she could be making stuff up because she wants attention i sat up at that i met with ms graham yesterday afternoon she didnt strike me as delusional at all i know shes old but if she says shes seeing lights in that house she is what about the man in the pool if nothing else him being there proves someone was using that abandoned estate for something i dont think mrs graham makes things up yosano agreed but she doesnt listen to advice we for instance advised her to move away from new solway when she sold but her ties to the community are very deep of course i had a picture of the hapless dotcom millionaire fending off geraldine grahams efforts to help him run larchmont the way her mother had done the young states attorney seemed to feel the interview was slipping away she demanded to know my relationship to the dead man we kissed once very deeply i waited until one of the deputies had eagerly written this down before adding when i was doing cpr on him his mouth was full of the crud in the pool and i had to clean that out first did you get that need me to spell any of the words so you dont admit to knowing him vanna landau said the verb admit makes it sound like you think knowing him is a crime i sneezed again does that mean you know who he is some dupage county career criminal whom it would be dangerous to admit knowing black guy on the land what else was he but a criminal one of the deputies snickered to his fellow i reached across the table and ripped a sheet from the states attorneys legal pad let me just write this last comment down word for word to make sure i have the quote exactly right when i call the heraldstar tomorrow black guy on the land what else was he but a criminal right barney why dont you and teddy go get us some coffee while we wrap this up schorr said to his deputies when they had left he pulled the paper away from me and balled it up its late were all pretty tired and not using our best minds on this problem lets just go over a few last questions and let you get back to chicago where you belong do you or do you not know who the dead man is i never saw him until tonight i cant add anything to this discussion you have any prelimary report from the me i could feel a sore throat rising up my tonsils schorr and the asa exchanged looks she pursed her lips but picked up the phone at her end of the table she had a brisk conversation with one of the me techs and shook her head even under the cold light of the dupage county morgue no one had found any clues id overlooked youll run a photo in the papers and on the news right i said to the asa and a full autopsy including dental impressions we know our job out here she said stiffly just asking i wouldnt want to think that because he was a black man you wouldnt put your best effort into cause of death and so on you dont need to worry about that schorr said the fake good humor in his voice not masking the anger in his face you go on home and leave this investigation to us when i told him where id left my car he gave an exaggerated sigh and said he supposed one of the deputies could drive me but id have to wait in the front hall my hamstrings had stiffened while we sat i stumbled on my way out of the room larry yosano the young lawyer caught my arm to keep me from falling when i thanked him i wondered why hed joined our happy band tonight he yawned im the junior on call for difficult problems this week we handle affairs for most of the estates in new solway we have keys so if the lieutenant had wanted to get into the house i could have let him in in fact when they called me i drove over to larchmont but your group had already left for here i took some time to check the alarm it hadnt been set off and its still functioning i had a quick look around the ground floor but there wasnt any sign of an intruder he yawned more widely i wish lyons trusttheyre the titleholderswould find a buyer its not good to have a place like that standing empty we advised hiring a caretaker but the bank didnt want to spend the money deputy protheroe the woman whod given me my dry clothes appeared shed been elected to drive me yosano walked out with us before climbing into his bmw he gave me a card i squinted at it through my swollen eyes he was an associate with lebold arnoff offices in oak brook and lasalle street id never heard of them but i dont often have to deal with the property issues of the superrich give geraldine graham my number the next time she calls yosano said ill try to talk her out of more private surveillance at larchmont my cards were gummed together in my wallet i wrote my office number on a scrap of paper for him you awake enough to get that car of yours home protheroe asked when we reached the mustang i dont want to be called out in half an hour to scrape your body off the tollway theres a motel up the road maybe youd better check in for whats left of the night i knew i was tired enough to be at risk behind the wheel but i was feeling so rotten that i wanted my own bed i summoned a travesty of bravado sketching a twofingered salute and a smile the dashboard clock read threefifteen when i pointed my little mustang toward the city chapter stochastic excursion i was in a cave looking for morrell someone had handed me a wailing infant i was hunched over trying to get out of the way of massive roots that pushed down through the rocks the air was so bad i couldnt breathe the rocks themselves were squeezing the air out of me the infant howled more loudly next to me lay the body of a black man in a brown weave suit dead from the bad air a buzzing in the distance meant an airraid warning from far away i could hear planes whining overhead the howling of the planes the wailing of the infant finally forced me awake the phone and downstairs doorbell were ringing simultaneously but my head cold left me too groggy to bestir myself i didnt even stick out a hand for the phone but rolled over onto my side hoping to relieve the pressure in my sinuses i was startled to see the clock read twoforty id slept the whole day away i tried to raise a sense of urgency about the man id found last night or about the girl id tackled but i couldnt manage it i was just drifting back to sleep when someone pushed the buzzer right outside my thirdfloor door three insistent hoots and then i heard a key in the lock that meant one thing mr contreras who has keys to my place with strict orders to save them for emergencieswhich he and i define very differently i couldnt deal with him while flat on my back by the time his heavy tread sounded in my hall id pulled on a sweatshirt and the pants id borrowed from dupage county last night he started talking before he got to the bedroom door doll you okay your cars out front and you aint been out all day but mr graham he just sent over a messenger with a letter for you when you didnt even come to the door i got kinda worried yeah im okay my voice sounded like poes raven after a night mainlining chloroform you sick doll what happened to you it was on the news you being out in wherever diving into a pond after a dead guy you have pneumonia or what the dogs pelted down the hall and circled around me with delighted yips all was forgiven in the three days since id last forcemarched them down lake michigan to the loopthey were ready for action i fondled their ears just a cold i didnt get home until four this morningbeen sleeping scuse minute i snuffled down to the bathroom blenching at the sight of my face in the mirror i looked worse than i sounded my eyes were puffy i had a bruise across my cheekbone and more on my arms and legs i hadnt noticed banging myself up so badly when i was hefting bodies around the larchmont estate last night i turned the hot water on in the shower and steamed myself for a few minutes when i emerged clean and thankfully dressed in my own clothes my neighbor had produced a large mug of tea with lemon and honey unlike geraldine grahams gilt eggshells mine were real mugs thick clunkyand cheap when i heard the news them saying youd been brought in to dupage county for questioning about this dead man i thought maybe youd been arrested you been fighting you got some case thats gonna kill you and you aint said nothing to me his brown eyes were bright with hurt nothing like that when id croaked out enough explanation to satisfy him he suddenly remembered darraughs letter the blistering prose raised welts on my fingers i have been trying to reach you all day to find out why you sent the police to my mother without informing me first since you arent answering your phone or email i am sending this by hand call immediately on receipt of this message how nice to be the man in charge and bulldoze your way through people as if they were construction sites i checked in with my answering service christie weddington the operator ive known longest answered is that really you vic just to be safe id better do our security check what was your mothers maiden name when id spelled sestieri she added severely when youre going to hole up can you let us know now that mary louise has left your company you dont have any backup person to call for emergencies we got like eleven calls from darraugh grahams office and five from murray ryerson darraugh or his pa caroline had started in at ten and kept it up every half hour geraldine graham had phoned four times herself the first time at a quarter of ten so the dupage sheriff had been to see her by nine at least they were taking it seriously murray had called early before eight presumably when hed looked at the morning wires i got back to him first in case he knew something that would help me in my conversation with darraugh murray was indignant that i hadnt called him when the blood was fresh enough to lick have they idd the guy yet i croaked into his barrage of questions you sound like a frog in a cheese grater warshawski so far the dupage sheriff is clueless i gather theyre running your john does prints through afis and theyve put his picture on the wires they have a cause of death i wheezed he drowned what were you doing warshawski turning up so pat minutes after the guy plunged to his watery death you should write for the enquirer with prose like that you drive out to larchmont no one could plunge to a watery death in five feet of water either he did like me tripped and fell or a coughing fit interrupted me mr contreras leaped up to pour me more tea and to mutter that murray was an inconsiderate jerk keeping me talking when i was sick or he went in on purpose or he was put there murray finished for me whats your theory did it look as though hed struggled i shut my eyes trying to remember the body as id found it i only had my flashlight to augment the moon so i cant say whether he had unusual bruises or scratches but his clothes were tidyno undone buttons and his tie was still neatly knotted i undid it when i was trying cpr cross your heart you never saw him before murray demanded hope to die i coughed so you didnt go out there to meet him no i was getting impatient hes what professor wright used to call a stochastic excursion in my physics class then what about the warshawski excursion murray asked what were you doing in the land of hope and glory catching the cold of a lifetime i hung up as a cough started racking me again you oughta go back to bed cookie mr contreras fussed over me you cant talk you wont have any voice at all you keep at it that ryerson he just uses you street runs both ways i choked i have to call darraugh darraugh interrupted a meeting on the fate of his georgia paper division to take my call mother had the police with her this morning that must have pleased her i said excuse me the frost in his voice turned the phone to dry ice against my ear she likes people to attend to her you dont visit her enough the cops didnt respond when she told them about intruders in your boyhood home now shes gotten the attention she thinks is her due you should have reported to me at once when you found a dead man at the house i dont pay you to leave me in the dark darraugh youre right my words came out with annoying slowness the way they do when you dont have a throat hear how i sound i got this way falling into your pool after hauling out a dead man futilely trying cpr spending two hours with the sheriffs deputies in wheaton it was threethirty am i could have called you at home then but i went to bed instead where i regret that i slept through ringing phones sirens doorbells and atom bombs i wish i werent so human but there you have it who was that man and what was he doing at the house darraugh barked after a moments silencehe wasnt going to agree that i had mitigating circumstances on my side but he wasnt going to go for my jugular any more right now eitherfrom him a concession i repeated what little information murray had given me then said why didnt you tell me larchmont was your boyhood home darraugh paused another moment before saying abruptly he was in an important meeting but he wanted me to report to him at once if i learned who had died in the pool and why hed been there you want me to investigate i asked give it a few hours not until your voice is better no ones going to take you seriously when you sound like this thanks darraugh chicken soup for the pis soul i said but hed already hung up just as well he has plenty of options among the big security companies that handle most of his heavymuscle jobs he stays with me not because he likes to support small businesses but because he knows there will be no leaks out of my tiny operationi get the jobs that he wants total confidentiality for but if he got fed up enough hed take the work elsewhere when mr contreras finally left with the dogs i lay down on the couch i didnt go back to sleepi actually felt better after being on my feet for a bit i put on an old lp of leontyne price singing mozart and watched the shadows change on the ceiling i had one little bit of information that no one else did the teenage girl it wasnt only a wish to keep a hole card although of course i wanted one but that her spunk and ardor reminded me of my own youth i felt protective of her the way you do of your childhood i wanted to find her on my own before deciding whether the cops or reporters ought to have a crack at her i assumed she lived in one of the coverdale lane estates i tried to imagine a strategy for going doortodoor looking for her i was her scoutmaster coming to collect her girl scout cookie sales money i was looking for my lost borzoi id found emerald earrings when i was jogging and wanted to restore them to the owner perhaps i could check the area high school although who knows where people in mansions like those in new solway send their children not only that id only seen the girl briefly by moonlight i wasnt sure id recognize her again let alone be able to describe her i shut my eyes and tried to conjure her face but all i remembered was her long braid and the soft cheeks of youth the planes or lines that might show character not yet formed had she said anything that might lead me to her i was a pig shed bet with some of the other kids she knew someone was in the attic what had i said that got her so mad shed run away something about not taking responsibility for and then i remembered the little thing that had come loose in my hand when she jerked free i had stuffed it into my jeans pocket and my jeans were in the garbage bag the sheriffs deputy had given me id dumped the bag in the front hall when i came in this morning with a ginger hand i fished out the damp mudcaked pants rotted leaves and threads of plant roots fell away when i shook them out i had a feeling i was lucky be too congested to smell them i had to pry the pocket flap open and pull the whole pocket inside out to get the thing id torn from my teenagers backpack it was black with mud when i ran it under the kitchen tap for a few minutes the mud washed off to show an ancient teddy bear the last few years its become kind of a fetish with kids putting the toys of early childhood on their backpacks or binders a high school senior had told me that the coolest kids use ratty crib toys wannabes buy them new so my girl was cool or aspired to be this little guy was missing both his eyes and even without a night in my muddy pocket his fur had been pretty forlorn worn down to the nub in places the distinguishing feature of the bear was a tiny green sweatshirt with gold letters on it at first i thought it was a green bay packers shirt which would only narrow my search to the million packer fans in the chicagomilwaukee corridor but then i saw the tiny v and f monogrammed around a minuscule stick the vina fields academy vina fields academy used to be a girls school when geraldine graham had gone there where theyd learned french dancing and flirting since turning coed in the seventies its not only become the most expensive private school in the city but an important academic one the stick on the teddy bears little shirt was supposed to be the candle or lighthouse or whatever the school uses to illustrate that its a beacon of light i only know all this because i see a lifesized version of the sweatshirt every time i go into la llorona on milwaukee avenue the owner mrs aguilar wasnt noticeably proud of her daughter celine getting a scholarship to attend vina fields she only had one entire wall papered with her yearbook photos from sixth grade on along with pictures of celine with the school field hockey team celine accepting the top prize in mathematics for her class three years running and the sweatshirt i hadnt eaten for almost twentyfour hours i might as well drive down there for some of mrs aguilars chicken soup with tortillas chapter neighborhood joint back when i signed a sevenyear lease for my part of a warehouse at the south end of bucktown the surrounding neighborhood was chiefly hispanic with a handful of starving artists who needed cheap rent two taquerias within half a block of my front door served fresh tortillas past midnight and i had my choice of palm readers this evening as i drove south and west toward my office all i could see was old sixflats like mine coming down and new town houses going up strip malls with identical arrays of starbucks wireless companies and home renovation chains were replacing factories and storefronts as if the affluent were afraid to take chances on neighborhood places the taquerias are a memory now i have to walk almost a mile farther south for the nearest good tostada of course tenants like me are one reason the neighborhood is changing but that doesnt make me any happier about it especially when i figure what my next round of lease negotiations will look like i drove past my office without stopping although i could see lights in the tall windows on the north side my lease partner tessa reynolds was working late on a sculpture a few blocks south of our building milwaukee avenue narrows to model t width making for congestion at all hours of the day i parked at the first meter i came to and walked the last two blocks to la llorona threading my way through the kinds of crowds that i knew from my south side childhood wornout women with litters of children straggling around them were stopping in the markets for dinner or fingering clothes on the racks set out on the sidewalk boys darted in and out of the noisy narrow bars and i saw a girl of about eight slip a hair clip off a table and into her pocket when i got to la llorona some six or seven women were talking to mrs aguilar while she packed up their families dinner celine was at the cash register her redbrown hair swept up in a ponytail she was working math problems in between ringing up purchases buenos dias senora aguilar i croaked when mrs aguilar glanced over at me buenos dias senora victoria she called back youre sick no what you need a bowl of soup celine chica bring soup okay celine sighed in the manner of all beleaguered teenagers but she ducked smartly under the counter to fill a big bowl for me while i waited i glanced at her book differential equations for math sat students a snappy title i sat at one of three hightopped tables that were stuck in the far corner of the storefront drinking the soup slowly when the shop was empty of other customers i listened to mrs aguilars endless fret about her bad back and her rotten landlord who was raising her rent but refused to fix the leaking pipe that had shut her store down for two days last week he want to make it so i go away then he take down the building and make condos or something she was probably right so i didnt do anything but commiserate i finally managed to steer the conversation to mrs aguilars thirdfavorite topic celines education i asked if she had a current yearbook for vina fields mrs aguilar came around in front of the counter and pulled it out from the drawer underneath the cash register field hockey i dont understand this game but at this school it is important and celine is the best celine squirmed and moved with her equations to one of the high tables when another handful of customers came in i took the yearbook with me to my table asking for a refill on the soup dont get no food on that victoria mrs aguilar admonished me as she ducked underneath the countertop and returned to her skillets i started going through the class pictures seniors first so many freshfaced selfconfident girls so many with long dark hair and arrogant poise i stopped at each such face trying to match it to last nights phantom i didnt think it had been alex dewhurst favorite sport showing horses favorite singers nsync or rebecca caudwell who loved figure skating and wanted to become an attorney although both were possible what are you looking for id been so absorbed i didnt notice celine shutting down the till and coming to stand next to me senora aguilar was scrubbing down her counters time to pack up i ran into one of your classmates when i was on a job last night she dropped something valuable but i dont know her name what does she look like long dark braid kind of narrow face celine offered to take the found item with her to school and post a notice on their inhouse webboard but i told her the girl probably wouldnt want the circumstances of her loss publicized when i finished the seniors and moved on to the juniors i saw my juliet almost at once her eyes were serious despite the half smile the photographer had coaxed from her and tendrils from her french braid were spiraling around her soft cheeks as if shed been too impatient to comb her hair just for a picture catherine bayard who loved sarah mclachlans music whose favorite sport was lacrosse and who hoped to be a journalist when she grew up she probably would be bayard and publishing the two words go together in chicago like capone and crime i didnt linger on catherines facei didnt want celine alerting her at school the next day instead i shrugged as if giving up the search as a bad job celine eyed me narrowly girls who work advanced calculus problems find adults like me tiresomely easy to solve she knew id spotted someone but maybe she couldnt tell who it was before giving the book back i looked at the faculty section the director was a woman named wendy milford who had the strong expression principals put on to make you think their young charges dont terrify them i asked celine to point out her field hockey coach and memorized the names of a math and history teacher you never know i closed the book and handed it to her with money for my soup three dollars for two bowlsyou wouldnt find that in or mauve or whatever trendy name youd see on whatever bistro ultimately muscled la llorona out of business i stopped in my office on my way home tessa had left for the day and the building was dark it was also dankly cold tessa mainly wrestles large pieces of steel into towering constructions work which makes her sweat enough to keep the furnace at sixty i turned up my thermostat and sat bundled in my coat while i brought my system up calvin bayard one of the heroes of my youth id developed a huge crush on him when he addressed my con law class at the university of chicago with his magnetic smile his easy command of first amendment issues his ready wit in answering hostile questions hed seemed in a different world than my professors after his lecture id gone to the library to read his testimony before the house committee on unamerican activities which had made me glow with pride illinoiss own congressman walker bushnell whod been a leading member of the house unamerican activities committee had hounded bayard for most of and but bayards testimony made bushnell sound like a smallminded voyeur he had walked away from the hearings without ratting out his friends and without facing prison time and despite the fact that many of his writers were blacklisted bayard publishing had grown throughout the fifties and sixties my law school had been a conservative place a number of students had written angry letters to the dean about being subjected to one more liberal but id been so enthusiastic id even applied for an internship at the bayard foundation on south dearborn i only got to see the great man twice that summerin company with a few dozen other people i hadnt made the final cut for a permanent job which hurt deeply at the time id ended up with my third choice the public defenders office after all this time i didnt remember a lot of details about bayard publishing itself i knew calvin bayard had been the person who moved it from a religious publishing house to doing secular booksthe kind of books that got him in trouble with congress and there was some business about his supporting civil rights groups which huac perceived as communist fronts i pulled up lexisnexis and scanned the companys history it had been founded by calvins greatgrandparentsevangelical congregationalists whod come west in the s from andover massachusetts to start a bibleandtract publishing house calvin had taken over the company in a boy wonder twentythree years old hed published their first nonreligious novel in tale of two countries by armand pelletier whod died in poverty in after years of blacklisting kept him out of print that wasnt in the nexis reportit was just one of those things i remembered i counted on my fingers calvin bayard must be around ninety now if catherine bayard was part of that family she would likely be a granddaughter i turned to nexiss personal search section calvin and renee genier bayard had five addresses including one on coverdale lane in new solway of course id read about mrs edwards bayard in the article about the gala opening of larchmont hall shed been the one with a mind above clothes so last night catherine had slipped through the woods between coverdale lane and larchmont hall and had kiown exactly how to find her way back in the dark i copied down the address and another one on banks street along chicagos gold coast the family also maintained residences in london new york and hong kong i wrote those down too although if catherine had fled that far i couldnt afford to go after her the record included everyone who made their home at coverdale lane there seemed to be a staff of seven in residence i added their names to my list and looked more closely at the bayard family renee was twentysome years younger than calvin theyd married in right after his triumphal downing of bushnell they had one son a man with three last names edwards genier bayard born in fiftyeight living in washington i rubbed my sore eyes why was edwards in dc while his daughter catherine was here and if catherine had a mother why wasnt she in the file the screen offered no answers i returned to the company reports bayard publishing was still closely held it didnt approach the size of aol time warner or random house in the book world but it wasnt that far behind them either besides the publishing house that made up its core business it held a thirty percent share in an online company an audio label called new lion a bunch of magazines and a part interest in drummond paper i leaned forward as if i could dive into the files in front of me drummond paper had been started by geraldine grahams grandfather i guess it wasnt surprising that the bayards owned part of itthe neighbors up and down coverdale lane probably did little deals together all the time while mrs edwards bayard attended the opening of larchmont in her mauve bombazine her husband probably discussed business with mr matthew graham in his masculine sanctum as the society writer put it it only made me uneasy because i kept finding places where the people from new solway connected who knew whom who did what to or with whom i was closing the screen when i noticed margent and margentonlinethe magazine paying morrell to hunt around afghanistan for stories i had a moments fantasy of calling calvin bayard look after morrellin fact bring morrell home and i wont rat out your granddaughter i shut my swollen eyes the conversation and its aftermaths rolling through my imagination morrell home in my armsthen never speaking to me again after he found out what id done i sat up and left nexis to check my messages including my log from the answering service among the litter of emails was one from morrell i put it aside to open lastdessert for doing my chores my phone message log took up two computer screens i closed my eyes again ready to turn my back on the whole caboodle but if i did that the total would only be worse in the morning i squinted at the screen geraldine graham had left two more messages this afternoon she could wait until morning murray again he could also wait inquiries from three clients whose projects were close to finished i called them all and actually found one live person on the end of the line i explained where i was on his problem and that hed have a report in two days one of the things mary louise started me doing was to keep a time sheet for each client including due dates i entered this one in big red letters so i wouldnt forget stephanie protheroe from the dupage county sheriffs office had phoned at fourthirty when i reached her she said she thought id like to know that theyd identified the man id found his name was marcus whitby he was a reporter for some magazine i could hear her rustling through pieces of paper here it is tsquare someone at the magazine called in an id when they saw his face on the wire tsquare i echoed what was he doing out in larchmont they either dont know or wont say lieutenant schorr tried to talk to whitbys boss but didnt get anywhere you know the magazine its a kind of vanity fair for the africanamerican marketcovers a mix of highprofile figures in black entertainment politics and sports they usually have a political section too tessa my lease partner has a subscription theyd profiled her last year in forty under forty brothers and sisters to watch did he live out there i asked uh his address is somewhere in chicago she fumbled with her notes again a street called giles also we got an autopsy result he hadnt been dead long when you found him maybe an hour or two and he died from drowning theyre saying he got himself drunk and went to a place to die where he thought he could be private theyre saying that means they found blood alcohol levels of some alarming height i havent seen the detailed report so i cant tell you that all i know is sheriff salvi talked to the press this afternoon i guess it will be on the news tonight his secretary says he told reporters that marcus whitby came all the way out to dupage county to commit suicide i thought youd like to know did they do a complete autopsy are they giving this a lick and a promise because he was a black man in white superpower country hoarseness made it impossible for me to sound as forceful as i wished i can only tell you what im told im not very high up the chain of command here but the summary makes it sound like they did check his blood alcohol level and wed have found him through afis anywayit turns out he had a sheet the sheriff slid that into his remarks i frowned trying to put a record together with the quietlooking man id pulled from the pond although i guess we all look quiet in death i probably will myself i tried to invest some enthusiasm in my thanks before hanging upprotheroe hadnt had to call me after all what had whitby been doing at the larchmont estate to begin with did the sheriff or even the new solway police care about that question if the magazine wasnt saying did that mean they didnt know or that they wouldnt tell maybe marcus whitby was thinking of buying larchmont or writing a story about it for tsquare magazine or perhaps some wealthy black entrepreneurs had moved onto coverdale lane and whitby was doing a piece on what it was like to own the house that your mother could only enter as a housekeeper catherine bayard could shed light on all these speculations i needed to talk to her as soon as possible i wanted to do it right now this minute but it was an interview id need my best wits to handle the only thing i was smart enough to know right now was that i couldnt corner a slippery teenager in my present condition instead i returned to nexis and looked up marcus whitby he ownedhad owneda house at thirtysixth and giles where he was the propertys sole occupant no spouse no lover no tenant to share the mortgage i looked up the address on my city map bronzeville the part of chicago where blacks had been confined when they first started migrating to the city in large numbers after the first world war after decades of deterioration the block where whitby had bought was making a comeback black professionals were buying what are some of the most beautiful homes in chicago and restoring the stained glass and ornate woodwork returning them to the glory they had when ida b wells lived there whitby had borrowed a hundred thousand from the ft dearborn trust to move into twentyseven hundred square feet of course if he was thinking of buying larchmont hed need about eighty times that i logged off and stared at the disarray that had built up on my desk and worktable in the short time since mary louise had quit i hadnt needed christie weddington from my answering service to remind me that mary louises resignation had left me with a pressing problem mary louise had brought organizational gifts to my operation along with eight years experienceand contactsfrom the chicago police force shed only been working for me while she went to law school now shed taken a fulltime job with a big downtown firm id interviewed a number of people but hadnt found anyone yet who had both the street smarts and the organizational skills to take her place it hadnt been a problem the last few weeks because id been so lethargic i wasnt generating a lot of business on a day like today when i was under the weather and clients were getting cranky i realized id better put serious time into finding someone new papers on mary louises old desk on mine filing so far in arrears i wasnt sure i could bring myself to start on it at least id better not just toss papers about this situation onto mary louises work spacethats what id been doing with my other open investigations i dug a hanging folder out of the supply closet and set it up the way she would have labeled larchmont subfolders for darraugh and his mama for marcus whitby for catherine bayard stapled to the front a time sheet as long as darraugh was paying me id keep working chapter no rest for the sick before shutting down my system for the day i opened my message from morrell it wasnt as much of a treat as id hoped darling im sorry its been so long but my phone isnt working im borrowing a hookup through giulio carrera at humane medicine so i dont know when ill be able to get back to you again i love you i miss you i wish you were here with meit would be a help to have someone on my wavelength im doing a tricky investigation wont say more on an open line but its not physically dangerous scouts honor giulio and i dont go anywhere aloneweve made friends with some local toughs who seem to know their way around both literally and metaphorically so dont worry darling although it may be a week before i can get back to you his email left me feeling hollow and lonelyirrationally i suppose he wasnt any further away now than hed been ten minutes ago but a week before he could write again somehow the hopeful anxiety of thinking each day might be the one with the message that he was coming home was better than knowing there would be no message at all okay penelope time to start weaving that tapestry i mutteredand realized that underneath my loneliness i felt a spurt of angertoward morrell and also myself i was acting like the woman of tradition home alone and anxious while my hero lover wandered the globe seeking adventure that is not the story of my life i croaked loudly i do not sit around waiting for you or any person morrell i called up my phone log again determined to work my way through the whole backlog before i left my office i returned a dozen calls from reporters who had learned id found whitbys body and even got back to murray by then my cold and my sore legs made me long for bed but in the end i decided to make one last call a maid answered geraldine grahams phone madam was resting i was ms warshawski madam wanted to speak to me when geraldine grahams high flutey voice came on i croaked out my name are you ill young woman is that your excuse for not returning my phone calls sooner i return calls as i have time ms graham i did speak to darraugh this afternoon since hes my client did he tell you what happened at larchmont last night young woman i know what happened since i had a visit from an extremely impertinent policeman this morning he called himself schorr i should think it would be boor i was seriously annoyed that you had not seen fit to advise me of what happened in my pool last evening the larchmont pool maam by the time i finished with the police myself and reached home it was four in the morning i doubt whether even someone of your restless sleep habits would have welcomed a call theneven if id had the stamina to make it which i didnt when that answer seemed to stop her i asked what schorr had wanted i kept my eyes shut massaging my sinuses that a negro man had drowned there he wondered if it was someone who used to work on the estate but we have had no negro employees during the last twenty years and i dont believe i ever saw one working there after i sold larchmont mexicans yes but no negroes this boor or schorr showed me a photograph but the mans own mother wouldnt have known him from it who was he a journalist named marcus whitby i dont suppose he wanted to interview you about what young woman journalists lost interest in me after my marriage i havent talked to one since then not even during a time when i might have had something newsworthy to tell them was this man using the larchmont attics for some purpose its possible i wondered what newsworthy events shed concealed its hard to know how he would have bypassed the security system whats that you have to speak up young woman you are not speaking clearly my hearing is not sufficiently acute to understand mumbling i made a face at the phone this is as good as i can do tonight ms graham well talk later in the week when i feel better she tried to bully me into coming out to new solway to see her in person but i deflected that as well and what should she do if she still saw the lights in the attic call the cops maam or that nice young lawyer who handles your affairs i squinted conjuring up his face his name larry yosano what who i know no such person julius arnoff handles my affairs as he has done for decades lebold arnoff that was the firm on larry yosanos card naturally geraldine graham only dealt with principals i said yes maam and took my aching head home mr contreras came out into the hall scolding almost before he had his front door open how come i went out in this weather as sick as i was and without letting him know he hoped i hadnt turned my cold into pneumonia ordinarily his monitoring of my comings and goings sets up my hackles but tonight i was weary down to my bones his concern was a comfort giving back an illusion of childhood with a mother whose scolding conceals affection and the promise of protection i agreed to stay put for the rest of the night agreed to wrap myself in a blanketan afghanon the couch while he brought supper up to my place we ate spaghetti and meatballs with the dogs at our feet and watched the nine oclock news on channel to see how the dupage sheriff would spin the whitby story we had to sit through a report on terrorism first this time on some egyptian immigrant whod disappeared before the fbi could question him about his links to alqaeda a reporter i didnt recognize explained that the man was a seventeenyearold dishwasher whose visa had expired benjamin sadawi came to chicago from cairo two years ago to learn english and to try to find a better job than he could at home he lived with his uncles family in uptown but when his uncle died his aunt moved back to egypt with her children sadawi decided to stay here alone the fbi says the job was a cover that sadawi was really here as a terrorist our middle east correspondent spoke with his mother through an interpreter my son is a good boy a tiredlooking woman sat crosslegged on a floor with a dozen people crowding around her since my husband is dead benji works hard for me for his sisters washing dishes sending money home to us when would he have time for meeting terrorists we only want to have him back safe with us we worry all the time but we cannot even come to america to look for him we have only the money that he sends us to live on the anchor switched to an assistant us attorney who explained that every terrorist had a plausible cover story and most of them had doting mothers the anchor thanked him then said just ahead a grisly death in one of chicagos most exclusive suburbs i muted the set as a group of frantic beer drinkers began jumping and dancing across the screen mr contreras grunted kid is probably hand in glove with those alqaeda thugs thats why his ma wont come here in person to look for him she knows as soon as immigration looks at her passport the catll be out of the bag you dont think shes just worried about her son morrell did a story last month about reaction in pakistan to a guy who died out in coolis prison hed been held for eleven weeks without anyone in our government telling his family where he was all im saying doll mr contreras began wed had the same disagreement a few dozen times ever since the fbi and ins started rounding up middle easterners on suspicion of terrorism back in september i know i know i said hastily lets hope hes not a terrorist and that he hasnt been kidnapped kids do funny things i turned the sound back on as a picture of larchmont hall filled the screen marcus whitbys death was a madefortv story the wealth and power of new solway the deserted mansion the sinister weedchoked pond the network had dug up file footage of a charity garden party at larchmont some twenty years ago we got to see the meadows when horses had roamed in them and the formal gardens were in full flower well cared for it had been a beautiful place channel contrasted that with a view of the ornamental pool shot at twilight with a closeup on the dead carp and here is where chicago private investigator v i warshawski found whitby channel has been unable to find out what brought warshawski to marcus whitbys side all we know is that she arrived too late to save him dupage county sheriff rick salvi came on as mr contreras was crowing at hearing me mentioned on television salvi took most of the juice out of the story by poohpoohing any suggestion that marcus whitby had been murdered theres no sign of foul play no gunshot wounds or blows to the head that would have meant someone put him in that pond to die we talked to the magazine that employed whitby they say he wasnt working on any stories that involved new solway for reasons well probably never know he chose what he thought would be a secluded spot to end his life if that chicago investigator hadnt been out checking on the estate we probably wouldnt have found the body until the next time a caretaker checked the pond probably not for some months we were lucky we got to see him while we could still identify the body we heard he had been drinking someone from fox said no one could face that water sober the sheriff said garnering a laugh channel moved from the press conference to reporter beth blacksin talking to whitbys editor at tsquare an austerelooking man in his fifties with a hatchetshaped face he said he wouldnt discuss an ongoing investigation even with our colleagues in the media but none of whitbys current assignments had a connection to new solway marcus whitbys family lives in atlanta blacksin concluded his parents and his sister harriet have come to chicago to claim his body we watched a somber triothe elder whitbys and a young woman arrive at ohare they ducked into a cab as cameras and mikes were thrust at them the whitbys are utterly shocked by their sons death and insist he was not in any emotional turmoil that might have led him to take his own life reporting live from wheaton im beth blacksin channel thank you beth the anchor said next channel s own len jimpson is with the cubs in tucson do they have a prayer going into full workouts this week stay tuned i had been a cubs fan for too many years to have any hope i switched off the set that the pond you was in doll mr contreras said doesnt look like the kind of place a man would choose to drown in not if he lived in the city and had this whole great big lake right at his doorstep none of it makes a lot of sense unless he was meeting someone out there i told the old man about catherine bayard i dont know if she was a source he was meeting or a lover a lover sixteenyearold kid and a black he caught my eye and hastily changed to and a man that age please i coughed hoarsely youre the only person ive told about finding her there i just learned her name this evening and i am counting the minutes until i can get my hands on her in person but if whitby didnt go out to new solway to see her what was he doing there maybe his magazine will talk to me i know theyve been stiffing reporters but after all im the person who found their guys body mr contreras patted my arm reassuringly youll have some bright idea in the morning cookie i know you right now you need to go back to bed nurse that cold the phone rang as i got up to help him stack the dishes i looked at the clock nineforty i almost let it go figuring it was either beth blacksin or murray ryerson wanting to talk about the sheriffs report on marcus whitby or even worse geraldine graham wanting more attention but what if morrelli jumped on the phone before my answering service could pick it up is this v i warshawski it is you sound different this is amy blount ms blount i was surprised our paths had crossed last summer she had a phd in economic history and had written a book on an insurance company i was investigating wed achieved some degree of mutual respect during the course of my investigation but we werent friends im sorry to call so late butharriet whitby is with me we were roommates at spelman she wants to talk to you sure put her on i tried to mask the dismay i felt i didnt have the energy to talk to the dead mans sister although i doubt i can tell her anything that she hasnt heard from the sheriff she wants to talk in person its difficult to explain and i shouldnt try to do it on her behalf but because i know you it seemed easier for me than her to call you i dont know if you remember but you gave me your home number last summer of course marcus whitbys sister would want to talk facetoface to the person who found her brothers body my morning was free i told amy id be glad to drive down to her hyde park apartment if she and ms whitby didnt feel like coming to my office can we do it now i know its late and i can tell youve got a cold but shed like to see you tonight before all the funeral arrangements get so far under way that they cant be undone i thought longingly of my bed but i infused what brightness i could into my hoarse bark and said id be on my way in short order mr contreras frowned at me and deliberately rattled the stack of dishes amy blount heard him she apologized again for disturbing me so late but only perfunctorilyshe wanted me to see harriet now she did however offer to bring whitbys sister to me harriet was staying with her parents at the drake amy would drive her up to my place before taking her to the hotel when wed hung up i managed to shoo mr contreras out of the apartment he disapproved heatedly of my setting up an appointment this late in the day i was sick these werent people he knew nothing was so important it couldnt wait until morning youre right i said im sure you are but this is the dead mans sister she needs special consideration if you take the dogs downstairs i can rest for twenty minutes until she gets here he huffed and puffed but when i pulled the blanket up to my chin and stretched out he rattled the dishes out to the kitchen and left chapter twinkletwinkle little light wonder if youre there tonight aloud knock on my own door jerked me awake forty minutes later i hadnt heard the bell for the simple reason that mr contreras had been on the watch for my visitors he let them in and brought them upstairs before they could announce themselves its a perennial source of conflict between us his monitoring of my company at least the pulse of anger i felt at his intrusion woke me up enough to greet the two women with some show of alertness amy blount looked much as she had when i last saw her her long dreadlocks twisted in a bundle behind her head her expression wary solemn she had an arm around the other woman whose face had the drained pinched look that follows on loss we murmured introductions and condolences while i got them settled on the couch with herbal tea for harriet whitby and me a glass of wine for amy blount i managed to force mr contreras to return to the first floor he blurted out a final admonishment directed at my guests that i wasnt to stay up late i was sick remember as soon as he disappeared amy began when we heard your name on tv i told harriet i knew you wed been talking over what we could do because its outrageous to think marc committed suicide he was the most oh not optimistic i wouldnt say that hopeful he was a hopeful man harriet whitby said and he knew how much our parents not just loved him but relied on him to make a difference with his life you know he was a pulitzer prize finalist for his piece on the federal negro theater project and hed won several other awards he wouldnt do something like this to daddy and mother i made noncommittal noises it can be hard when everyone relies on you to let them know that youre feeling despair but i didnt think it would be helpful to suggest that how did you find him harriet asked i dont know chicago at all but amy says that mansion where hehe diedis forty or fifty miles away in some kind of wealthy town most people never heard of your brother never mentioned new solway or larchmont hall to you or your parents she shook her head but he worked on a lot of different stories if he was doing research or even if he had a friend out therewe talked once a week or so but he wouldnt go into those kinds of details not unless it was something that was becoming well a regular part of his life did you think he was in danger is that why you went out there i told them about darraugh graham and his mother and the family connection to larchmont at harriets prodding i told them about finding her brother hefting him out of the water trying to revive him but i didnt mention catherine bayard i expected them to leave then but they looked at each other with the kind of wordless communication that old friends or lovers develop when harriet nodded amy bount said we want you to ask some questions about marcs death mr and mrs whitby are too shattered to take any action but we think well at a minimum we want a better answer to what happened to him than the dupage county sheriff is giving us harriet whitby nodded again its not that marc didnt drink but he wasnt a drinker if you understand me and he didnt use alcohol to bolster his courage what they said on tv was a cruder version of what they told us this afternoon when my parents and i met with them that hed been drinking and fallen in this pond and drowned if heoh its too hard to explain but nothing about his death makes sense to me even if he had wanted to die which i dont believe for one minute he wouldnt do it like that but theyre saying that their examination showed he drowned and that hed been drinking would they make that up no but they dont do a complete autopsy on every body that comes to them its too expensive and thisyour brothermust have looked straightforward to them they wouldnt do a complete screen for drugs or poison if theyd found traces of alcohol harriet and amy looked at each other again and again it was amy who spoke do you think they could be making that up the alcohol i frowned thinking it over it seems unlikely you could get a lawyer to subpoena the medical examiners report i suppose do you have some reason to think they might make it up their general indifference harriet said we didnt meet the sheriff just some spokesman he was polite enough to mother but not very interested they dont seem at all curious about why marcus was in that place to begin with they want it to be that he got drunk andstumbled onto a deserted mansion and drowned himself either by accident or on purpose they dont care which thats what wed like to know amy said why he was out there and how he really died i was curious enough myself to want to take the job but i had to explain that i couldnt work for free i hate to talk about money to someone in the shock of bereavement but i outlined my fee structure if harriet whitby lived on graduate student earnings as amy blount did she might find the bills mounting up faster than she expected thats all right im not like amyi was smart enough to get a real job when we left spelman she gave the glimmer of a smile i can tell youre sick but if youre going to do this i need you to start right now tonight you mean i was startled theres very little i can do tonight anyone i might have questions forpeople who knew him at the magazine for instance or his neighborswouldnt be available until morning you dont understand amy said the whitbys will be collecting marc in the morning they want to take him home to atlanta for the funeral so if there are any questions to be asked aboutabout his bodywe thought you would know who to talk to even at this hour i mean just the idea that he was drunk is so odd it makes us wonder if they did an autopsy at all my eyes were swelling and tearing with a weariness that made it hard for me to think but i suddenly heard the unspoken question in the room had the dupage me given marcus whitbys death a onceoverlightly because he was black and out of place in wealthy new solway i didnt know anyone in dupage county unless you counted the deputy whod lent me the pants and sweatshirt and she wasnt in a position to put pressure on the medical examiner to reopen the autopsy if only hed died in cook county where i know i got up abruptly and started tossing aside papers on the table i use as a home desk trying to find my paimpilot when it didnt turn up there i dumped out my briefcase the palm was buried in the bottom i looked up bryant vishnikov the deputy chief medical examiner for cook county but of course he wasnt in his office this late at night it was after eleven now i hesitated but finally dialed his home number he wasnt happy at being awakened this had better be a real emergency vic im on duty at six tomorrow morning nick do you know the dupage me that is not an emergency question he snapped this is serious they have marcus whitbys body out there you know the man who drowned at one of those big estates near naperville sunday night i found him he grunted i cant keep up with every corpse you stumble on in the six counties warshawski i have enough trouble with the ones right here in cook i rode over his sarcasm i think dupage only gave him a brief looksee and its really important that they do a complete autopsy before they release him to the family tomorrow on your sayso vishnikov was sarcastic no dr vishnikov on yours the sheriff is saying he was drunk but it doesnt seem likely they need to do a thorough exam see if theyve overlooked something like what he growled i dont know a blow to the head or sternum or curare in the blood stream orim not a pathologist anything anything that might have made him go into that pond if he even drowned there maybe he died in lake michigan and someone carried him out to larchmont youve been watching too many law f order reruns give it a rest and let me get back to sleep not until you tell me youll talk to the dupage county me do you have any ideano apparently not this is not like calling one of my own colleagues at cook county i only know jerry hastings very slightly and if he called me to tell me to go back over a body id tell him to go to hell so thats what id expect him to do to me cant you say you have a body that died in a similar way and you want to compare notes or get them to let you look at marcus whitby yourself for the same reason i started coughing again and had to stop to drink more tea no what i can do is a private autopsy if the family hires me if dupage is releasing the body to them its within their rights to make that decision i covered the mouthpiece and explained his advice to amy and harriet who frowned in worry mothershe wont agree to that all she wants is to get marc away from this place as fast as possible isnt there anything else you can do when i relayed that back to bryant he said then theres nothing i can do to help you you want the autopsy youve got to get the family to release the body to me or someone else who will perform a private exam or come up with some compelling reason for jerry hastings to revisit the body i need to buy time for an investigation i exclaimed frustrated look warshawski if the family wont agree to a private autopsy then youll just have to let them take the body away in the morning speaking of which the dawn is not far distant im going back to sleep and you you start gargling or your next stop will be one of my slabsassuming you die in cook county vishnikov hung up but just as i was explaining the problem to harriet he called back in my morgue im always having to battle with lowlevel clerks who lose the paperwork on bodies he hung up again before i could speak i waved a hand at my visitors urging them to silence while i frowned over his advice i only had one possibility i combed through the papers id dumped from my briefcase until i found stephanie protheroes cell phone number i watched the television news tonight i said when she answered the sheriff seemed pretty convinced that mr whitby drowned on purpose we didnt see anything to suggest foul play she said deputy i have mr whitbys sister with me they were pretty close she finds it hard to believe her brother committed suicide its always a struggle for the family protheroe said they find his car i asked or discover how he got to larchmont hall its what about five rniles from the nearest train station do they have a cab service out there a long pause told me protheroe realized they had a biggish hole in their solution to whitbys death i didnt push on the point ms whitbys hired me to ask a few questions ordinarily i advise the family to get a private autopsy when theyre not satisfied with the medical examiner but the mother only wants to get her son out of chicago and interred she wont consent to a tox screen or anything else then you have a problem dont you protheroe wasnt hostile just cautious of course if the paperwork for the body got misfiled for three or four days i might come up with a different reason for why mr whitby was in new solway than just that he stumbled out there to die i might find his car i might find something that would make dr hastings want to reopen the autopsy without anyone looking bad and why should i risk my career on this protheroe demanded oh because i think you went into law enforcement for the same reason i did you care more about justice than jelly doughnuts dont knock jelly doughnuts theyve saved me more times than my kevlar vest she broke the connection will the person you just talked to help harriet said anxiously i think so we wont know until your mother tries to claim your brothers body tomorrow amy blount looked at me with respect i had a feeling she hadnt expected me to come through for her we should let you get to bed did you get sick from trying to rescue marc its just a cold i said gruffly who can i talk to tomorrow who might know what mr whitby was working on or what might have taken him out to new solway did he have a girlfriend or any close men friends here harriet rubbed the crease between her eyes if he was dating anyone in a serious way it was still too recent for him to have told me or mother his editor is a man named simon hendricks he would know what marc was working onif he was writing for tsquare marc did freelance stuff too you know as for his friends i cant think right now i know his college friends but not his chicago ones ill start with the magazine in the morning i said and maybe i can ask your mother about his friends she gave another fleeting smile better notmother would be terribly upset to find out id hired you i stifled a groan this meant the second client in a week where i had to tread lightly between mother and child what about your brothers house can you get in there do you think we might find some notes or something i looked in his pockets hoping for some id and he didnt have any keys on him it hadnt occurred to me until i was talking to the deputy just now but there werent any house keys or car keys unless maybe those fell out of his pockets into the pond harriet turned in bewilderment to amy thenbut his cari didnt think about that what did he drive i pulled a notebook out of the heap on the table a saturn sll well see if he left it at his house amy volunteered to find a lawyer or someone else who might have a spare key to marcus whitbys house i didnt say i could get past the lock myself if need be id save that parlor trick for when i had to use it mentioning the search id made of his pockets made me remember the matchbook and pencil id found id tossed them in a bowl by the front entrance when i took catherines teddy bear out of my pockets i went back for them and showed them to harriet and amy water had gummed the matchbook into a solid mass that wouldnt open the cover had originally been some shade of green water had turned it blackish and whatever the logo had been it now looked like a childs amorphous picture of a star the cover didnt have an address or phone number i might be able to get a forensics lab to open it to see whether whitby had written something on the inside the pencil was an ordinary number with no names stamped on it harriet turned the matchbook over in her hands neither she nor amy had any idea where it was from but harriet wanted to keep it as the last thing her brother had touched i looked closely at both the matchbook and the pencil again they werent going to tell me anything i handed them over to harriet whitby when id ushered them out i was utterly beat i steamed myself for a few minutes in a hot pot of my mothers inventionherbal tea lemon gingerand crawled into bed where i fell at once down a hole of sleep the phone dragged me out of it at one in the morning is this v i warshawski the night operator from my answering service demanded weve gotten a phone call from a mrs mackenzie graham she says its an emergency and insisted that we wake you mrs mackenzie graham i echoed bewildered i knew darraughs son mackenzie and didnt think hed gotten married then i remembered through the fog of sleep that mackenzie had also been darraughs fathers name i switched on a light and fumbled around on the mghtstand for a pen when i had geraldine grahams number i was tempted to make her wait until morning butid found a dead man in her childhood pond sunday night maybe someone was making a habit of tossing bodies there and she was watching them do it again i dialed the number i want you out here at once young woman she sounded as though she thought i was the night chambermaid why because its your job to discover who is breaking into larchmont you didnt find them last night but they are here right now what are you seeing i croaked hoarsely what is that young woman dont grumble at me i tried to clear my throat what are you seeing people phantom lights cars im seeing the lights in the attic didnt i tell you that if you come right now youll find whoever it is redhanded you need to call the cops ms graham i live more than forty miles from you she brushed the distance aside the cops had proved how useless they were she hoped i wasnt going to be similarly ineffectual if someone is using larchmont as a dump for dead bodies you need to get the local cops there at once me arriving ninety minutes from now would serve very little purpose if youd like me to call them for you i can she took my offer as a facesaving out and what is your direct number young woman im tired of relaying messages to you through your help theyre not cooperative theyre your best chance of reaching me ms graham good night i didnt want to call stephanie protheroe again one favor a night is all i expect from anyone i finally remembered the young lawyer on emergency duty for the rich and famous i found his card with a pager number and beeped him when he called me back ten minutes later he was as groggy with sleep as i was but he agreed to get someone from the new solway police to drive over to larchmont will you let me know what they find i asked im working for the graham family you know its a strange life isnt it he said responding to the demands of the very wealthy i dont think ive ever heard a lawyer joke that covered that aspect of our work while i waited i made myself another pot of herbal tea my mother had brought me up to believe one drank coffee as a matter of course but tea only in illness i took it into the living room and drank two cups idling away the early morning by watching audrey hepburn stare wistfully at gregory peck all the time i looked at hepburns doelike eyes i kept wondering whether the new solway police would catch catherine bayard breaking into larchmont hall after an hour larry yosano called me back ms warshawski i went over with the new solway police and we didnt see anyone we made a circuit of the house and the outbuildings and didnt notice any breakage the security company confirms that no one has tripped an alarm out here we doublechecked the pond youll be glad to know there arent any new bodies there maybe ms graham confused lights in the attic with the traffic going by on coverdale lane i felt absurd breathing a sigh of relief i saw nothing but shoals ahead in talking to young catherine bayard but i was still happy that if she was the person geraldine graham had seen at larchmont hall shed finished whatever she was doing before the cops arrived chapter ice cube editor when i woke again the sun was bright in the sky i on the other hand was stiff and congested when i tried my voice i sounded more like sam ramey than renee fleming i stumbled out of bed and into my clothes but the late night with harriet whitby and amy blountfollowed by geraldine grahams demandshad knocked out any reserves i had i was too hoarse even to make phone calls finally i gave in to the luxury of a day off i played tapes of my mothers old concerts listened to leontyne price sing mozart and ate soup that mr contreras brought in from the market on wednesday i was still snuffling but finally had enough energy to get back to work id slept too late to catch young catherine bayard at home so i could find out whether to waylay her at home or at school i called the vina fields academy pretending i was part of the bayard mansions staff the directors secretary answered did catherine bayard get to class on time this morning we had to drop her at the train and i dont think she caught the early one i said in my basso profundo i promised her i would explain to the school if she was late they put me through a few hoopsprotection for their students since a school full of wealthy kids is a target for kidnappers the sketchy data about the bayard household id garnered from nexis was enough to convince them to tell me shed arrived late for algebra i didnt push my luck by asking what time catherines school day ended at least she was in chicago within relatively easy striking distance my day off left me fit enough to do a complete set of exercises stretching my tight muscles working up a modest sweat with my weights and finishing by taking the dogs on a short jog around the neighborhood you be sure youre bundled up cookie you get a chill on top of that cold it could turn real serious mr contreras once again adjured me when we got back i did feel better its sometimes hard to believe that motion does you more good than bed i hoped my looser muscles would get me through the day lotty herschel called to remind me we were having dinner together tonight we have a standing date once a month to make sure we dont lose track of each other yes i can hear youre under the weather my dear but i see more germs in an hour than you could possibly shed on me so unless youre too unwell to go out come and have some company to cheer you her dry wry concern was a good tonic i dressed quickly in a greenandblackstriped trouser suit that i liked it was professional but had a bit of style in the jacket waist down at my office i started my calls with one to darraugh so i could report on his mothers early morning alarm darraugh was in new york but his assistant said she would make sure he knew the sheriffs deputies hadnt found any signs of a breakin she added that theyd already heard twice from ms graham she wasnt sure you understood the urgency of the assignment but i assured her that mr graham has full confidence in your abilities i cant get a handle on what marcus whitby was doing out there i told caroline jerry hastings the dupage county me only did a superficial autopsy it would be helpful if we could pin down the cause of death more exactly than drowningif we could even make sure marcus whitby drowned in that water do you think darraugh would be willing to call dr hastings hastings wont respond to a chicago pi butyou know how the world goes darraughs family has been prominent in dupage for a long time ill mention it to him when we next talk caroline promised i next phoned harriet whitby at the drake i explained that besides trying a strategy to buy time on the release of marcs body i was also trying to get someone to push on the dupage me to do a more complete autopsy in case neither of these ideas pan out you should get your mother to agree to a private autopsy i guess i can try she said without a lot of enthusiasm what else will you be doing im going over to llewellyn publishing see if theyll tell me what your brother was working on when he died theyve been stonewalling the press but they might tell me since im working for you im going to be in motion all day take my cell phone number so you can call me if you need toespecially if amy finds someone to let us into your brothers house how long will you be in town it all depends on mother she said if i can persuade her to slow down but shed like to hold the funeral on friday or saturday i offered to talk to her mother myself but harriet still didnt think that would be a good idea its not as if theres any evidence of well that there was anything wrong except for him being out there to begin with unless you find something concrete shes not going to listen shes determined to believe it was a tragic accident she let out a harsh squawk of a laugh maybe im just doing the opposite pretending he didnt die for no reason at all lets not worry about your motives right now i said gently the questions youre asking deserve answers before going to llewellyn publishing i wrapped up the work i needed to do on my three small jobs i also looked up marcus whitbys previous work his stories for tsquare had centered on africanamerican writers and artists shirley graham ann perry lois mailou jones the federal negro theater project of the thirties he had detailed the rise fall and current resurgence of bronzevillethe south side neighborhood where hed bought a houseas a way of showcasing richard wrights chicago years whitby had occasionally written for rolling stone and had done a recent piece on a young black writer whose first novel had made a big splash a year or so back about ten years ago whitby wrote a biting essay on his arrest and imprisonment during an antiapartheid demonstration in massachusetts so that was how hed picked up a sheet he didnt have any other arrests on his record that i could see before i could get out the door murray ryerson phoned hoping i knew something about whitby that hadnt been in any of the official material he had on an oxxford suit i said helpfully i think the shoes were johnston murphy but im not a hundred percent sure so he was a conservative dresser he wrote hip and dressed square anything else i thought a long minute pros cons the dupage medical examiner seems to have given the body a lick and a promise some people are wondering if they would have been as cursory if whitby had been white what people murray was on it like a flea on a dog unnamed sources i said primly a client i wont reveal anyone been able to find out what he was working on at tsquare theyve got a lockdown at llewellyn the editor simon hendricks hes the guy with a face like a tomahawk if you were watching last nights news if you try to ask him anything he chops you off at the knees for violating editorial integrity i hoped that didnt apply to an ambassador from the dead mans family but it definitely meant going in person with a note instead of facing the runaround of voice mail i checked my email one last time even though i knew morrell had said hed be out of touch for a week and of course the new messages in my in box were either spam or business related an old lover of morrells an english journalist was also in afghanistan morrell traveling with susan horseleyi tried to put that thought out of my mind what did penelope really do those twenty years that ulysses was sleeping with calypso and fighting the cyclops only a man would imagine she spent it all weaving and unweaving she probably took lovers went on long trips herself was sorry when the hero came home i locked up and headed south to the trendy stretch of land developers like to call river north llewellyns building was an eightstory cube built when the streets west of the magnificent mile were a nomansland between the cabrini green housing project and the gold coast land was cheap then and it was also spitting distance from both the river and the expresswaysvaluable for a publisher needing to bring in tons of paper every week nowadays the old warehouses hold chichi art galleries while highrise condos filling the vacant lots dwarf llewellyns cube the boom has also made parking a supreme hassle i finally found a meter several blocks west of the building llewellyns lobby was as spare as the exterior all it held was a waiting area with beigeupholstered chairs and a high horseshoe counter where a receptionist sat no art no glitz only a photograph of llewellyn himself hanging in the waiting area relieved the monotony a uniformed guard lounged between the receptionist and modest elevator bank although the receptionist was built on a massive enough scale to stop an intruder without help from the guard she frowned majestically when i identified myself and said i was hoping to see mr simon hendricks and do you have an appointment no but hes not taking any unsolicited interviews i have a note for him can you send that up please she took the envelope from me and opened iteven though it was sealed and addressed to hendricks id kept it simple dear mr hendricks i am the private investigator who found marcus whitbys body at larchmont hall on sunday night i got him out of the water and tried to give him cpr his sister ms harriet whitby has hired me to investigate his death id like to know if mr whitby was working on something that took him to new solway on sunday v warshawski when the receptionist had read ittaking her time as if hoping to goad me into some display of impatience that would allow her to throw me outshe made a call on the house phone speaking too softly for me to overhear she mutely nodded me to a seat in the lobby i sat on the scratchy beige upholstery hoping my message was persuasive enough to open doors closed to murrays aggressive style after a wait long enough to let me read most of the january issue of tsquare which was on a small table with current copies of the other magazines in the llewellyn group a woman got off the elevator and came over to me she was about six feet tall as lean as a whippet wearing skintight turquoise leather and highheeled boots that added another three inches to her height the shiny turquoise made my striped suit look dowdy and conventional the woman didnt sit down so i got up it isnt often i feel like a shrimp but my eyes just about connected with her breastbone she ignored the hand i held out as i smiled and introduced myself im mr hendrickss assistant what is it youre hoping to get out of a meeting with him i let my hand drop and spoke with a phony sincerity more grating than outright hostility im so sorry your receptionist didnt let you read my note im a private investigator marcus whitbys sister has hired me to find out how and why he died it would be helpful to learn what he was working on these days that took him out to new solway she curled her lip in disdain and for proof you offer i pulled the laminate of my investigators license from my wallet she looked at it but told me she wanted proof that harriet whitby had really hired me i pulled out my cell phone and called the drake harriet wasnt in her room but when i rang the senior whitbys i found the client with her mother she answered cautiously trying not to give herself away to her mother im at the publishing company right now ms whitby one of the secretaries wants to make sure youve really hired me that im not using your name as a smoke screen for infiltrating llewellyn publishing can you talk to her i guess so but i cant really that is well let me see what i can do harriet stammered the assistant was frowning mightily but she took the phone from me and had a terse conversation with my client at the end of it she gave me back my phone ill talk to mr hendricks about it she clicked over to the reception desk in her high heels and picked up the phone i followed her over she says shes his sister no i dont all right ill tell her she hung up and turned to me mr hendricks wants some proof that we were really talking to harriet whitby by now we had drawn a small crowdthe guard and two people who had been on their way out of the building joined us at the reception counter they werent saying anything but secret smiles and nudges showed hendrickss assistant that she was putting on a good performance i leaned against the countertop my eyes hot are you seriously suggesting that this grieving woman leave her mothers side to produce a photo id for you is there some scandal about marcus whitby that youre trying to hide did the magazine send him out to new solway to die the assistants plucked eyebrows rose in great semicircles of course not were only trying to protect our own privacy then take me up to simon hendricks now if he knows anything about marcus whitbys death the sooner he tells me the sooner i can help the whitby family take their dead son back home for the funeral thats right delaney one of the onlookers said stop horsing around and take the woman up to simon several others in the group echoed the sentiment delaney hesitated but realized the groups mood had shifted against her she stalked to the elevator telling me over her shoulder to come with her i followed her to the editorial offices on the sixth floor chapter trackless desert hendricks himself was as bleak in person as hed seemed on television monday night he didnt smile when his assistant introduced me didnt change expression when i explained why harriet whitby had hired me didnt as much as blink when i mentioned her concern that dupage hadnt done a proper postmortem i see ms he glanced at my cardwarshawski so the family believes you can tell them something the police cant they have actually hired you to conduct this investigation he sounded as though it was about as likely as my being asked to pinchhit for sammy sosa your guard dog here spoke with harriet whitby i said and the family believes it yes or they wouldnt have asked me to do the job he and delaney both stiffened at the guard dog title but hendricks merely said coldly and what do you expect to learn from mr whitbys current assignments i again went through my song and dance about trying to understand what had taken whitby to new solway wed all like to know that msuh i dont believe it was connected to his work you spoke to whitbys sister delaney youre convinced it really was the sister delaney murmured a respectful assent hendricks picked up a sheaf of papers the busy man interrupted middecision mr whitby was working on a story on the writers in the federal negro theater project you know what that is when i repeated the little knowledge id picked up from whitbys articles hendricks curled his lip i see i would have thought the familybut i suppose they know their own business best very well msuh youre welcome to look at the proposal he gave me but he hadnt turned in the completed story nothing in the proposal would have taken him to the western suburbs and i dont know of anything else he was working on that would have done so he did freelance work but he always cleared such projects with me to make sure they didnt conflict with anything we were doing here delaney take her out to talk to aretha and give her a copy of the proposal he returned to the printout in front of him before wed left the room when i asked delaney who aretha was she said tersely research assistant and fact checker who worked with mr whitby the coldness i was meeting was riling me and i braced myself for a confrontation with the fact checker to my relief aretha cummings turned out to be the opposite of delaney in everything from her heightabout five feet tall in her pumpsthrough her plump curvy body and her warm energy were all devastated here she said when delaney had minced off in her threeinch heels even delaney although she wont admit it she has such a crush on mr hendricks so she thinks she has to act like him to get him to like her i could give her a few tips but she isnt the kind to invite them and anyway she intimidates me but im glad marcs sister had the sense to bring someone in to investigate his death he was a wonderful wonderful man a really inspired reporter hed had offers from esquire and vanity fair but he wanted to stay here i think sometimes mr hendricks sat on him because he was frightened that marc would show him up not that marc wanted an administrative job he loved writing and tracking down sources all the time she was talking shed been motoring down the hall on her worn pumps moving as fast as me even though she took two steps for each one of mine we passed cubicles and offices all of them filled with paper i spied production schedules pinned to different doors shelves stacked with old issues of llewellyn publications reference books a supply room where a woman and a man were arguing in fierce undertones we finally landed in a conference room barren of everything but a scarred deal table and a couple of folding chairs this is where the writers get to meet aretha explained nothing fancy for them or for us ras the editors have mahogany and a refrigerator and everything but i can get you a soft drink or coffee from the vending machine my throat was dry lemon soda sounded better than vending machine coffee while aretha was out of the room i read through the proposal delaney had handed me the single page assumed the reader knew what the federal negro theater project was whitby was proposing to look at several chicago contributors not the wellknown theodore ward or shirley graham but some who should be as well known especially kylie ballantine their stories will be woven into the ongoing history of bronzeville i read it through twice when aretha came back i was studying an erasable board on the wall it was covered with arrows and bullet points about halle berry and denzel washington and the upcoming oscars she grinned of course were sending a couple of writers to the oscars i wish one of them was me i adore halle berry i suppose winning an oscar is in line with the talented tenth even if its not the same as the nobel prize we scooped everyone with our stories on toni morrison and derek walcott oh tsquare w e b duboiss talented tenth of the negro race turned into a celebrity magazine were you helping marcus whitby with his story on the federal negro theater project i dont really know much about it it was part of the wpa see in the thirties the federal theater project that fdr set up for outofwork performers they were trying to provide work for artists and playwrights and they had this idea of peoples theater can you imagine the government today doing something like that she grinned engagingly so there was a yiddish theater experimental puppets a lot of different things including negro theater which existed in twentytwo cities although they were only really productive in three chicago and new york and for some reason i dont understand seattle so we had richard wright and theodore ward here in chicago they were playwrights and kylie ballantine was a choreographer shirley grahamshe was duboiss wife and a wellknown stage director they did some pretty amazing things the swing mikado was the most famous but ward wrote something called the big white fog about the real state of race relations in this country then the republicans in congress got freaked almost like they were todays fossils screaming about the nea they claimed the federal theater project was a communist front and shut it down after only about two years was it do you think i was curious she leaned forward the brown check of her jacket sleeves straining against her plump forearms see this was when gone with the wind was published and everyonewell a lot of white americawas buying margaret mitchells idea that we were all contented little pickaninnies until the evil yankees came and ended slavery there were definitely some fellow travelers in the project but mostly it was people for some brief time getting a chance to put real theater on real stages instead of having to do minstrel shows or play mammies and stepin fetchit so what was mr whitbys interest the ideological battles she shook her head so vigorously her short curls danced no some folks think the ntpthe negro theater project was just a chance for the white bourgeoisie to exploit black artists but marc wasnt interested in the ideological angle he wanted to follow the chicago writers workshop that a lot of these artists belonged to to see what happened to them and he was especially interested in kylie ballantine she was so complex she danced she did choreography but she also was an anthropologist and wrote books on african dance and ritual she had a studio in her home in bronzeville marc tried to buy her househes been hoping to turn it into a museumhad been she corrected herself mournfully but the new owner cut it up into a bunch of little apartments and refused to sell so marc bought a place close to hers then he started a campaign to get her home in the national register of historic buildings maybe ill try to take that over she gave a little hiccup and busied herself with her notebook for a minute i waited until she regained her composure then asked if she knew how much of kylie ballantines story marcus had finished it was more like how much he was cutting it back he had so much material on kylie he was turning it into a book the piece for tsquare was almost finished hes been doing occasional pieces on the history of bronzeville you see you know bronzeville right i made an apologetic grimace not really it was the corridor along cottage grove avenue where africanamericans were restricted when they started moving to chicago in large numbers after the first world war i think not exactly she said with a friendly smile that made me glad it was she not delaney or simon hendricks who was educating me youre right that we were pushed into that narrow stretch along cottage on the south side but bronzevilleoh in some ways it was a state of mindit included the wonderful mansions on king drive you know a bit west of cottagethats where ida b wells lived for instance and richard wright when he was here and daniel hale he had a clinic there because even though he did the first openheart surgery in the world none of the white hospitals would let him practice but also because the downtown stores were segregated there was a shopping district around thirtyfifth street no one misses segregation but its really sad all those stores and little businesses disappeared we were both quiet for a minute mourning the passing of the little shops or perhaps the passing of marcus whitby aretha gave her curls another shake anyway marc was fascinated by bronzeville he came from atlanta so he had such a different experiencebetter in some ways worse in others but definitely differentand he felt like he had a mission to preserve and record bronzeville then he fell in love with kylie she isnt still alive is she i asked startled oh no she died in but you know how you can be so fascinated by a dead person that they feel really present for you i used to tease marc about it about how i could never she dissolved suddenly into tears i pulled some clean tissues from the stack id packed before starting out today but didnt try to stop her crying shed loved him when he was alive that much was clear and now she was likely to have her own dead hero to keep alive it isnt fair he was so smart and so loving he didnt deserve to die she gulped out i dont believe he killed himself i know people like delaney laughed at me just the way i laugh at her with her stupid crush on simon hendricks but marc was different he was special he never would have gotten drunk and jumped into a creepy old pond thats what his sister thinks toothat he wouldnt have done that i mean i said when arethas sobs had died down and shed wiped her face no dont apologize grief keeps hitting us at unexpected moments knocking the wind out but do you know why marcmr whitbywent out there did kylie have a house in new solway she swallowed the rest of her coke no she only ever lived in bronzeville except the years she spent in africa and she didnt have any family in those western suburbs i did a search through marcs notes because i wondered the same thing did mr whitby ever mention calvin bayard i asked is he in charge of bayard publishing were not supposed to go to them mr hendricks is afraid theyll scoop our stories because they own magazines with tons more reporters and money than we have marc would have known that she stopped oh does mr bayard live in new solway do you think mare went out to see him without telling us because he knew it would annoy mr hendricks i shook my head at this point i dont know enough to have theories but it sounds like one possibility i can look through his notes and see if marc says anything about bayard but he never mentioned well either mr bayard or bayard publishing to me could i see marcs notes i tried not to sound like peppy with a rabbit in view she wrinkled her face up in doubt i dont think mr hendricks would like it if i let his stuff leave the building but i can see what marc left at his desk if youll read it here i followed her out of the conference room and on down the hall like most offices the floor was laid out in a square around the elevators and bathrooms we ended up at the corner near where wed started at a row of cubicles facing an interior wall a few people were working at their desks but most were leaning over the edges of the carrels talking to each other they stared frankly at me but didnt interrupt their conversations marcus whitbys name was on a black plaque two from the end unlike most of the other desks id seen his was extraordinarily tidyno stacks of paper on the floor no leaning towers of files i asked aretha if shed cleaned up after his death no marc was just a neatness freak everybody teased him about it her voice wobbled but didnt break thats right a man in the adjacent carrel whod been talking to his far neighbor leaned in our direction whitby was mr anal compulsive you couldnt borrow anything from him if you hadnt returned what you took last week you his lawyer nowhy did he need one the man grinned just a guess know youre not with the magazine jason tompkin v i warshawski im an investigator hired by the family to see how he died did he ever mention going out to new solway to you tompkin shook his head but marc was a solo operator most people here share and share alikeyou know youre stuck you want an opening you bring your buddies up to speed on what youre doing not marc he owned his material he was happy to help people aretha snapped youre just lazy jt and you know it tompkin grinned you ought to be a perch aretha you rise faster to the bait than anyone i ever met but you cant deny whitby didnt let people in on what he was doing simon and he had a few words about it now and then is that why mr hendricks was reluctant to let me know what mr whitby was working on i asked tompkin thought that was funny enough to laugh about but when aretha glared at him he subsided and returned to his other neighbor aretha rifled quickly through a plastic disk holder heres bronzeville but i know marc kept most of his kyle ballantine stuff at home his notes his notebookhe did stuff by handi dont see that but he probably had that at home too a lot of the writers do most of their work at home can you imagine trying to work with jason tompkin blaring away all day this last was said loud enough for tompkin to hear but all he did was laugh again and say stimulation darling i was stimulating him but marc was too uptight to enjoy it i followed aretha to her own desk the research assistants and fact checkers were another peg down from the writers her desk wasnt in a cubicle but one of four put together to make a square she slipped the disk into her own computer skimmed through the contents but said there wasnt anything current on it i leaned over her shoulder to study what was on the screen she brought up the file that showed kylie ballantines history it was annotated with his sources mostly private papers labeled vhthe vivian harsh collection at the chicago library aretha explained when she realized i was trying to scribble notes off the screen onto my own notepad she printed out a copy i can also give you the back issues of tsquare where he wrote about bronzeville already theyll tell you some of the history theres nothing here about his new story if his sister has his things shell have his notebooks and stuff do you thinkcould you ask his sisterid love to have one of his notebooks i promised her that as soon as id sorted through what hed left in his house id see she got some of his personal papers i was disappointed though id hoped for some kind of breakthrough here or insight but maybe there wasnt anything to find maybe marcus whitby had gone to talk to calvin bayardbut about what blacklisted writers whom bayard might have known he hadnt mentioned it because you werent supposed to go to bayard about anything and then hed gotten lost on his way back to his car hed tripped on the loose bricks and fallen to his death it could have happened why didnt simon hendricks want to let me know what marc was working on if there isnt anything very secret about it i asked aretha as she waited with me for the elevator she shifted uncomfortably oh corporate stuff you know oh i grinned suddenly making sense of jason tompkins laughter he didnt want a white woman poking around she blushed its not personal but mr hendricks well he came up in the organization when mr llewellyn was still fighting every inch o the way to get funding to get distributors everything i think he would have expected the whitby family to hire a different investigator as i rode the elevator back down to the lobby i hoped hendricks was wrong chapter a childs garden of verses bmws and mercedeses stood three abreast on astor street as parents and nannies waited to fetch their children from the vina fields academy chicago taxpayers were helping out city cops had blocked off the street and were directing outsiders like me away from the area i found a sort of legal space on burton place and sprinted back but the students hadnt yet started to emerge i was cutting it close because id hung around the entrance to llewellyn publishing hoping jason tompkin would come out for lunchhe hadnt seemed like the type to eat at his desk after fortyfive minutes when i was about to give it up hed emerged with a couple of coworkers one of them was delaney simon hendrickss assistant who frowned when she saw me the third was the woman jason had been talking to when i was in marc whitbys cubicle jason tompkin came over to me tipping the beret he was wearing ah the special investigator looking for the xfiles what can i do for you his voice and smile were without malice i had to smile in turn xfiles is right i was hoping since you worked right next to marc whitby you might have heard somethinganythingthat would explain why hed gone out to new solway aretha said you all werent supposed to talk to anyone at bayard about work in progress so i did wonder if hed had a surreptitious appointment with calvin bayard delaney said marcus whitby thought being a star reporter he could write his own rules it wouldnt surprise me if he thought he could bypass mr hendrickss orders about this too and did he i asked tompkin i like to feed the rumor mill as much or more as the next man but i unfortunately did not hear the ace reporter talking to or about the bayard empire he was working on something he thought was pretty hot that much i can tell you but he made sure i never heard him actually say anything when did that start his acting like he had something pretty hot jason shrugged one slim shoulder a week before he died maybe hed started making a lot of calls started hanging by his phone so he could jump on it when it rang being a finalist for the pulitzer gave him a taste for glory he kept hoping hed got that big prizewinning story in his sights why arent you supposed to talk to anyone at bayard i asked wondering if id hear the same reason aretha had given its our policy with all our big competitors delaney said mr llewellyn is the proudest man on the planet jason added no delaney thats not an insult its the truth the bayard policy dates from jt just stop it right there delaney said we dont need to tell every stranger on the street our business and you know mr llewellyn would say that louder than mr hendricks you hear tompkin rolled his eyes expressively but a glance at his other coworkers frowning face shut him up delaney pushed him on the shoulder to start him up the street i followed after long enough to give all three one of my cards delaney let hers flutter to the pavement but jason and the other woman tucked them away i sprinted back to my carbut not in time to avoid the meter reader an orange envelope my chance to give the city fifty dollars was stuck to my windshield i swore roundly and drove over to la llorona for a quick bowl of soup so who was marcus whitby the warm loving hope of his familyand aretha cummingswhod come close to a pulitzer the competitive uncommunicative coworker the star who thought he could make his own rules huddled up against the restaurant window away from the noise at the counter i checked my messages i had an urgent one from harriet when i reached her i learned that deputy protheroe had come through for us when mrs whitbys funeral director in atlanta tried to arrange the shipment of marc whitbys body the dupage mes office gave them a runaroundthey needed a little more time to process the paperwork mother got so angry i blurted out that youd done it to buy more time for the investigation and then i had to confess that id hired you which made her really furious i was wishing the floor would open under me when daddy suddenly said he thought it was a good idea he never disagrees with mother aboutabout oh domestic thingsso she was completely surprised and then he kind of put his arm around me and said thank goodness id had the gumption to take the bull by the horns that he doesnt want a slur over marcs reputation on account of how he died buthe isnt ready to agree to anwell to letting someone else look at marcs body getting her parents to agree to an investigation seemed like the most important first step i could get going on more ideas and keep pushing on the independent autopsy harriet said amy blount hadnt had any luck with locating a key to marcs house we agreed to meet there the next morning around nine whether amy had found a key or not i gulped down the rest of my chicken soup while i scribbled down my other messages and then hightailed it to vina fields not that i often visit the gold coast but id never really noticed the school before so carefully was it tucked into its surroundings it presented the same bland inwardturning faade as the apartments and homes on the street pushing outsiders away as firmly as a guard dog only a small plaque near the double doors identified the stone buildingthat and the waiting nest of mothers and nannies clustered at the bottom of the steps actually two men stood in the group one with a stroller and a toddler the other with a copy of the new york times tucked under his arm this late in the school season those on foot seemed to know each other at least by sight they chatted about their childrens triumphs and whether they could sell the tickets for the school play each family had been allotted occasionally shooting a curious glance my way after about ten minutes the doors opened and children began streaming out the primary grades left first in knots of giggling girls of boys loudly haranguing each other punching each others arms both sets ignoring the children alone who hunched down in their coats as if already resigned at age eight to life as outsiders a lot of the boys were in shirtsleeves their coats slung over a shoulder hey were men were too tough for sissy things like coats in winter the cars started to pull up honking and jockeying for curb space parents screaming invective at each other a woman with a blond coiffure that spoke of weekly visits to the salon climbed out of her lexus to yell abuse that would have made a truck driver squirm the jaguar in front of her replied with a finger the adults on foot were waiting on the young kidsolder students living close enough to the school to walk could make their own way home when the upper grades began to trickle out a little later i was the lone grownup still standing by the stairs i fingered the ratty teddy bear in my shoulder bag as time passed i began to fret that id missed my quarry or that she had lacrosse practice or junior publishers club just as i had decided to take my chances on getting into the banks street apartment catherine bayard appeared although she was paler than id thought from seeing her by moonlight i knew her at once her mouth was wide and tremulous her face so narrow the cheekbones almost seemed at oblique angles to her nose sleep deprivation had produced violet bruises around her eyes she was with two other girls who were expostulating loudly about someones odd behavior but catherine herself didnt seem to be listening to them although one was blond and the other indian all three looked remarkably alike in their tight jeans and hiplength coats perhaps it was the healthiness and confidence they exuded or maybe the wealth that showed up in little details like the diamond studs ringing the blondes ears and the indian girls cashmere cap and scarf earth to catherine the indian girl said arent you listening catherine blinked sorry alix i didnt sleep much last night jerry the blonde grinned suggestively catherine forced a smile yeah like gran wouldnt lose it completely if he came around on a school night just as the trio turned south on astor i stepped in front of them hello catherine v i warshawski the three girls froze alarm bells of what happens when strangers accost you ringing in their heads loudly enough for me to hear the one whod mentioned jerry looked over her shoulder for help we met sunday night i said heartily when we both decided to go for a latenight run you left something of yours with me remember ill get p idgeley the blonde turned back to the stairs no marissa its okay catherine produced another unconvincing smile i forgot i was jogging at midnight and i ran into this woman jogging at midnight youve always said runners were the biggest losers on the planet marissa exclaimed yeah its just you know the sats my grandfathers health all that stuff i thought i might work some of it off and i couldnt exactly go out riding in the middle of the night anyway let me find out what this person wants she seems to think shes in charge of the universe just a small stretch of chicagoland i said smiling affably where can we talk privately banks street or would you like to come to my office theres a coffee bar on the corner catherine said not quiet enough my office is just a couple of miles west along north avenue ormaybe youd like to visit the old graham estate you choose she shot an unhappy look at her friends at me at the school and finally decided we could go to her apartment her friends stood uneasily by clearly wondering whether it was safe to leave her alone with me finally alix said forcefully that catherine had her pager number she should just beep if she needed help well be at grounds for delight like reading until six or so the other girl said you can catch us there we walked down the street together an awkward foursome until catherines friends turned west at the first cross street alix reminded catherine to beep if she wanted them to call i worked for the bayard foundation one summer when i was in law school i said when we were alone before i joined the sex police i mean i am one of your grandfathers many admirers im sorry if hes ill she turned her head away from me she was not going to help me i fell into the pond when i was running after you sunday night i said thats how i caught this cold but its also how i found marcus whitby whoever that is you made your point you saw me sunday do you really have something of mine or was that just blackmail to make me come with you she kept her head turned away so that all i saw of her was her left ear it exposed her youth that pale shell and made her seem vulnerable breakable i really have something of yours its how i found you so easily what i dont understand is why you went back to larchmont last night that startled her into facing me again how did youi wasnti was here in town last night your grandmother will no doubt back you up on that well ask her when we get to your place after a pause she said you can ask the housekeeper my grandmother is still at the office i was in bed before she got home last night i nodded is the housekeeper ms lantner she moves between the new solway mansion and banks street how do you know all this about my family she said where i live and everything how do i know who you are you dont you havent asked im exactly what i said i was on sunday a private investigator i used to be a lawyer a public defender i dont know whose account of me you would trust but i can refer you to a reporter at the heraldstar or someone on the chicago police force or better still darraugh graham i do a lot of work for him you do know him right hanging around his boyhood home the way you do she bit her lip but didnt say anything it would be an excellent plan for you to call one of these people and ask if they know me you shouldnt trust a stranger who comes up to you on the street but were still going to talk because if we dont im giving your name and phone number to the dupage county sheriff right now im the only person who knows you were at the crime scene sunday night but as soon as the sheriff learns about you he will be here with as much force as he can use on the granddaughter of a powerful taxpayer of course hed also be on my butt like a horsefly for concealing her presence but i hoped she was too inexperienced to think of that what are you talking about you think rick salvi is going to care that i was trespassing its nice you knowing the sheriff by his first name and all but were not talking about trespassing here and even if he dandled you on his knee when you were a baby hes going to want to know what youre up to at larchmont i cant help being born into a rich family but that doesnt mean i think i have a right to special treatment she burst out her eyes bright i know if you have a special position you have special obligations i nodded you dont look much like your grandfather but you sure sound like him your yearbook statement said you hoped to go into the publishing company do you do much around there now i was an intern last summer i got to work with haile talbot i mean i just brought him coffee she broke off remembering we were enemies and refused to speak again until we turned the corner onto banks street i was glad i hadnt tried to talk my way in her familys town home was in a fivestory building hidden from the street by a high stone wall and a wroughtiron door with opaque safety glass filling the curlicues a microphone was set into a recess beside the door where i could have bent over and tried to persuade someone inside to buzz me in catherine unlocked the door and led me across a flagged courtyard a little garden with a couple of fruit trees and an old stone bench lay on the east side of the building continuing as far as i could tell around to the back we walked up gray flagstones to the front entrance also locked and took an elevator to the fourth floor no doorman catherine could come and go with no one seeing her the elevator opened onto what was essentially the apartments entryway an area so big i could have set up my office there and no one would have tripped over me for at least a month we went on through an arched doorway into the body of the apartment a middleaged woman in a maids uniform came out from some back room oh it is you miss katerina and your friend a business acquaintance elsbetta well be in my room you want me to bring tea coffee juice her english was precise but her voice was soft and heavily accented the esses slurred the way my fathers mothers used to were fine without anything catherine said firmly i was not a guest i didnt get refreshments were you here last night i asked elsbetta here yes i sleep here catherine looked daggers at me but she said this woman wants to know if i was here also what do you mean was youwere youhere yes of course you were here you ate with friends you came home at tenthirty you went to bed so i also i then went to bed elsbetta turned to me when mrs renee is not here i stay awake until miss katerina is in bed catherine gave a tight triumphant smile and led me to her room it was decorated in bold colors and furnished in a way that would remind you every time you came in that you had been born to special obligationsthe bang olufsen tvstereo for starters and then the antique armoire and desk navajo rugs worn enough to show they dated to the premachine epoch of indian work these lay on a hardwood floor so polished it reflected our legs as we walked across it another few were draped across a pair of ottomans in front of the working fireplace the room overlooked the back garden i opened the french doors and looked out on a small balcony you wouldnt have to be a great athlete only reasonably confident to move from the balcony to a fire escape screwed into the brickwork about a yard away so you went to bed at tenthirty you waited until elsbettas light went out then you climbed down went out the back gate and headed for the western suburbs you have a drivers license or anyway access to a car you did your business out at the larchmont estate and retraced your steps only you were so worn out that you overslept and missed your algebra class this morning she scowled ferociously what are you trying to prove that you can stalk me you know thats against the law in illinois lots of things are against the law here im not stalking youim just a reasonably competent investigator if i wanted to go to the trouble i could probably find traces of your clothes on that fire escape rough metal like that always snags some fibers while she tried to think of a response i went over to inspect the photographs on the mantelpiece calvin bayard and an eightor nineyearold catherine flyfishing he with his easy smile she with her face furrowed in intensity calvin with a short dark woman catherine with the same woman various other family groupings it wasnt immediately clear which ones were her parents what do you have thats mine she demanded of my back your little teddy bear it came off your backpack in my hand when you broke away from me sunday night oh that you can keep it i could see her in a mirror over the mantel her little face was pinched with anxiety she wasnt as unconcerned as she was trying to sound did you not know marcus whitby was dead when you went back last night i spoke to the trophies keeping an eye on her in the mirror what are you talking about you must have been worried when he missed your rendezvous on sunday or did you just assume i had frightened him off i dont know any marcus whitby so stop trying to pretend youre like jack mccoy i swung around to look at her you dont know marcus whitby the man i fished out of the larchmont pool you dont know hes dead her eyes and jaw opened in what looked like genuine bewilderment you found a dead man out there what happened to him dont you look at the paper or the news when you log onto your fancy computer there doesnt cnn or nbc or something come up to tell you whats happening outside the gold coast she stiffened for your information im very involved in current events but that doesnt mean i read about every dead person in the world is that why you were at larchmont to look for him who was he i sat down on one of the ottomans in front of the fireplace and gestured to her to take the other marcus whitby worked for tsquare magazine she gave the elaborate shrug of adolescent indifference black arts and entertainment middle class when she continued to mime ignorance i added he wrote a piece on haile talbot i thought maybe that was how you met i dont know him marcus whoever i mean and i hardly know haile talbot just because i did pa stuff for him doesnt mean i hung out with him when he did media he had a publicist who took care of that then who were you meeting out at larchmont she bit her lips no one i was there on a dare you caught me fair and square now you can give me my teddy back and go home i shook my head no i know you were there again last night so even if i was gullible enough to believe and you say youre not a stalker i ignored the interruption i told you at the getgo that it was me or the cops since you wont talk to me its the cops you were at the scene of a mysterious death a crime scene you fled they will be incredibly interested in you the good news is theyll only talk to you with your parent or guardian present soyour dad your mom your grandparentswhich one of them should i explain this to her eyes darkened with dismay but before she could say anything someone tapped on her door and immediately opened it the short dark woman from the photographs swept in moving across the room to catherine like the wabash cannonball chapter the wabash cannonball gran catherine jumped and looked from her grandmother to me in alarm what are you doing home so early renee bayard leaned over to kiss catherine she was older than in the mantel photos her dark hair was now well streaked with gray but her skin was remarkably smooth and clear under its light foundation her red dress made from a wool so soft i had an impulse to stroke it looked as though it had been cut to fit her short square body a bracelet of ivory mahjongg tiles clacked when she put her arms around her granddaughter i felt tired of the same meetings churning over the same stale material i want to get to your school tonight for the parents meeting on what we can do with all these justice department efforts to look at student files so i thought id come home first have a family supper if youre not already engaged catherine bounced up from her ottoman i hope you make all those wusses take action so many of them are like marissas dad yacking on and on about how its our duty to cooperate fully were in a war situation ordinary privacy doesnt apply like its never dawned on him what they might find out about his own kid if the school gives them total access to our files marissa haswell never mind the feds have been ruthless talking to leila since shes from pakistan they figure since shes muslim she must have known benji but shes such a snob shes like totally offended they think shed even talk to a dishwasher and marissas dad well how would he like to have the fbi in his files i bet theyd find stuff like enron if they only started looking yes darling i know youre ready to get on your horse and raise the siege of orleans renee smiled fondly at her granddaughter we can talk about it over dinner unless your friend is staying oh oh this isnt a friend its she floundered unable to remember my name i stood im v i warshawski ms bayard im a private investigator although i originally trained as a lawyer catherine made a fast recovery im doing a story on her on her work i mean for vineleaves you know the school newspaper a lot of kids meet private eyes whove been working on their parents divorces but i figure not too many know anything about murder investigations if renee bayard found her granddaughters restless manner odd she didnt comment on it she was more concerned with me saying in a voice heavy with censure murder investigations why did you seek out my granddaughter catherine once more leapt into evasive action she didnt gran i mean i called her i had the idea and i knew mr graham worked with a lot of investigators so i called and asked if he could suggest someone mr graham needs a murder investigator renee bayard persisted watching me sharply most of my work involves financial and industrial crime i said but some of my cases have included murders and thats always sexier to young people than someone shredding company papers to keep their financial fiddles secret renee bayard gave a little nod as if to acknowledge that id scored a point and are you working on something now for mr graham just think gran she found a dead man in the pool out at mr grahams old home catherine intervened so it was you who found that unfortunate young man renee bayard said to me what made you look for him to begin with was that what mr graham hired you to do i smiled my clients appreciate having their private affairs kept private maam but i will tell you i found marcus whitby completely by accident i was looking forsomething elseand tumbled on him literally and youre regaling my granddaughter with this tale we hadnt got that far catherine was more interested in the techniques investigators use for getting information she shows a remarkable capacity for imagining ways to circumvent the law renee bayard frowned at me perhaps because she found my words unacceptably frivolous or maybe because she didnt want me to encourage her granddaughters lawlessness a girl enterprising enough to climb out through her bedroom window and drive off in the middle of the night probably had plenty of other escapades under her belt do you have any idea how the young manwhitney is itcame to die out at larchmont is there any thought of whether it was an accident or intentional renee bayard asked whitby i dont know what the dupage sheriff is thinking but catherine has just been explaining to me that rick salvi is an old friend of your family salvi might say more to you than he would tell the press renee bayard cocked her head at catherine trina you shouldnt call sheriff salvi a family friend hes a political acquaintance she turned back to me i know you dont want to reveal client secrets but are you looking into young whitneysno whitbysdeath if he was murderedmy husband spends the whole year out in new solway now we should call the lantners catherine said if theres a murderer roaming around new solway they need to be on the lookout i shook my head if mr whitby was murdered it was more likely by some homeowner out there who resented his presence on their land i assumed when i found him it was an accident i assumed he was meeting someone by appointment and that he tripped on a loose brick by the pool and fell inbecause thats how i happened to find him i broke off to look at catherine fidgeting on her ottoman wouldnt it be helpful to take some notes in case you actually decide to write up our interview yes darling renee bayard agreed you should never assume that you will have an accurate memory of what someone has said catherine glowered at me but went to the work counter built into the far corner of the room and fished a spiral notebook from her backpack her grandmother frowned over what id said but if he was meeting someone out there why havent they come forward he could have been having an affair with someone who lived out there and was taking advantage of the old graham house standing empty although hed have to have a key to bypass the security system catherine jabbed her pencil through the holes in her notebook and started pulling apart the ends of the paper is that what you think her grandmother asked i did at first but he didnt have any keys on him not even his car keys its possible they fell into the pond when he went in but his car wasnt anywhere on the grounds i suppose the sheriffs police will be finding out how he got therehe could have gone by train i wasnt hopeful about thatsalvi seemed to want to wrap the story up in a package and be done with it after i met with mr whitbys associates at tsquare this morning i did wonder if hed gone out there to consult your husband ms bayards hand went to her throat in a reflexive gesture of selfprotection why wouldwhat made you think that it was a leap mr whitby was doing a story on someone in the federal negro theater of the thirties you probably know they were pilloried in congress for being communists i just thoughtif some of bayard publishings writers had been blacklisted mr whitby might have wanted your husbands inside view on how that affected them mr bayard doesnt grant interviews these days if a journalist tried to callwell our staff are very protective they would have turned him away then maybe mr whitby tried to pay a visit without an invitation i said wondering whether it was calvin or renees decision that he didnt grant interviews the tsquare staff dont seem to know why mr whitby went to new solwayunless his editor simon hendricks does and wont say hendricks says they have a policy against talking to anyone at bayard publishing renee bayard smiled faintly augustus llewellyn muscled his way into becoming a journalism giant against a great deal of oppositionhe was launching tsquare about the time my husband acquired margent magazine none of the big banks would fund a venture by a black publisher my guess is that augustus is simply unwilling to make the white journalism establishment a present of one of his reporters work didnt grample help him out catherine said continuing to twist the edges of her notepaper i thought he put together the consortium yes darling but were not talking about your grandfather right now why dont you finish your interview with ms i fished a card out of my briefcase warshawski if you know mr llewellyn do you think hed be willing to talk to you about what marcus whitby was working on she gave a grim smile the fact that my husband helped him get financing doesnt make him an automatic ally of mine but if i have time ill try to call him elsbetta appeared in the doorway mrs renee excuse me a man is calling from a television station are you wanting to talk to him ms bayard cocked her head to one side you dont know what its about elsbetta no she brushed catherines forehead with her fingertips and steamed out of the room as quickly as she had entered it your grandmother has a lot of energy i remarked running a publishing house and looking after youi couldnt do it no one wants you to catherine said you can stop bugging me now and go home i think i should give you a tip first for vineleaves i sat down again facing her you told your grandmother a lie about darraugh graham andno dont interruptits one she can easily check the two of them know each other when she asks him if he referred you to me darraugh will be astonished and he wont bother to hide it she flushed you could ask him to say i had called why would i want to do that for a girl whos been lying to me and stiffing me i admit i terrified you by tackling you sunday night but i still dont know why you were at larchmont hall the same night that marcus whitby died there it was a coincidence she muttered cant you believe that not really youre a pretty accomplished liaryour grandmother whos known you your whole life believes what youre saying in the background behind us the phone kept ringing and then the doorbell catherines mouth set in a mutinous line i did not know this man was out there dead and i never heard of marcus whitby just because he was on the local news which i dont watch and i am not the person he was meeting out there so who were you meeting at larchmont that isnt any of your business believe what you want be with the sex police if you want im not going to tell you panic was rising in her voice there is someone in the old graham house and you know a way in that doesnt trigger the alarms what is it i wonder youre wrong theres no one in the house if old mrs graham thinks there isshes almost a hundred and she can hardly see shes not blind shes just nearsighted and shes by no means deranged and after talking to her and talking to you well if she said your hair was green id believe her before i believed you telling me it was brown i paused hoping shed blurt out somethingher flushed turbulent face showed she wasnt used to being called a liar after a moment i went on you wouldnt have to meet a boyfriend there as clever as you are about jumping out of fire escapes if you wanted to see someone your grandmother didnt like youd find an easier way to do it unless there was a thrill attached is that how you get into larchmont you shinny up a drainpipe or something to reach a thirdfloor window that doesnt have the alarm system wired to it no is that what you would do she had her arms crossed the very portrait of a hostile teenager but it felt to me more like a pose than a real act whoever youre meeting you dont want your grandmother to know because you tapdanced your way mighty fast past anyplace where shed ask a question shes obviously proud of you and your strong beliefs i guess id have to find out what would hit her the wrong way i cant imagine drugs since even if you were a user youd have an easier place to score than that i got to my feet its a puzzle and puzzles make me curious even when they arent my business when they may beand i dont have any way of knowing this one isntwell then i keep digging catherine scrunched up her face one night last summer when i couldnt sleep i saw my grandfather going through the woods i followed him and he was going over to larchmontthat was after the nounous moved out i dont know why he had a key i guess from when the grahams lived there and they were all good friends but he was letting himself in andand i went in after him so sunday when i couldnt sleep i went in to his room to see if he was sleepinggran had gone back to chicago because she had an early meeting monday but my first class wasnt until ten anyway grample my grandfather wasnt in his room so i just thought id go see if he was over at larchmont its a private place to talk out at our house you know someone on the staff is always around and its hard to be private right i smiled affably and last night when you couldnt sleep you drove out to larchmont to find your grandfather and talk to him privately i mean her flush deepened but before she could say anything renee bayard sailed back into the room trina something unexpected happened olin taverner has died and the local television stations want to talk to me i dont know how long it will take so we wont be able to have dinner together elsbetta will lay something out for you in the kitchen no i want to hear you do your stuff gran i hope he was writhing in agony oh olin taverner hed been senior counsel to walker bushnell the illinois congressman whod been huacs point man in going after calvin bayard all those years ago catherine had presumably grown up on tales of him as the family villain renee put her hands on her granddaughters shoulders darling you absolutely must not say that in public and in public includes in front of strangers we rise above these things so that no one can tell from our public face that they matter to us catherine finished in chorus with her its okay i said i admired your husbands work so much that after he spoke to my constitutional law class i got a job as an intern at the bayard foundation renee ignored me telling her granddaughter that she was going over to channel to do a segment for their postnews discussion show chicago talks you can sit in but you cannot butt in do you understand trina its very important dont worry gran even if you start saying that olin taverner was a wellrespected member of the bar i wont barf or anything on camera you need to show your guest out i have to leave for the studio in ten minutes i told them it was now or never because im determined to get to the parents meeting at vina fields we were done anyway grant catherine hopped up from her ottoman thats right i smiled again holding out my card you need my address though as well as my name and phone number so that you can follow up on your interview and send me a copy of the finished piece yeah sure catherine mumbled shooing me down the hall before i could say anything else in front of her grandmother chapter quicksand i left the bayard apartment feeling confused and annoyed my mood wasnt improved by the bright orange envelope on my caranother fifty dollars this time for leaving the front end across a yellow line a hundred and one dollars so far today in parking fees i could have screamed in frustration my eyes and joints ached from my cold which made it hard for me to think clearly i pulled the lever to recline the drivers seat as far as it would go and leaned back with my eyes shut strictly speaking whether catherine was lying or not about her grandfather was none of my business the only thing about her that could remotely justify my scrutiny was whether she had known marcus whitby and i thought she hadnt she wasnt yet a sophisticated liarher breathless manner when she was twirling away from the truth would disappear with practice that farrago shed spun about her grandfather and larchmont was truly infuriating but i thought she was merely oblivious to marcus whitby hers was an adolescent absorption in her own affairs it was so intense that she brushed off the dreadful notion of whitby lying dead in the pool while she went about her own separate business i dont usually believe in coincidences but whitby and catherineand meall being there on the same night could actually be one she was frustrating enough for me to want to find out what she was doing at larchmont hall but i couldnt ask harriet whitby to pay me to pursue a teenager for no reason except that shed made me feel foolish i switched on the radio to see if they had anything on olin taverners death more bombing runs outside kandahar dissension among the afghan warlords illinois cutting funds for schools and health care to balance the state budget since september just about every public figure in america has been declaiming that were a christian nation i guess thats why widows and orphans carry the load for fiscal responsibility here during the interminable commercial breaks i began to doze but i jerked back awake at taverners name one of chicagos most prominent figures and one of its most controversial is gone olin tavernergained notoriety in the fifties when he served as counsel to illinois congressman walker bushnell on the house unamerican activities committee for two decades taverner was one of the most important voices of american conservatism of late years he had been living quietly almost reclusively in a retirement home near naperville his personal attendant found taverner in his armchair this morning dead of an apparent heart attack he has left no immediate survivors again olin taverner dead at ninetyone are you sick of turning to your tenyearold every time you want to cruise the web well heres a perfect solution i switched off the sound dead in a retirement home near naperville could that have been anodyne park maybe taverner had been geraldine grahams neighbor in that exclusive little retirement resort maybe i could talk to her about him and find out whether by some remote chance catherine bayard was telling the truth when she said her grandfather had a key to larchmont hall a chicago cop started purposefully down the street ready to give me a second ticket i put the car in gear and drove to my office i should check a few things anyway before seeing ms graham again come to think of it i could get a detailed report on taverner from the web as i let myself into the building tessa was locking her studio door she backed away from me when she saw i had a cold shes a bit of a nut about germs i made a show of covering my mouth with my scarf she laughed but still edged quickly out the front door i went down the hall to the back of the building switching on the tiny cooktop we put back there we share a shower room and a refrigerator too but we meter our gas and electricity separately because tessas metal sculpting is so powerdemanding i scrounged one of tessas tea bags conscientiously leaving an iou one gingerlemongrass tea bag and took it into my office on an impulse while my system came up i phoned morrells editor in new york don strzepek and morrell had known each other for years since their peace corps days in jordan and i hoped don might know what morrell was up to when i only reached his voice mail i didnt bother to leave a message i wanted a human voice i wanted morrell email is too remote a traditional letter has more intimacyyou can hold the paper that someone else touched but with email you type and send but never touch or hear morrell himself was beginning to seem so distant it was hard for me to feel that he was real i studied the photo i had on my desk his wiry curly hair his thin face the mouth that had kissed me but i couldnt summon his voice or the touch of his long fingers ulysses chose his path penelope dont let that control you i adjured myself sternly dont weep over yourself my mother had told mei was eight or nine and wrapped in misery because the girls i usually played with had gone to a birthday party i wasnt invited todo something that afternoon shed abandoned dinner preparations and let me play dressup in her concert gown weaving an improbable story for me as signora vittoria della cielo e terra today i began searching the web for stories about calvin bayard maybe i could find out why no one was allowed to talk to him or had renee been spinning me a line when my web search brought me the bayard phone number i called out to the new solway estate and my heart beat a little faster what if i did get through to him what would i say to my hero when a woman answered i said i was one of calvins old interns im in town this week it would mean a lot to get to see him he isnt scheduling that kind of appointment now the woman said in a deep rough voice id settle for a chance to say hello on the phone i wheedled he couldnt come to the phone there wasnt a good time to call back i should try mrs bayard at the company number if i had business with the bayards her goodbye was truncated by the clicking of the handset so what was going on if he was sick why didnt they just say so something about new solway made me imagine gothic scenarios calvin was dead and to keep control of the company renee had organized a massive conspiracy to make the world think her husband was still alive calvins embalmed body lay in a giant freezer in the estates old icehouse marc had found it there and renee had murdered him making things up was more fun than research but research gets the job done i started reading news stories on nexis hoping to find out when calvin had last been seen in public five years ago hed stepped down from formal leadership of bayard publishing and renee had assumed the ceo spot the heraldstar and the new york times both did big stories on it industry scuttlebutt said shed been in charge for a good four years already that was all the web could tell me calvin hadnt been at charity balls or any other public event at least not any reported in the press since his retirement to find out anything more i needed to do oldfashioned legwork talk to friends and neighbors for which darraugh would definitely not pay me although come to think of it he probably knewthat would be an easy question to slip in when we next spoke when i switched my search to olin taverner i picked up a slew of hits i chose the national public radio report which had the advantage of being something i could absorb with my eyes shut i logged onto a realtime player and leaned back to listen to the report taverner had died in anodyne parkbut he had grown up in new solway so not only were he and calvin bayard old enemies they must have been old playmates they were roughly the same age after all they used to gallop around new solway on their ponies together or knout the servants or whatever it is that very rich children do to amuse themselves perhaps marcus whitby had been on his way to see taverner when death stopped for him i was getting up to find my detail map of the area to see if there was a way for a man going on foot to anodyne park to end up in larchmonts pool when the bayard name arrested my attention again in recent years publications like the washington times and the wall street journal have tried to change public perception of taverner bushnell and other leading mccarthy era figures many on todays right say that the left damaged the reputations of true patriots and they have sought to revisit that history one of the greatest oddities of this attempt at rehabilitation is provided by edwards bayard son of renee and calvin bayard who jousted with taverner in front of the house committee some years ago edwards genier bayard joined the ranks of liberalturnedconservative pundits he now works for the inf uential spadona foundation the rightwing think tank that has set the agenda for much contemporary political discourse our political affairs correspondent jolynn parker spoke with mr bayard in his washington office jolynns throaty voice came on explaining the highlights of bayards career phd in economics from the university of chicago a stint at the international monetary fund running the program to sell bolivias water supply to us and french engineering firms and now heading the spadona foundations economic policy division your father is a legend in liberal political circles how did he feel about your taking a position with spadona which has opposed so many of his policies and politics we had a number of interesting christmas dinners bayard said but both my parents are great respecters of free speech as i am and we all believe there is room in america for many different public opinions how did your views come to differ so greatly from your fathers jolynn asked it was my work at the university of chicago which coincided with the end of the allende government in chile i became convinced that supporting a communist like allendeas my parents didwas damaging for us interests there and not fair to the chilean people either some people would say that the united states intervening to overturn another countrys election was unfair especially in light of the many thousands of people the pinochet government imprisoned and killed during the eighties bayard gave a dry laugh ive heard those complaints many times jolynn but the chilean economy is stronger today than ever i clicked the stop icon i wondered what form those interesting christmas conversations had taken and why catherine had adopted her grandparents values instead of her fathers and where her mother was none of my web researches gave any private gossip about edwardss marriage i left nexis and switched to my phone messages to my surprise geraldine graham hadnt called again however amy blount had phoned to say that whitbys housekeeper would come to his house in the morning to let us in darraugh had phoned from new york just to say he had heard from his mother as well as his pa caroline he had full confidence in my abilities but he thought wed put enough energy into his mothers problems for now my answering service has a neat little program that identifies the phone number of incoming calls they include that in the report they email me darraugh was staying at the yale club in new york which tracked him down in the bar what is it didnt you get my message he demanded yes two minutes ago and ill wrap up my report in the morning two things though the first is that the dead mans family has hired me to look into his death so i will be continuing my inquiries out in new solway i would rather you didnt im telling you as a courtesy darraugh because youre one of my most valued clients you know i normally never reveal one clients business to another i paused to let him digest that before adding the second thing is that i talked to calvin bayards granddaughter this afternoon she says mr bayard has a key to larchmont is that possible possible possible that he has a key to my familys house you had damn well not be spreading that story around town his anger made the receiver vibrate darraughtake it easy the kid told me he had a key shes wrong shes lying for whatever reason teenagers lie his voice retreated from fury to mere wintriness i see i pinched the bridge of my nose wishing i did see i tried to talk to mr bayard but was soundly rebuffed do you know why not for any nefarious reason hes in poor health renee protects him with her usual energy send in your bill for the hours youve put in on my mothers complaint i hope you will remember as you look for this dead mans murderer that ive paid your bills for many years now i expect you to keep that in mind if you feel your inquiries must take you out to new solway for any reason you should realize you could fall into quicksand faster than anyone could get to you to pull you out he hung up before i could say anything i had known darraugh graham for fifteen years but i had never heard him threaten me before chapter gaps in the newsreel many people saw olin taverner as your husbands greatest enemy renee can you explain to us why calvin bayard continued to see olin taverner socially dennis logan cocked his head at renee bayard with an intense sincerity that made her withdraw deeper into her studio chair lotty and i were sitting with max loewenthal watching the interview in the back room where lotty keeps her television max whos known lotty practically her whole life is the executive director of beth israel where lotty has her surgical privileges the two have been lovers for many years but since last fall theyve become much closer in a way i resented not having lotty to myself as much as i used to but i like and respect max over roast chicken and a bottle from maxs impressive cellarwhich i was still too congested to appreciatewe talked idly about a number of things including maxs perennial struggle to find a way to bring more paying patients into the hospital one of his board members had suggested getting designer hospital gowns for affluent patients great idea i applauded how can we really tell weve got a twotier health care system if we dont have outfits that demonstrate it armani in a soft gold silk for the privately insured gray overwashed nylon for the wretched poor max laughed but lotty wasnt willing to joke about the matter she uses her substantial surgical fees to fund a number of health programs for the unor underinsured but shes acutely aware of how small a drop that is in the health care bucket i changed the subject hastily describing my encounters with young catherine bayard lotty and max had immigrated to america from britain in the late fifties by the time theyd arrived here the huac hearings had pretty well died down so she and max didnt know the names or histories of the key players but they were interested enough to follow me to the television after dinner we turned on the nine oclock news on channel to my surprise the show started not with olin taverners death but with the parents meeting at vina fields that catherine had mentioned i wouldnt have thought that was newsworthy but i guess angry rich people shouting at each other makes good theater the segment opened with beth blacksin standing in front of vina fields this discreet stone facade hides the entrance to a chicago power institution its here that grahams bayards felittis and other chicagoans whose names spell clout send their children its a mile from the cabrim green housing projects but a lightyear from the turmoil of an innercity school no gangs no guns here but lately this calm building has itself been caught up in turmoil over whether theyve been harboring not street gangs but an international terrorist parents and administrators have been anguishing over whether student records including what books students check out of the library should be open to law enforcement agencies at the center of this upheaval is an egyptian dishwasher benjamin sadawi who disappeared three weeks ago the station showed a photo of the youth in the white shirt and tie mr contreras and i had seen last night the justice department claims he fled to his terrorist cells hideout they want to examine all school records to see if these might shed some light on his disappearance the first freedoms forum is trying to intervene to keep the justice department out of school files we spoke to lawyer judith ohana before the meeting judith whats at stake here a tall slim woman took the mike with practiced ease this is basically a witchhunt beth if one of the children from this school was in cairo and the army came in to confiscate books and papers and computers because of a rumor about a missing dishwasher everyone in america would be outraged thats whats happening here a few parents are fanning the flames of mob hysteria do they really want their childrens private thoughts to be the bedtime reading of fbi or ins agents beth then took us inside the school so we could watch the parents discuss what they wanted school administrators to do people were screaming at each other with the hearty venom of a hockey game an angry man came to the center mike to say his daughter was a student at vina fields my childs safety is paramount i wont have the school sheltering terrorists because of some first amendment gobbledygook that puts my childs life at risk other parents jumped into the fray then renee bayard came to the mike she was still wearing the red dress which stood out vividly against the gray suits and ties around her we all want our children to be safe in school at home on the streets in the air when our children are at risk we dont care about law or justice or abstractions we only care about their safety im the same way and thats why i dont want police agents meddling in my granddaughters school records i dont want some private opinion my daughter put in an essay scrutinized by the fbi to see whether shes a security risk adolescents think in extremes its their nature if they have to secondguess everything they write or read then pretty soon well have a country of robots we wont have the freethinking creative young people who have the zest for experiment even for risk that makes american business lead the world the camera cut away during another angry salvo from the man who objected to first amendment gobbledygook that was renee bayard ceo of bayard publishing beth said her husband calvin a leading first amendment advocate fought memorable battles with chicago lawyer olin taverner who died today at ninetyone stay with us after the news for chicago talks when well be discussing olin taverners life and career renee bayard will describe her husbands clashes with taverner in the house of representatives for now im beth blacksin live at vina fields academy on chicagos gold coast a battery of commercials came on lotty muted the sound could the fbi really have put that kid in custody without telling his mother or anyone at the school max was troubled i grimaced morrell just did a story for margent about a pakistani immigrant who vanished from his uptown apartment last october his family searched frantically for him but it was only after the guy died out in coo hs prison that the feds told his sons theyd been holding the father for eleven weeks i did the local legwork for morrell on thatit seems a neighbor had reported seeing a suspiciouslooking van pull up on september with a large box turned out to be a new toilet but by then the fbi had moved on and ins didnt think that bit of information was relevant and this boy they could do that to a child lotty demanded hes sixteen or seventeen if he really is a terrorist thats plenty old enough to be planning something so you believe the fbi or whoever it is has a right to turn the school upside down looking for him i didnt say that just that in the context of terror kids younger than he is are making and using bombs as to whether the feds have the righti dont know what rights this patriot act gives them if hes an undocumented immigrant the kid doesnt have any rights under the new lawbut whether that extends to the place where he worked well i guess thats why first freedoms jumped in here to test the acts limits max and lotty looked at each other theyd met in london as child refugees from nazi europe where theyd seen their own families and friends arrested and killed without being charged or tried neither of them spoke until lotty quietly said shed make me a hot drink to help my cold when i started to follow her max shook his head at me by the time she came back with a mug of something soothing and lemony the interminable weather report and endless commercials were over lotty returned as dennis logan gave his provocative introduction to his interview with renee i didnt realize this was a gossip show dennis renee responded its been many years since my husband saw olin taverner except to say hello of course they grew up in the same milieu and knew the same people you dont walk out of a meeting with a senator or a governor just because you dont like one of his other guests but your husband must have felt strongly about seeing the man who tried to ruin him accepted at many of the same political and social gatherings you attended renee leaned forward her heavy brows meeting above her nose you know calvin and i were so busy building up bayard publishing and then the foundationlooking after the first amendment shouldnt have to be such a fulltime job but it isthat we didnt have time to think about olin taverner of course we used to see him at the symphony or the chicago club but once he moved into his retirement apartment he stopped coming into the city i hadnt thought about him for a long time you didnt think about him even though some commentatorsincluding your own sonhave been urging us to revisit the mccarthy era and see people like taverner or congressman bushnell as american heroes trying to protect the country from internal enemies dennis looked as earnest as if he knew or cared what he was talking about what he really wanted was to provoke renee into some onair reaction but she had her advice to catherine well in hand rise above it i think its dangerous when we start to turn people who want to subvert the constitution into heroes we need to think especially carefully about that these days where were making it hard to hear any dissent from our current governments policies but unlike some of our talkshow hosts and editorial writers i dont believe those who disagree with me should be jailed or hounded out of the country all i want is for them to respect my right to hold differing views from theirs even though your own son has been among those leading the charge renee bayards smile grew wooden edwardss essays in commentary and the national review havent been leading a charge dennis he takes a different tack on the issues than his father and i mightbut at least i know that we raised a child who can think for himself childof course hes a grown man now with a daughter calvin and i are incredibly proud of she insisted on joining me in the studio tonight dennis looked a little sour as the camera moved away from him to a glowing catherine seated at the corner of the studio he started talking to force the camera back to his face speaking of jailing people who disagree with us renee people have often wondered how your husband walked away from those hearings without either a contempt citation or a sentence there was no reason for calvin to be in prison he committed no crime and he was never charged with one however much our son dis agrees with our politics i dont believe he would claim his father should be put in prison but calvin was a member of the committee for social thought and justice logan persisted and he refused to answer questions about it to congress that interview was shown on television i found an old copy this afternoon when we were looking for footage on olin taverner renee looked startled as the grainy blackandwhite tape began to run it took us back to the old house hearing rooms with men in the doublebreasted suits of the day i recognized calvin bayard at once his lean face pale hair even the goodhumored smile with which he greeted someone behind him were much as theyd been when he spoke to my law school class twenty years later he sat alone at a table facing the committee not even a lawyer at his side his long legs stretched out in a pantomime of the man at ease on a raised dais six men faced him from behind a nest of microphones channel had written the mens names in white above their heads olin taverner austere hair combed back from his forehead looked like the model for the upright public man in contrast congressman walker bushnell the committee chair had a face as round as a lollipop his buzzcut hair turned him into the caricature of a thug taverner spoke first you were at a meeting of the committee for social thought and justice on june in eagle river wisconsin were you not mr bayard calvin bayard chuckled i attend a great many meetings olin just as you do i dont remember all the names and dates you must have an amazing calculating machine in your head if you can remember the exact date of meetings that far back taverner leaned forward we have testimony from other witnesses whose memories are good that you were in eagle river on june do you dispute this bayard answered impatiently i cant discuss the matter because i dont know whether you had testimony or not and i dont know who did or didnt provide it taverner slapped the tabletop we have reliable testimony that you were at this meeting who else was present with you bayard hooked his fingers in his belt loops and leaned back in his seat mr chairman when mr taverner and i were boys in rural illinois we often found weasels and rats prowling around our henhouse they like to slide through the cracks under cover of dark the weasel doesnt come out in broad daylight and meet you face to face the way a dog will now i wouldnt like to characterize any of my distinguished friends in the publishing or entertainment industry this way or even those serving this committee because every man at the end of the day has to face his own conscience in the privacy of his bedchamber and my conscience may tell me something different than what yours or those of my friends do but slithering around under cover of darkness or under pretense of patriotism why my dog would know what to do with a creature that acted like that a gasp went up among the spectators in the committee room taverner himself started to shout something but walker bushnell silenced him by reaching across to put a hand over taverners microphone so you refuse to tell this committee who was at the meeting with you on june bushnell said bayard looked at him steadily mr chairman the greatest pleasure americas enemies have is seeing her leaders attack our cornerstone the right to free speech a free press free association i will not give succor to our enemies by violating those rights the tape ended there the camera tonight flashed back on renee bayard she was dabbing tears away from the corners of her eyes i felt pretty sniffy myself dennis logan said that was a fine speech your husband gave but people are still left wondering why it moved olin taverner and walker bushnell after all your husband was the only person who ever got olin taverner to let go once hed dug his heels in but calvin didnt name names he didnt go to prison he wasnt even fined what was his secret poor calvin with all the work he did to allow people like you to say whatever you want whenever you wantand all you want is to put him behind bars renee that isnt fair is it its a legitimate question now that olin taverner is dead is there any harm in letting us know how your husband persuaded him to leave him in peace calvin always had a great deal of charm this time her smile held genuine warmtheven a touch of mischief which made her seem suddenly appealing he charmed me right out of vassar when i was twenty he might have been able to charm walker bushnell too although it would have been heavy work youre too young to have known the congressman werent you dennis but i typed up some of the logan could feel the interview slipping out of his control and hastily said we had hoped for a comment from calvin on taverners passing but he wouldnt come to the phone the heavy lines settled back in renee bayards face on olins death you mean calvin hates euphemisms for the most common acts of our bodies and nothing is more common to us all than death logan conceded defeat when we come back more on olin taverner and the house committee he served this time with a team of constitutional scholars renee thank you for coming in i know this cant have been an easy evening for you the station shifted to a commercial before renees answer came on lotty switched off the set id say game set and match to the lady max said he wanted something that he couldnt get from her it was very moving that old piece they ran lotty added id never paid much attention to those hearings but how extraordinary that their son is betraying them not betraying them i objected they raised him to think for himself hes not thinking for himself lotty said hes echoing what every other rightwing lunatic in america is saying what i want to know is why hes living in washington while his kid is in chicago with her grandmother and how he came to think so differently on politics from his parents and why calvin bayard has no comment on taverners death and a lot of other stuff thats none of my business im going to take my sore nose home to bed although whatever you put in this drink lorry i feel a whole lot better thanksfor everything she and max saw me to the elevator their arms around each other riding down the elevator i felt both the assurance one gets from seeing others in love and the pang of feeling separate from the world of lovers chapter house of the dead tome the south side has always meant the brokendown mills of south chicago where i grew up when i got a scholarship to the university of chicago four miles up the lake from my home i used to scoff at hyde parkers with their big yards and their kids in expensive schools and camps for claiming to be south sidersthey might live below madison street but they were more at home in the restaurants and theaters on the far side of the loop bronzeville where marcus whitby had bought a house was yet a different south side one i only knew secondhand i got there early enough to do a little exploring whether because of lottys magic potion or because geraldine graham let me sleep through the night id woken early with more energy than id had lately i took the dogs for a brisk walk went to my office to check messages and complete a reportand still reached twentysixth and king where bronzeville starts before eightthirty i paused in front of a statue commemorating the great wave of black immigration into the city driving on down king to thirtyfifth street i passed the husks of the businesses that used to make up the socalled black metropolis as aretha cummings whitbys assistant said yesterday no one wants those old segregation days back but it was painful to see the wreck of buildings that once had been the heart of a vital community the same thing has happened in south chicago i can hardly bear to return to the scenes of my youth because of my old neighborhoods rotting buildings but south chicago has forty percent unemployment and the highest murder rate in the city while bronzeville is on its way back true many of the businesses around me were dilapidated but an art deco building on the corner of thirtyfifth and king had been turned into an insurance company and the stately mansions that lined both sides of the boulevard looked well maintained marcus whitby had bought a town house on giles a short narrow street just west of king drive i found a parking space on the corner of giles and thirtyseventh and walked back up the street to the address id found on nexis some of the houses on giles seemed to be teetering on their last beams with broken windows and sagging roofs others had been restored even beyond their original beauty with the addition of painted victorian curlicues on the porches and window trim most like whitbys own fell somewhere in between i stood on the pavement staring at it as if i could learn something about whitbys life from studying his home it had been built high and narrow to fit on a small lot the dark red brick was old cracked in many places but freshly mortared the modest porch and wood trim around the windows patched and painted louvered blinds were drawn on all three floors making the house look forbidding its empty eyes closed to the world children straggled out of the nearby houses backpack laden on their way to school they flowed around me like fish parting around a piece of pilingi was a grownup nonexistent for the adults heading to work it was a different story i stood out as a stranger and a white one to boot several people stopped to ask i i needed help when i told them i was just waiting for someone they eyed me narrowly white suburbanites come into the black south side to buy drugs so they can keep their own little towns clean and crimefree id dressed soberly in my greenandblackstriped wool to look both respectful of the dead and professionally competentbut that didnt prove i wasnt a crackhead if anyone probed further i told them who i was and asked what they knew of marcus whitby people responded charily not willing to discuss the dead man with a stranger but i got the impression his neighbors hadnt known him well oh yes he got on with everyone but he kept himself to himself not that he was mean in any way not at allif you needed your car jumped or help installing a window he pitched in he just didnt sit out on the porch at night joining in the neighborhood chitchat none of the adults who stopped remembered seeing whitby on sunday night but a tenyearold waiting impatiently while her father questioned me said shed seen whitby come home he was out all afternoon then on his way home he stopped at the corner for milk we saw him because me and tanya went up there to get a snickers bar then he went out again about nine oclock how do you know i asked me and tanya were jumping rope we saw him walking up toward thirtyfifth street what in the middle of the night her father thundered how many times i know i know i cut in hastily its dangerous but you do it in the street because you can see under the lightsmy girlfriends and i always used to no matter how many times my mother yelled at us not to so you saw marcus whitby leave she nodded a wary eye on her father he locked his door called to us to be careful and headed on up the street was he in a hurry i asked she flung up her hands i dont know me and tanya we didnt pay special notice to him maybe hed parked up the street and drove off i suggested do you know what his car looked like when she pointed at a green saturn sl across the street i said thats what his looked like a green fourdoor no she said annoyed with my stupidity thats his car youre positive is that where it was sunday night i dunno she was tired of answering questions we didnt think nothin of it he took the bus to work most days then we saw he was dead daddy im going to be late and miss stetson shell give me detention please drive me please yeah okay but you know i dont want you jumping rope in the street and was kansa part of your group sunday night because if she was you are definitely they climbed into a car before i heard what she definitely was i crossed the street to look at whitbys saturn underneath a film of dust the body was in mint condition no dings or scratches except for a dent in the left front fender i peered into it cupping my hands against the glare if i could believe the girls hed left on foot where had he been going and how had he gotten out to new solway a cab pulled up in front of whitbys house amy blount hopped out of the front seat and opened the back door to help out a dimunitive woman in a severe black suit and hat a man slowly climbed out of the other door followed by harriet so the whole whitby family had arrived i sucked in a breath this could make things more complicated the man bent over the drivers window to pay the fare when i stepped forward mrs whitby turned to look at me i couldnt see her face even in high heels she only stood about five foot two and the hat brim shielded everything but her chin i made conventional noises of condolence and introduced myself yes its very difficult she said in a dry dead voice but since my daughter and my husband want you to pry open my sons life i thought i should make the effort and come out to see you poor marcus i couldnt protect him in life i dont know why i think i can protect him in death harriet bit her lip shed obviously been hearing these sentiments for the last twentyfour hours she introduced her father a tall thickset man i guessed he was in his fifties but he was walking with the stoop of someone older and frailer so youre the woman who found marc i dont understand it i dont understand it at all and you think you can explain it find out why he was out there how he came to die amy stepped forward with determined briskness and asked if id been inside yet i was waiting for the family i said when is ms murchison getting here she had already arrived she must have stood inside the doorway watching while i talked to the neighbors because before we had sorted out the protocol of who went first and whether mr whitby or harriet would support her mother up the five steep stairs to the front door rita murchison opened it like me like mrs whitby and her daughter rita murchison was wearing a dark suit chosen to prove she wasnt a cleaning woman but a legitimate mourner she didnt step back as our awkward group converged on the small concrete stoop i was afraid she was going to demand ids before shed let us in i moved forward forcing her to retreat thanks for coming over here ms murchison was this your usual day to clean for mr whitby she scowled at me im a housekeeper you look after the house i said meaning you live here what time did mr whitby go out on sunday i dont live here but i do look after the house mrs whitby pushed past me and rita murchison into the hall the rest of the family followed her leaving me alone with the housekeeper so when you were looking after the house on sunday i persisted causing her to say she was a christian she certainly didnt work on sundays on monday then i asked after a stubborn minute she finally admitted that she only came in on fridays for four hours he was a bachelor he lived a simple life he didnt need a lot of help behind us mrs whitby said i had no idea this neighborhood collected so much dust because im sure you must have gone over this last friday and yet here we are on thursday kneedeep in dust rita murchison wheeled around i peered over her shoulder down the narrow hallway to the staircase which rose halfway down its length mrs whitby had found the light switches a spotlight was trained on a framed poster on the stairwell wall it showed the silhouette of an african dancer back arched in the social realist style of the thirties around the sleek figure was an intricate design of african prints and masks the federal negro theater presents proclaimed the header and underneath kylie ballantines ballet noir of chicago april the ingleside theater the light also revealed a thin film of dust along the edges of the stairs mrs whitby stood there inspecting her finger rita murchison surged forward prepared for battle harriet put her arm around her mother trying to persuade her not to worry about dust when marc was dead i slid away from the trio into the room on my right amy blount followed me i tried to persuade mrs w to stay at the hotel but i could hardly blame her for wanting to see her sons house shes been wanting to fight someone all week anyone to distract her from her distress over marc when harriet and i wouldnt play i thought for sure shed take you on i grinned i thought she would too lets leave them to it and see if we can find any trace of his notes or a diary or anything that would tell us why he went out to new solway amy nodded its not that big a place its got three floors but only nine rooms and he didnt really use the third floor at all his study was on the second floor next to the bedroom want to start there we can go up a back staircase from the kitchen you spend a lot of time here i asked we werent lovers if thats what you want to know amy said roughly we were friendsharriet and i were close at spelman i used to spend christmas with the family so even though marc was six years older than us i knew him through the family when he moved to chicago three years ago to take the job at tsquare i introduced him to people he was quiet not naturally outgoing not like harriet unless he was working on a storythen he would feel comfortable calling people and talking to them later he developed this interest in ballantine which began absorbing his spare time i followed her through a dining room to the kitchen and the back stairs our feet echoing on the uncarpeted floors whitby had masks from one of ballantines productions on the living room wall photographs from the swing mikado along the stairwell he even had a pair of ballantines toe shoes under a glass bell on his dresser hed also been rehabbing his house bit by bit the kitchen walls were scraped and painted hed put in a new stove and refrigerator but stacked all his pots and dishes on a trolley instead of buying cupboards the refrigerator held half a cooked skinless chicken breast skim milk orange juice and a carton of eggs no beer no wine was in sight only a bottle of makers mark about a quarter empty stood on a shelf with spices and pastas his drink amy said when she saw the bottle bourbon and branch hed begun work on a bathroom had finished two upstairs rooms his bedroom and the study but the rest of the house was still either halfbuilt or untouched books were housed neatly on boardandbrick shelves most dealt with black history and theater or with african art and dance he didnt seem to read much fiction next to his bed though he had a library copy of armand pelletiers a tale of two countries the first novel calvin bayard had published when hed taken over the pressbayard publishings first nonreligious novel amy was right about the search in this bare place it took very little time i pulled latex gloves from my bag and handed her a pair well quarter the room i said everything you touch you put back exactly as you found it you think theres been a crime he left on foot sunday evening how did he get to new solway if he went out there to die surely he would have driven instead of taking a train to a remote town followed by a fivemile hike to that pond no one goes to that much work to kill themselves thenthe police if i can persuade one of my acquaintances there but first lets check this out ourselves amy was a scholar a dogged researcher she was willing to collect data before pushing me into further action she was thorough not as fast as me on her first search but careful and tidy we went through the drawers shelves looked in the books looked behind pictures under the neat stack of sweaters in his closet nothing nothing about kylie about the federal negro theater about new solway no datebook no notebooks we logged onto his laptop the wordprocessing files had been wiped clean nothing anywhere back in the kitchen harriet had somehow persuaded rita murchison and her mother to a ceasefire ms murchison was making coffee her lips a thin angry line mrs whitby was in the living room staring blankly at a photograph of her son in front of the old ingleside theater i had only seen marc whitby dead by flashlight in the picture he was smiling pointing at the theater doors but his essential seriousness was still evident despite having his fathers height he looked very like his mother with her slender bones and bronze skin i took that amy said we went on a walking tour of ballantines haunts and of ftp sites and he liked this one particularly mrs whitby clutched it to her breast her face finally cracking into grief my baby my baby she crooned harriet and amy pulled her to a chair and knelt on either side of her i went back to the kitchen to confront the angry housekeeper did anything in this house look different to you when you came in this morning dont start in on me about the dust ive had it if it wasnt for mr whitby being dead and me knowing him all this time i wouldnt stay around here to be insulted i dont care about dust or no dust i said its the house ive been looking for his papers theyre gone if youre accusing me of stealing she smacked the coffeepot down so hard the glass carafe broke now see what youve done listen to me for a minute i said my voice rising a half register in exasperation i know you and mrs whitby have been in each others hair but im not part of that fight i want to know where he kept his papers i want to know what you noticed when you came in maybe someone was here stealing them or maybe he kept them someplace else she began to pick up the pieces of glass the door it wasnt locked right i thought maybe he left in a hurry and forgot to put the deadbolt on but he was a careful man careful and saving you know because he didnt make a lot of money at that magazine and what he made he spent on this house this house and that dancer he was so crazy about but i never came here once all the years ive been working for him and found only the one lock on i nodded so someone had been in here did you ever find anyone here with him when you came in or signs of a lover he was a man he had a mans normal instincts i looked at her speculatively she wasnt that old and beneath her frown and ostentatious bustle she wasnt unattractive but when i put out a tentative question she bristled shed been interested and he hadnt it might explain her aggressive possessiveness when the whitbys arrived this morning something to ask the neighbors whether anyone had come and gone at odd hours an angry lover could have keys shehecould have driven marcus whitby out to a remote place to die in the meantime i went through the motions here asking rita murchison to come with me to the second floor to see what was out of place she opened the drawers and cupboards amy blount and i had already inspected but all she could tell me was that the stack of notebooks he usually had on his desktop was gone chapter burke and hare i found mr whitby in the basement inspecting the furnace he got a good model the one i told him to buy good fuel rating i told him he needed that up north here of course he knew all about winter going to the university of michigan like he did he wasnt good with his hands i never wanted him to have to be a handyman but i talked him through some of the work when he decided to do this house himself he was methodical he did things right you see how he laid that tile in the bathroom he called me we talked it through he did it right course a furnace i told him not to try installing that himself get a plumber spend the extra money but he bought the model i recommended i looked respectfully at the furnace for a few minutes before taking mr whitby upstairs to collect his family i persuaded rita murchison to give me her keys just a loan i said offering to pay her for the time shed taken to come here money and keys changed hands while the family lingered in the living room while i drove the family back to the drake i tried to urge mrs whitby to return to atlanta theres something serious going on here and i dont know how much time it will take before we can get it sorted out i know somethings serious she said in her leaden voice my son is dead but how he died i dont care how he died edwina her husband said edwina weve had all this out before now listen to the lady what do you mean missim sorry ive forgotten your name warshawski i said but people call me vi all of your sons papers are missing i think someone came back to his house with his keys and scooped up all his notes and computer files they even took time to wipe out his hard drive this is a street where the kids at least notice whos coming and going i might be able to canvass the neighbors and see if anyone noticed a stranger here sunday night in the meantime getting a proper autopsy performed is the most urgent task we need to know how marc died in the seat next to me mrs whitby moaned but didnt interrupt again i will be looking at everything your son was doing over the last few weeks i continued i dont expect anything terrible to emerge about him butif it comes to that i wont hide evidence of a crime within that constraint i will be working for you and my boy never did a criminal deed in his life mr whitby growled if youre trying to imply that he did well stop this business right now and take him home no sir im not implying that i just want you to be aware that an investigation like this doesnt follow a straight path i am not having any investigation done that frames my baby as a criminal mrs whitby said thats why i never wanted you to start your digging around in the first place i glanced in the rearview mirror and saw amy lean over to murmur something to harriet after a short dialogue harriet said vi isnt out to frame marc and if we dont let her finish the investigation well always have that nagging worry about why he did die and mama daddy you two should go home were spending a fortune on that hotel i can stay with amy untiluntil things are cleared up the office urged me to take all the time i need i just cant bear to go home with my baby lying in a drawer in the morgue mrs whitby fretted harrys right we cant afford to stay in that hotel for god knows how long mr whitby said but if you want to stay on we could move into marcs house i suppose not until a forensics team has been through it i said they argued it over among themselves while i turned onto lake shore drive the lake at its lowest level in a century looked sullen not the roiling of a usual stormy winter but the dull surface of a creature in retreat mrs whitby staring through the windshield seemed just as remote when i pulled up in front of the drake they still hadnt decided who would stay and who would go but mr whitby had agreed that i could go ahead with my business amy got out with them but after shed hugged harriet and her parents she climbed into the front seat i can drop you at the train i said but i dont have time to take you home i thought id ride with you see what kind of help you need i opened my mouth to protest but shut it again i did need help and amy blount was a skilled researcher i invited her to come with me to my office while i tried calling the cops well decide what to do next when i see what kind of reaction i get amy lifted her brows at the unorganized stacks of files but didnt say anything she perched on mary louises chair and watched me while i tried the police i started with terry finchley a detective in the first districts violent crimes unit terry had been mary louises boss when she was with the police he was also a close friend of a chicago cop id loved and lost and hes never quite forgiven me for how i treated conrad still weve sort of worked together several times and he takes my opinion seriously after id laid out such facts as i had finchley said its a jurisdictional problem vic he died out in dupage county hes their puppy but finch he lived here on the south side his cars here his house has been cleaned out a car in front of an empty house isnt evidence of a crime vic i cant send a forensics team down there or ask the twentyfirst district to order one in no crime has been committed there burglary on your sayso only he could have burned his papers he could have had a power surge and lost all his files no sale vic you can talk to the captain of course but i cant take it on the captain was bobby mallory my fathers oldest friend on the force like the finch he sort of respects my work without liking my doing it in his case it has nothing to do with my old lover and everything to do with my being his friends daughter he gave me less time than the finch had and finished by saying the last i heard your intuition wasnt considered grounds for chicago to demand jurisdiction of a body from dupage county we got five hundred unsolved homicides here in town im not creating a political stink by trying to catch fiveohone eileen wants to see you for dinner call her set up a date that nice boy of yours still being a hero in afghanistan hes over there being something i snapped you watch your step until he comes home meaning dont sleep around penelope even if ulysses is lying in the arms of a british journalist i hung up savagely on that thought youre not seeing me at my most effective i told amy but at least i can find out if the cook county me will do the autopsy privately i tried bryant vishnikov at the morgue but he had the day off when i reached him at home he snarled if id wanted live patients paging me day and night i wouldnt have gone into pathology i thought my home phone was unlisted anyway is it you didnt tell me that marc whitbys father wants a second autopsy performed on hi son would you be willing to do that he waited a minute toswer its something i do do and can do but its not something cook county can pay for vic and you know if i do a thorough autopsy and simplyfind that the guy drowned with alcohol in his system the family may not accept those results what would you charge for the tox screens and the time and space it could go as high as three thousand i had no idea what kind of resources the whitbys had but i told vishnikov to proceed and asked how we should get the body to him it would help to have a third party like a funeral director do it so i dont have to step on jerry hastingss toes by going to him direct so vic he added as i was preparing to hang up dont go babbling about this to the press it could be very hard on me politically to look as though im taking a public position against dupages me someones going to have to know i objected unless youre planning on stealing his body out of their morgue and doing this in your basement he burst out laughing youre outrageous warshawski making me sound like burke and hare but i still dont want this broadcast copy that houston i said your ass will be draped with the same discreet purple our government is using on the statues of justice he laughed again and hung up while id been on the phone amy had been organizing papers shed cleared a space on mary louises desktop and had spread out the contents of my larchmont file to study youre good she said looking up at me you dont bully unless its the only way do you what are you doing next want me to hold mrs whitbys hand while you move marcs body no i want you to find out everything you can about kylie ballantine she opened her eyes wide at me whatever foroh you think thats why marc went out to this mansion why i grimaced i dont know thats why but i only have a couple of starting points hes been thinking about her day and night for months hes writing a book about herand all his files have disappeared i pulled the printout on ballantine that aretha cummings had given me yesterday from my briefcase and handed it to amy blount id read it before i went to bedi summarized the high points for blount kylie ballantine had been both a dancer and an anthropologist shed been trained in classical ballet but shed gone to africa to study tribal dance in french equatorial africa modernday cameroon and gabon i was guessing on her return shed started the ballet noir a deliberate pun on diaghilevs ballets russes incorporating african dance into classical ballet using costumes and masks from africa with the negro theater project money shed done an ambitious ballet called regeneration which depicted an africanamerican sense of awakening and selfrespect as people reclaimed their african heritage itd be great to see that blount commented there probably arent films of it though what did she do after the theater project lost its funding she went back to africa i think i thumbed through the printout i know she wrote a couple of books on tribal dance and taught briefly at the university of chicago that must have been something special blount said dryly black woman at that school in the forties or fifties no wonder she took early retirement she took the printout from me to examine whitbys brief paragraph on that part of ballantines life it looks like marc was really only interested in her dance career and theni see she ran a private dance studio from her home in bronzeville until she died in seventynine okay ill see what else i can figure out what are you going to do go back to his house and canvass the neighbors it occurred to me private as he was there might have been a lover in the picture you and harriet never heard about the kids on that block see everything someone had to notice something about him amy looked at me speculatively from under her thick lashes you know im second to none as a researcher and id be glad to go online or down to the vivian harsh collection but im wondering if i wouldnt be more effective on that street than you i felt my cheeks grow hot but i remembered the cautious response id already received this morning the kids might talk to me as readily as to a black woman but the adults were more likely to be open with amy point taken do you have a cell phone we exchanged mobile numbers im not sure what i can pay you for thisi hadnt factored that into the estimate i gave harriet for taking the case but your help will make a big difference and i dont expect you to donate it she shook her head it feels good to be doing something even after marc moved here i didnt know him all that well but harryharrietis like my own sister doing something active to track down what happened to marc its the one thing i can do for her you dont need to be paying me chapter timmys in the well we spent some time online me looking for the negro theater project amy checking the trains to the western suburbs marc could have caught a ninethirty which would have set him down in the station nearest to new solway at tentwenty he still would have been miles from larchmont hall one of us would have to fit in time to hunt down any suburban cabs or buses that might have picked him up i ground my teeth at that prospect when the web yielded only two meager references to the negro theater project and none at all to kylie ballantine i drove the fifteen miles south to look at real documents in the vivian harsh collection amy took off for bronzeville when i left for the library shed described the harsh collection before we separated harsh whod been the first africanamerican to head a branch of the library had been a private collector of material on black writers and artists when she died she donated everythingphotos documents booksto the city the harsh collection was the best of its kind in america next to one in harlem to my surprise the papers were housed in a room off a major library branchid pictured the collection in its own building the library itself was doing a bustling business mostly with women bringing their young children in to look at books but also the usual collection of homeless and elderly that a library gathers its a respectable destination its warm you can be with other people all reasons why the web cannot take the place of your branch library also it had books and an archivist who knew and loved his collection at first gideon reed frowned over my request yes he knew those papers well but why did i want to see them i know marcus whitbys been looking at them for some time i said thats why im here when i explained my role in whitbys deathfinding him working for the familyand showed him my id the archivist unbent mr whitby had been a real scholar they didnt get many here mostly students working on term papers just wanting a few facts about martin luther king not that he didnt love showing young people how to use books and documents but there was something satisfying about seeing this collection in the hands of someone who truly appreciated it reed set me up in a temperaturecontrolled room with photographs of black poets and artists on the walls while gwendolyn brooks and langston hughes smiled down at me i went through the same papers that marcus whitby had studied the letters and other documents were encased in plastic sleeves i tried to skim looking for names or events that might mean something to me but ballantine had a fine spiderlike handwriting and shed often written in pencil making deciphering a maddening task she sometimes wrote on pages torn from school exercise books sometimes on thin green paper where her pale handwriting became even more undecipherable i read ballantines correspondence with franz boas at columbia over her discoveries in africa her correspondence with hallie flanagan about the staging of regeneration her angry letter to w e b duboiss wife after congress pulled the plug on the federal theater project we were doing good work we were doing important work the notion that a ballet like regeneration or your own swing mikado are communistinspired because we try to tell the truth about race in this countryis enough to make me look seriously at communism i dont know what i live on nowback to private dance classes for earnest little girls whose mothers tuck away a dime a week from washing white womens clothes so that their children can learn in my studio what would have been their birthright in africa the archive was patchy sometimes holding letters like ballantines to shirley graham without grahams response sometimes letters or typed notes to her without any way of telling what shed written to the correspondent several typed ones in the late forties came from an anonymous committee the committee is grateful for your involvement in the benefit we were able to raise which our patron matched the next committee meeting will be on june at the ingleside church right before the second world war ballantine somehow got a grant from the university of chicago to travel and study in africa how she spent the war years or where wasnt clear but in she signed a contract with university of chicago press for her book on ritual dance among the bantu of west equatorial africa they paid her five hundred dollars perhaps that was a standard advance in her second book dealt explicitly with slavery and the dances she was able to trace from america back to africa the longest leap african dance in american slavery didnt come from an academic press but from bayard publishing that was a bit of a surprise maybe ritual dance among the bantu had sold better than youd expect maybe ballantine had lived on her royalties or perhaps calvin bayard had known her personally and wanted to support her i stared at the bayard logo on the title page the jagged outline of a lion as if it could tell me something but finally turned to the book itself there were photographs of masks photographs of shyly smiling african girls demonstrating dance steps shyly smiling africanamerican girls demonstrating what were supposed to be similar stepsi couldnt tell from the pictures i read paragraphs here and there about where ballantine had been what she had seen how it compared with the dances she observed in the american south she wrote fiercely about the patronizing attitude of white america to black dance they ignore the history of civilizations far older than theirs african civilizations which each step and ritual encode in their eyes we africans exist shamelessly in the body and our dances are thought to be only a sign of our mindlessness leaving the mind itself to the high civilizations that think up atom bombs and gas chambers a yellowed article from the daily defender dated from gave a few biographical facts ballantine had been born in lawrence kansas in but her family had moved to chicago when she was six she had attended howard university where she studied anthropology and dance shed gone to columbia when franz boas was welcoming black students there and achieved a masters degree in anthropology before returning to chicago where she taught dance performed dance studied dance in the defenders photograph she was shown standing regally in front of a wall of african masks wearing a dancers leotard and an africanprint skirt the reporter had been more interested in her dance than in her academic career he burbled in print over her energythere she was sixtysix still dancing four hours a day still teaching children in her bronzeville home he hadnt asked how shed spent the years from to except to discuss her trips to africabesides the two id already read about shed lived in gabon for three years following its independence the reporter did ask whether she felt any bitterness toward her treatment in the late fifties and she had said that bitterness only wasted ones energy i skimmed the rest of the papers hoping for a diary or something personal but there wasnt much else here a letter from the university of chicago provost dated october coldly stating that they would not need her services after the end of the fall quarter but there was nothing from her to the university her contract with bayard a onepage document offering her seven hundred dollars not the advance of a commercially successful writer after all calvin bayards bold thick signature stood out against the faded paper making him seem vividly present in the room it seemed odd for a commercial press to publish a book with such an academic title had he and kylie ballantine been friends or even lovers bayard had published her they lived in the same townif you thought the gold coast and bronzeville were the same town if bayard had known ballantine personally that could easily explain why marc had gone to new solway on sunday eveningto see what calvin bayard remembered of her i stacked everything in a tidy pile to return to the archivist gideon reed was talking earnestly to a teenage boy showing him something in a fat reference book when i handed him the stack of ballantine documents reed gave me a kind smile did you find anything useful nothing that shed direct light on what might have taken marcus whitby out to new solway its a bit of a stretch but the longest leap was published by calvin bayard he lives out there so im going to drive out see if whitby tried to talk to him about kylie ballantine did whitby ever mention bayard reed shook his head its not like i saw him that often im sure he did a lot of research i never knew anything aboutand of course he worked full time he had a lot of other stories to cover i read ms ballantines interview in the defender do you know what happened to her in the fifties the reporter asked if she were bitterwas that because of the u of c firing her the archivist turned reflexively to the article but didnt look at it mr whitby was guessing shed been blacklisted but i dont think hed found any evidence to confirm that she was never called to testify before congress and except for that one letter im sure you saw the one she wrote when she was so angry about congress canceling the theater project she never discussed communism what about something called the committee you know the one i mean could that have been considered a subversive group he flipped through the plastic sleeves until he found the references but he couldnt shed any light on them i know mr whitby wrote for her file under the freedom of information act but its like so many of those files most of what you want to know is inked out so you cant read it since september theyve made it harder to find out what records theyre keeping on the citizens its kind of frustrating our own government spying on us then not letting us see what they claim weve been up to when i asked if there were other ballantine papers anywherea diary or financial records reed shook his head again if there are theyre not in a public archive her estate didnt amount to much and even though she was highly respected in the black community no one had the kind of money to do preservation or restoration in her homeit had to be sold to pay her debts if there was some kind of trove of documents im thinking theyre in the cid landfill by now reed paused to answer a question from a woman whod been waiting for several minutes then turned back to me mr whitby did go through her old house after she died the bank or whoever bought it cut it into a bunch of little apartments but mr whitby hoped something might have been left in a basement or crawl space did he find anything reed slowly shook his head that may have been why he called me maybe a week or ten days ago i wasnt in and he left a message for me i never did reach him when i tried calling back but that could have been ithe knew i shared his interest in kylie if hed found some papers well he would have wanted to show them to me another patron was trying to get the archivists attention i turned to leave feeling frustrated at how little information i was able to collect as i walked away from his desk reed called out to me let me know what you find out about mr whitby if you get to the truth it may not make the evening news you know a sad commentary kylie ballantines life should have been seen on stage under spotlights but shed died in the wings and now gideon reed was afraid her lone champion was going to vanish into the same shadows i imagined melodramatic statements i might make picturing myself as annie oakley riding to the rescue of both ballantine and marcus whitby maybe i was just lassie the dog though barking around frantically for help timmys in the well i said aloud as i unlocked my car a woman with a couple of toddlers passed me just then but she barely spared me a glance people saying odd things to themselves are commonplace at the public library after all chapter crocodile in the moat im going out to new solway i told amy blount when i reached her on her cell phone i didnt find anything definite in the ballantine papers but theres a possibility that marc tried seeing calvin bayard who published one of ballantines books i want to talk to mr bayard if i can get inhis wife has a sharkfilled moat dug around him did you find out anything like you nothing definite the woman who lives on marcs south side thinks she saw lights at three yesterday morningshes got a newborn who woke her up around then and she was rocking by the window but she wasnt really paying attention she couldnt be a hundred percent sure it was sundayshes up most nights and shes pretty sleep deprived and anyway she didnt look at the front walk so she wouldnt know if it was marc or an intruder the old man across the street he save marc bring a woman home with him once or twice but no one had spent the night here for several months as far as the local gossip columns know i was on ninetyfifth street heading west to the tollway doing the worst kind of driving the steering wheel wedged between my knees one hand on the cell phone one on a raspberry smoothie id picked up in lieu of lunch when i had to brake for a semi that suddenly changed lanes i dropped the smoothie i swore and pulled over to the curb where i daubed pink liquid from my greenstriped trousers id lost the connection by the time i finished with my clothes when i redialed i asked how many people amy had left to talk to she hadnt reached the neighbor on his north or the kidsschool wouldnt get out for another hour if you have the time stay down there until you talk to some of the kids what about the autopsy have the whitbys come to a definite decision on that they have then ill find a funeral director who will get mares body from dupage and deliver it to bryant vishnikov that was the kind of detail mary louise neely knew from her years of police work id give her a quick call at her fancy new office finally i said to amy do you think harriet is up to a trip to tsquare im wondering if simon hendricksmares editorknows more than he would tell me about mares current project maybe hed be more forthcoming with you and harriet what should i say amy asked mares assistantaretha cummingsthinks hendricks was jealous of mares abilities start with aretha see if you can get something specific to use as a lever usually two emotions start people talkingresentment or sympathy so try to get hendricks feeling sorry for harriet and the whitbys talk about their need for closure but if that doesnt work see if anything aretha tells you will goad him into revealing something augustus llewellyn he owns tsquare and all those other magazines has a policy against talking to anyone at bayard i want to know if thats truly a policy about not going to any competing publisher or if theres some specific issue between llewellyns enterprise and bayards the guy in the cubicle next to marc jason tompkin seems willing to talk i can try she said doubtfully but im not very skillful sorting out office politics i was about to give her a hearty pep talk but her words triggered a memory from my encounter with renee bayard i think youre up to the jobbut there is something you might find on the web or the sec or even from aretha cummings calvin bayard helped llewellyn get his original financing theres some history there something that made renee bayard think llewellyn wouldnt respond to a call from her see if you can pick up anything on that if i manage to see calvin bayard ill ask him too lets talk tonight okay while i finished my smoothie i called mary louise we had a quick chat about her new job which she confided was more work and less excitement than shed hoped for as id thought she knew a funeral director whose fees were reasonable and who knew the ropes at the county morgues first i called deputy protheroe and told her the paperwork on marc whitbys body might be getting ready to show up then i called mary louises funeral director who set up the transfer for the next morning finally i left a message on vishnikovs voice mail to tell him to expect marc whitbys body only then did i reenter traffic with both hands on the wheel i was the model of the good driver feeling superior to the people with books propped on steering wheels cell phones in ears hamburgers in mouths as if to reward me i had an easy run all the way from kedzie to the tollway and made it to the warrenville road exit well ahead of the afternoon rush when i reached the turnoff to coverdale lane i pulled over to inspect my detail map the woods behind larchmont hall belonged to a sort of common area in the middle of new solway the bayard and larchmont estates were about four miles apart if you followed the road but only a mile if you went through the woods i supposed thats what catherine did sunday nightskittered through the underbrush home even if i hadnt fallen in on top of marc whitby i probably couldnt have kept up with her in the dark through woods she knew well all the way out to new solway id tried to think of a persuasive argument to get me into the bayard house nothing came to me maybe id park at larchmont and cut through the woods myself but when i found coverdale lane the gates to the bayard estate stood open i turned through the stone gateposts onto the carriageway after winding about half a mile through old trees i came to a fourstory mansion its stone facade aged to a golden gray like larchmont the bayard grounds also held a series of outbuildings garage stable greenhouses a barn the surrounding gardens and meadows fed into the woods in front of the house the drive split in three one fork leading to the garage one to the other outbuildings and the third along the left side of the house itself where a discreet sign pointed to a tradesmans entrance the main entrance where i pulled up faced south shallow steps led to a porticoed doorway i could hear voices from around the north side of the mansion so i climbed out of the mustang and followed the sign to the tradesmans entrance a van and a small truck were parked there three men were unloading supplies while a woman in blue jeans and a black turtleneck and blazer supervised in the near distance someone was doing something with hay and a wagon how bucolic almost justifying calling this spread rural illinois as calvin bayard had done in the testimony id watched last night out in his overalls at four in the morning like all the other illinois farm boys who had fortyroom palaces to protect from weasels thatll see you through the weekend ruth one of the men laughed loudly and handed a clipboard to the woman the woman in black signed frowning at his familiarity but he laughed again clapping her on the shoulder telling her hed be back first thing monday he slammed the back panels of the van shut and jumped into the drivers seat whistling danny boy in a cheerful tuneless way the back panels proclaimed home bodyfor all your home care needs in green cursive the other two men were unloading groceries from the truck ruth checked each item before letting it into the house miss catherine doesnt like this brand of yogurt why didnt you bring the bulgarian and we specified teriyaki tofu she wont touch the hawaiian this was the woman whod answered the phone when i called pretending to be one of calvin bayards old interns i hoped id been so much hoarser yesterday that she wouldnt recognize my voice today the man explained that the bulgarian yogurt was past its shelf date ruth told him sharply to bring some when he came back on friday even i he had to go into chicago for it if id thought about it i would have guessed catherine bayard would be a vegetarian she was rich she could be a picky vegetarian ruth scowled in my direction and told me shed be with me in a minute youre not with the media are you if you are youd better leave now we have nothing to say to you the media people always say this as if it were some foul disease youre not with the cholera pouring out of the sewer are you and yet we worship and bow down before the televisions eye i meekly denied connection to the sewage ruth finished her work with the men telling them they could have coffee in the kitchen before turning back to me yes trying to pitch my voice higher to disguise it from yesterdays croak i explained that i was a detective investigating marcus whitbys death you know that mr whitby died in the larchmont pond sunday night i watch the news yes i saw that story that he had come out here to end his life and i fail to see why that means you can bother us oh thats a story sheriff salvi put out to calm down the community i said carelessly we know better than that can step you through the evidence that shows mr whitby didnt go into that pond on his own but youre probably more interested in his connection to the bayard family she frowned more deeply but didnt say anything we know mr whitby came out here to see mr bayard because that is a lie mr bayard has seen no one this week because mr whitby was writing about one of mr bayards authors i continued as if she hadnt spoken kylie ballantine who had such a difficult time in the fifties and sixties perhaps mr bayard didnt talk to mr whitby but he did come out here didnt he she paused as if deciding what she could reveal then said the man telephoned but we dont allow journalists to talk to mr bayard so you sent him to ms renee bayard in chicago but she wasnt helpful and he came out here hoping to gatecrash i held up a hand to forestall a further objection we know catherine was at larchmont both sunday and monday nights she told me her grandfather you are full of lies ruth said scornfully catherine was in the city monday night as she always is during the school year and she certainly had no reason to be at larchmont either of those nights i talked to catherine yesterday afternoon she was certainly out here monday night we can call her i looked at my watch schools out for the day unless she has lacrosse practice shes probably with her friends either at banks street or the coffee shop they go togrounds for delight its called i dont have her cell phone number but you probably do it was a bit of a gamblei had no idea what catherine would say if the housekeeper called my bluffso i only paused briefly before adding ill be honest with you catherine would not tell me what she was doing at larchmont but she says that when her grandfather cant sleep he goes over there that he has a key and she sometimes goes with himthey like the privacy at larchmont hall a key to someone elses house i never heard such a ridiculous suggestion she sounded fierce but her eyes were moving uneasily between me and the house i pulled out my cell phone i agree it sounds ridiculous but thats what catherine told me lets call her to check on that all i really want to know was if mr bayard did go to larchmont if he did see mr whitby im trying to find the person who last saw him alive ruth looked again from me to the house hers wasnt really an indecisive nature after a moments further hesitation she ordered me to come with her i followed her through the side door to an areaway where people left coats and muddy boots beyond that another door opened onto the kitchen where the two deliverymen were drinking coffee and laughing with someone out of my field of sight on our right i could see the food cartons stacked in a pantry ruth whisked me past a back staircase whose narrow pine steps presaged perilous journeys for anyone carrying laundry or logs or whatever had to be hauled up and down we passed through a swinging door into the body of the house where the hall immediately widened something dark and highly polished with thick blue runners down the middle replaced the pine flooring our feet whispered in the blue pile ruth moved so fast that i almost had to trot to keep up with her so i got only a blurry sense of a dining room with a vast table loaded with silver followed by a series of doors to smaller rooms and pale walls hung with art of the kind people like me see only in museums when we reached the east end of the hall ruth opened the door into a small anteroom and commanded me to remain there she continued down a right turn in the hall heading to the front of the house the little room was primly furnished with a couple of hard chairs standing in front of an empty grate mullioned windows gave a view of the back of the property a series of gardens stairstepped down to a small stream beyond which lay new solways communal wood i stared out the window at the bare trees a couple of deer stepped out of the woods into the gardens a border collie raced out to drive them back into the woods a man appeared whistling the collie to his side the two disappeared toward the outbuildings with the live figures gone from the landscape i turned away looking for something to read or do as the minutes ticked past the room held that sense of despair you feel in any waiting area no one worked or lived here they only waited for someone to make decisions about them like at the doctor i abruptly went down the hall in the direction ruth had taken this took me to the main entryway where an ornately carved staircase rose from a marble floor lifesized portraits of bygone bayards were hung on the walls i prefered marcus whitbys simple staircase with its poster of kylie ballantines ballet noir but i backed up to get a better look at a stern woman in mauve silk wondering if she was the mrs edwards bayard who had gone to the opening of larchmont hall in i could see a resemblance to young catherine and to calvin bayard in the narrow planes of her face not the great beauty geraldine grahams mother had been i heard ruths voice above me and slid around behind the stairwell where the balustrade formed an alcove all you have to tell her is that he was asleep and in bed but you know if this happens again i will have to talk to mrs renee about it a second woman mumbled something inaudible i hurried back down the hall to the anteroom the thick carpeting muffling my steps i managed to be standing at the window gazing outside with supreme indifference when ruth reappeared the mumbler was a woman in her thirties with a bony anxious face like ruth she wore jeans not a uniform and had on a heavy gray cardigan over a faded tshirt this is theresa jakes ruth fished my card out of her blazer pocket and did a creditable job in pronouncing my name mr bayard has been ill and theresa is helping mrs bayard nurse him theresas hands were red from much scrubbing she tucked them nunlike into the sleeves of her cardigan and looked at me nervously i repeated my little speech did you take a phone call from marcus whitby did you try to arrange for mr bayard to see him theresa shook her head i know better than to let journalists come here its mrs bayards strictest order anyone who wants an interview has to talk to her in town no one can bother mr bayard here at home could he have taken the call himself i asked theresa looked helplessly at ruth lantner there is a phone in his room but weve turned off the ringer so it wont bother him unless hei guess i could check it but he did go out sunday and monday night right i said plowing forward despite my growing uncertainty was it you who brought him home he wasnt out theresa said he was sleeping sleeping heavily you were with him all night i asked he doesnt need someone in the room with him theresa said he doesnt have that kind of illness but if he leaves an alarm goes off over my bed so that i can make sure hes all right and that alarm never sounded i persisted hoping to get some inkling about what shed done that ruth was going to report the next time it happenedsince whatever it was explained why id been admitted to the house its funny because young catherine emphasized that shed used his key to get into larchmont hall theresa made a little dismayed face at ruth who shook her head at the other woman and said catherine wasnt here monday night mr bayard did not leave the house on monday or on sunday whatever scheme you have in mind if something hadnt happened here you wouldnt have let me into the house at all i cut in ruthlessly i have the names of everyone who lives here one of them will talk to me and tell me the truth the men can tell you nothing that i dont already know ruth said with finality theresa you go back upstairs to mr calvin so tyrone can get on with the vacuuming theresa put her chapped red hands into her pockets and scuttled down the hall toward the main staircase i couldnt think of any way to press my point if ruth had seen whitby or any strangers sunday night she wasnt going to tell me if calvin bayard had left the house despite whatever illness he had she wasnt going to tell me that either i might be able to find a way to talk to the men working with the hay but it wouldnt happen today under ruths stern eye theresa looked as though shed be more likely to crack but it would take me some time to find a way to talk to her alone i wryly conceded the field to ruth shaking her hand thanking her for her help i started down the hall toward the front door but ruth called to me to follow her back the way wed come i smiled blandly my car is right outside the main entrance its ridiculous for me to use the side door before she could order me out of the front hall calvin bayard suddenly lurched around the edge of the great staircase and headed toward us calling renee renee theresa walked next to him a chapped hand on his arm renee isnt here mr bayard shes at work right now with her patient she was a different person assured gentle her anxiety gone renee this woman wont go away i dont like her make her go away calvin bayard plucked at theresas hand looking at ruth whose short dark hair and stocky build did give her a vague resemblance to renee bayard the voice that id loved as a student was still deep but it had become tremulous and uncertain his face with its long narrow hollows had shrunk and turned pinkish whatever illness id imagined hadnt come close to this i dug my nails into my palms to keep from crying out in dismay he suddenly caught sight of me and stumbled to me grabbing me in a rough hug deenie deenie deeme olin i saw olin trouble trouble olin is trouble he crushed me tightly against the rough fabric of his jacket he smelled of talcum powder and stale urine like an infant i tried to move away from his embrace but despite his age and his illness he was strong its all right i said as he continued to clutch me olin is dead olin doesnt mean trouble now olin is gone i saw him he repeated you know deeme between them theresa and ruth managed to remove his arms from my back he saw the story about olin taverner on the news theresa panted hes been very agitated thinking that this man is out to get him he keeps claiming hes seeing him out the window why did you let him watch the news ruth demanded no one told me about the history or i wouldnt have let him theresa snapped back everyone in this house tiptoes around simple things and then blames me for not doing my job because im supposed to use esp to figure them out get a psychic off the tv hot line if thats what you need in a nurse to my surprise instead of blistering theresa for impertinence ruth said no ones trying to keep things from you theresa it was before my time too but it was so important in the bayard lives that people still talk about iti just assumed someone had told you whos deenie i asked rubbing the place on my shoulders where calvin bayard had dug in his hands its a nickname for mrs bayard theresa said he cries for her when hes really upset mr bayard were going to get you a nice hot drink and take a little walk you come with me you like to watch sandy heat your milk dont you with sandy and me to look out for you no one can hurt you remember that chapter under the dragons spell i sat in my car shaking when i was a student i had daydreamed about being held in calvin bayards arms the nightmarish way my old fantasy had come true made me sick to my stomach the man whod stood up so valiantly to the walker bushnells and olin taverners of america now derived pleasure from watching the cook boil milk it was too much i couldnt bear it my eye caught a movement at one of the front windows ruth waiting for me to leave i found a bottle of water in the backseat and drank it down not the pint of rye philip marlowe would have used but it steadied me just the same i drove slowly down coverdale lane at larchmont hall i pulled in through the gates trying to regain my composure in the twilight the whitewashed brick looked more than ever like the prop to a gothic novel but my gothic ideas about why renee bayard had dug a moat around her husband were wrong she merely didnt want people to know he had alzheimers maybe calvin really had somehow gotten hold of a key to larchmont hall maybe he did wander over there and catherine really did follow himand was protecting him and the family secret but why keep it a secret was it renees own pain he couldnt bear her husbands diminishment and didnt want the world to know or were there majority publishers at bayard who only let renee hold the ceo spot because they thought calvin was guiding the reins behind scenes i couldnt make sense of it i got out of the car and walked up the drive to the pond i couldnt see much in the growing dusk but the sheriffs deputies hadnt treated this like a crime scene no tape no signs of any investigation only the scarring along the grass where id dragged marcus whitbys body showed that anyone had been here i looked at the water in distaste the dead carp was starting to bloat id come back tomorrow with a wet suit and crawl along the bottom in case whitbys keys or some other personal item had fallen out of his pockets but i wouldnt enjoy doing it i got in my car and continued down coverdale to dirksen it wasnt until i found myself staring at the pink brick of geraldine grahams condo that i realized id headed away from the tollway darraugh had asked me to drop the investigation so i was dropping itbut it would be rude not to pay a farewell visit to his mother the guard at anodyne parks entrance approved my admittance this time the maid ms graham had imported from larchmont hall let me into the apartment she took my jacket then asked me to wait in the entryway while she checked with madam a comedown from my wait at the bayard mansionnot even a chair let alone a view of the woods there was a painting a small piece soft pinks and greens that resolved itself into a mountainscape as i examined it the maid returned and escorted me out to the sitting room where ms graham sat drinking coffee from an elaborate service perhaps when her maid was with her she couldnt escape her mothers rituals i began to understand why she might relish living alone in her great age that will be all lisa ms graham dismissed the maid and looked at me over the rim of her coffee cup so young woman you wont come when i send for you but you do show up unannounced on your own whim darraugh told me to stop the investigation into your old home did you know that he phoned this morning to tell me she bit off the words did he explain why i walked over to the sideboard and poured myself a cup from the crown derby pot hes always disliked larchmont enough not to want to invest energy in its care i think he suspects i made up lights in the attic as a way of forcing him to pay attention to the place or maybe to force him to attend to me the bitterness in her fluty voice made me ask why didnt darraugh want to keep it was it unpleasant for him growing up there she gave me what i was starting to think of as her queen victoria look subjects will remember that they cannot interrogate the monarch after a moment she said stiffly darraugh has never enjoyed country life my eyebrows went up he had to spend his boyhood getting up to slop the pigs which gave him a lasting disgust for the sights and smells of the country youre impertinent young woman so ive been told i pulled up a chair and faced her across the piecrust table i have this idea about people who live with enormous wealth and great positionthat because they get exactly what they want when and how they want it they believe theyre entitled to privilege and i imagine such people think the rest of us exist only at their pleasure that means its all right to summon us in the middle of the night or lie to us or do whatever else takes their fancy at the moment because to them our lives have no existence away from their orbit i heard a gasp in the background and realized the maid was listening geraldine graham herself produced a blistering look from her clouded eyes do you truly imagine young woman that i have had exactly what i wanted when and how i wanted it if so you have shockingly little understanding of family life i was startled i had braced myself for a diatribe that would end with her ordering darraugh never to work with me again now i remembered the unhappy faces in the newspaper photos of her wedding your parents bullied you into marrying mackenzie graham i said calmly you didnt feel able to stand up to them her lips trembled with more than the uncertainty of old age my mother was not the kind of person one stood up to easily i looked at the frosty blue eyes in the portrait behind her head they could have wilted ferns in the amazon you and your husband didnt want to start a life together in a house away from your mother was larchmont that important to you geraldine graham paused when she spoke again it was more to herself than to me my husband and i had so little in common that it was easier for us to stay with mother than to try to live alone someplace else do you keep her portrait up there to remind yourself every day that she humiliated you i asked you are impertinent young woman geraldine graham repeated but this time with a touch of wry humor you may pour me more coffee before you leave rinse the cup with hot water first she added as i picked up the coffeepot i looked at her through narrowed eyes what she wanted when she wanted it before i pushed my luck by uttering the thought aloud lisa bustled around the corner into the room and took the cup from me she poured hot water from a small pot into the cup swirled it and emptied the slop into a bowl before refilling geraldines cup ignoring geraldines implied command to leave i refilled my own cupwithout going through the rinse cycleand leaned against the sideboard im still trying to figure out what brought marcus whitby to new solway i thought he might have gone to see calvin bayard not realizing how ill mr bayard is her hand stopped with the cup midway to her lips how ill is he renee has discouraged visitors he seems to have alzheimers he knows who he is but not who hes talking to alzheimers geraldine repeated slowly so the neighborhood gossip has been correct for once why would ms bayard keep his condition so secret i asked with renee bayard one never knows why she does what she does but it is always safe to assume she is enjoying her power over all our livesover calvins in keeping him locked awayover his old friends keeping us from visitingprobably over all the employees at the publishing company she pressed her lips together in resentment calvin and i were friends from earliest childhood and she has kept me from him most successfully all these years so if your negro writer was hoping to see calvin renee would have made sure he wasnt able to do so why do you imagine your negro wanted to talk to calvin i recited my piece on whitbys interest in kylie ballantine and her contract with bayard to my surprise geraldine knew ballantine calvin took an interest in her work when he was enthusiastic he wanted everyone to share his interests so we all drove into the city to watch her dance he bought art from her and we all had to follow his lead and buy one of her african masks when she gave a recital we all drove to the city to watch her dance in think it was or perhaps fiftyeight he had just brought renee out here i remember i was prepared to feel sorry for her a little patronizing toward her twentyyearold bride of an older domineering man what a mistake that was she made a bitter face ballantine was in her fifties the night i saw her but she still moved like a young woman i didnt care much for the dance it was african and ive never cared greatly for african art or music it all sounds like boomlay boom to me but heaven lent her enough grace for me to admire past the sound its a pity mr whitby didnt have a chance to talk to you i returned to my seat he might have found your recollections useful had ballantine been blacklisted during the mccarthy hearings was that what brought her to mr bayards attention geraldine graham slowly shook her head i dont know young woman it was about that time that my husband died and mother and darraugh werei remember the evening at the ballet because it was vivid but much else that year is gray in my mind i would dearly have loved to know what mother and darraugh had done fought in a loud unrefined way about mackenzie grahams death was my guess after a decent pause to show respect for her unhappy memories i pulled the picture of whitby and his sister out of my bag you notice a lot around you did you notice him geraldine graham took the photograph from me and picked up her magnifying glass to study it her hands were misshapen by age and arthritis and they trembled she laid the picture on her lap and held the glass with both hands ive never seen him but lisa might have she is always here in the evenings to help me with my meal and my night routine she picked up a bell on the table next to her but lisa had remained in earshot and came in before geraldine could ring it this is the man who drowned in our pond lisa she handed the picture to the other woman the detective is wondering if we saw him here on sunday lisa took the picture over to the window and looked at it closely not on sunday madam but i believe he was here perhaps a week ago i cant be sure i see so few black men but it looks like a man i noticed when i left you after lunch when was that i asked she pursed up her lips trying to remember it would have been the day i washed madams hair because i realized i had brought the shampoo bottle with me i was standing there by my car wondering should i go back up or could it wait until the morning when he pulled in across the way from me i felt foolish standing there looking at the shampoo so i got into my car so when was it i always wash madams hair on monday thursday and saturday she seemed surprised that i wouldnt know that so which was it i asked she paused again to think the thursday it would have been a week ago but why would he have come here if it wasnt to see you ms graham geraldine graham surprised me again if he was that interested in this dancer and if she had been blacklisted perhaps he went to see olin olin taverner i mean he lived here after all taverner of course hed been one of huacs hatchet men after all and now he too was dead so i couldnt ask him about marcus whitby or kylie ballantine how well did you know mr taverner i asked well enough we grew up together he was my cousin i vaguely remembered now from that newspaper id read geraldines mother had been somebody taverner before she married whoever drummond mr taverners death must be quite a loss then did you see much of him while he lived here very little her voice frosted over again consanguinity does not necessarily breed intimacy i was sad to know he died only because it ended a chapter in my own life i tried to rearrange my ideas if whitby had come out here to see taverner instead of calvin bayard it put him closer to larchmont hall but i couldnt see why taverner would have met him there or sent him there i asked ms graham if taverner had lived alone i wasnt in close touch with him but i assume he had someone to look after him lisa will know lisa when summoned again knew the name of taverners attendant how many hours a day the man had worked and even what hed said and done on finding the old lawyers dead body did mr taverner have a family children or other relatives geraldine graham gave another involuntary glance over her shoulder at her mothers portrait he never married histastesran in other directions than women it was one of the things that made calvin particularly angry during the fifties olins hypocrisy i tried to add this to the bewildering array of information i was getting taverner had been gay but in the closet maybe whitby had uncovered taverners secret andwhat taverner afraid of disclosure had murdered whitby rolled him over to the larchmont pond then come back here and died of a heart attack brought on by his exertions the notion made me smile which drew geraldines sharp attention and a demand for the source of my amusement sorry maam i wasnt laughing at you just my own absurd ideas i went to the bayard house before coming here because my first thought had been that marc whitby wanted to talk to mr bayard the staff said he hadnt been around should i believe them ruth lantner geraldine graham said shes what i had in mind when i said i didnt want a staff managing me she and her husband run calvin and renee bayard oh they do it well theyve been with calvin since the boy was born edwards one of those old family names people like to give their children no odder i daresay than darraugh calling his own boy mackenzie although mother tried to change his mind at the time i remember mrs edwards bayardshe and my mother had famous feuds my mother thought she was a hypocrite with her extraordinary causes and habitsshe didnt allow any alcohol or tobacco in her house although her husbands behavior was an open secret in our milieu mrs edwards thought mother was an odalisque whereas mother was something far more dangerous i was tempted to follow this historical byway what had mr edwards bayards behavior been but i kept to the main topic would ruth lantner lie about whitby coming to the house oh dont ask me about servants characters i dont know her well i daresay she would lie to protect calvin probably renee as well so she expected lisa to lie to protect her which meant if geraldine graham was hiding something about whitby or bayard lisa would back her up how nice and feudal i met the bayards granddaughter the other day i said catherine thats a sad story the mother dying when the baby wasnt a year old the boy edwards fell apart for a time under the blow i will say in renees favor that she took on raising her granddaughter without a murmur what kind of job has she made of it i smiled catherines a lively ardent young personwho so far has run rings around me and shes extremely close to her grandmother catherine says calvin wanders over to larchmont at night he does how astonishing she gave a dry laugh perhaps in the secret recesses of his mind he is trying to escape renee catherine says her grandfather has a key to larchmont hall that he uses it to let himself in there at night is that possible when i asked darraugh he became angry and hung up on me why ms graham put her down cup her jaw working do you have children young woman no they are a mystery you bear them in your body you watch over them but they grow up as strangers darraughs anger is one of those mysteries to me once again she danced away from talking about darraugh and larchmont i reverted to the key would calvin bayard have one i should be most surprised but we live in a very odd world are they looking after him properly how did he seem the nurse seems competent he looks physically fit he thought i was his wife he clung to me and called me deenie i always admired himthat was hard ms grahams hands shook as she picked up her cup coffee slopped over the edge and onto her aqua silk skirt so clumsy she murmured the thought of calvin with his wits wandering is truly unsettling send lisa to me on your way out young woman my exit cue i didnt need to summon lisa the maid continued to hover within earshot as i let myself out i could hear her clucking soothingly to geraldine graham mother calming infant the smell on mr bayards clothes urine and talc came back over me in a shuddering wave that we all come to this no matter how far or fast we run we come to this not away from it chapter lair of a star chamber man the emotions of the afternoon left me limp i didnt go to my car but walked aimlessly along the paths that wound through anodyne park night had fallen while i was in with geraldine but the paths were well dotted with fake gas lamps and i found my way easily not that i exactly knew what my way was right now it was that time of evening when people were out with their dogs or heading over to the bar on the shopping strip for a drink i thought about following a dour couple into the bar but id had too much company the last few hours i kept walking i was too tired to try to make sense of everything id heard this afternoon but the image of geraldine and her mother kept floating in my mind geraldines futile rebellions culminating in her unhappy marriage culminating really in her son darraughs wintry personality i imagined scenes at the breakfast table laura drummond giving her soninlaw his coffee with a barbed comment on his character geraldine slamming out of the house to dowhat i couldnt imagine her wasting time over bridge or shopping i didnt know how shed spent the years from until her mother died beyond the bar the path made a gentle descent by and by i found myself going under powell road and rising again onto the anodyne park golf course the course itself was dark but the occasional lamppost let me see the path a late golfing foursome passed going the other way in their cart at the top of a rise i came on the clubhouse a welllighted sprawling building with a rack of golf carts at the far end and a couple of valets moving cars at the other a wave of laughter rolled toward me i shuddered away from the jollity i scrambled to the top of a hillock and lay on my back looking at the stars the grass was velvety soft but cold it wasnt long before i started shivering and sneezing i sat up again and pulled out my cell phone maybe i could reach domingo rivas the man who had looked after olin taverner he didnt have a listed number that i could find but when i called the anodyne park management office and identified myself as a detective they were happy to give me his number he lived with a married daughter in nearby lyle i hope theres not a problem detective domingo looked after mr taverner as carefully as if he were his own father and we have recommended him to another older gentleman in our assisted living compound i reassured her explaining that i just wanted to talk to mr rivas about marc whitbys visit to olin taverner she put me on hold for a minute then came back on to say that rivas would be here in an hour to meet with the family of the gentleman who might be hiring him we can ask him to stop by the office early to talk to you she gave me directions to the office i found the underpass from the golf course back into the anodyne park community but once inside the complex the dark and the winding paths unsettled my sense of direction i pulled a small flashlight from my bag but couldnt make out any building that i recognized i figured all the paths would end up either at the exit or the bar and kept going i was wrongthis particular walkway suddenly ended at a large shrub which caught on my trousers as i bent to untangle myself i dropped my flashlight its beam picked out wheel marks going around the evergreen curious i followed them and found myself at the entrance to a culvert the ground was damp i saw the tracks easily it looked as though someone had driven a golf cart through here i was tempted to follow the trail to see whether this culvert ended up in new solway on its far side but i didnt want to muck up my good shoes in the damp soil and i didnt want to miss domingo rivas i turned around more by luck than skill i found my way to the main part of the complex a woman walking a toy poodle directed me to the management office the office took up a wing of the skilled nursing facility a building tucked well away from the jolly parts of anodyne park so that no one had to think of disagreeable things like dementia or death the woman on evening duty said oh yes they were expecting me domingo rivas arrived soon after me before it occurred to the woman to ask me for identification rivas was a small man perhaps my age dressed like a waiter in black trousers and a white shirt he watched me with worried eyes while the administrator explained that i was a detective with some questions to ask about the black man whod died across the street last weekend after some urging i got her to let us use a conference room where we could be privateshe clearly wanted to be part of the conversation with a little patient coaxing i persuaded rivas to sit down and even to reveal his chief worrythat someone had complained that he didnt take good care of olin taverner he hashadvery high standards very high but so do i his apartment it is always spotless when i leave him his clothes also his meals i make them with my own hands i am a good chef for the old who cannot eat strong food no one has ever complained about your care of him i assured rivas i wanted to talk to you about something different i took out the photograph of marc and harriet whitby this man came to see mr taverner last week didnt he when he nodded and said yes the man had been there on thursday i continued you know he was killed on sunday im wondering if he came back to see mr taverner sunday evening rivas slowly shook his head sunday i do not work i spend with my family maybe this man comes back again when i am not there although mr taverner he says nothing on monday nothing about a visitor that was disappointing on thursday when mr whitby did see mr taverner do you know what they talked about papers old papers mr taverner wants to show this man he keeps them in a locked drawer in his desk i never see them i only help mr taverner walk to the desk with a visitor he does not like to use a wheelchair he does not like to seem helpless many of my old people are like that very proud and he is the proudest of the proud mr taverner i help him walk to his desk i help him undo the lock i help him walk back to the man then i wait in the kitchen while they talk in case he needs tea water whisky or suddenly needs help you understand with his private functions sometimes they comecameon him suddenly rivass solemn courtesy would be comforting to people whose strength was waning but who prized their dignity were the papers written or typed they were written by hand that much i know what they say that i do not know and did he give them to marc whitby no mr taverner shows them only the other man he writes things from the papers into a little notebook that he carries in his pocket but when he goes away mr taverner he locks the papers again in his desk and did mr taverner say anything to you about the papers he says what the old so often say he says i will die soon the time to hold secrets is over i thanked him but when i tried to offer him money for his time he drew himself up to his full height and said quietly he did not take money for such things i felt embarrassed as one does in making a social mistake and left the room ahead of him stopping at the administrators desk to get taverners address rivas caught up with me at the exit i am thinking someone has been visiting mr taverner on monday night not sunday when this black man dies but the next night on monday i leave mr taverner as always at ninethirty ready to go to bed but not in bed that he likes to do by himself he likes to sit in his chair with his whisky to read or sometimes to write and then move into his bed when he is ready for that for the private functions in the night he has a bottle on his chair and one on his bed but tuesday morning when i find him when he is still in his chair and i know he has never gone to bed also his glass is clean he never has washed a glass in his whole life i think and now that he is old and he walks so badly he will not start now washing glasses when i was finding him then everything was tootoo much drama i didnt think about the glass i didnt think until tonight until now when you ask me did this black man come back on sunday but someone did visit mr taverner on monday my heart beat faster what did you do with the glass i put it in the cupboard with the others when someone comes for his things they will find all of his glasses just so everything just so do you still have a key to mr taverners apartment i know youre meeting some people but could you take five minutes to show me which glass its possible we might find something in it still some fingerprint or something and then i could stay behind and break into the drawer where taverner had locked the papers hed shown marc whitby the weariness that enveloped me an hour ago had vanished excitement made my fingers tingle rivas led me solemnly from the nursing facility to a nearby apartment building he said little except that he was meeting his new gentlemans family in this same building so he had enough time from the outside the assisted living building looked like geraldine grahams but inside it had been designed for people in wheelchairs and walkers with handrails bolted into extrawide halls taverner had lived on the ground floor rivas took a key chain from his pocket and with the compact motions that characterized him opened the front door when he turned on the lights i saw we were in an apartment similar again to geraldines but again with wider halls and doorways to accommodate wheelchairs the rooms as a consequence were smaller rivas led me past a sitting room to the kitchen which was as he had boasted spotless and opened a cupboard where the glasses stood at attention it was only after hed pointed out the relevant glass that he spoke you think there is a problem with mr taverner with his life ending because of this glass im like you the washed glass makes me suspicious can you show me where you found mr taverner rivas led me into the bedroom a large room with heavy drapes covering a set of sliding doors the bed was still as hed left it on monday night the sheets turned down so that an old man could easily get under them a leather easy chair was placed about five steps from the bed a table stood next to it with two canes hanging from a rack on the polished tabletop were a phone mondays newspapers and a bottle of berghoffs fourteenyearold bourbon youve seen many people die havent you i asked was there anything unusual about mr taverners body when you found him he slowly shook his head he has gone in his sleep i think as we all hope will happen without the hospital thethe equipment all of those things that hurt us but something wasnt right i suggested seeing his troubled frown he looked around the room again shaking his head you are right it is something not only this glass is it the pillow i think it is it has thehe fumbled for a word showing with his fist the way the head makes a hollow in the pillow after sleepyes the hollow the pillow looks like he sleeps on it but he is in his chair nowhe crossed to the bednow it is normal butnot quite right not where i have been leaving it and also i think someone has moved this chair he pointed at a cane chair on the far side of the bed next to the drapes covering the sliding doors you could see four indentations in the pile where the legs had stood for months whoever replaced the chair hadnt aligned it exactly i wanted to inspect the rest of the apartment but rivas was anxious not to be late for his meeting i tried to get him to leave me his key telling him the police would want to send in a forensic team but rivas didnt want to be part of a police inquiry if someone had been here with mr taverner the night he died had moved furniture moved pillows it would seem as though rivas hadnt looked after his gentleman carefully even though mr taverner always wanted to be left to go to bed alone besides the new family would take it amiss to have rivas involved in a police inquiry the administrator would help with keys and entrance to the apartment he said if investigators needed to search mr taverners apartment in greater detail i nodded my understanding following him down the hall and out the door i took advantage of his anxiety about the time to depress the lip of the dead bolt so it wouldnt fasten when we left rivas went to the elevators while i walked outside as soon as he got into an elevator i darted back down the hall pushed taverners door open and flipped the lights back on a handsome old leathertopped desk stood in a corner on the far side of the sitting room nearer to me were the armchairs where taverner and whitby had presumably sat to have their conversation i started toward the desk then decided caution was the better part of valor i returned to the kitchen found some latex gloves under the sink and put those on when i returned to the sitting room i realized it was considerably colder than the kitchen and bedroom had been i stopped on my way to the desk a draft was seeping under the brocade drapes which swayed with the air currents i crossed the room fast and flung the drapes open someone had broken the glass on the door to the patio and forced the lock from the inside i pulled the heavy fabric away from the wall a man was flattening himself into the corner he swore and ran toward me bulllike head lowered i didnt let go of the drapes fast enough the man butted me in the stomach shoved open the broken patio door and took off i doubled over gasping and gagging and tripped in the drapes i fought free of the heavy fabric and staggered after the intruder across the patio through a small garden i could hear his feet pounding away from me but i was too winded to move fast i lost him on the winding paths damn and double damn i hadnt gotten a good look at him just a confused impression of a youngish white man with dark thick hair in jeans and running shoes a burglar who knew the place was standing empty or someone after taverners secret papers i found my way back to the assisted nursing compound and returned to taverners apartment it wasnt so hard to find the locked drawer except the lock was broken and the drawer was empty like domingo rivas i didnt want to spend a whole lot of time with the police especially not the suburban forces i thought of driving back to chicago and leaving this mess for the anodyne park management to sort out when they got the apartment ready to sell i thought of the hollow in the pillow disarranged on the bed the glass rinsed out what if taverners visitor monday night had put something in his bourbon to make him drowsy and then taken the pillow from the bed and held it against his face untilwell until yes i couldnt think of one thing about olin taverner that i didnt despise the careers hed ruined through the blacklist the homosexuals hed hounded in public life while remaining deeply closeted himself the list could go on for days did it really matter if someone had hastened the end of an old huac hatchet man on the other hand hed died soon after showing marc whitby some secret papers and marc whitby had died soon after seeing them who had whitby discussed those papers with his young assistant but then why hadnt she mentioned them to me maybe shed been more forthcoming with harriet and amy i rubbed my sore diaphragm the man whod butted me was either lucky or well trained maybe hed murdered whitby and taverner and come back to search the premises but that made no sensehed have had plenty of time to search when taverner died unless he hadnt known until later that whitby had seen the documents i pulled out my cell phone and called stephanie protheroe the sheriffs deputy id been dealing with warshawski isnt your boyfriend jealous of the amount of time youre spending with me ive lent you clothes ive lost and found documents for you now what youre right i said ive been imposing maybe i should take this to the new solway cops she sighed okay ill bite what is it i was visiting geraldine graham this afternoon she lives in the same complex as olin tavernerthe guy who died on monday or tuesday as i was leaving her place i discovered that someone had broken into taverners apartment that someone wasnt you was it ms warshawski no maam that someone was a man who knocked me to the ground when i went in to investigate white maybe forty lots of hairi didnt get much of a look okay she sighed again well send someone over and deputymarc whitby visited olin taverner last thursday night i dont know if whitby came back here on sunday before he diedbut it seems worth exploring and taverner had an anonymous visitor on monday someone who washed out taverners whisky glass just thought youd like to know chapter jigsaw puzzle it wasnt until i was back in my own home that i remembered the wheel tracks going into the culvert i was bone tired too tired to think about it further let alone try to decide whether i should do something about the tracks i soaked in the tub for half an hour and ate a bowl of canned chicken soup it wasnt anything like as good as mrs aguilars but it was what i had i was drifting off to an early sleep when deputy protheroe called me back i tried to rise to her level of energy as she explained what shed done the guard at the entrance to anodyne park couldnt possibly identify my intruder too many people came in all day either making deliveries or visiting families for him to recognize anyone from my vague description she added almost casually you didnt bust the lock on that desk did you during your lookaround deputy if id gone into that desk you wouldnt know about it you got a crime scene team doing prints and so on the anodyne management doesnt like a big police presenceit lowers morale and leads to lawsuits she gave a dry laugh but just to keep you from calling six times an hour i did take the glass into our lab and youll let me know what they tell you just to keep me from calling you six times an hour you never know i might even do that when shed hung up i went back to bed but id woken up too much and couldnt relax it was still early only nine i phoned amy blount to see if shed had any luck either at tsquare or from mares other neighbors unfortunately the nursing mother was the only person whod been up in the middle of the night or at least the only one whod seen any sign of activity at mares house when i asked who used to visit him the kids thought i was some jealous girlfriend trying to stake him outthey could remember seeing me come out of mares house but not anyone else they began creating a scenario where i had murdered him it made me laugh and then it made me cryi cant believe how lonely he must have felt and i cant believe hes dead yeah investigation sometimes feels like a game until you remember a person died who was important to their friends and family what about mares editorsimon hendricks umh cold fish he had to talk to us because harriet was there we started the way you suggested with mares assistant aretha but she didnt think there was anything specific to the tension between him and hendricks beyond professional insecurity marc had a contract for a book about kylie ballantinewe found that in his desk drawer at the office aretha said hendricks was furious about that because hehendrickshad been trying for five years to sell a book about martin luther kings summer in chicago so why did marc tell him about his own book contract had toterms of employment do you think hendricks was bitter or jealous enough to kill marc over it she thought it over im no expert on why people kill each other butwell why would hendricks lure marc all the way out to that pond there is that i admitted what about mares cellmate jason tompkin did you get him to say anything about the company relations with bayard he runs his mouth so much its hard to know whether to trust anything he says for what its worth the company policy is not to discuss work in progress with anyone outside llewellyn publishing however he says that hendricks really stresses it in relation to bayard publishing jt says that comes down from llewellyn that theres some kind of bad blood between calvin bayard and augustus llewellyn nobody knows what but he jt thinks its because llewellyn took money from bayard to start up tsquare and bayard acted patronizinglike llewellyn was proof of what a goodhearted liberal bayard was but heres something really weird according to jt hendricks and marc had a big blowup last week because marc tried seeing llewellyn in person i was astounded you dont survive corporate life by trying to see the company owner behind your bosss back what was that about no one knows maybe marc wanted to persuade mr llewellyn to relax the companys policy on talking to bayard because bayard was part of the kylie ballantine story so if marc had wanted to talk to bayard hed definitely have done it quietly i said i found out today that marc went out to new solway at least twice and the first time wasnt to see bayard but olin taverner i told her the odd things id learned about olin taverners death and the man whod broken into taverners apartment id give a months pay with chocolate sauce to know what was in taverners papers marc didnt say anything to aretha cummings did he not that she reported to us amy said and you know that was a big story an old man opening a locked drawer showing off his secret papers if marc had mentioned it i think she would have said even if he swore her to secrecy although i can call her again in the morning to doublecheck right i made a note we need the notes marc took at taverners last thursday night or we need the connection between taverner and kylie ballantinealthough im assuming its something to do with the blacklist maybe she was hauled before huac even though it isnt mentioned in any of her papers down at the harsh collection i can go to the university library tomorrow amy offered all those hearings are on microfiche i did try with hendricks to see if he might have any of marcs notesi could sort of see him going to marcs desk and helping himself when the news came in marc had diedin case there was something he could either use or needed to cover up he definitely was jealous of marcs success so was jason tompkin tompkin thinks marc flew solo too much because he wanted glory his theory is marc got hold of something dangerous but all he saw was the prize hed get for scooping the world so he didnt tell anyone idont like that idea someone like this jt would make marc retreat into his shell but not out ofof jealousy or ambition more out ofhe didnt like a lot of noise its hard when you have to investigate affairs of people youre close to i sympathized i went through that when my cousin boomboom diedits almost like being the fly on the wall when people are talking about you isnt it i looked over the notes id been making marc visited taverner a week ago on thursday when did he try to see llewellyn or at least when did he and hendricks have their big dustup i asked before or after marc met taverner i dont know paper rustled as she went through her own notes you think taverner told him something about llewellyn but what i dont think anything i said impatiently i dont know enough to think the fight was recent she said slowly it could have been last friday i can call jt tomorrow and ask him do it could be important i said before hanging up we organized the next days work i told amy that the archivist thought marc might have found some original documents in kylie ballantines old home id like to make one last desperate effort to find those papers or any papers of his it just isnt natural the way everything has vanished we agreed to meet at marcs house in the morning while i broke into his saturn to see if any documents were there amy would start a finetoothcomb search of the house itself in case wed missed anything yesterday then amy would go down to the university library while i tried to talk to renee bayard after all renee had met calvin doing volunteer clerical work for people who had been called before congress she might know if there had been a connection between taverner and ballantine while wed been talking id had another idea about that secret file of taverners young larry yosano the lawyer doing odd jobs for lebold arnofl it was a little late for business calls but he was on the emergency shift this week i figured id get further faster by assuming taverner had been another of lebold arnoffs new solway clients and started by saying that taverners death must be generating a certain amount of work at the office he concurred but added you know ms warshawski nothing against you but i do have a private life its hard enough when all those new solway clients think im the japanese houseman they can call in the middle of the night cant we have this conversation tomorrow in my office i had to agree although i didnt really want to add another trip to the western suburbs to my crowded friday schedule we settled on three in the afternoonyosano had wanted to do it earlier but i wanted to get things clear at whitbys house so that i knew whether i really had to clutch at straws by going into the larchmont pond i was finally climbing back into bed when my phone rang i was startled to hear darraugh grahams voice bitingly angry didnt i make it clear that you were not to trouble my mother any further you have thirty seconds to explain why youve so blatantly disregarded my orders i stiffened darraugh you are not a marine colonel and i am not one of your recruits i owed your mother the courtesy of a visit to explain what id done and why i wouldnt be further involved in her problems and i wont apologize for seeing her it was unconscionable of you to upset her that wasnt a courtesy visit it was an interrogation she called you to complain oh no lisa called to complain your mother was upset by learning how ill calvin bayard was not by anything i asked her i think its permissible for a woman to weep over the decay of an old friend talking to my mother can have nothing to do with your murder investigation i warned you about that earlier if you wish to continue in my employment i am ordering you to stay away from my mother ill think about it darraugh about my wishes i mean good night i hung up before my anger rode me into an outright declaration o quitting his thousandamonth retainerone could pay too high a price for money sometimes chapter but where are the pieces of the jigsaw when i got to lebold arnoffs offices in oak brook tower larry yosano took me in to meet julius arnoff it was better that the senior partner know who was involving herself in the affairs of the firms most important clients better for yosano anyway by the time i arrivedlateat the meeting i had already had a long day id woken early from feverish dreams id been hunting for morrell through the caves of kandahar when the caves turned into the culvert under the road in anodyne park it was miles long the soil rank with rotted fish and rat droppings i was no longer hunting morrell but fleeing from the man whod butted me in the stomach i ran as fast as i could but my feet in my bruno magh pumps were sinking into the fetid ground and the man was driving a golf cart when i finally turned in a desperate effort to confront him marc whitby was at the wheel i woke panting and sweating it was only five oclock i tried to go back to sleep but i was in that gritty state where it was impossible to slide away from my conscious brain finally when the late winter sky was starting to streak red i got up and took the dogs for a run i wanted to go as far as i could as fast as i could i wanted to get away from myself and my tired gray mind but at the end of three miles mitch and peppy both balked they planted themselves in the bike path and refused to move despite both commands and bribes i finally turned around and took them home at a pace slow enough to please them but one that left me prey to the uneasy images from my dreams i couldnt shake the images nor the feeling that something beyond mere unpleasantness lay in them back home i showered and made breakfasteggs in the hopes that protein would overcome my gray mood and give me the energy to organize my day work felt beyond me this morning but i didnt have the income or the upbringing to indulge only myself behind my bleak thoughts i could see my mother at the kitchen table mending socks it was three in the morning my dad hadnt returned from his shift and the west side was an inferno of riots and looting i had heard her or felt her anxiety i dont know which and crept down from my bed under the attic dormer she held me close for a time then made me a cup of cambric tea and showed me how to darn a heel we dont give into our worries cara she said that is for grand ladies who can fancy themselves ill when their lover hasnt written or the new dress is commonplace we arent like that selfindulgent we do some job like this we do it well we make the worries leave us alone my father had come in around five to find us both asleep at the kitchen table our faces in his socks a cops daughter a reporters lover that gave you plenty of practice in showing you werent a grand lady or selfindulgent i hadnt darned a sock since i was fifteen but i had plenty of other chores i could be doing i started with a phone call to luke edwards the lugubrious mechanic whos looked after my cars for years car locks are tricky i didnt want to tackle whitbys with my picklocks where i might not only jam the lock but get arrested if some cop saw me using a tool of questionable legality whenever i talk to luke i have to endure a long lecture on everything ive done wrong to my current machine before hell work on it but hes kind of like the car talk brothers in what he knows about engines when he heard i wanted to get into a locked saturn he made me sit through five minutes on the inadequate safety features of modern american cars but at the end he agreed to send his own locksmith to meet me on giles street next on my list was renee bayard naturally i only reached a secretary naturally ms bayard was in an important meeting but i left a carefully rehearsed message i was a detective ms bayard had met wednesday night the one who had discovered marcus whitbys dead body it was now clear that whitby had met with olin taverner shortly before taverner himself died and i was assuming they had discussed kylie ballantine i wanted to ask ms bayard what she knew about ballantine and taverner the secretary read the message back to me in a doubtful voice but said she would pass it along after some internal debate i also placed a call to augustus llewellyns office once again i only reached a secretary a polished woman with executive office manners not the rough hostility of their lobby receptionist once again i explained my mission for the whitby family mr marc whitby tried to see mr llewellyn last week when he made the appointment did he say why we have procedures for staff writers for all staff who want to see mr llewellyn i explained that to marc when he came up to the eighth floor and told him he had to send me a memo stating the reason for the meeting she put me on hold to answer another line did marc send the memo i asked when she came back on the line he didnt want to her tone hardened he said it was sensitive material that he didnt want to put in writing he also didnt want to discuss it with his editor i told him he couldnt be the only judge of what was worth intruding on mr llewellyn he was one of our best writers but i really cant relax the rules for one person just because hes a star i understand i said quickly but im also puzzled it doesnt sound like him to try to contravene company policy i think he was troubled by something olin taverner told him and that he might have wanted to consult mr llewellyn about it and what was that i dont know i admitted if i could find out it might explain who killed him mr whitby learned something unusual last week something involving the old huac investigations i cant find a living soul he talked to about it so if thats why he tried to see mr llewellyn id really like to know could you check with mr llewellyn to see whether marc actually talked to him he might have waited for you to go to lunch or even phoned mr llewellyn at home she said stiffly that when she was away from her desk her assistant sat in for her and logged in any callers still she took my details before hanging up to answer another call i stared at the picture over my desk as if i could see marc whitby in the blur of color what had come up that made him risk his job at tsquare by going directly to the magazines owner of course it could have been anythingbut no notes or papers remained in his desk or home so i had to believe it involved the same story that took him to olin taverner last week if i couldnt find any papers in his car then id have to grasp at my last straw and see whether hed dropped something in the pond when he fell in i called around to places that rented diving equipment just in case i found a shop on diversey that could help me i stopped there on my way to the south side they rented me a wet suit i bought a headlamp goggles and an underwater knife at a hardware store near marcs home i bought a roll of twine that should get me through the pond if i had to go in i got to marcs house after the morning rush to work and school had ended a stayathome mom out with a baby buggy eyed me curiously but no one else was on the street when amy arrived we started a deeper search than wed done before going through the basement looking under rugs and tapping wallboard in the unfinished roomsall the labor of a truly thorough search around noon lukes locksmith arrived he had a box of keys and alarm codes when he had opened the saturn he gave me the coded key that worked the ignition and alarmfor a hundred dollars while amy continued doggedly inside the house i made a similarly thorough and equally futile search of the car i was lying under the chassis with a flashlight while a couple of area winos offered helpful suggestions when renee bayard returned my call i slid out from beneath the car and got into the drivers seat so i could talk to her privately the wabash cannonball came over the ether at full speed ms warshawski you were talking to my granddaughter on wednesday without my permission you were out in new solway yesterday questioning my staff without talking to me first and now finally as an afterthought you want to talk to me you should have started with me my hand grew wet on my little phone i thought catherine told you why we were talking give me some credit ms warshawski i didnt just climb down from a tree and start walking erect ive spoken to darraugh graham besides assuring me catherine never asked him for the name of a detective he says he told you to end the inquiry that took you to new solway to begin with hes not my only client ms bayard im investigating marcus whitbys death mr whitby died in new solway and and has no connection with my husband or granddaughter that i can discern and has a definite connection with olin taverner who also died this week in odd circumstances annoyance stiffened my attitude mr whitby met with taverner shortly before his death taverner showed him his secret files which are now missing im assuming their mutual interest was kylie ballantine i was hoping you knew what taverners involvement was with ballantine and im supposed to be your research file because we published one of ballantines books because you met mr bayard during the huac hearings and you might remember whether kylie ballantine was also a target of olin taverners she paused for a moment as if deciding whether i deserved an answer before saying there used to be something called the committee for social thought and justice a kind of leftwing think tank olin always wanted them to be a communist front ballantine might have taken part in some of their meetings i dont know if she did olin might have questioned her privately but i wouldnt know what were the odd circumstances of olins death theyre part of an ongoing police inquiry i said primly im not at liberty to say im amazed you take so many other unauthorized liberties one which you may not have again is access either to my granddaughter or my home she hung up without saying goodbye i climbed out of the car feeling shaky the way one does after being run over by a highspeed train i abandoned the car and the winos who kept telling me they could get that engine going no problem in the house amy and i finished our search just going through the motions we knew there wasnt anything under the floorboards or in a secret compartmentmarc might not have left documents under jt or simon hendrickss prying eyes at work but he wouldnt have felt the need to hide papers inside his own home i really hoped id find some of kylie ballantines letters i said i think i mentioned last nightmarc left a message with the archivist at the harsh collection maybe ten days before he died gideon reed knew marc was going through her old home he thought maybe marc wanted to let him know hed actually found something there i could go over to her place amy volunteered talk to the owner or tenants or whoever see whether they know if marc turned up anything ballantines old home was just around the corner on king drive cant hurt if you have the time but theres something else i was hoping you could do as well i described my frustrating conversation with renee bayard while youre down at the university of chicago library see how much you can find out about the committee on social thought and justice its a slender thread but its the only one weve got right now there are a couple of references to an unspecified committee in the ballantine archivesits a good assumption its that one and come to think of it taverner questioned bayard about his involvement with the same committee lets leave were not going to find anything here id worn jeans and a sweatshirt for my search but had brought a business suit to put on for my meeting with the new solway lawyers i changed in marc whitbys living room picked up a homemade biscuit at a local diner to eat in the car and joined the early afternoon exodus from the city chapter the family retainer even though i reached the eisenhower at twothirty traffic was already heavy by the time id found a place to park found the right building in the massive shoppingoffice complex and used a ladies room to brush biscuit crumbs from my blouse i was fifteen minutes late for my meeting larry yosano whisked me straight into the senior partners office julius arnoff was a short bony man perhaps in his late seventies with deepsunk eyes under hooded lids he didnt shake hands with me just waved yosano and me to a couple of straightback chairs on the far side of his desk i understand from young yosano here that you are a chicago detective a private detective not with the chicago police thats correct he produced a cold smile you are not the first chicago detective to be curious about our clients affairs i expect not i said from what ms geraldine grahams been telling me your clients could have kept an entire bureau of detectives busy larry yosano sucked in his breath and looked from me to arnoff in dismay but the senior lawyer said if mrs graham has been confiding in you then yosano here can hardly add anything to what you know shes told me fragments not anything like a whole coherent story shes told me about her battles with her mother and that her mother persuaded her to marry mackenzie graham shes told me that olin taverner was a homosexual i know that calvin bayard suffers from alzheimers and that renee bayard is at great pains to keep the world from knowing hes ill but a lot of the connecting details are missing and you hope well tell you what we wouldnt tell the detectives and reporters who sniffed around here fifty years ago his tone was supercilious my concern isnt with new solways fiftyyearold riff on peyton place but with a couple of contemporary murders im investigating marcus whitbys death hes the man who died i know all about the man who died at larchmont even though the grahams sold larchmont hall we continue to be involved with the property i know that rick salvi believes the man committed suicide and that you are out to force us into a murder investigation when murder has been committed an investigation is usually a good idea i said mildly not always young woman not always he snapped ive been wondering about that myself i assumed a thoughtful expression i discovered evidence at olin taverners apartment yesterday that makes me suspect he may also have been murdered and yet i have to ask whether that needs to be investigated does it matter that someone hustled an old man off the planet a few months before his time do i waste my energy on the death of a man who himself ruined many peoples lives olin taverner began his legal training in theodore lebolds office arnoff said he went on to more important matters before i joined the firm but we have always held him in esteem here so you think his murder deserves investigation but that marc whitbys doesnt dont twist my words young woman arnoff turned his hooded gaze to yosano what do we know about mr taverners death larry yosano sat up straight only that ms warshawski found something unusual in his apartment sir she was going to explain the situation to me in our meeting this afternoon and that situation is arnoff turned back to me i leaned back in my chair legs crossed trying to establish that i wasnt a surbordinate someone was in taverners apartment the night he died that person took pains to cover up his or maybe her presence but nonetheless left telltale traces i know firsthand that someone broke into the place yesterdayi interrupted him unfortunately he knocked me over and got away i know marcus whitby consulted taverner last thursdaya week ago yesterday and i know taverner let him see some documents that he kept in a locked drawer those documents have been stolen from the apartment im hoping you know what was in them arnoff slowly shook his head our clients dont always confide in us we are the executors of course of the taverner estate who are the heirs since he didnt leave a family i asked several foundations whose work he valued including the spadona foundation i wonder how renee bayard will feel seeing her son use money from his fathers old enemy to set a policy agenda she and calvin oppose arnoff smiled primly if calvin bayard had kept better track of his own documents edwards bayard might not be in such opposition to him today meaning meaning all these great families have something they dont want anyone else to know im sorry i cant help you with olins papers i doubt i ever saw those i asked what arnoff knew about kylie ballantines connection to taverner he gave his thin supercilious smile again the african dancer i dont think it was olin who had a connection to her calvin bayard then i asked calvin supported a number of artists i believe ballantine was his protegee for a time before he married renee of course the brief pause he gave before the word protegee was supposed to let me know they had been lovers everything in this officein new solwaywas done by innuendo i wondered how long it would be before young yosano picked up the same skincrawling habit renee bayard was telling me this morning that taverner had a bee in his bonnet about the committee for social thought and justice theres a rumor that calvin bayard gave them money a rumor i myself was just starting but he might have been the patron mentioned in the ballantine archive oh calvin was generous with many leftwing groups in the thirties and forties theres never been any doubt where his politics lay but just because he published known communists like armand pelletier i dont think anyone ever seriously believed calvin was a communist himself not even olin when he was hounding him back in the fifties i think they were simply two men who didnt like each other calvin was the flamboyant young success olin had to climb his way slowly and olin was hampered by the homosexuality you alluded to by the way i understand darraugh graham hired you to find who his mother was seeing in the larchmont attic did you ever discover who was there i shook my head slowly somehow id forgotten the original inquiry that had taken me out to new solway catherine bayard told me it was her grandfather that he had a key to the old graham house arnoff made a sound like an engine starting in cold weather i realized after a startled moment he was laughing so young catherine has all the bayard spirit one never knows how the next generation will behave with so much wealth available to it but when i asked darraugh about it he became furious im afraid im not in grahams confidence young woman he took his legal affairs elsewhere arnoff said he was much attached to his father however and mrs drummonds attitude when mackenzie graham died did cause darraugh to run away that summer he was something like fourteen or fifteen eventually he returned to exeter to finish his education but i dont believe he ever returned to larchmont was there something especially difficult about mackenzie grahams death i asked all deaths are difficult but mackenzie had hanged himself as i understand it but why larry yosano was startled into speaking he was at that age arnoff said in my experience the unhappy of the earth either learn to live with it by the time theyre fortyfive or they decide they no longer can make the effort it was particularly unfortunate that darraugh found his fathers body i believe his father didnt know exeter had sent him home mackenzie was very attached to his son i doubt he would have killed himself at least not then had he known darraugh was there i tried to digest this by ms grahams account it was an unhappy household why did she and mr graham marry in the first place and why did they never move into a place of their own had you known mrs matthew drummond you would have understood the answer to both questions mr and mrs mackenzie graham both caused their parents considerable anxiety when young as mr lebold explained the matter to me both mrs drummond and mr blair grahammr mackenzies father that isthought marriage would settle the two young people down of course when i came into the firm mrs drummond was sixtyfive but she was still a formidable power in fact she refused at the outset to work with arnoff broke off she wouldnt work with a jewish lawyer i suggested she had oldfashioned prejudices he said primly when theodore lebold made me a partner a few took their business elsewhere just as some did when we brought yosano here into the firm but most of new solway saw then as they do now that lebold arnoff still has their interests very much at heart chapter scuba diver twilight softened the ponds surface blurring the tangled nest of weeds so that only the lily pads showed even the dead carp looked as if it might be merely floating near the surface waiting for a fly to land when i left arnoffs office id thought about returning to chicago and leaving the pond until the morning but that would have meant yet another drive out to the western suburbs after all it was going to be dark under all those weeds whether i went in at six in the morning or six at night all i had left in my thin arsenal was the dogged desire to find what taverner had told marc whitby arnoff had dropped hints that i should be able to sort out he clearly was proud of knowing the secrets swirling around new solway like indiscretions that calvin bayard should never have committed to paper or at least made sure were far from his sons prying eyes i negotiated the turn onto the eastwest tollway and joined the milelong backup at the tollbooths arnoff had said no one not even taverner ever seriously believed calvin bayard was a communist so what else had he done that had shocked his son into becoming ultraconservative and done on paper i inched forward that was what was so frustrating about this parade of prima donnas all of their lives were intertwined by history by marriage by shared lies they were like a group playing threecard monte and laughing as i kept diving for the court card i was beginning to doubt a south side street fighter could be a match for such smooth hustlers i oozed off the tollway at warrenville road i could find my way from the tollway to larchmont hall on autopilot by now at larchmont i pulled my mustang around behind the barn where it was hidden from both the road and the woods connecting to the bayard estate if someonesay young catherine or even ruth lantnerwere visiting larchmont hall they wouldnt be able to see the car before leaving oak brook id stopped in the shopping center to change out of my business clothes and put on a swimsuit sweatshirt and jeans these last i took off now and left in the car i squirmed my way into the wet suit the rubber was hard to maneuver i was sweating from exertion by the time i finished but feeling clammy at the same time from the cold rubber against my skin i put on the divers headlamp id bought this morning tucking the twine and small knife under my arm with fins and goggles i padded around the barn through the overgrown gardens to the pond id never done underwater work but id learned to swim in lake michigan in fact my cousin boomboom and i used to drive our mothers mad with worry by going into the foul waters of lake calumet since that was closer to our homes funny how the stuff thats exciting when youre a kid with a scolding mother in the background seems horrifying when youre an adult on your own if boomboom were here it would be an adventure if boomboom were still alive i wouldnt feel so alone selfpitying tears spurted out i dashed them away angrily youre a woman saved by action i mocked myself get the damned fins on and get going the water was as nasty as id imagined i made a face then pulled the goggles over my eyes stuck the breathing tube between my teeth and did a handstand trying to ignore the shock of cold water against my head almost at once i became tangled in the nest of roots picking and kicking my way through them got my blood flowing enough to keep the cold at bay although it also stirred up dirt from the bottom making it harder to see anythingthe headlamp couldnt penetrate more than a few feet of this murk as id expected it didnt matter that id gotten to the job latedaylight wouldnt have made it through the knotted vegetation on the surface i estimated i had about four hundred square feet to cover i grimly set about working the lanes headstand paw my way through the roots feel the bottom surface for air repeat the breathing tube was useless so i laid it along the pond ledge each time i reached one of the walls id tie off a length of twine i started at the west end where id tumbled onto marcs body on sunday at the end of an hour id covered about a hundred square feet id found three rusty cans a corroded watch shards of china with edges worn smooth by the water and a crystal champagne goblet miraculously whole id also found a number of pieces of wood so logged by water theyd sunk to the bottom it was seven oclock and completely dark now in the upper world my shoulders ached from pushing through the weeds my nose was running and i was feeling sorrier for myself than ever i put the goblet on the edge of the pond next to the china tied off my line and dove again at seventhirty id added more cans some forks and spoons more china shards and a womans ring to my trove the ring had been there for some time judging by the amount of dirt on it but it looked as though it might have impressive stones in it i zipped it into a pocket of the wetsuit at eight when i was so cold and discouraged i wanted to quit i found a pocket organizer i surfaced and stared at it i was numb unable to summon any excitement but i knew it had to be either marcs or his murderersbeneath the muck of dirty water and plant detritus the grain on the brown leather was still visible my hands were too thick with cold to try to open it here i hoisted myself out far enough to zip it into my pocket next to the ring id covered most of the pool by then i was tempted to call it quits but i only had one more section to do if i didnt search it id lie awake all night imagining the vital piece of evidence id overlooked i sucked cold air into my damp lungs for a few minutes then slid back into the water nothing else was there except more wood one piece felt as though it might actually be an artifact not just a dead branch i brought it to the surface with me pushing myself thankfully free of the murk i walked around the pond undoing my lengths of twine looping it around my shoulder my legs were wobbly from two hours of diving and kicking before i could start gathering up my trove of china and glass i heard footsteps whicking across the lawn i gripped the breathing tube between my teeth and slid into the pond remembering at the last second to switch off my headlamp water amplifies sound the feetcatherine bayards ruth lantnerssounded as though they were pounding past in hobnailed boots i waited a long minute giving her time to clear the pond and head up the lawn to the house as i was starting to climb out again i heard another set of feet crunching along the brick walk next to me i dropped back under water the steps stopped a light shone across the ponds surface my heart stood still i held my breath while the light played through the tangle of reeds lily pads dead fish surely my breathing tube didnt stand out in that mess after a moment the light swept away the steps moved on it was a windless night if i scrambled out of the pond now sound might carry to a suspicious ear if i stayed where i was someone might be attacking catherine bayard i lifted my head out of the water straining to see through the dark in front of me up near the house a flashlight bobbed i heard voicesan exclamation of surprisefollowed by murmurs it didnt sound like an assault id been standing still in the cold water too long my teeth were chattering so loudly i couldnt believe they couldnt hear me up at the house the noise couldnt be louder than id make climbing out of the pond for the third time i hoisted myself out of the water moving as carefully as i could i slipped out of the fins and trotted to the far side of the pond where id left my shoes before i could put them on the voices sounded more loudly i was damned if i was going into that rank and chill water one more time grabbing my shoes i rolled under one o the stone benches catherine youre lying to me and i dont like it ruth told me the detective who was at banks street on wednesday came out to see her yesterday with a tale of you coming over here in the night with a key belonging to your grandfather so i told you she made it up i dont know why not ruth the detective no renee bayard halted a yard from my nose i called darraugh yesterday i didnt like the idea that he would send a detective to you who dealt with murder theres time and to spare for you to delve into human misery butat any rate he said he hadnt heard from you recently and nor had his staff so either you found this woman on your own or she found you why she found me she stalked me catherine cried renee was silent for a few beats apparently collecting her thoughts when she spoke again her voice was tired darling if she were stalking you why did you support the stories she was telling yesterday afternoon if shes blackmailing you you need to tell me if you think you need a detective for something cant you tell me that too i cant if i could i would but i cant dont make me say any more because it will only be lies and youll know and get angrier were you here sunday night renee said did something frighten you you mean if i was out here did i interrupt whoever killed that journalist no granny i wasnt here i didnt have a clue a murderer was hanging around here renee sucked in a breath as if she was about to dispute catherines repeated claim of not being here then paused as if aware that this argument was futile i clenched my jaws together to keep my teeth from rattling at her feet but now you do know trina you mustnt come back here we dont know who killed that reporter someone is taking advantage of larchmont standing empty to use the house thats why your detective was here geraldine graham has been seeing lights in the attic and while darraugh thinks she could be making it up to force him to spend more time with her i dont agree shes a shrewd woman she doesnt use petty tricks a deranged person could be hiding in this house if youre coming here to meet a friend or a lover or to use drugs or anything you dont want me to know about please she broke off unable to complete the thought no one can get into these buildings they have a security system catherine said an alarm goes off in julius arnoffs office do you know that because youve triggered it its not like its a secret i mean we all have alarms on our houses and we all know what to do when they go off and everyone knows they ring at the lawyers office and at the police catherine was talking in the breathless runon sentences shed used on me yesterday when she wanted to rush me past sensitive topics what didnt she want her grandmother to push on here renee bayard clearly was wondering the same thing because there was another long pause before she spoke again do you have a key to the alarm system catherine no granhow could i have a key to someone elses house by taking it if you found it lying around renee bayards voice was casual almost as if she wasnt interested in the subject i expect this house is like all the houses out here were such special people in new solway so unusually honest and moral by virtue of our wealth and position that newcomers dont have to bother with new alarm systems they know the old owners wont come around breaking in i daresay thewhat was the name of the family that bought larchmonti daresay they left the grahams alarm in place and keys to that system could have been drifting around out here for years im not suggesting you stole anything but that you couldnt resist using a key once youd found it oh please gran i couldnt stand those jablon kids long enough to get a key from them they were such nounous with their such what her grandmother demanded sorry catherine mumbled we use it at school nouveauxnouveaux riches you know i do now renee said dryly contempt for those born in different circumstances than your own is the easiest way to stop thinking i know i know but if youdhey gran someone has been herelook at all this stuff laid out like theyd been having a picnic or something except using all this old broken china renee swept a circle of light outward toward the china shards catherine had seen these were from my first lot at the end of the pond closest to us i watched her feet march over catherine followed was the sheriff here do you think was he dredging the pond for clues i dont know renee said rick salvi doesnt seem that interested in the situation maybe it was your detective returning to the scene of the crime these look like bits of geraldine grahams mothers coalport she had place settings for a hundred all in this blueandgilt they must have fallen into the water during alfresco evenings people got drunk and threw china into the pond we werent quite as wild as that darling i shall have to call rick and see if he sent a crew to the pond recently it would be too there are still wet patches under these pieces you didnt see anyone i thought i heardbut i didnt see the flashlight swept around again heres something else catherine had moved to the far end of the pond her own flashlight cutting a narrow cone along the ponds edge if id left wet footprints on the walk she was obliterating them oh its just more grubby old bits of something not more china from mrs grahams drunken orgies its all dark and nastyhey if you look close it looks like a mask you know like the one grample has in his study didnt some friend in the arts or something give that to him it looks like they gave one to the grahams who didnt like it quite as much renees feet crunched on the broken brick as she strode over to her granddaughters side i think youre right well have to clean it up most of its here its just the top corner around the left eye thats broken off i must say this explains a lot about what gran life trina although it is always an inexplicable mystery lets go home now as their footsteps crunched out of the garden she added what did you see here sunday night but catherine wasnt to be tricked their voices were fading but i heard her say since i wasnt here i couldnt possibly have seen anything chapter scaling the north face i slept three hours at the nearest motel when the alarm went off at midnight i lay blinking at the unfamiliar surroundings why had i set the alarm when what i really needed was eightno make that tenhours in a warm bed it was too cold i was too old for nighttime derringdo but when i rolled over and wriggled back under the blankets i couldnt get back to sleep catherine had a key to larchmont hall she was shielding someone inside the house and renee bayard was too shrewd not to understand both these things renee would have the dupage sheriff out there first thing in the morning and my chance of findingmarcus whitbys murderer say or a possible witness to the murderwould evaporate as if its your business i could hear catherine bayard say that her narrow face pinched up in scorn but i got out of bed anyway i put my jeans back on but my socks and sweatshirt were wet and stank of rotted vegetation the silk blouse id worn to see julius arnoff was in my trunk i didnt want to wear it for strenuous work but one thing the suburbs have in abundance is allnight shopping the motel itself was across the street from a twentyfourhour behemoth i put on my blouse and suit jacket and stuck the pocket organizer into my day pack before crossing the highwayi didnt want to leave my precious booty alone for a minute before falling into the bed id tried to pry the organizer open but dirt and wet weeds clogged it shut i didnt force itif this was marc whitbys i didnt want to destroy any notes or documents zipped inside id get it to the forensic lab i use for this kind of problem the ring i rinsed off under the bathroom tap a jeweler would have to clean it up properly but as id thought it was an expensive garish piece of jewelry a kind of beehive of stones was built up from a gold banddiamond and emerald chips banked around four goodsized rocks a couple of the small chips were missing but what remained could probably pay mr contrerass and my taxes for a couple of years had it been geraldine grahams her mothers i pictured a teenage darraugh throwing his grandmothers ring in the pond after theyd fought about his fatherthe father for whom he defiantly named his own son or perhaps geraldine herself had thrown it away out of disgust with her marriage or perhaps i was being melodramaticmaybe she or her mother or even some guest had lost it during one of those al fresco dinners renee bayard mentionedthe owner would be thrilled to see it again my fingers were swollen from the cold water but at their normal shape the ring would have slid down over the knuckle i held out my hand to study the ring in the bathroom mirror wedged against my knuckle with my fingers showing a spider network of cuts the piece looked even more grotesque definitely the possession of someone with more money than tastealthough i guess a claim to superior taste is the weak comfort of the poor i stuffed the ring into my jeans and went out to buy skulking clothes in the superstore across the road i found aspirin orange juice socks fresh batteries for the work lamp work gloves with rubber palms and a hooded navy sweatshirtall for twentythree dollars i had an uneasy feeling that slaves in china or burma had made these items they never say that on the label made for megatherium superstores by slave labor so you can have it cheap but a sweatshirt gloves and so on for twentythree dollars ought to tip you off ought to tip me off i could have driven all the way home for gloves sweatshirt and so on not to mention my gun but i was an americanfast cheap and easy was my motto back in the motel i drank half the orange juice with two aspirins that would do me as much good as another six hours in bed the rest i put in my day pack along with the small knife and the headlamp i left a do not disturb sign on the door in case i wanted to use the room again but i put all my stuff in the car if my luckand staminaheld i wanted to drive straight home when i finished i was in one of the peaks of alertness that you sometimes reach when youre basically exhausted at the entrance to coverdale lane i pulled the mustang behind a bush i wanted to approach larchmont on foot didnt want the noise of my car to alert anyone who might be hanging around five nights ago the trip had spooked me the road had seemed endless the night animals major menaces now i knew the area well enough that i jogged along i was wearing my divers headlamp but the moon outlined the road in enough ghostly light that i didnt have to switch it on movement loosened my muscles helping the aspirin kick in i stretched my arms some muscle between my shoulder blades gave me a stab of pain sharp enough that i winced i hoped it was a muscle i wasnt going to want again tonight twice cars went past and i ducked into the shrubbery i thought about cutting across the fields but id make less noise on the tarmac i was betting renee bayard would wait until morning to call the sheriff but i couldnt be sure of itthe wabash cannonball moved fast and if she thought her granddaughter was sheltering a murderer shed act at once i was also betting catherine wouldnt try to slide out past her grandmother again tonight but i couldnt be sure of that either when i turned up the larchmont carriageway i slowed down stopping periodically to listen to the night sounds jogging had warmed me up now i could feel the latewinter air against my back a wind had come up rustling the leaves and dead grasses making me stop more oftenin my nervous state every noise sounded like someone moving through the underbrush when i reached the house i first made a tour of the outbuildings looking for any signs of other people i had uneasy visions of renee bayard or the dupage sheriff leaping out at me but i didnt see anyone a loud crashing near the pond sent me to the ground my heart hammering but it was only a couple of whitetailed deer startled into flight by my approach at last i crossed the yard to the big house to the main entrance on the west side where white columns supported a domed porch without giving myself time to think it over i ran the last twenty feet jumped and grabbed the crossbar between the column capitals the sore muscle in my shoulder protested but i moved fast bending my arms pulling my body up hooking my legs around one of the columns so my thighs were bearing my weight i stuck an arm up to the edge of the dome found a stone knob that i could hang on to and heaved myself up landing like a dying fish on the curved surface when id caught my breath i scooted backward until i was leaning against the wall from my vantage point i could see more of the grounds the only movement i could make out besides the wind rustling the dead grasses was of the deer returning to the pond through the bare tree branches i looked at the night sky wisps of clouds floated across the moon but the stars were bright and crisp and close the way they never are in the city my burst of alert energy was fading i started to doze off get up and get your head in the game warshawski i could hear my high school basketball coachs deep bark almost as if shed been standing next to me i forced myself to my feet and looked at the window behind me it led into an upper hallway but it held the telltale markers of the security system which meant going up another layer there was no easy access to the third story no columns to shinny up but gaps in the old mortar left fingerand toeholds here and there i started up ive always thought wall climbing was a stupid sport fumbling about for purchase testing each hole where i stuck my fingers pulling myself up half a foot at a time with throbbing muscles and trembling legs going cheek to cheek with rough bricks so that when i slipped i had a raw spot from forehead to chinnone of that made me change my mind i was very aware of how clear a target my dark clothes presented against the whitewashed brick and that if i lost my grip and fell id bounce off the domed roof underneath and break well a lot of bones and that anyone lurking inside would have enough advance warning of my approach to be waiting for me with lead a bullet or a pipe or maybe molten in a pot the way they did it in the middle ages by now i was sweating freely and not merely from exertion imagination is not a gift for a detective the thirdfloor windows had narrow ledges not wide enough to kneel on barely wide enough for me to stand splaylegged like a graceless ballerina i hung to the top of the frame gasping for breath soothing my raw face against the cool glass before adding to my racket by breaking the glass i tested whether the window was even locked the sash was stiff but it movedthe security system on the first two floors had made julius arnoff and the titleholder complacent when i had a wide enough gap to stick my arm through i pulled up on the inside sash to lift the bottom half i had to move along the narrow ledge like an egyptian figurine but i managed to slide my right leg through the gap to ease down to a sitting position one leg inside one dangling outside and finally push the window far enough open to duck into the house i pulled the headlamp from my day pack and switched it on i was in one of the thirteen bedrooms described in the newspaper no one had thought it worth redecorating or even cleaning for years dust was thick on the floor a water leak was sending brown fingers down the faded wallpaper i tiptoed through the dust and opened the door onto a long uncarpeted hall i moved as quietly as i could opening each door looking in closets in bathrooms not seeing anything stairs rose from the lower floor halfway along the hall i peered down this was the top end of the main staircaseon the floor below me the bannisters grew large and elaborate presumably by the time they reached the ground they would be equal to what id seen at the bayards yesterday morning on the far side of the main staircase tracks appeared in the dust catherine bayard i had to believe i followed her steps to a door at the end of the hall i opened it quickly crouching low behind it in case someone started shooting no lead came pouring down at me instead a scared little voice called catterine it is you chapter the jaws of a giant clam i straightened up and turned on my headlamp i was looking up a flight of narrow stairs at a youth in sweatshirt and jeans his dark eyes were wide with fear far from trying to attack me he seemed too frightened to move i stood still and spoke in a calm slow voice im sorry but catherine cant come tonight her grandmother wont let her out of the house he didnt say anything he looked very young and vulnerable like a fawn frozen in a clearing he was gripping the handrail so tightly his knuckles showed white through his dark skin can you tell me your name and why you are in this house i spoke in the same slow gentle voice catterine she say i stay here his voice came out in a whisper why is she hiding you he swallowed convulsively but didnt speak im not here to hurt you but you cant stay in this place any longer people know youre here who know catterine she say she tell no body the woman who used to own this house lives across the street she has seen your light your and catherines lights through the attic windows the woman has a son who is afriendof mine the youth was so frightened i didnt want to tell him i was a detective her son asked me to find out who is living in his mothers old house and now what you are doing you are telling police im not telling the police unless you killed someone kill i not kill you cannot say i kill i am in house not killing in his panic his voice rose wed been speaking in whispers so that the sudden shout was shocking fatigue was making it hard for me to concentrate also i was getting a crick in my neck from staring up at him i want to come upstairs so we can talk properly as i started up he began to retreat his big eyes not wavering from my face the staircase ended in a large open area with skylights overhead so this was where light seeped out for geraldine graham to see when catherine came she and the boy sat talking by flashlight or something i switched off my headlampi hoped before geraldine noticed it the roof was pitched steeply here odd corners stuck out into the room to accommodate the houses four chimneys this had been the servants common room during geraldine grahams childhood i pictured a wistful girl with dark braids sneaking up the stairs to watch the maids play poker old furniture was piled against one of the wallsi made out a couple of dressers a jumble of chairs and a bed frame the boy and catherine must have dragged out the leathertopped desk that stood directly under the skylights some books were stacked neatly along one side next to a plate cup and glass i assumed the desk and the rest were graham family discardsthey looked too old to have been part of the nounou familys brief tenure the boys eyes darted from me to the stairwell he was trying to summon his courage to make a break for it you can run down the stairs and out the doors i kept my tone level even friendly good cop i wont try to stop you but you wont get far especially not without catherine to guide you over the ground he slumped on the top step his head on his knees forearms pressed against his ears so desolate that my heart was touched instead of catherine his one friend whom hed been longing for hed gotten me i walked over to the north wall which overlooked the back gardens the windows were small and set up high but he had moved a chair over so he could stand and see out i climbed up from here you could watch for someone to appear around the corner of the garage you could spend long lonely nights on this chair hoping she had gotten away from chicago to come see you you could also see the pond i climbed down and explored the rest of the attic the common room led to a short wide hall with six monastic bedrooms and a spartan bathroom i turned the taps cold water came out at least he could use the plumbing a mattress with a sleeping bag on it was set up in one of the rooms his few clothes were neatly folded on yet another chair a couple of flashlights and a box of batteries stood next to the bed when i came back to the large room he was still sitting on the top stair head on his knees who are you why are you hiding here i asked he didnt answer me didnt move his head its cold up here you probably havent had a proper meal inhowever long its been come on with me and tell me about it i wait for catterine when she say going then is safe i going his knees muffled his voice she cant come you can see the pond from your window here you must have seen her grandmother arrive this evening her grandmother will not let her leave the house again tonight and her grandmother may well call the police we probably have until the sun comes up to get you out of here but i need to know who you are and why youre hiding i laughed suddenly you saw me too this evening didnt you jumping in and out of that wretched pond poor sister anne with nothing to do but watch the horizon did you see i am not girl his head jerked up and he glowered at me ferociously who said anythingoh sister anne a character in a childrens story who has to keep watch from a tower i know youre not a girl but i know you saw me this afternoon and you must have been watching for catherine on sunday sunday night someone killed a man outside this house they put his body in the pond did you see this when he didnt answer i moved so i was standing directly over him you were watching for catherine you knew she was coming that night or anyway some night soon you saw the killer put the mans body into the water who put him there nothing i seeing nothing did you help kill him is that why youre hiding no and no and no and nowoh where is catterine only she he broke off and looked at his knees again i am a girl crying hiding behind another girl i am a baby and a girl he lapsed into a mortified silence i frowned trying to force my tired brain into some useful line of questioning that would get him to tell me who he wasand what he had seen on sunday finally i went to the leathertopped desk to look at the books one of them might be his one of them might have his name in it i needed more light than the moon provided hoping this wasnt one of geraldine grahams wakeful times i switched on my headlamp and picked up the open book i had never seen anything as beautiful as the coral reef it stretched away for miles and was soft to the touch like velvet stupidly i forgot the dangers that lay all around as i watched the many brightcolored fishes swim through the red reef suddenly i felt a pain in my left leg so sharp i tried to scream forgetting in my fear i was underwater i took in a mouthful of water around my breathing tube i looked down in terror a giant clam had grabbed my leg i flipped to the title page eric nielsen on the great barrier reef published in calvin bayard his book was printed underneath the title in a childs drunken hand there were two other eric nielsen adventures along with treasure island and an old tom swift catherine bayard must have raided her grandfathers library for books she thought might appeal to a boy trying to learn english the other books were in arabic along with an englisharabic dictionary i looked again at the boy light dawning youre benjamin sadawi arent you catherine is hiding you from the fbi he jumped up in terror and started down the stairs then came back and snatched up one of the arabic books from the desk i seized his arm but he broke free and tore pellmell down the stairs i followed closely but didnt try to grab himi didnt want to hurtle us both down on our heads we landed in the great front hall two wings led behind us and benjamin darted down one only to find himself in a closet when he turned back i wrapped my arms around his torso his heart was beating wildly i dragged him back to the stairs and sat him down he was still clutching the book hed snatched from the desk upstairs listen to me you young fool i am not giving you to the fbi or the police but i am going to take you away from this house it isnt safe here anymore and it isnt healthy anyway cold house no heat no company he struggled in my arms you must not hold me you woman true enough im a woman with zero interest in your body im old enough to be your mother a thought no less depressing for being true but i took my arms from his shoulders he edged away from me on the bottom step but didnt try to run again glass panels framing the great oak doors let in just enough light that i didnt need my headlamp to see him although i couldnt make out the details of his expression i also couldnt see the different blocks in the tessellated marble floor the one that had taken italian workers eight months to install but i knew the marble was there it was bleeding cold through the soles of my running shoes come on i stood up we have a bit of a hike to my car and then well get you someplace where you can sleep and be warm and not worry about whether someones coming into the house you have the key for door he asked alarm goes to police if you opening with no key i switched on my lamp and knelt to inspect the lock another depressing truth the alarm was set on both sides of the door i couldnt just open the doori needed a key and of course i didnt have my picklocks with me we could go up to the third floor and climb down the way id come up but i didnt want to do that if i didnt absolutely have tothe body of a woman old enough to have a teenage son was not happy after a night of pond diving wall climbing and stair chasing the house had at least two other entrancesthe one on the back terrace that catherine had been using and one out through the kitchen there was probably also a basement exit that might be easier to use im going to explore the other doors you wait here for me okay when he didnt respond i put my hands on his shoulderswoman though i was okay he stiffened but muttered okay okay sounding like the universal teenager fed up with adult bossiness i switched on my lamp again to navigate the hall with no furnishings or rugs to soften it the high wide space seemed not just barren but menacing shivering from more than cold i opened doors on empty rooms checking windows and locks until i got to the back of the house where the hall opened onto the terrace room this was the area that led to the gardens and the pond with the french doors that catherine bayard had used i switched off my lamp and peered into the night wondering if she might be going to show up after all it was onethirty in the morning catherine might try to slip out if she thought her house was sound asleep it would be helpful if she arrived with her key if i couldnt get out any other way id break one of the glass panels in the french door but i moved on to my right looking for the kitchen moving past geraldines fathers study its floortoceiling bookshelves empty except for a cd by nsync presumably left behind by the nounous i came to the swinging door that id expected after my jaunt to the bayards and again found myself in servants space narrower hall cheaper wood in the floors lower ceilings the kitchen held an array of appliances still shiny with newnessa sixburner restaurantweight stove three ovens including a standalone bread oven a walkin freezer two refrigerators the current vanity of wealthy homeowners these monstrous toysalthough maybe mrs nounou really was an accomplished chef maybe shed been baking thousands of quiches to support the family since her husbands dotcom business went south i looked in the pantry which was windowless the computer for the house was there too catherine had apparently switched off the motion detectors but id need a code to turn off the current to the doors and windows beyond the pantry i found a small bathroom it did have a window built high into the wall not only would it have been hard to climb out but it too had white security piping across it the back door had a heavy dead bolt which i undid but it was also keyed shut i looked hastily through the cabinets brushed stainless steel covering one whole wall a colander had been abandoned and a box of decorative toothpicks id have to try to use the small knife in my day pack but i needed a secondary tool that meant the plastic toothpicks with their whimsical animal heads with the divers light trained on the door i began working the lock using toothpicks to hold the tumblers in place as i found them the first time i had two pressed back the toothpicks broke the second time a soft footfall behind me made my blood run cold i dropped the knife and jumped up to see benjamin standing anxiously behind me i think you are leaving me he said simply just trying to open this lock look kneel down here next to me and hold this toothpick in place he was still carrying his book but he laid it now on a counter and came to kneel next to me i showed him how i was pushing the cylinders back and how to hold them in place there are three altogether youll have to hold two while i undo the third no dont push so hard i spoke too late the toothpick snapped in his nervous fingers not to worry feel my fingers feel the way im holding it his hands brushed mine nervously as if contact would burn him but the next time i had the roller pushed back he held the toothpick in place and then a second i was working the third and trickiest roller when we both heard the car dont move i said sharply were almost there his hand gave a convulsive jerk and the toothpicks clattered to the floor is the police i dont know lets get this damned door open come on on the kitchen side of the house we couldnt see the drive we couldnt hear activity at the front door wed only heard the car because it had driven past the main entrance toward this side of the house maybe geraldine graham had seen my light and called the sheriff in which case the deputies would make a brief survey and leave but if fiddling with the lock had set off the alarm or if renee bayard had summoned the law then we were in trouble benjamin sadawi was shaking too hard to help me i looked around the kitchen hed suffocate in the refrigerator but he was a small slim boy and the bread oven was big i hustled him over to it im not going to leave without you unless im arrested and cant help it but you stay in this oven until you hear from me he insisted on taking the book with him i pulled the racks from their shelves stacked them behind the refrigerator and halflifted halfbent him into place i took one of my work gloves and used it to keep the door open a crack enough that he could breathe and hear and then ran back to the outside door i was practically weeping with weariness but i forced myself to work methodically if the newcomers were outside the back door i couldnt let my mind wander toward unknown terrors keep your head in the game vic one pick in place now the second the third tumbler rolled back just as i heard footsteps moving on the uncarpeted floor toward the kitchen i opened the back door pushed in the lock to keep it from closing on me again and stuffed my makeshift tools into the nearest drawer whos there i shouted pressing myself against the wall behind the swinging door two uniformed deputies came in holding flashlights so powerful i couldnt make out their faces i could just see that a third figure loomed behind them a mans voice said sharply if it isnt the chicago dick i thought we told you to stay the hell away from dupage county chapter well howdy lieutenant it was lieutenant schorr the sheriffs officer whod been so aggressive sunday night next to him silent and ramrod stiff stood deputy protheroe lieutenant i smiled an exuberant greeting you know how it is with us innercity kidswe get one whiff of country air and we long for more its so clean and pure out here except when people drown remote from cars trains and home i mean protheroe spoke quickly before schorr could react warshawski you are definitely the bad penny in this larchmont soap opera how did you get into the house the kitchen door was open so i came in is that why youre here the alarm get triggered why were here is none of your business but why youre here is our business schorr walked to the door to check that it was indeed open i pulled myself up onto the counter floating in the middle of the kitchennot as easily as i would have done if i hadnt been wall climbing diving and the rest of it already this evening but forcing schorr to come between me and benjamins oven if he wanted to see me now that he was holding his flashlight away from my eyes i could see that the third member of the party was the lawyers dogsbody larry yosano i gave yosano a friendly hello before adding lieutenant marcus whitbys family doesnt share sheriff salvis easy optimism about their sons death theyve hired me to investigate i came out to look into the pond which i did with interesting results so you admit to trespass schorr said we keep having problems with that verb dont we i sounded as chipper as a cheerleader with a hometeam victory i agree that i was on this land i assert that ms geraldine graham and her son darraugh graham ceo of continental united group asked me to come onto this land to see who was in this house i submit that you lieutenant dismissed ms grahams claims that she saw lights in the attic i suggest that you thought she was demented and failed to investigate i contend that i did not share your view so tonight when i finished raking through the pond i decided to take one last look at the house the back door was open and i announce without hesitation that i took the opportunity to come inside schorr frowned heavily he didnt speak not because hed been wowed by my delightful banterwhich i thought impressive given how tired i wasbut because id reminded him that i had friends in high places before he had to say or do anything that might cost him face two young men barged through the swinging door they were breathless with excitement no ones here now lieutenant but someones definitely been living up in the attic lookee what we found the speaker held out the books that had been on the attic desk with benjamins arabenglish dictionary on top one of the windows was open on the third floor the second deputy said we think he heard us coming and jumped down you can get to the porch roof from the third floor and slide down the columns to the ground did anyone run past you when you were coming in stephanie protheroe asked me i shook my head he must have left when he heard me arrive because no one was in the attic when i got up there and i didnt see any open windows when i circled the house looking for a way in i was just about to start exploring the basement when you guys showed up there any place to hide in the cellar schorr demanded of yosano the lawyer gave a shrug ive never explored the house but as far as i know only the usual stuff is down there furnaces laundry no secret cupboards or anything like that well search just in case schorr said adding to the two young men good work you two you start combing the grounds see if this guy is hidingthese fields could conceal a lot of people arab likely a terrorist on the run he could have any kind of weapon so you see him dont hesitate just shoot the two young men saluted and departed almost tripping over each other in their excitement puppies admitted to the hunt for the first time so eager to get their fox theyd probably kill a unicorn if it crossed their trail schorr shone his flashlight smartly in protheroes face she winced and turned her head away you go through the cellar just in case steph these alqaeda guys theyre smart enough to make you think theyve jumped out a window when all the time theyre hiding in the basement yosano you get the power turned on we need to see what the hell were doing when yosano said it would have to wait until the start of normal business hourscom ed wouldnt regard this as an emergencythe lieutenant slammed a hand against a stainless steel cabinet and then swore as the hard metal bit his bone this fucking is an emergency an arab terrorist out here in new solway get on it yosano kept his voice patient with an effort it will have to wait until morning lieutenant schorr schorr got half a swearword out but bit it off to run to the door and call out to his two young deputies when he didnt get a response he turned back and shouted at deputy protheroe who had found the stairwell leading to the basement before you go down there call over to headquarters see if they can send us out a generator get something rigged up so we can see what were doing i dont want us shooting each other because were crashing around in the dark so he wasnt totally stupid only giving a good imitation i slid off the counter and moved toward the cellar door still trying to keep attention away from benjamins oven should we call ms bayard first stephanie protheroe asked her hand still on the doorknob some camera crew is going to be scanning our calls you know and theyll get here we might want to let her know we think there was a terrorist here before a tv outfit shows up trying to ask her questions so they were here because renee bayard had decided on a preemptive strike i wondered how this would affect catherines relations with her grandmother the flashlights cast menacing shadows around the kitchen turning schorrs heavy frown into a gargoyle grimace yeah id better do that any place to sit and have a private conversation in this mausoleum he added to yosano all the furniture was taken out when the previous owners had to leave the lawyer said there are chairs and a desk in the attic i said ms graham probably forgot she had discards up there when she sold the house you have a lot of slick answers dont you schorr said how do you know theyre her things i dont really i suppose arab terrorists could have stolen them from some of the houses around here and carried them up to the attic we cant be too careful about anything these days i opened the basement door where the fuck you going you got your deputies searching the grounds and ordering generators i thought id start on the cellar you stay right here dont move from the kitchen until i get back from phoning yosano you lock this back door so princess twinkle toes here doesnt go dancing off into the night before i have a chance to check on her felony warrants so that was why hed brought the lawyer to unlock the doors for him i still dont understand how a terrorist got in here without a key the alarm has not been breached despite what ms warshawski is saying we checked the house each time mrs graham phoned in a complaint yosano said but he obediently did up the lock id struggled so hard to open his remark made schorr decide he ought to search me to see if i had a key to larchmont or heaven forbid had used picklocks to get in despite protheroes presence schorr patted me down himself a little more roughly than necessary i thought of benjamins cry of you womanyou man i wanted to say hands off but i stood very still when schorr found my house and car keys in my day pack he made a big show of comparing them to the house alarm key he thought he was going to pocket them but i took them from him again before her commanding officer could escalate hostilities deputy protheroe intervened im going out to the car sir to order the emergency generator do you want to come with me to phone ms bayard it will probably be more comfortable in the car than the attic because we can run the heater yeah okay stay here with her yosano i dont have an extra deputy to keep an eye on this gal and i dont trust her yosano squirmed in embarrassment really lieutenant its not as though ms warshawski has a criminal record shes working for the graham family or says she is schorr snapped every time something fishy has happened out here this week this chicago dickette has been in a frontrow seat id kinda like to know why is it all right if i use the bathroom i asked in a meek little voice theres one just off the pantry here and my cramps are starting to get the better of me you dont have a tampon do you mine are in my car like many hemen schorr was disgusted by talk of real womens real bodieshe was out of the kitchen before i finished speaking i went into the bathroom switched on my divers lamp and climbed up onto the toilet seat to undo the window locks there was an extra bolt in the window for security but that was to keep outsiders away the key was on a hook next to the frame the bottom sash was stuck through years of disuse flushing the toilet a couple of times covered the sound i made forcing it open the alarm would definitely go off now but since it rang in lebold arnoffs office and they already had their dogsbody on the scene i hoped theyd think the deputies had tripped it looking around on the upper floors i took a quick look out the window faced south toward the road the deputies were searching the north back in the kitchen yosano was fiddling with a handheld trying to play some game by the computers backlight i didnt know how long benjamin could keep quiet in that oven i needed some strategy for getting the lawyer out of the kitchen they interrupt your private life to bring you over here tonight i asked he nodded but im only on call one week a month and usually we dont have such dramatic crises usually its just a client wanting to change a will or being lonely in the night did mr taverner call you in out of loneliness he continued fiddling with the keys the computer binged every time he made a score oh yes and like many of the old ones he thought of me as a servant oh they all think the lawyers are their servants but being a japaneseamerican im like a gardener in their eyes they need to pee im supposed to help them with their bottles and bedpans sounds horrible surely you could get a less demeaning job he shrugged the money is incredible and some of its interesting we work for such powerful people youre sort of part of history sometimes like these papers that taverner had its been so long since mr arnoffs done daytoday work with the clients he probably wouldnt know about them but taverner was a lonely old guy hed tap that locked drawer and say he knew people in new york whod pay ten million bucks to get their hands on them i thought of benjamin in the oven but i couldnt miss this chance to ask yosano what was in the papers i never saw them the computer made a derisive sound to let him know hed bombed but he used to say theyd make the hollywood ten look like goldilocks and the three bears and it was a shame he was a man of honor who gave his word not to divulge them didnt you wish hed show them to you oh sure yosano said but were his executors i knew id see them sooner or later and then you always wonder if it really is going to be such a big deal its human when you get that old to hope youve done something so big the rest of us will never forget you but a lot of the time its something no one cares about anymore i was about to argue that someone cared or marcus whitby wouldnt have drowned outside the room we were standing in when a gunshot ripped open the night chapter when you need a ride steal a car when you hear a you never think it was a backfire or a firecracker yosano and i froze and then he ran through the swinging door to the front of the house as soon as the door swung shut i opened the oven come with me dont ask questions and dont speak i told benjamin he was giving off the sweet sickly sweat of fear and he couldnt stand hed been lying doubled up so long i slung him over my shoulder firemanstyle and humped to the bathroom double time he was clutching his book still and it dug into my sore shoulder he was fifteen or sixteen but such a skinny kid it wasnt as hard a ride as id feared inside the bathroom i set him down and worked on his legs he was still shying away from my touch but fear and cold had made him numb he didnt resist as soon as he could stand i turned off my headlamp opened the window and looked out we could hear the excited yelling from the front of the house but we were clear here in the back im going to give you a boost up to this window i spoke in the flat tongueless speech you learn in prison because it doesnt carry far you slide through you drop to the ground you lie flat on your stomach and wait for me got it i felt rather than saw him nod i gave him a boost up to the sill and helped him wriggle his legs through as he twisted he dropped his book he cried out i stuck up my hand and covered his mouth ill hand it to you get through and get down when he seemed unwilling to leave without it i pushed him he clung briefly to the sill and then fell he didnt cry out again so i assumed hed landed without breaking anything i climbed up on the toilet seat dropped his book through the opening and hoisted myself onto the sill the stab of pain between my shoulders was so intense i had to hold back my own cry i sat for a few seconds gathering my breath then began the hard job of wriggling through the windowa grown womans hips are wider than a skinny adolescents when a second shot reechoed it startled me so that i landed in a heap almost on top of benjamin the fall knocked the wind out of me and i lay gagging for air trying not to make any noise we were at the southeast corner of the mansion we could hear excited shouts as the puppies and schorr tried to figure out where their prey had fallen they had shot at a raccoon or a deer they had not shotnotan ardent teenage girl running through the fields to protect her protege i wanted to dash to the back what are you morons doing you machodrunk fools shooting at shadows and children i grabbed the grass in front of me tying myself to the ground here if i joined the hunt id leave the boy here where he would be found arrested if not shot and schorr was jumpy enough to arrest me or even shoot me if i showed my face what they doing benjamin cried in an undervoice they shot at something probably a raccoon an animal as soon as they figure that out theyll be looking for me so lets move animal you think not he thought better of finishing the sentence come on i said roughly were going we are going to go straight across the lawn here the house will keep the people in back from seeing us when we get to that tall grass we are going to go through it you will stay right behind me got it he stumbled to his feet we couldnt go fast he could barely walk and certainly not run cold hunger confusion far from home in a country that wanted to put him in prison for beingwhat if he was a terrorist id deal with that down the road but if he was just a kid in the wrong place at a time when fear was holding the horses reins in america i needed to deal with that too we were halfway across the lawn when two more squad cars squealed up the drive lights flashing i turned to benjamin and pulled him smartly to the ground lying flat next to him until the cars were at the house lifting my head i watched the side of the house we were facing they hadnt found the open bathroom window yet all the action was in the fields and gardens at the back lets go hands and knees you go forward ill keep an eye out the work gloves shielded my hands from the stickers growing in the untended lawn but benjamin didnt have any protection when i saw him unable to put his hands down i stripped the gloves off and forced them onto his hands move its our only chance while theyre doing what theyre doing we crawled through the unmown grass to the untended field beyond i was lightheaded with fatigue and hunger my shoulders ached i was scared only the snuffling from the boy in front of me tears manfully suppressed air sucked painfully in kept me going the deputies had rigged up the searchlights while we were stumbling through shrubs the sudden light arcing through the night sky behind us startled me i tripped on a fallen branch and landed in rotting leaves at least if they sent dogs after us they wouldnt find us by our smell when we reached the ditch by the side of coverdale lane i cautiously poked my head through the shrubbery to survey the road a squad car blocked the intersection of coverdale with dirksen where i had left my mustang i couldnt see clearly at this distance but they had probably found the car might be waiting next to it for me i sank back down into the ditch close to screaming with fatigue and frustration we were trapped i fought back panic benji whispered how we are going to do the only possibility was to cross coverdale and fight our way through the hedge to anodyne park on the far side taking a chance that they wouldnt see us in the road if i had the wings of a dove or the shovel snout of a mole a mole if that culvert id stumbled on yesterday came this far under cover of sirens and of a helicopter that had arrived on the scene i explained to benji as best i could what i was looking for i would explore east toward my car he would crawl along the ditch to the west let it open up here on this side of the road i begged the whimsical ruler of the universe let me find it before they find me i crawled along slowly patting the embankment praying for it to give way about fifty feet from where the squad car stood benji tapped my shoulder with a soft timid hand he had found the entrance i crawled back after him the opening was a black hole on the road side of the ditch not high enough for me to stand upright but just wide enough for us to move side by side it smelled of mold and animal droppings and it was as dark as the entrance to death we couldnt afford to show a light i grabbed benjis left hand with my right he didnt try to withdraw indeed he clung to me trembling as we squelched along the muddy floor it should have been a quarter mile getting to the hedge going under powell road coming up in anodyne park but the tunnel seemed to stretch endlessly in front of us what if we werent under powell road at all but were shuffling into the deep tunnel we could wander for hours until we collapsed and died of hunger and thirst no one would find our bones for years if they ever came on them at all morrell lotty everyone i loved who cared about me they would forget me already they were so far away that they didnt exist my breath rasped dry against my tonsils my back ached from walking in a stoop red darts flashed across my eyes and then we were suddenly breathing fresh air smelling the juniper berries scrambling uphill standing upright on asphalt i shuddered in relief we stood trembling for a few minutes stretching sore muscles listening for pursuit all was blissfully quiet anodyne the healing of pain all we needed was a car and wed be home free i led benji up the winding path toward the town houses where cars were parked for the night in the drives that lay behind them in this wealthy enclave i didnt expect to find an old car the kind where i could break the steering column and pull out the ignition rod but the fifth house we came to luck favored us someone had left their keys in a jaguar xk id always wanted to drive one of these i opened the door for benji you are stealing this car borrowing i grinned the owner will get it back tomorrow chapter back to the briar patch so its you my girl is it been long enough since you showed your face around here come to serve early mass for me father lou stood at the rectory door in tshirt and trousers his face still red from shaving as id driven along ogden avenue into the city i figured if i didnt get to the rectory before father lou started robing i could slip into the church with the handful of neighborhood people who came for the six am service as it was even taking the long slow route i managed to pull around to the back of the building by fivethirty benjamin had fallen asleep before we reached warrenville road i kept my window open needing cold air on my face to keep my own longing for sleep from overpowering me but i ran the heater so that the vents pointed on the young man his book fell from his slackened hand i leaned over at a stoplight and put it in his lap so he wouldnt wake up distressed hed dropped it while we were in the ditch and revealedin a defiant gasp as if he expected me to strike him or abandon him on the spotthat it was the koran his fathers own copy he could not lose it in that case wed better hang on to it was all i said when i had us both strapped into the jaguar a wave of fatigue crested over me pulling me under i only woke a few minutes later because a helicopter thundered directly over us heading east i blinked at it hoping it was taking a teenager to a hospital not to a morgue i put the car in gear and drove slowly past the guard station the man in the booth nodded at the car he was there to keep the world out it didnt matter who left the complex i bypassed the tollway preferring to take ogden avenue if schorr decided to issue an apb on me theyd stake out the expressways first they wouldnt know what car i was driving but they might guess id taken someone elses when i didnt show up at the mustang even forty miles out ogden is not a beautiful street every town along its route had decided this was the place for car dealerships for fastfood joints for gas stations and junkyards once the street crosses the city limits it goes from tacky to grim finishing its life near the cabrini green housing project a number of cabrinis towers have been torn down as the gold coast oozes west but those that remain with their broken windows and bulletpocked playgrounds still present an ominous face to the city as we drove in a fair amount of traffic already filled the roadearly commuters pulling into the endless strip malls for the days first coffee people coming off the night shift stopping for a burger at one point i dozed off again at a traffic light the hydraulic honk from the truck behind me scared me awakei thought id heard another shot i thought we were surrounded the adrenaline from that kept me alert for the rest of the route the jaguar engine was quiet as a feather dropping on a leaf and the power inside made me itch to swoop in and out of lanes or go sixty on roads posted for forty on an impulse waiting for a light at austin just before crossing the border into chicago i called murray ryerson on my cell phone he was grumpy about being woken up but became alert even aggressive when i told him id met sheriffs deputies out at larchmont they were going nuts thinking they had some arab terrorist in their sights they shot someone i didnt feel like hanging aroundthey were being mean to mebut i have a queasy feeling about the shooting what about killing a terrorist makes you queasy he demanded i dont think thats who they shot i think they may have hit a member of the bayard family perhaps even calvin bayards granddaughter and if thats the case they will try to keep it very very quiet you actually see the body is that the basis of your feeling murray was truculenthes known me too many years i was there in the early evening looking for clues about marcus whitby in the larchmont mansion pond i found his pocket organizer by the way that seemed like an unconnected time and place to where i was now anyway two of the bayards came by then and from their conversation i had a feeling they might be back thats all thats not enough not nearly enough tell me about whitbys gizmo was there anything suggestive in it yeahfour days of pond scum im taking it to a forensic lab so they can dry it out and take it apart another honk goosed me into remembering i was driving i hung up hastily on murrays indignant squawk i turned off my phoneif murray wanted to call back the ringer would wake benjamin besides i didnt want to tell murray anything else right now i just wanted to make sure lieutenant schorr couldnt sit on it if hed shot catherine at western avenue ogden turns northeast angling past the juvenile detention center you are not going there my friend if i can help it i said to the sleeping boy he muttered something guttural probably in arabic and shifted in his seat i turned north onto western and drove four miles through the drab hindquarters of the citys industrial zone the lights from factories and trucks made it hard to tell whether the night sky was starting to lighten the air was gray and gritty both day and night around here we were also close to the criminal courts and cook county jail so there was a heavy squad car presence i tried to keep my mind on the traffic not on the possibility that someone might be looking for a borrowed jaguars plates i breathed easier when id moved out of the area at north avenue i was only two blocks from my office but i turned west again into humboldt park where gentrification hasnt yet touched the hispanic neighborhoods if someone was hunting me theyd have my office staked out but i didnt think anyone would look for me in a mexican church i parked on a small side street behind it was a job to rouse benjamin and a bigger job to make him come with me to a christian church i know what priests doing with boys in church i know they hurting boys doing bad things with boys not in this church i said pulling him up the walk like a recalcitrant mule this is the one building in chicago that i know where you can be warm where you can get something to eat and where you can be safe this priest is a boxer i let go of him long enough to mime boxingthis priest has harbored fugitives he will look out for you he will try to turn me from my believing mymy he hunted for a wordfrom the truth no he wont do that he believes in his truth as much as you believe in yours but he will not disrespect your belief he doesnt disrespect my beliefs which are different again from both yours and his and catterine she cannot see me here and how can i know she is not shotted shot catherine will be able to see you here if its safe for both of youit may not be this really is the best place for you right now benjamin he didnt believe me but he was old enough to know when he was out of options and maybe too he figured id kept him safe this long i might be trusted to keep him safe a bit longer or maybe he was just so tired he couldnt fight anything going on around him whatever the reason when father lou answered my anxious pushing on the rectory bell benjamin stayed at my side father lous tshirt exposed the formidable muscles in his neck and forearms that hed developed in his boxing years his frown as he took in benjamins and my bedraggled appearance made him look like a menacing popeye i hoped he didnt frighten benjamin into running this someone morrell sent you the priest growled my stomach felt queer at morrells name the nights labors had kept me from thinking about him and now it came back to me in a rush that he was missing or missing anyway to me ive lost track of morrell never mind that now this young man has been hiding in an abandoned house out in the western suburbs i found him moments before sheriffs deputies surrounded the place he needs to be warm he needs to eat and he needs to be in a place where the county cops and the city cops and john ashcrofts cops arent going to find him they have a good reason to look for him father lou pulled back the heavy door far enough that we could come in yeah they dont like his race creed or place of national origin that a fact you got a name kid his faded blue eyes looked directly at the boy who didnt withdraw as id fearedid forgotten the priest had dealt with generations of frightened boys benjamin the youth whispered benjamin sadawi mass in seven minutes father lou said got to get to church ben you go with victoria to the kitchen shell make you tea and eggs fix you up with a bed unless its been so long since youve been here my girl you dont remember where anything is i do not go to christian church benjamin said not asking you to got other rules you have to follow if you stay here no drugs no weapons no cigarettes say your prayers however you want special intention for morrell he added to me for the kid too jesus doesnt care if he prays in arabic he stumped off down a dark corridor connecting the rectory to st remigios church i took benjamin down a different unlit hallway to the kitchen father lou saves money in his financially strapped parish by not keeping lights in the halls i had to switch on my headlamp again to guide us to the kitchen the batteries were wearing out the light was feeble like my legs at this point in the kitchen i found the matches to light a burner on the heavy old stove i was surprised in a way that father lou even had spent the money on a gas stove instead of keeping a coal burner or whatever had been in the rectory when the church was built in the s in the refrigerator i found the eggs that were the staple of the priests diet he had margarine and a big block of cheese as well i scrambled them all together in a castiron skillet father lou ate a lot of bacon but i remembered not to offer that to a muslim youth while the margarine was melting i switched on a transistor radio perched on top of the refrigerator it was the wrong time for news highlights i got ads and sports reports the bulls had lost again along with the blackhawks its no easier to be a chicago fan in the winter than in the summer benjamin had removed his sweatshirt to fold it carefully on the cracked linoleum he knelt down on it to recite his morning prayers but when the radio came on he looked up his thin face anxious no news i said ill turn it back on when youre done i cleared space on the enamel kitchen table budget figures the sports pages from a weeks worth of papers school essays and advertising catalogs were all jumbled together i swept them into a pile without trying to organize themif he needed to find something father lou would sort through the stack id seen him do it a number of times looking for old sermon notes hes the only person i know more disorganized than i am i set down eggs tortillas and cambric teaa little tea and a lot of hot sweetened milkfor benjamin and me we both needed our blood sugar raised about now i took a couple of aspirin from the bottle in my day pack and swallowed them with the tea maybe they would persuade my sore shoulder to calm down benjamin finished his prayers with a defensive glance at me his prayer schedule must have anchored him during his long days alone given him something to rely on his fathers koran his fathers prayer schedule like my mothers vocal exercises the routine of the beloved makes you feel that the beloved is with you news now he said please you are finding out of catterine about catherine i corrected him absently about catherine he echoed i turned the radio back on finally at half past the hour we got the local news responding to a complaint from neighbors dupage county sheriffs deputies raided an abandoned house in unincorporated new solway early this morning according to sheriff rick salvi an arab man wanted for questioning in connection with the september attacks had been hiding in the house the man made his escape through a thirdstory window as deputies were storming the house as they combed thegrounds a local girl was injured by a gun shot the sheriffs office refused to confirm reports that one of the deputies fired the gun but the injured girl is catherine bayard who was taking a late walk through the fields behind the home of hergrandfather chicago publisher calvin bayard sheriff salvi has said its possible ms bayard was shot by the wanted man he will issue a full report after he has inspected his deputies weapons ms bayard is in an area hospital in serious but stable condition the wanted man was in the same house where chicago investigator vi warshawski found a dead body on sunday night warshawski was actually in the house when sheriffs deputies arrived on the scene but left while they were still searching the grounds whether she has a connection to the missing man is unknown at this time but sheriff salvi is anxious to talk to her and i to you sheriff i switched off the radio turning to benjamin how much of that did you understand he shook his head too quickly talking catterine they talk of her about her they talk about september about arabs but what they are saying catherine was shot but she will recovershe will get well they didnt say where she was hit but they did say serious but stable which means a bad injury but not one that will kill her that is true his eyes were painfully large in his thin face you his lips moved as he went through a vocabulary list in his head you swearing that is true i swore to him that i was telling the truth about catherine i added that i would find out what hospital she was in and exactly how shed been hurt but that i needed to sleep first i left out the rest of the story the manhunt for him he probably guessed it but putting it into words would make it too stark we both needed sleep not anxiety now i was too exhausted to think or talk when i got up to carry the plates to the sink tears spurted down my face involuntary the bodys protest against further effort no heartening slogans from the basketball court no remembered lectures of my mothers could make me stop crying weeping i led benjamin to the second floor where a series of narrow bedrooms stood left over from the days when the catholic church was awash with priests and a parish like st remigio had five or six on its roster army blankets were folded at the foot of the beds and thin down pillows as ancient as the building stood at the heads the most elaborate furnishing was the wooden crucifix over each bed carved so realistically that benjamin looked at his in horror i removed it from the wall over his bed and put it in the linen closet the rooms were cold left unheated to save on fuel but they held minute electric heaters for emergency guests like us i turned them on showed benjamin where the bathroom was put sheets on beds in two adjacent rooms and fell asleep still weeping chapter warming up i awoke from my most familiar nightmare my mother had disappeared i was looking for her panicstricken because the only reason she would leave was that she didnt love me any more the search changes from dream to dream this time i was in the dark culvert that connected new solway with anodyne park behind me i could hear a hissing and knew dreamwise that it was the hissing of tires in the mud i ran pellmell until i crashed into the evergreen bush the wheels came closer and i saw a giant golf cart about to run me over i woke my heart pounding my arms and shoulders so stiff it was painful to move them when i pushed myself up on the narrow bed my stomach muscles trembled i sat bleareyed wanting just to lie back down and sleep for a hundred years until i felt well until morrell came home until these times of fear and brutality passed i thought of the horrors wrought in the hundred years now ending and didnt think waiting another century for peace would bring much solace i maneuvered myself to the head of the bed and found my watch one oclockin the afternoon given that the gray march light still seeped in through the dirty window the single bar of the space heater did no more than take an edge from the cold room i lay back down pulling the army blanket up to my nose my mother died when i was in my teens like many people who lose a parent young i believed it was my fault some failing on my part that had made her leave all the times id upset her racing into trouble with my cousin boomboom if i had come home on time practiced my music as she so often begged me and on morningsafternoonslike this awakening in pain brought on by one more headlong plunge into danger my heart twisted again my mind told me differently told me of the cancer that went unchecked untreated for too many yearslike many immigrant women she would not let a doctor especially a man examine her in her private spaces the bleeding that went on and on after a miscarriage couldnt overcome her revulsion against exposure i shut my eyes to keep from looking at the crucifix it was two feet high with thorns and blood no less vivid for being covered in dust i should have put it in the linen closet with the one from benjamins room i knew i would feel better if i took a bath and started stretching my muscles but the routine felt old and dreary to mesore joints stretch recoverin order to overtax my body another time itd started as a teenager when id gone cold into a basketball game suffered the next day and followed coach mcfarlanes advice on stretches and warmups in the years since id had too many jobrelated injuries too many days when id woken up feeling as sore as though i really had been run over by a giant golf cart the thought of beginning again with heat and exercise only annoyed me what was i pushing myself for anyway so i could keep racing around town looking for crooks and murderers that no one wanted me to find in the interview with kylie ballantine that id read at the librarywas it only two days agoshed said when she was twenty she could take a threeweek vacation and be back in shape after one days hard work but that shed reached an age where missing a single day took three weeks of conditioning to recover and so she worked out every day my heroine i pushed myself upright once more and stumbled into the bathroom i began doing the things i knew i needed to do to recovernot easily since the guest bathroom to give the chipped stained fittings and cracked walls a fancy name had no heat at least it made me move fast i jogged back to the narrow bedroom which felt downright cozy in contrast i put the two army blankets on the floor and spent half an hour stretching out my legs and arms i must have torn a muscle in my left trapezius from the knife stabs it gave me when i extended my arms but when i finished i thought my legs would carry me along i couldnt bear the thought of last nights torn and filthy clothes but my suit was in the trunk of my own car out in new solway i put on the stained rank sweatshirt and tried not to think about it on my way downstairs i looked in on benjamin he was still asleep i found father lou in his study working on his sunday homily he grunted when he heard me come in but kept typing until he finished a passage he used an old royal electric banging away with two fingers i did leg lifts while i waited to keep the circulation going kid still sleeping father lou said when he finally looked up listened to the noon news guess hes the arab they lost out in dupage you think hes a terrorist i made a face i dont think so but i cant say i know what signs to look for the priest wheezed hoarselyhis idea of laughter neither does the fbi dont imagine a county sheriff is any smarter than the bureau whats the boys story i dont know how or why but catherine bayardthe young woman who got shot last nightscooped him up and took him out to this deserted mansion near her grandparents country estate i explained who the bayards were and how id come to be involved in the situation romeo and juliet father lou echoed my own image they in love they making love i shrugged benjamin has pretty strong feelings for her but she think with her it was quixotismwanting to follow in her grandfathers footsteps catherine lives in a larger milieu than benjamin with school and horses and an important family he had only her to think about for three weeks or however long its been butshe didnt tell her grandmother what she was doing and ive seen her with her grannytheyre pretty close so i dont know what she feels for him personally maybe hes exotic egyptian a bluecollar youth for some rich kids crossing so many boundaries of race and class can seem daring even exalting teenagers everything too intense all the time probably gave her word not to tell a soul and felt that included the whole world girls at northwestern hospitalthey medevacked her into the city know the chaplain there he says a bullet nicked the humerus cracked it not lifethreatening you going to see her probably but i dont think i should tell her benjamins here when she was protecting him she didnt have all the law enforcement agencies in the country breathing down her neck ill let her know hes safe but i dont think she should have to worry about standing up to interrogation on his safety i picked at a hole in the chair i was sitting in i dont know how serious the feds and the rest of them are going to be about wanting to find benjamin they may talk to me and let me go after that or they may try a trace on everything i do to be on the safe side i think i need to assume that all my phoneshome office mobileand possibly even my email will be monitored think theyll charge you under this patriot bill whatever it is the priest asked i grimaced i hope notthe last few years ive already had more jail time than i can really use anyway if the fbi gets involved and if they really want benjamin they can put enough people on me that i may not be able to shake them so once i show up at home i wont be able to get back in touch with you or vice versa if you cant keep benjamin let me know now so i can try to come up with some other safe house dont seem to be able to keep track of their own weapons these days the feds shouldnt think theyd have the manpower to follow one gal like you around town still better safe than sorry baker street irregularsi can send some of my toughs over to you on bikesyour office still over there near milwaukee right easy ride for these kids if you want me he grinned showing his yellow teeth say a prayer godll let me know meaning i could come to church as far as young ben goes ill sort him out father lou went on think youre right think hes a scared kid on the run in which case ill keep him until we figure out where else to send him if hes doing something he shouldnt be give him to uncle sam let you know either way theres one other thing about him i said i think he saw some part of what happened to marcus whitby sunday night he would stand at the attic window watching for catherine and you get a view from there of most of the pond if he saw the person who put whitby into the wateri want to know father lou thought it over decided it wasnt an unreasonable request and nodded agreement see what i can get him to say whats happening with morrell my stomach tightened hes off on some hot lead that he didnt want to reveal online and youre angry im angry im supposed to weave tapestries while he does god knows what in god knows whose company the priest gave his wheezy laugh again you weave tapestries my girl you aint the passive waiting type so dont sit there feeling sorry for yourself get off your tail and get to work i have to finish my sermon i blushed in embarrassment and stood up father lou saw the flash of pain across my face from my shoulder i tried to make light of it but he led me through the church to the school on the far side even on a saturday afternoon the gym was filled with kids some shooting baskets but most working out on boxing dummies st remigios routinely won state boxing titles and every boy in school dreamed of making the team father lou stopped to correct one boys arm position set another closer to the bag and warned two others not to bring personal fights into his gym they all nodded solemnly father lou had the magic touch of believable authority in this world he might chew out his kids but he never let them down he took me into a small infirmary built off the gym he handed me a towel to use as an improvised robe and told me to take off my sweatshirt i sat on a stool with my back to him draped modestly in the towel while he ran his hands along my shoulders and upper back when he found the spot that made me squawk loudest he rubbed something into it used this on horses when i was a boy got them back between the traces in no time flat he gave another of his sudden barks of laughter put some in ajar for you get someone to rub it in if you cant reach the spot best if you tape it up leave that stinking shirt here take one of ours he handed me an orange and gray st remigios sweatshirt faded from much washing but mercifully clean when i pulled it on my trapezius already moved a bit more smoothly he escorted me out the back door of the school to my borrowed wheels you get in trouble girl come back here no one to look after you but those two dogs and an old man he laughed again probably only got six to seven years on contreras but i fight regularly and he dont ins city cops theyre around here all the time fbi wants to join in wont bother me when i put the jaguar in gear and drove off my shoulder moved only a little better but my spirits were easier the voice of believable authority it worked on me too chapter superhero while i was still in the cleari hopedi went to a place called techsurround to send whitbys pocket organizer to the forensic lab i use you can do everything at techsurround from photocopying to sending mail i used their computer to type up a letter to the lab explaining where the wallet had been said that i wanted to see any papers whitby might have kept in it told them to make it a top priority job and put the whole thing in a bubblepack envelope i was about to stick the envelope into a fedex packet but today was saturday the lab wouldnt get it until monday i didnt want to use my cell phone in case someone was actively tracing me but the one thing techsurround lacked was a pay phone i risked turning on my mobile for a minute to phone the messenger service i use arranging for a pickup at techsurroundi planned to be here for a bit checking messages i logged onto one of their computers and looked at both my phone log and my emails which depressed me since there was nothing from morrell and a slew of messages from murray ryerson catherine bayard had been shot this was big news in chicago he had scooped the city because of me so i got dinner at the filigreeespecially since dupage had first tried to pretend shed been shot by a fleeing arabbut why the hell hadnt i mentioned terrorists and did i know police from three jurisdictions wanted to talk to me make it four if you counted new solways finest i sent him back a brief message saying it was nice to be wanted i knew nothing about terrorists id slept through the day in a motel and id get back to him after all the fine men and women in blue had mauled me i also typed a quick message to morrell shutting my eyes trying to remember what he looked like what he sounded like but gray mist swirled behind my eyes when i said his name morrell where are you i whispered but i exed that out ive had twentyfour unusual hours upside down in a pond and squeezing out through mansion windows wherever you are i hope youre warm safe and well fed i love you maybe before leaving the machine i pulled up my phone log which only confirmed what murray had said dupage sheriff rick salvi wanted me asap in which he was joined by the chicago policewhich i couldnt figure outand derek hatfield from the fbi who would appreciate my calling at my earliest convenience behind the bureaucratic formula i could hear dereks baritone rumble with menace there were also two messages from geraldine graham i hadnt expected to hear from her again after darraughs furious phone call but i should have realized that his mother would want the inside story on what happened last night at her beloved larchmont shed probably watched the helicopters and emergency vehicles from her living room darraugh had also called i would get to the grahams in due course but i couldnt feel excited by yelps from the rich and powerful right now the only message i was really glad to get was one from lotty asking if i was all right and to please call as soon as the messenger service took my packet for cheviot labs i got ten dollars in quarters from the cashier and found a pay phone in a laundromat up the street i didnt think benjamin sadawi merited massive surveillance i didnt think i did but we were living in paranoid times everyone in law enforcement was on edge not just the hormonecrazed youngsters whod fired at catherine bayard last night but everyone my first call was to my lawyer just in case worst came to worst i wanted freeman carter to know what was going on with me to my amazement i actually found him at home freeman im glad youre ini thought youd be in paris or cancun or whatever your usual weekend spot is these days believe me vic when i heard your name on the news followed by the magic phrase arab terrorist i tried to book a seat on the first flight out why cant you get into trouble during normal business hours and without pulling homeland securitys chains like a real criminal you mean im at a pay phone but even so i think i should keep this simple ive been out of circulation all day catching up on my sleep so i dont know what dupage or thefederales will have in store for me when i go home under this patriot act if they think i have something they wantwhether its a runaway kid or a library bookdo i have a right to phone counsel before they hustle me away im not sure freeman said after a pause ill have to research that but just in case leave word with lotty or your tiresome neighbor to call me if you dont show up when youre expected and for once in your own tiresome ornery life victoria check in with someone once a day until this blows over otherwise contreras will be on the phone with me and ill be billing new hours to your outstanding balance which is not small as it is agreed copy that houston nothing would bring mr contreras more pleasure than to babysit me few things would bring me less but freeman was right there are days when its better to be pliant i tried amy blount next when i got her voice mail i phoned the client at the drake harriet whitby was in her room when i saw the report on tv this morning i wondered well were you out at larchmont because of marc or because of the terrorist she asked every time someone referred to benjamin sadawi as a terrorist he changed from a scared kid hiding in an attic to a bearded monster in a yasser arafat scarf but if i started saying no hes not a terrorist hes just terrified then id have to explain that id seen him and i couldnt do that your brothers affairs took me out to larchmont i was looking in the pond where he drowned to see if he might have dropped something he did in fact his pocket organizer ive sent it to a lab to dry it out and extract any documents a woman was waiting to use the phone looking ostentiously at the clock above the dryers i held up my thumb and forefinger to say only a little longer while i was out at larchmont i found the kitchen door open i went in to see whether anyone was inside and the sheriffs excitement kept me out there longer than i hoped i think i know who your brother was visiting in new solway but it doesnt bring me any closer to how he ended in that pond dr vishnikov called this morning harriet said your funeral director delivered marcs body to hishis place but he wanted to warn me before he started what it would cost and that i might find out i dont know things i wouldnt want to know he terrified me but then what could be more terrible than marcs death her voice was raggedy the voice of someone whod had to talk to too many people about too many difficult things lately dr vishnikov is just being cautious ill call him tell him if he feels like being responsible to the client do it through me not you and to get startedweve already lost a week on this i can think of a lot of things one wouldnt want to know about a beloved family member but frankly i cant picture your brother doing any of themyou know running a prostitution ring or dealing drugs that kind of activity doesnt fit with the man whose house i saw yesterday morning harriet gave a shaky laugh thank you i needed to hear someone say that all day ive been thinking my god am i going to find out marc was a drug addict the woman waiting for the phone made a loud remark about how inconsiderate some people are i smiled and nodded can you call amy for me i said to harriet i want to compare notes with her and ive got to surrender this phone see if she can come to my office tomorrow morning shes meeting me at the hotel tonight harriet said why dont you join us if the police arent holding me i gave her mr contrerass number in case she couldnt reach me on my cell phone and just in case the law thinks im such a scintillating conversationalist that they want to listen in keep your phone comments on the short and simple side the waiting woman grabbed the phone from me when id hung up she snapped short and simple thats what you think is short and simple the woman dragged out her conversation as long as she could but i waited since i still needed to talk to vishnikov and to my neighbor and i didnt want to scour the streets for another pay ph when she finished the woman gave a triumphant nod with the comment that now i knew what it felt like i blew her a kiss and dialed vishnikovs home number jeesh bryant good thing you only deal with the dead your bedside manner gets the living totally weirded out you really think whitby looks like a user i just dont want the family refusing to pay the bill if i find out what they dont want to know well talk to me about it next time i will guarantee the bill i said grandly in that case well use the new spectrometer warshawski time on its five hundred bucks an hour but youll be happy with the results he hung up pleased with himself i hoped he was joking or that the whitbys could pay his bill i phoned lotty next but only got her answering machine where was everyone on saturday afternoon i needed a human voice right now i left a message saying i was fine just bruised a bit in body and mind and id try her again over the weekend finally i put two more quarters into the phone and called my neighbor mr contreras was predictably upset and voluble he too had heard the news and not only had my name been on it as someone sheriff rick salvi was eager to talk tobut deputies had come around the apartment twice already today and where was i and what was i doing i fed quarters into the phone until my supply dried up giving hire the details of last nights excursionexcept of course my escape with benjamin mr contreras vigorously approved of my jumping out the bathroom window to get away from the sheriff but wanted to know why i hadnt come home then i was beat i checked into a motel out there i said i only woke up a little bit ago so you didnt actually see the arab huh doll what was that girl that catherine bayard doing out there in the middle of the night she mixed up with that terrorist do you think hard to picture i said lightly probably has some boyfriend in the area she doesnt want her folks to know about i just put in my last quarter can you meet me at your back door in ten minutes my clothes are a wreck and i want to change before i do anything else just in case dupage has the place staked out and just in case they havent posted anyone in back the warning beeps sounded we were disconnected before mr contreras could finish his response waving a cheery farewell to the woman whod wrestled me for the phone i headed into the dank afternoon i switched on my cell phoneearth to vi once moreand climbed back into the jaguar when the engine turned over i found myself thinking that luke could file off the serial number and repaint the car blue instead of red i knew i had to return it but driving the coolest car on the road brought me more cheer than father lous horse liniment i drove up western past a new megamall that had driven away two little grocers a small appliance rental and repair shop and zoes homemade pies and cakes ah progress i crossed racine the street where i live and parked a block to the east i walked in a square south and west away from the car so i could saunter up racine looking for any unusual vehicles or loiterers the overcast afternoon was bleeding into a gray dusk cloaking my face from any watchers if i were a clancy or ludlum superhero id have memorized all the license plates on the twoblock stretch and been able to tell you which ones hadnt been here when i left early yesterday morning since its all i can do to remember my own plate number i concentrated instead on vans that could hold listening devices and cars where people were sitting with the motors running one of these was a chicago squad car across the street from my own building not too subtle after walking another block north i turned east again and cut down through the alley behind my building no squad cars were warming the night air behind my building a woman i recognized was emptying her garbage but no one else was in the alley mr contreras was waiting for me inside the back gate along with the dogs the three greeted me with a heartwarming ecstasy while we were still outside i explained the possibility that the building might be under electronic surveillance i dont think that it isi dont think my being in the house an arab speaker fled from warrants huge attentionbut i cant be sure sodont say anything to me you wouldnt want clara to hear in the dark i could sense rather than see the old mans embarrassment clara was his beloved wife dead now for many years i hastily changed the subject explaining that i had borrowed a car and needed to drop it some place close to its owner im going upstairs to change then i want to drive out to new solway and collect the mustang want to come along he was delighted to take even a small part in my adventure i left him in his own kitchen and went up to my apartment my living room overlooks racine so i moved through it in darkness trying to remember where id left things like the piano bench i only banged my shin once since no one seemed to be watching the back i did turn on lights in my bedroom and kitchen first making sure the blinds were pulled and the door leading from the back to the front of the hall was shut after my night in larchmont hall the apartment seemed tiny but i was glad of my small space it was like a cloak protecting me i was ravenous and badly wanted real food in the last twentyfour hours id had a smoothie a plate of eggs and some toast and tea in the rectory kitchen i put water on for pasta in the freezer i actually found part of a roast chicken i stuck it in the microwave while i changed my shoulder muscles did not like it when i tried to fasten my bra but i gritted my teeth and did up the hooks it felt important not to be exposed even beneath a sweater when i finally got around to the law i put some of father lous embrocation on a bath brush so i could reach behind my head to rub it into my sore zone it had an odd smell not unpleasant but conjuring up stables or locker rooms remembering father lous advice to tape the area i dug an ace bandage out of the medicine chest i managed to wrap it tightly enough to hold the sore muscle in place with clean jeans and walking shoes i felt strong enough to get by for a while my running shoes were badly nicked from scaling larchmont id have to stretch the budget to cover a new pair i still had some decentlooking lettuce a bag of carrots and fresh green beans in my refrigerator i put these together into a salad which i ate with the chicken and pasta sitting down at the kitchen table too often i eat either in the car or walking around the apartment while i get ready to run out the door i wanted to keep things slow right now not rush at whatever lay ahead when i finished eating i washed the dishes including the ones id let build up in the sink while i was under the weather bringing a container of household cleaner and a sponge with me i walked slowly down the stairs to collect mr contreras and the dogs we went out the back way down the alley to the jaguar chapter golf cart hearse the roads west were clear we made the fortymile trip in fortyfive minutes to my relief as well as my amazement the mustang still stood behind the shrubbery where id left it maybe schorrs deputies hadnt spotted it maybe theyd posted the squad car to intercept benji rather than to stake out my car we drove on past the mustang and parked the jaguar in the larchmont carriageway while the dogs tore through the underbrush mr contreras and i cleaned out the jaguar i was concerned about obliterating any trace of benji but he was happy to think he was getting dog hair and my fingerprints out of the car we left it on the carriageway keys in the ignition for some new solway cop to find we walked back along the ditch toward the mustang the route that had been so slow and fearladen in the dark middle of night was an easy stroll now that i had mr contreras and the dogs with me im looking for the culvert where i got under the road i told my neighbor its got a muddy bottom id like mitch and peppy to churn it up and hide my tracks the gray air had thickened into blueblack evening mr contreras used my flashlight while i turned on the headlamp id used yesterday it was mitch who found the entrance i stooped to look at the culvert floor benjis and my footprints were clearly visible they overlay the wheel marks id noticed at the other end on thursday evening looks like some kind of little utility truck forklift or something come along mr contreras said someone chasing after you i stared from him to the wheel marks suddenly making sense of what i was seeing the golf cart that had been chasing me through my dreams that was how marc whitby had been brought to the larchmont pond someone had driven him there it was so easy you could get a cart from the anodyne golf course drive it into anodyne park along the path put up for members and then if you knew about this culvert get to larchmont hall in disjoint phrases i explained what i thought had happened my neighbor nodded intently if youre right doll you better try to find that golf cart or you think your killer already disposed of it i dont know i said unhappily whoever it isits not theyre so smart but the law doesnt care enough to go after them so it could still be lying around i looked at my watch sixthirty the longer i put off confronting the law the harder they would make it for me when i finally surfaced still since we were out here id take the extra time to talk to someone at the golf course i bumped the mustang back onto the road and whipped down dirksen to the golf course naturally there was a gate an ornate affair with a picture or maybe a logo welded into the bars a spotlight on the design highlighted a pond with cats tails sprouting around it anodyne park golf course was emblazoned in gold and green across the top i told the guard in the gatehouse that i was working for geraldine graham and had some questions about a missing golf cart he accepted this claim unblinkingly but wouldnt let the car inside the course with dogs in it you never know people say theyll keep their animals in the car but then they let them out on the course i didnt waste time on argument just got permission to leave the car at the entrance while we went in i pulled my briefcase from the trunk since it still had marc whitbys picture in it and hurried up the drive to the clubhouse with my neighbor saturday is such a busy golfing day that the head of the club was on duty in the clubhouse a doorman pointed him out a dapper fiftyish man laughing with a redfaced group of drinkers in front of the fireplace when i said i was a detective a hush fell over the group the manager whisked us into his office just in case i was going to breathe something ghastly over his members but when he heard my storyi worked for ms graham her son had had a near miss with a golf cart on the road several days ago she was concerned and wanted to know if one had been stolenhe quickly off loaded me onto the equipment supervisor when eli janicek the supervisor trotted in the club manager told him to get mr contreras and me over to the equipment shed we clearly lowered the tone of the place we followed janicek out the service entrance while the manager rejoined the drinkers at the fireplace although janiceks attention was divided between me and his crew who were calling in with reports on abandoned carts and clubs on the fairways he answered my questions pretty directly none of his carts was missing yes some had been picked up from anodyne park last monday morning but there was nothing strange in thatmembers were always driving them over to the anodyne estate and leaving them for the equipment crew to retrieve i was turning away disappointed when janicek added now i think of it one was caked with mud and when we come to clean it up we found the front pretty well dented in that didnt sit with me right we clean up after the members thats our job but then they abuse equipment and dont even leave a note saying who was it that did it thats not right people need to act responsible the cart had been parked outside the bar if he remembered right when i asked if he could be sure of the date he pulled out his log yes this was the one the cart had been caked in mud up over the wheels when they hosed it down they found dents in the sides deep scratches in the paint and the front axle bent some kid treating a golf cart like a dune buggy and even if they found out who the parents more than likely would chew out the clubhouse manager not the kid on wednesday when janicek had cleaned up the cart hed sent it on to the repair shop but he didnt think the mechanics had gotten to it yet too big a backlog when mr contreras started to chime in on modernday manners i cut both of them off can you hold off on the repairs the graham family may want to press charges or at least get their insurance company to look at it nothing to do with the club i promise you but theyre concerned about reckless endangerment and want to talk to sheriff salvi about the cart janicek didnt like it didnt like the thought of the club being involved in a serious legal problem but he reluctantly agreed to talk to his mechanics in the morning and ask them to wait on the cart before we left i showed janicek marc whitbys photograph he called a couple of the valets over but no one remembered seeing him and they would have the clubs only black member was august llewellyn and he hadnt been out for months black guests were rare had edwards bayard been in the club last week no neither he his mother nor anyone else from the bayard household mr contreras and i walked back to the mustang while i thought this over anyone who knew about the culvert could have used it to get into anodyne park and from there used the parks private path to the golf course to borrow a cart they might even have parked it next to the culvert on the coverdale lane side whitby was in the pond dead by the time i got there if id only gone to larchmont an hour or two earlier last sunday night it was frustrating to come on one piece of the solution and yet not be able to follow it on the drive home i mulled over the story of the cart with mr contreras without coming to any satisfactory answer when we got back to lakeview i dropped my neighbor in the alley with the dogs i need to face the lawive been putting it off for five hours its eight oclock now if im not home by eleven call freeman okay and also until this business is cleared up well talk every day between fivethirty and sixthirty if you dont hear from mecall freeman under this patriot act if the law gets pissed off enough they may be able to take me away without letting me talk to my lawyer i squared my shoulders and drove around to the front of our building chapter patriot acts i feigned surprise when the chicago cops followed me into my building but i didnt have to pretend anything when two other men jumped out of adjacent cars and hurried in after them one was a federal agent who flashed a quick badge the way theyre taught in gman movies the other a dupage sheriffs deputy i clearly was no superhero since i hadnt noticed them earlier the four men werent palsthere was a lot of pushing and shoving in the entryway as they all tried to speak to me the dupage deputy said he had orders to deliver me to wheaton and since i had fled the jurisdiction where a crime was committed he had first dibs the chicago cops said they had told him already his orders had been superseded that i was to go to thirtyfifth and michigan with them as soon as the federal agent had finished with me i am operating under orders to search your place of residence the federal agent announced that got my attention at once i demanded to see his warrant maam under the patriot act if we believe there is an emergency situation affecting national security we are permitted to bypass the warrant process he had a flat nasal twang that made him sound like the quintessential bureaucrat im not involved in any emergency situations and nothing i do affects national security i put my house keys into my back jeans pocket and leaned against the inner door maam the united states attorney for the northern district of illinois is the judge of that and he deems that the events of yesterday evening are sufficiently alarming to require us to examine your premises the events of yesterday evening could you stop talking like a damned manual and tell me why youre here the chicago cops exchanged grins at that but the agent continued in his flat way maam you vacated a house where a known terrorist was in hiding we need to make sure you are not involved in shielding him in some way was there a known terrorist there i asked with polite interest i only knew that a dupage county lieutenant thought he could lock me in an abandoned mansion all night irregardless i have orders to search your place of residence if you do not cooperate the chicago police are ordered to break down your door he didnt speak with the aggressive glee that some law officers show when they can overwhelm you with forcehe had a job to do he was going to do it what happened to the right of the people to be secure in their persons houses papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures my voice was husky with fury maam if you want to challenge my orders in federal court you will be able to do so at some later point in time but these officersindicating the chicago cops who stood stolidly behind him dissociating themselves from the proceedingsare here to ensure that i examine your place of residence before i could escalate the confrontation to a level where id spend the night as the taxpayers guest mr contreras erupted from his apartment with the dogs mitch took exception to seeing men in uniform in the entryway and hurled himself at the hall door peppy barked in support i opened the hall door wide enough to slip through and grabbed the dogs by their collars panting at mr contreras to get their leashes when i had the dogs under control i wanted to stay on the far side of the entryway hurling abuse at the law with the dogs but i knew that would not just postpone the inevitable it would make the inevitable more intolerable i told my neighbor to let the men in what in heck do they want he asked to search my home according to that walking manual in the tan overcoat they can go to any home in america claim the owner is concealing osama bin laden and enter without a warrant and if you object they bust down the door we were collecting an audience the medical resident who lives on the first floor across from mr contreras stormed out saying that if i didnt stop making all that racket she was calling the cops when she saw the uniformed men she blinked a few times then demanded that they write me a ticket or impound the dogs the four lawmen were knocked off balance but the federal agent recovered first and began intoning the fact that he was not here as part of a canine complaint unit before he could finish his first paragraph a pair of guys from the second floor leaned over the stairwell and hollered down at the resident to shut up and get a lifethey had an ongoing feud with her because shed sicced the law on their latenight parties several times those dogs are well trained they never bother anyone they yelled the chicago cops were now uncomfortable when neighbors start to gather simple situations turn complex in a hurry the cops shushed the fed and hustled our party up the stairs sped along by the pair on the second floor who were singing god bless america loudly enough to bring out the young korean family from the facing apartment as i undid the dead bolts on my door i could hear their fouryearold ask is it a parade it didnt take the law long to hunt through my apartment for the obvious you cant hide a body in four rooms without it coming to light pretty fast mitch and peppy helped every time someone opened a cupboard or looked under something they were on his heels i kept the dogs on short leashes made sure they never actually touched one of the men but a hundredtwentypound half lab can make even a federal agent turn a few hairs mitch was also pulling on my sore shoulder hard enough to make me wince but i pretended not to feel it during the search mr contreras kept up a running commentary on men who hid behind badges as an excuse for doing work no decent person would undertake let me tell you i saw plenty of that in europe in fortyfour never thought id watch it in my own country i risked my life on the beaches at anzio i know what real fire feels like coming at you out of real artillery i saw my buddies cut up in pieces around me if id known i was doing that so you could break into any house in america because you felt like it they couldnt a got me on that landing boat that did sting the fed no manly man likes to be reminded that searching a womans apartment for a runaway youth isnt as dangerous as facing real fire he kept breaking off his search to try to rebut mr contreras but the beat cops told the fed they were under orders to get me to thirtyfifth and michigan pronto and to finish up thirtyfifth and michigan is the new chicago police headquarters i couldnt begin to guess what they wanted with me there whoever had set up the meeting was getting impatient heor shekept calling the chicago cops to move them along and they kept complaining that the federal agent was taking his sweet time when the fed said he wanted to go through my papers the chicago cops dug in all four feet they had orders to bring me in within the half hour i dont require her or your presence to examine the documents the fed said in his flat voice im not leaving you alone in my apartment i said firmly you could plant evidence you could steal something when he started to proclaim his essential honesty i said brightly i know mr contreras and the dogs can stay with you make sure you get a detailed description of any document j edgar takes mr contreras and for heavens sake dont let him walk off with the utility bills unless he promises to pay them cant afford to have my electricity turned off the thought of an evening alone with the dogs and my neighbor made the fed decide my papers probably werent worth going through perhaps the array of mail and books in the living and dining rooms also daunted him at any event he left my place of residence with the other lawmen i locked up and followed them downstairs with the dogs at the front door mr contreras told me gruffly to keep my chin up if i wasnt home by midnight hed get freeman to find me i went out with the four lawmen including the deputy from dupage who hadnt spoken since wed gone inside he went off to his own car without so much as a goodbye to his partners in crime prevention at least the us agent thanked the city cops for their intergovernmental cooperation as i learned in the squad car the dupage deputy was sulking because the chicago cops had overridden his orders the two men thought this was such a good joke they shared it through the grill with me but they wouldntor couldnttell me why we were going to chicago police headquarters youll find out soon enough when you get there maam the driver said at least they were calling me maam instead of girlie and i wasnt in handcuffs the driver covered the ten miles south in twelve minutes blue lights flashing occasionally hooting the siren to move cars out of the way if id been president id have felt important but when we reached the underground garage behind the slick concrete building i only felt motion sick police headquarters had been at eleventh and state for my whole life i used to go there with my dad when he had a meeting or needed to turn in special forms of some kind the chief of the patrol division would ruffle my curls and give me a dime for the vending machine while he and my dad caught up on departmental gossip i had a kind of nostalgia for the old headquarters beatup linoleum and its rabbit warren of offices the new building felt cold and unfriendlytoo big too clean too shiny my escort handed me over to a desk sergeant who busied herself with the phone i studied the wall notices these at least hadnt changed in thirty years armed and dangerous last seen driving workers compensation missing since january the desk sergeant summoned a uniformed officer a heavyset woman whose equipment belt created a giant m between her breasts and hips you got to cross that lonesome valley i sang under my breath following her down the hall to an elevator you got to cross it by yourself is it that bad she asked as we rode up one floor whatd you do to get so many big men in a room together i made a face ran away from an ugly county lieutenant last night but why that should get a lot of big men into a room i dont know in fact i dont even know what big men have gathered on my account she held the elevator door open until i was in the hall in front of her never leave a suspect alone in an elevator well honey weve arrived so i guess youll know soon enough she opened a door saluted said here she is captain and left i couldnt sort out how many people were in the room or which ones i knew i was so astonished at seeing the man my guide had saluted bobby i exclaimed what are you doing here chapter what bill of rights bobby mallorycaptain mallory nowhad been my dads protege on the force my dad had been best man at his and eileens wedding if my mother had believed in godparents bobby would have been my godfather but that didnt bring a jolly twinkle to his pale eyes when he saw me nothing about my work makes him twinkle but tonight he looked as grim as if idwell helped a known terrorist escape i felt my knees weaken had he somehow learned that id taken benjamin sadawi to father lous i was smart enough at least to keep my mouth shut as i found an empty chair i had time now to take in the rest of the crowd at the table i knew some of the people at least by sight but four were complete strangers the lanky woman with bags under her eyes next to me was a cook county states attorney wed met in court several times of course i knew bobbys own longtime subordinate my sometime friend terry finchley lieutenant schorr had made the long trip in from wheaton he was glowering at me like a man who wished his deputies had shot me instead of catherine bayard stephanie protheroe sitting next to him didnt look at me i also had occasionally worked withor aroundthe fbis derek hatfield vicki bobby said weve been waiting for you to surface you have a lot of explaining to do my girl the superintendent asked me to head chicagos task force on terrorism and we seem to have a connection between a terrorist suspected terrorist whos been living in chicago and the man you flushed last night in dupage all these busy people have been waiting to ask you questions so lets get going lieutenant schorr and a man i didnt recognize both started talking at once just a minute i protested you busy people all know who i am v i warshawski vicki only and solely to captain mallory id like your names and affiliations a highly polished specimen next to derek hatfield was an assistant us attorney for the northern district along with deputy protheroe schorr had brought an assistant states attorney from dupage with hima man who looked like the us attorneys twin brother young white thick brown hair perfectly combed everyone in the room had a sidekick but me i wished id brought peppy mikes were set up on the table a young woman in a chicago pd uniform sat in a corner with sound equipment and earphones the room and the sound system were as modern as anything id seen in the sheriffs office last sunday night i hoped schorr was impressed after the pause for civilities schorr and the us attorney both jumped in again schorr wanting to know why i had fled before he questioned me the attorney angry because the feds had been hunting benjamin sadawi for four weeksid been within centimeters of him without telling them benjamin sadawi is that the boy whos been a dishwasher at that fancy gold coast school i paused briefly hoping they would stop picturing a big man in a head scarf and start seeing a skinny teenager i didnt know i was within centimeters of him larchmont hall was empty when i got there lieutenant schorrs men thought whoever was hiding in the attic jumped out a thirdfloor window when heor sheheard me come in it didnt make you suspicious when you found arablanguage books up in that attic derek asked the whole situation was so confusing that i didnt know how to make sense of it you went upstairs didnt you the us attorney asked he and the dupage attorney had been introduced as jack and orville but they looked so much alike that i couldnt remember which was which when i nodded he said what did you think when you saw that some of the books were in arabic i wrinkled up my face puzzled woman thinking there were a bunch of old kids books with calvin bayards name in the flyleaf the house had belonged to the drummond familygeraldine grahams fatherso i wondered why mr bayards books were there then i saw the arabenglish dictionary and thought maybe mr bayard was coming over in the middle of the night to study arabic i thought he might be translating his childhood books or something you couldnt possibly have thought that orville or jack slapped the tabletop no you couldnt have vicki bobby spoke quietly but sternly tonight isnt an occasion for joking since september every law enforcement officer in this country has been stretched past the point of endurance so give us straightforward answers to our questions terry finchley suggested i start by explaining what id been doing in larchmont in the first place for what seemed to be the thousandth time i went through my litany about marcus whitbys death and his sisters hiring me to investigate we paused while the woman in the corner changed disks in the machine and checked that it was recording when she nodded at terry he continued you didnt think that was police business dragging the pond i did completely just as i thought searching marcus whitbys house was police business but i couldnt persuade your buddies in dupage any more than i could persuade you since you all took a pass on the investigation i went out to new solway on behalf of the family and searched the pool the lanky woman from cook county said and searched the pool i agreed find anything relevant orville or jack asked i spread my hands hard to say a lot of old china nothing that said who put whitby into the pond what i did find though was the golf cart that the murderer used to drive mr whitby to the pond that got their attention in a hurry although jack or orville poohpoohed the idea we know he went there drunk to kill himself privately bobby spoke up asking lieutenant schorr how marc had gotten to the estate had they checked the trains the taxis and so on schorr and jack or orville blustered in a way that proved they hadnt done any digging into this problem bobby would have blasted a subordinate whod been so slack to schorr he only said quietly that he thought the question merited some research whats this about the golf cart vicki i told him about finding the culvert this evening and talking to the equipment supervisor the finch nodded and made a note i breathed a quiet sigh of relief the police machinery was going to take over the laborintensive part of the inquiry but this doesnt make you a heroine bobby warned me what did you do after you searched the pond yesterday break into the house bobbycaptain i protested wounded bobby glared at me and let schorr take over the questions we rehashed geraldine grahams interest in her old home we rehashed the fact that the kitchen door was open you say derek hatfield put in ive worked with warshawski before she skirts the law ive never proved it but shes not above breaking and entering this dupage gorilla hereexcuse me this lieutenantsearched me thoroughly enough for a sexual misconduct claim ask him if he found any tools on me you were there alone for god knows how long schorr shouted you had plenty of time to hide any picklocks i raised my brows in exaggerated disbelief you didnt search that mansion from top to bottom and all the time thinking you had a terrorist cell hanging out there on less evidence than an arabenglish dictionary the government just took apart my home without a warrant this isnt comedy central the us attorney said those of us at this table are trying to protect our country well ill sleep easier at night knowing youve inspected my bras i said bitterly what did renee bayard say about the books in the attic the bayards and the grahams are old friends ms bayard thinks her husband might have lent them to mr darraugh graham when mr graham was a boy the dupage attorney said of course with her granddaughter in the hospital she was too distracted to give the matter serious attention so the bill of rights still operates for wealthy voters i said thats reassuring you do know why her granddaughter is in the hospital right because of an unfortunate accident the dupage attorney clipped off the words why didnt you wait in the house to answer lieutenant schorrs questions last night jumping out the bathroom windowit makes us think you had some reason to run away to take such a risky exit i would have preferred a door myself but the lieutenant made the estates lawyer lock me in you could have waited until schorr talked to you jack or orville persisted i was tiredid been dragging the pondit was freezing in the house i wanted to get some sleep when schorrs deputies shot catherine bayard he was too busy to remember me so i left but you didnt go home the cook county attorney spoke up no i agreed i believe a safe driver is one who knows when shes too tired to control a vehicle i checked into a motel the lanky woman nodded theyd cared enough to find the place id stayed they clearly didnt know id left my mustang behind the shrubbery or someone would have been all over me for that the cook county attorney pressed the attack you werent in the motel when the maid went in to clean at noon what were you doing today between noon and eight oclock is there reason you need to know that i asked if there is ill be happy to tell you but i cant imagine why my movements are of interest to cook county or dupage or most especially the department of justice america is at war the us attorney reiterated if you aided a terrorist in escaping you can be charged with aiding our enemies i suddenly felt very tired i spread my hands on the table and studied my fingers while the silence grew well the us attorney prodded its not well i said none of it is well were not at war for one thing only congress can declare war which they havent doneunless it happened while weve been sitting here you know damn well what he means derek said do you think its a joke what happened in new york what our troops are doing in afghanistan or the persian gulf i looked up at him i think this is the most serious thing that has happened in my lifetime not just the trade center but the fear weve unleashed on ourselves since so we can say that the bill of rights doesnt matter any more my lover is in afghanistan i dont know if hes dead or alive i havent heard from him in almost a week if hes dead my heart will break but if the bill of rights is dead my life my faith in america will break if i had found a terrorist in the larchmont mansion i would have done my best to deliver him to you derekand hoped youd pay more attention to me than your colleagues in minnesota or arizona did to similar warnings but i didnt see any signs of a violent criminal did you were those arabic books manuals on bombs or did they contain diagrams of important us targets i assume youre finding that out i turned to the dupage attorney meanwhile the net gain for the night was that schorrs arabhunting tigers shot a local teenager i had nothing to do with that and i dont think my hanging around larchmont while schorr figured out what spin to put on that catastrophe would have been at all helpful no one said anything for a minute or two i shifted in my chair stretching my neck and shoulders we need to reopen the investigation into whitbys death i dont believe in coincidences a suspect hiding in a house a man dead outside the house those two have to be connected bobby spoke with the authority of his forty years on the force he looked at the dupage attorney orville can you get your pathologist to do a full autopsy including a tox screen on marcus whitby we released the body to the family yesterday orville said ill see if theyve taken it back to atlanta bobby rubbed his balding temples i hope to christ they havent i dont want to deal with an exhumation or with one more jurisdiction than the three already involved i didnt reveal that bryant vishnikov had already started a private autopsy i was hoping bryant could finish and give me the results before the law found out he had the body we can expedite that if necessary the us attorney said meanwhile what about warshawski here we never got an account of how she spent those missing hours is she capable of hiding a wanted man you searched my home i protested ill be glad to take you to my office if were done here you can look in the trunk of my car we had someone at your office this afternoon derek said and were checking with your friends i tried to control the rising tide of fury in me did you bastards help yourself to my rolodex did you take files where the hell do you get off harassing a citizen without probable cause we dont need probable cause the us attorney snapped we have you and a suspect both missing from the same house on the same night like the captain said no coincidences here you might have thought he was an innocent kid and given him a boost out the window with you but now that you know hes a wanted man we expect you to cooperate i am cooperating i shouted leaning across the table vicki watch yourself bobby warned me i shut my eyes and took a breath counting backward from ten in italian as i exhaled i am cooperating i said in a calmer voice now you guys give some back whats he done how do we know hes a terrorist tell me that and ill get more excited about your questions derek and the us attorney exchanged glances the attorney spoke he stayed on in this country without a visa and without a sponsor after his uncle died he goes to an uptown mosque where they preach some pretty radical rhetoric and he went underground when we tried to bring him in for questioning i asked him to expand on the radical rhetoric or what theyd found in the room benjamin had rented with a pakistani family after his uncle died but they refused to provide more detail they knew what they knew i see i said really though i didnt seeanything it didnt sound like a catalog of evil but i didnt know what radical rhetoric covered death to israel death to america death to abortion providers radical or patriotic depending on your viewpoint if benji advocated all three then id have to rethink covering up for him but id wait for father lou to finish interrogating him before i turned him over to these guys my own judgment might be at fault but i sure didnt trust any of the people at the table more bobby said if i would just explain how id spent the afternoon theyd wrap up the meeting i returned phone calls i ran errands i ran my dogs i ate dinner no one saw you run your dogs the cook county attorney said the fact that you staked out my building is sufficiently depressing without you boasting about it you have a record of my phone calls too the look that derek and the us attorney exchanged told me all i wanted to know about that i was at a techsurround outlet on fullerton you can probably get a record of my transactions by raiding their cash register or hacking into their computer or whatever you feel you can do in the name of protecting the country schorr wanted to bluster more about what id really done last night but everyone else seemed as worn out as i was or maybe id embarrassed them into silence just a little bobby broke the silence turning to look at the woman with the recording equipment sissy were done for the night you can collect your things and go sissy that didnt seem like a very imposing name for a police officer sissy said yessir switched off the system and labeled her disks the dupage attorney stood up saying he had a long drive but hed call bobby as soon as he knew the status of marcus whitbys body that effectively broke up the meeting derek and the us attorney left at once along with the two county attorneys schorr threatened me with grievous bodily harm or a month in prison or maybe both if i crossed him againi wasnt paying a lot of attention by that point can one of your team give me a ride home i said to bobby when the room had cleared as you know i didnt drive myself down bobby nodded finch go find someone to give princess grace here a lift that was what bobby called me when he thought i was being a nuisance it wasnt exactly a term of endearmentbut he would never have used it in front of the dupage and federal officials when terry had left to find me a driver bobby told me to join him at the head of the table so he wouldnt have to shout jack zeelander is a pain in the behind he commented all the feds these days are chasing shadows theyre so upset at missing the obvious last summer that they grab at every straw the wind blows by em hoping itll lead them someplace i can understand thatweve had murder investigations here where the heat was so high we burned ourselves and never caught the perp but zeelander wants to be in washington so bad you can smell the ambition on him and it doesnt make him a trustable colleague bobbys remarks took me by surprise hes never let his hair down in front of me before do you think this is a straw blowing past the missing kid i mean he grunted thats not my call thank god what is my call is you i didnt lean on you in front of all those people but dont lie to me now vicki do you know where that kid is the hairlettingdown that had been the tactic of a skilled interrogator i felt the twist of guilt i was supposed to tony and gabriellas good friend i couldnt lie to him i thought of catherine bayard crying out to her grandmother not to ask her anything else because she didnt want to lie to her i thought of the vast expanses of st remigios the gym the classrooms the chapel the kitchen and bedrooms i had no idea which room benjamin sadawi was in right now i slowly shook my head i dont know bobby he narrowed his small gray eyes you better not be lying to me vicki i looked at him solemnly i know gabriella would hate it yeah tony wouldnt be crazy about it either but the two of them would protect you me if i catch you in a whopper on this one ill hang you out to dry what were you doing since checking out of that motel after you went to that techwhatever place i drew a circle in the tabletop with my finger morrell has gone underground i went to see a friend who knows him for six hours dont try my patience if i tell you my private business youll use it against me what theoh unless youre about to reveal a criminal act ill keep it to myself i had played games with the truth about sadawi id level with him on this your guys staked out the front of my building but not the alley i thought the feds or that ape schorr might be tailing me so i went in through the back i needed a decent meal i wanted to run the dogs i wanted some time with my neighbor i did all those things then changed my clothes went out through the alley again and came up the street to the front door bobby stared at me then let out a hoarse sound somewhere between a laugh and a snarl no wonder we cant find a missing egyptian boy its a wonder we can find our feet to put our shoes on in the morning when we dont have the brains to cover both entrances to a building jesus mary and joseph chapter among friendsfor a change i slept in the squad car going home it was only ten but the two hours at thirtyfifth and michigan had worn me out almost more than last nights physical stresses when the driver shook me awake i blinked momentarily disoriented i had expected to see the little bungalow on houston street where i grew up i had expected or wanted to find my mother waiting for me instead mr contreras and the dogs came bustling down the walk to greet me the old man voluble in relief that i hadnt been locked up i lay on his living room floor with my arms around peppy running through the highlights or maybe lowlights of the evening when he learned the fbi had also searched my office and might well be tapping my phone mr contreras spoke his views on the law colorfully and at length he might think any and all measures the government had taken in the name of protecting america were justified no matter whose rights they violatedbut when it came down to me the feds had crossed an inviolable line id always miss my mother when times were hard but having my neighbor as a partisan was a pretty good second but going out the window of that mansion doll that musta shook you up bad i see how you been favoring your shoulder it wasnt the window it was diving into the pond and then climbing up that wretched wall i sawi stopped just before blurting out father lous namea sports trainer on my way home this afternoon he gave me some salve and told me to tape up the shoulder i just havent had time to stop at a drugstore for firm enough tapeive been using an ace bandage which doesnt hold the muscle quite in place go see the doc tomorrow dont rely on no sports trainers halfbaked notions that was a good idea lotty dispensed more than medical comforts from her storefront clinic i lay on the dogs shoulder thinking i should get up and go to bed before i fell asleep on the floor when my cell phone rang to peppys indignation i stopped petting her and got up to retrieve the phone from my handbag it was harriet whitby apologizing for calling so late but she and amy were at the hotel waiting for me did i still want to see them i was about to moan that i was too tired to move but then i remembered that the dupage states attorney was going to ask the whitbys to return marcuss body i needed to talk to harriet tonight so she didnt learn about it from some functionary in case the feds were really monitoring my calls i didnt want them to learn that i had already organized a full autopsy i told harriet id be at the hotel in half an hour when mr contreras realized i was going out again he tried to argue me out of it it was late i was beat i shouldnt be driving i agreed with all of those things but said i would take a cab its one of the few benefits of living in chicagos most congested neighborhood that taxis cruise the streets at all hours mr contreras and the dogs walked down to the corner with me and waited until a cab pulled up in front of a new hot spot at belmont and sheffield he ushered me in with the assurance that he would wait up for me the usual saturdaynight eaters and drinkers filled belmont cars honked crowds spilled across sidewalks into the streets as we crawled east i kept looking out the back wondering if the law was following me but the suv immediately behind us made it hard to see anything else i finally decided it didnt really matter if the fbi knew i was going downtown and dozed off again until we reached the hotel the drakes lobby is at the top of the kind of staircase audrey hepburn was always climbing in roman holiday or how to steal a million a princess could negotiate those stairs in high heels with ease but a tired detective had trouble lifting one leg after the other i could have slept all night i sang to myself and still have begged for more harriet and amy were on a couch in the small lobby at the top of the stairs when she spotted me harriet sprang up to greet me clasping both my hands in her own then exclaiming remorsefully when she saw the purple hollows under my eyes this is the second time ive called you late after youd been wearing yourself out on my familys account im so sorrythis could have waited until morning i smiled in reassurance something came up tonight that you should know about anyway where can we talk quietly your room mother keeps coming into my room if im there she and daddy are thinking of flying home monday regardless of what dr vishnikov discovers and shes fretting about the travel arrangements we found a corner table in the palm court which was kept dark in the tradition of the old bars of the fifties we sank into velvet plush and tried to see each other by the light of little tabletop fixtures when a waitress materialized out of the gloom and harriet ordered herbal tea i started to follow suit then realized i wanted whisky black label might put me to sleep before we finished talking but i wanted that glow of warmth to soften the knots between my shoulder blades we talked idly while we waited for our drinks amy had spent the afternoon hiking in the dunes southeast of the city harriet and her parents had met aretha cummings marcs research assistant aretha had brought them some of marcs private things from the office a nice young woman clearly griefstricken mother had wondered if marc and she had been dating and me i spent the day dodging shots from three law enforcement agencies the drinks arrived and i took a welcome swallow if you heard the news you may know an egyptian kid was hiding in the house on the estate where marcus died the police and the feds now are imagining that the kid his name is benjamin killed marcus and since thats the track their minds are running on they will be looking for a connection between the two theyll wonder if marcus was writing about wouldbe terrorists in chicago theyll wonder if marcus had a political involvement with a terrorist group harriet let out a muffled cry marc with terrorists no and no and no if you think that for even one minute i dont think that but you need to be prepared for that kind of question from the police tomorrow or whenever they try to talk to you and another thing now that the law has decided to take an interest in your brothers death they want to reopen the autopsy they agree they did a superficial job the first time round butyou know dr vishnikov is already doing that didnt you speak to him this afternoon harriet said oh yes and maybe hes already done what he needs to dobarring results from the tox screens but if he hasnt its up to you whether you want to give your brothers body back to the dupage county me if you dont keep them away until vishnikov is done hes such an eminent pathologist even the fbi will accept his findings also since youre paying vishnikov hell have to tell you what he discovers if you send your brother back to dupage theyll do the work for freefree for you i meanbut they may not share their results with you couched in those terms the decision to keep vishnikov on the job seemed the only sensible way to go of course i had an agenda too i wanted the autopsy results and no one in dupage was likely to tell me whether theyd drunk coffee for breakfast let alone what marcus whitby had inside him harriet didnt think she would be verytgood at holding off the dupage county sheriffs office i told her she could refer them to me as her legal representative im used to them being annoyed with me it wont bother me to have them add one more count to their list ill stay with you tomorrow harry amy promised unless theres something vic needs me to do i slumped back against the thick upholstery my eyes shut it was hard for me to imagine the next day but i guessed id be starting it at the hospital where catherine bayard was recovering from her surgery with an effort i remembered what amy had been working onwas it only yesterday and asked if shed found anything useful about the committee for social thought and justice she grinned i thought wed never get around to that that meeting in eagle river the one olin taverner was interrogating bayard about well kylie ballantine was there i sat up again what you found it in the congressional record she shook her head the university of chicago archives she leaned over to pull a sheaf of papers from her briefcase and laid them on the table harriet and i bent over them trying to read them by the flickering bar lights but couldnt make out them out i signaled to the waitress for the check but harriet took it from me youve run yourself ragged for me and my family the least i can do is buy you a glass of scotch she signed the bill to her room and the three of us went out to the lobby where we looked at the documents amy had photocopied one was a photograph blurry in reproduction that showed a group of african tribal dancers you couldnt tell sex let alone identity because of the masks everyone was wearing but stapled to the picture was a letter on olin taverners stationery dated may to the president of the university this photograph was taken on june it shows kylie ballantine and her ballet noir de chicago performing at a benefit for the legal defense fund of the committee for social thought and justice this committee is a major supporter of known communists in the arts and letters a number of university trustees are my clients they are deeply disturbed to find that ballantine is actually teaching at the university i dont know what students are learning in her classes but if parents saw this photograph and knew that their children were being taught by someone who not only supports communism but engages in sexually explicit dancing i doubt they would want them studying at the universityeven one with the university of chicagos leftist leanings handwritten at the bottom of the letter was the phrase get someone to deal with this so taverner got kylie fired amy said thats probably why marc went out to see him is there any evidence that marc saw this letter i asked she grinned again yes because you have to sign into the rare books and archives roomnot like the rest of the library where you go in and out on your id marc had been there about three days before he met olin taverner but this doesnt prove anything harriet objected you cant tell where this was taken or who was in it how could they fire her just because of that america in baby amy said communist black you only needed to whisper it once chapter bedside manner catherine youre lucky to be alive the sheriffs police may have been recklesswe agree they were way out of line and well take appropriate actionbut dont try to hide behind that with me i know youre in pain but i also know youre lying whoever was speaking had a penetrating baritone it carried easily through the hospital door which wasnt quite shut the volunteer looked dubiously from a vase of flowers in her hand to the door ill take those in for you i offered she smiled gratefully and handed off the flowers before the private guard stationed outside the door could object or ask me to identify myself i was in the room i had spent the night at the drake it wasnt just that i was too tired to take another step but the thought of going to bed at home under the watchful eyes of the law made my skin crawl the hotel had toiletries for forgetful travelers like me i took a toothbrush toothpaste and comb from the front desk i had just enough brain function left to call mr contreras so he wouldnt rouse freeman and fell deeply and totally asleep when i woke the next morning in the pleasant unfamiliar room i felt a familiar unpleasant stiffness i groaned my way out of bed to start stretching and then lay back down calling the concierge from bed to arrange for a massage id worry about the bill when my american express statement came next month breakfast in bed an hour in the hotel spa followed by a massage and a makeup treatment when i put my jeans and sweater back on i almost looked as though i belonged on the gold coast more to the point i could move my arms without feeling like someone was sticking a knife into my back before checking out i went into the hotel florist and charged an attractive little bouquet to my room i added a floppyeared dog adorable only another sixtyfive dollars on a bill long enough that i shoved it into my pocket witlvbut inspecting the total the drake is only a few blocks from northwestern hospital where catherine bayard had been sent i walked south to the hospital along the lakeshore the wind tearing at the paper around the flowers whitecaps danced up to the breakwater like daredevils advancing retreating fists of clouds tumbled across the horizon the air was sharp i was happy to be alive and walking at the hospital i found that the bayard family was guarding catherines privacy the clerk at the information desk wouldnt give out her room number i didnt argue just nodded and handed over the flowers the clerk put them on a shelf with a bunch of other offerings i retreated to a curtained alcove by the front entrance until a volunteer came by to load flowers onto a cart after that it was simply a matter of following the flopeared dog up elevators and down corridors as the volunteer made deliveries catherines room turned out to be the last one on the route at the end of a long hall of private rooms most of those we passed had their doors firmly closed but i could see into some where the chintz curtains and couches made the rooms look more like the highend hotel id just left not a hospital the room i entered was charming with armchairs upholstered in the same goldflowered brocade as the curtains visitors could eat or read at the polished side table the girl in the hospital bed her shoulder swathed in bandages her arm attached to an iv struck a discordant note so did the man shouting at her in this setting one expected visitors to behave with decorum that arab boy worked at your school dont expect me to believe its a coincidence that he was hiding out in he broke off midsentence as catherine who had looked dopily toward the opening door recognized me and gave an involuntary gasp the shouter also turned to look he was a lean tanned man about my age in a crewneck sweater and jeans with a shock of thick dark hair he ordered me to put the flowers down and leave but i stood rooted to the floor water slopping over the flopeared dog onto my hand just who are you i demanded who am if he yelled who the hell are you barging in here he strode over to me grabbing my arm in an effort to propel me out i leaned against him a dead weight that made him stagger we met in olin taverners apartment thursday night i said now tell me who you are and why youre in this hospital room he let go of me so fast that the rest of the water sloshed out of the vase i wasntwho are he stammered you may not have seen my face but i saw yours i said my voice a nasty whisper my next call is to the cops your prints must be all over that desk drawer you jimmied what was in it father catherine bayard said from the bed in the thread of a voice its my father we both turned toward her guilty that wed forgotten her lying there i should have realized he was catherines father from the snatch of diatribe id overheard but id been too amazed at seeing thursdays headbutter to think clearly i went over to her side how are you feeling shitty like i fell off my horse and he danced on me i smiled thats a rich girls imagewhen im injured i feel like ive been hit by a dump truck im sorry you got caught in the fire from those soupedup cowboys friday night i was in larchmont hall when they shot you behind the morphine her eyes flickered from me to her father i smiled reassuringly the deputies were pretty pumped i thought theyd been shooting at a raccoon or deer and when they went out to look i hightailed it back to chicago i hope you werent lying out in the grass too long before they got you to an ambulance her father burst out you were in larchmont with that arab terrorist are you responsible for no mr bayard im not responsible for your daughter being shot and i didnt see any terrorists friday night i was in new solway on friday for the same reason i was there on thursday and that was investigating a homicide i let the words die away homicide edwards bayard looked at me uncertainly are you with the police im a detective you may not have heard about the death of a journalist on the larchmont grounds last week oh that when i heard about it of course i was worried about whether it was safe for my daughter to be out in new solway but rick salvi says they think this arab kid did it the arab cant have gone far unless the gal who was in the house when they surrounded itthat was you wasnt it did you help him escape catherines eyes grew larger in her white face i took her uninjured hand in a light clasp the sheriff and the feds and even the chicago police figure they can wrap marcus whitbys death up in a nice tidy package with benjamin sadawis name on the gift card but theyre overlooking a lot of evidence in that convenient wrapup evidence that makes it clear that sadawi had nothing to do with whitbys death evidence what kind of evidence i let go of catherines hand to stand next to edwards bayard i spoke to him in my prison yard undervoice so catherine couldnt hear the law is starting to think taverner was killedinstead of the popular theory that he died in his sleep you showing up in his apartment like that breaking in through the patio skulking behind the curtains well it makes me wonder where you were last monday night and last sunday night when marcus whitby died for that matter why youhow dare you his eyes blazed with fury but he also kept his voice low glancing at his daughter to see how much of our talk she was following what do you mean how dare i you knocked me down in your haste to flee the dead mans home and your rightwing think tank is a major beneficiary of taverners estate give me one reason why i shouldnt hand younot to the old family friend rick salvibut to the chicago cops who arent going to be nearly so impressed with you get out of here right now bayard roared i will not have you slandering me in front of my daughter daddy please catherine cried from her bed dont shout i cant stand it and let me talk to her i want to talk to her not without me present you dont dont you understand trina you are in a lot of trouble right now trinas in a lot of pain and sheriff salvi is in a lot of trouble dont get hysterical eds renee bayard swept into the room she moved me away from catherine with an imperious glance and felt her granddaughters pulse although renee was dressed casually in corduroy trousers and a sweater she still wore her mahjongg tile bracelet which clacked as she felt catherines wrist i couldnt help wondering how long shed lingered outside the door waiting for the perfect line for a dramatic entrance its not hysterical to be concerned when your daughter lets herself be sucked into involvement with a runaway terroristespecially when youre twelve hundred miles away what the hell were you doing letting her roam about larchmont like that in the middle of the night i agreed to let her stay with you when i took the position in dc but if this is whats going to happen then as soon as shes fit to travel shes moving out there where she can be properly supervised wont go catherine tried to speak with her usual fire but her words came out slowly stay with grample and granny wont listen to rightwing bullshit night after you see edwards bayard said to his mother she lives with you and she loses all respect for my work eds shes terribly weak she cant think straight right now lets let her rest and sort this out when shes stronger and you she turned to me i dont know what youre doing here but its time you left want her to stay catherine whispered talk alone please granny tears trickled down the sides of catherines pale face renee gave me a look that seemed to question what her granddaughter saw in me but she moved with her usual decision you can have ten minutes eds you and i will get a cup of coffee and find out why the guard let this woman into the room when the two had left i made sure the door was shut all the way then pulled a chair up next to catherines head leaning close to her so i could speak softly and keep any eavesdroppers from making out my words ben jamin is safe but im not going to tell you where he is youve been gallant and heroic standing up for him but the police will be coming through here in waves youre calvin and renee bayards granddaughterthe cops wont abuse youbut they are going to question you a lot the less you know the better for both you and benjamin i rescued him i have a right this situation isnt about rights its about keeping benjamin safe until we find out whether he really does have any terrorist affiliations her mouth set in a mulish line benji is not a terrorist i know him hes scared hes lonely he needs me i shook my head you cant take him back to larchmont and even if you had some other place to hide him youre wounded you couldnt look after him besides which the fbi is looking for him because they may be tailing me im not trying to visit him and as soon as you get out of this bed theyre going to be questioning you hes safe where he is on your sayso i looked after him for three weeks and never breathed a word to anyone she sat up in bed her eyes fierce in her pale face you cant just barge in and take him away and not tell me where he is i shook my head tired of the orders of the rich even the young ardent rich but i said i will tell you if you promise not to try to see him until i let you know its safe and if you agree to answer my questions she thought it over for a minute not wanting to give me anything but finally agreed when i told her he was at st remigios she objected to my putting a muslim in a catholic rectory but after id described father lou she reluctantly agreed it might work mindful of renees timetable i cut short catherines further questions to ask my own how did you come to take charge of benji the ghost of a smile flitted across her face in the cafeteria one day id left my books room was empty cept for him saw him trying to read out of one of the thirdgrade books helped him after hed stop sometimes during lunch he bussed tables you know hed ask what a word meant never intruded i liked him didnt know his story uncle died here mom home in cairo three little sisters a brother sending them money learned that later she stopped panting i helped her drink some juice and looked at my watch yeah granny cant fight her day they came for him benji hid inside our sports equipment shed saw me when i was putting away field hockey sticks begged for help hid him in the shed took the padlock key home did like you guessed down the fire escape took grans car picked up benji at vina fields drove him out to new solway he couldnt stay in the sports shed i knew larchmont was empty only place i could think of we found all that old furniture in the attic turned off motion sensors for alarm brought food when i could get there but how did you get into larchmont trample did go once last year i saw him leave two in the morning theresa didnt wake up i followed him through the wood and saw him go into the house grample did have a key for the door the alarm that part was true i dont know how he got it got grample home he does come with me even when he wont go with granny daddy was at home so i didnt say anything but i kept the key i thought theresa had an alarm over her bed so shed wake up if your grandfather left his room in the night she does but sometimes she has seizures and stuff she sleeps through alarm granny mustnt know it doesnt happen often grample likes her shes good with him dont tell granny please she was growing paler and shorter of breath i assured her i wouldnt rat out theresa to her grandmother and told her to lie down and rest that wed talk more another time edwards and renee came in as catherine sank back against the mattress edwards looked at his daughter lying with her eyes half shut her face white and glared at me what have you been doing to her he bent over his daughter and added with surprising tenderness trina trina its okay baby daddys here a nurse had followed the bayards into the room she pushed past edwards and renee and put her fingers on catherines wrist shes all right just very fatigued im going to give her something to help her rest better and for now no more conversation with her edwards turned to me what did you do to her i talked to her mr bayard just as i plan to talk to you my glance swept from him to his mother we have a lot of catching up to do you and i renees attention was arrested you and my son know each other not well i smiled tightly but i hope to change that weve played soccer against each other or was it bullfighting i get the sports confused renee frowned she didnt like the tone i was using or she didnt like the secret relationship with her son i was implying its time for you to leave catherines room but you may wait outside i want to talk to you about fridays events more commands from the rich and powerful i didnt snarl at her because i wanted to find out some things myself like whether renee had been on the scene friday night and what kinds of questions the sheriff was asking above all i wanted time alone with edwards bayard out in the hall i leaned against the wall next to the door but the murmurs within didnt reach to me the guard stared at me i hoped he was memorizing my face as someone with unquestioned access to catherines room i strolled to the window at the end of the corridor as id expected the private wing commanded a view of the lake but directly below the window an apartment building was being deconstructed so the hospital could add yet another building to its gargantuan operation they were taking the building apart slowly instead of blowing it to bitsi suppose a blast would shock the cardiac pavilion where the outer wall had come down i could see dangling pipe and a bed that someone had left behind after ten minutes or so renee bayard came out of the room with her son with a pointed look at me she told the guard no one was to be allowed into the room except the private nurse the two doctors whose names the guard had and herself and edwards no volunteers carrying flowers no private investigators and absolutely no officers of the law if any o the above tried to force their way past the guard was to beep renee at once was that clear when he agreed that that was clear she beckoned to me to join them and sailed down the hall edwards and i were about the same height a good four inches taller than renee but we almost had to jog to keep up with her in the elevator going down renee kept the conversation casual the doctor felt strongly that they should discontinue the morphine pump by the end of the day today she hoped edwards agreed catherine would be in the hospital a few more days they should bring her laptop over so she could chat with her friends they needed to decide when they could let her friends visit at the bottom renee led us out the front into a waiting car she told the driver to take us home the banks street house yoshi miss catherine is very weak but she is conscious and alert were pleased with the progress shes making i felt a reluctant sympathy for edwards who hadnt been able to edge in anything since saying yes i didnt want her on the morphine a second day anyway it would have been hard to grow up with such a strong personality rolling over you perhaps thats why hed sought refuge in the rightwing causes anathema to his parents chapter a boys best friend at the banks street apartment renee stopped to tell elsbetta she wanted coffee in her study then swept down the hall without looking to see if her son and i were following edwards stalked after his mother not wanting to talk to mesulking because renee had reduced him to eightyearold status i stared curiously into the rooms we passed especially at a long sitting room with a baby grand and walls hung with paintings the hall was lined with curio cases edwards tapped his foot ostentatiously when i stopped to inspect a greeklooking pot i asked how old it was but he only told me to come along and took me into a room overlooking the back garden this seemed to be renees private space in the apartment where she had both office equipment and home comfortsbooks family photos worn rugs and chairs suitable for lounging there was also an alcove with chairs less suitable for lounging and it was there that she directed her son and me to sit edwards and i want to know how you came to be involved with catherine no more stories please about an interview with the school paper renee bayard had the impersonal force of a hurricaneyou couldnt take offenseyou either held your ground or got flattened i smiled that was catherines story although i was feeling pretty frustrated with her at the time i admired her resourcefulness in thinking it up on the spot that doesnt answer the questionwhat is your name it didnt seem important to remember it before v warshawski i handed her one of my cards yes i see now why were you here onwednesday afternoon wasnt it how did you come to follow catherine home and why did you then go to new solway on thursday to bother my staff maam i have a great deal of respect for your husband and am acquiring a fair amount for you as i watch you in actionbut you mustnt jump over facts to get to the conclusion you want edwardss eyebrows shot up he apparently wasnt used to seeing people stand up to his mother renee studied me and what fact do you think im jumping over you assume or want to believe that i followed catherine home last week elsbetta entered with a trolley holding another ornate china service when shed served us and left renee continued as if there had been no interruption i know catherine didnt get your name from darraugh graham how did you meet her i told her about finding marcus whitby about my investigation into his death and why i wanted to talk to catherine in the first placeit seemed pointless to cover up catherines presence at larchmont on sunday night i even told renee about being in the pond on friday but not that id heard her and catherine talking and i stuck to my story about finding the kitchen door open at larchmont hall i didnt want competing versions of my activities floating around i was startled when the sheriffs police suddenly arrived i said and i did wonder if it was you whod alerted them to the notion that there really was someone in the house renees hand didnt pause as she lifted her eggshell cup to her lips she drank and set it down and what made you wonder that you knew catherine was wandering around larchmont in the dark she wouldnt tell you why shes an ardent spirit but shes very youngperhaps you thought she might not recognize as dangerous someone shed agreed to help perhaps you thought she had some outlaw holed up someone shed romanticized into a robin hood i dont know how you would have imagined this person but you knew she valued her oath to protect him more even than the very strong bond between you and her you wanted him found and moved off the larchmont property so you did know she was wandering around there edwards said to his mother and you did nothing to stop her i only learned on friday for once renee was on the defensive i called rick salvi to tell him someone was hiding in the house o course i didnt tell him it was someone catherine was meeting even so edwards burst out you should have i thought i had catherine well under my eye renee said i looked in on her at midnight right before i phoned rick and she wasshe seemed to be sleeping i thought id have the problem solved before she woke up in the morning instead she apparently waited for me to check on her then went out her window onto the veranda roof and slid down a column to the ground when i heard shots coming from the woods i went back to her roomand found her gone i dont think anyone ever covered that ground to larchmont faster than i did that night which was fortunate since when i got there they were staring down at catherine as if she were a movie they were watching they hadnt even sent for an ambulance edwardss eyes flashed im sure your organizational skills saved her life its a pity you didnt apply them to keeping her from risking it shes your daughter eds shell do what she wants to do no matter how much i try to engineer a different outcome renee spoke with the kind of saintly resignation that makes the hearer long to belt the speaker edwards took a breath and turned to me how deep is her involvement with the kid with sadawi ive only met your daughter a few times but i think she was in love with the romance of the situation not with the young man himself what did your buddies in washington learn about him is he a serious security threat we dont know anything about him per se but hes connected to a suspect group the mosque that he frequents puts out some pretty fiery rhetoric and hes been renting a room from one of their members a guy whos sent money to the brothers in harmony foundation i take it these brothers arent in harmony with american interests i pursued oh theyre murky like all these groups we know theyve sent an xray machine to the chechen rebels theyve bought food for egyptian families but we believe other funds get funneled through honey sales into alqaeda hands the spadona foundation has a direct pipeline to the current administration as id hoped taking for granted that edwards had spoken to the attorney general got him to answer without realizing he was being pumped the fact that anger with his mother had knocked him off balance helped an xray machine hardly sounds very dangerous eds renee remarked youre surely not imagining it can be used to make nuclear weapons he shifted uncomfortably in his chair mother dont let your hostility to the attorney general and his methods blind you to the reality of how dangerous our enemies are youre right she said his methods make it hard to remember who is more dangerous the people who are attacking our liberties overseas or those who are suppressing them at home the most dangerous people at home are the ones refusing to cooperate with the governments efforts to root out terror either out of real loyalty to alqaeda or ignorance or through misguided ideas about the legal rights of americas sworn enemies edwards set his coffee cup down so hard that the delicate handle snapped off just because you express your anger more violently than i do doesnt mean youre rightit doesnt even mean youre angrier than i am his mother said dont you see that catherine was shot because people like rick salvi believe theyve been given a green light to use any means at their disposal if they think they have a terrorist in view it was your daughter they had in view and they acted literally on the old saw shoot first ask questions later edwardss eyes were angry slits in his face they knew they had a terrorist whod fled the house they didnt know my daughter was there it was a shocking mistake but if youd been looking after her properly it wouldnt have happened he turned to me as for you if you were in larchmont hall friday night you fled the scene you could have had sadawi with you tucked under my arm like anne boleyns head i agreed when he exclaimed what the i said you know that old bert lee songthe sentries shout is army going to winthey think that its red grange instead of poor old anne boleyn what did you tell the police when they asked about mr bayards books mr bayards books edwards repeated uncertainly looking from me to his mother your fathers childhood books maybe the police dont ask people like you the same questions they ask people like me they wanted to know why his book about the boy attacked by the giant clam was in the attic next to an arabenglish dictionary i told them i thought mr calvin bayard was coming over in the middle of the night to translate the story into arabic at the time i didnt know there was an arabspeaking kid in the house as soon as the words were out of my mouth i regretted them it was a ghastly mockery of a man with alzheimers to joke that he was studying a foreign language renee frowned at me her heavy brows almost meeting across her nose i think we all know why the books were there and i can see that you are agile at dancing away from questions you dont want to answer did you see benjamin sadawi or talk to him or help him escape no maam the lie got easier every time i told it and i am most eager to talk to him why is that she asked because he had a chair set up in the attic where he stood looking out into the back garden he was lonely he probably stood up there watching hoping catherine would appear so i think he saw what happened the night that marcus whitby died in that pond edwards smacked his chair arm impatiently the fbi are confident that sadawi killed whitby i told you in the hospital that their theory overlooks a number of important facts some of which you know better than l edwards fell silent at that nasty reminder of his housebreaking if you dont believe in the police version of this journalists death do you have any information yourself about why he went to larchmont hall renee asked me i know he visited olin taverner i guess ten days ago i know taverner showed him some secret papers which he claimed would make the hollywood ten look like goldilocks and the three bears but i dont know what was in the papers and now that mr taverner is dead we may never knowsince someone broke in and stole them and neither the magazine nor his family had any inkling of what took whitney to new solway renee persisted whitby i corrected her im assuming it had to do with the dancer kylie ballantinewhitby was interested in her oh yes the dancer edwards said a spiteful undertone to his voice one of fathers special projects wasnt she mother as you say eds renee spoke quietly but her brows contracted again it was good that he was in a financial position to help her out ive always been happy we could support her his mother said with more energy like so many black artists of the thirties and forties she suffered terribly and she was a gifted researcher as well as an artist yes by the fifties the press was in good shape financially father could give her a legitimate advance on a book instead of a handout and now whitby wanted to write a book about her he did i said how did you know that he looked uncomfortable for a moment then said i thought that was what you said i must have jumped to a conclusion renee changed the subject you said you had dredged the pond where this unfortunate mr whitney died did you find anything that was helpful whitby i corrected again odds and ends a lot of broken chinai wondered if geraldine graham threw a piece in whenever she was upset with her mother and i found an old wooden mask the kind of piece kylie ballantine collected when she was in gabon oddly enough the mask had vanished when i went back to collect my findings renee looked absently at her empty cup perhaps the sheriffs men seized it as evidence or maybe it got kicked into the pond when they were racing around why didnt you take it with you to begin with i smiled i was freezing i caught cold sunday night getting mr whitbys body out of that wretched water and i didnt want to get sick all over again i went to a motel to change into something warm and dry and then got sidetracked with all the excitement over young benjamin sadawi when i finally remembered to return to the pond that mask was gone was that one of the ones dad bought from kylie ballantine edwards asked more than likely his mother said it was part of how he helped kylie he insisted that everyone in new solway have one it was the year we were married i remember the party where he brought the masks out of his study and persuaded even the fellittis and olin to buy one so was that when ms graham acquired hers i asked renee paused probably it was over forty years ago and i still couldnt tell most of those people apart i remember calvins glee at forcing olin to buy one of course i knew olin because i had done volunteer work for calvins defense in washingtonthat was how we met her mouth twisted in a sad smile eager young women like me coming down to washington on the train typing speeches and press releases for the people under investigation congress could draw on an openended budget but calvin only had his private fortune to pay his bills edwards interrupted or was it a fortune at that time or was it private perhaps he had qualms about that so he used his charm on eager college girls like you mother renee bayard gave her son a boneshattering look but didnt respond this was the second time edwards had implied that his fathers fortune was shaky perhaps illusory and the second time that his mother had cut his comments short but neither of them spoke i didnt know how to push the matter further so i returned to the mask in the pond even if ms graham only bought african art to please mr bayard i cant picture her throwing it into the pond to be rid of it would her mother have done that renee swallowed a smile laura drummond didnt like african art and she was never shy with her opinions she thought she spoke for jehovah on everything from marriage to well masks but i cant imagine her throwing anything even african art into her pond she valued decorum more than anything else perhaps geraldine did it to show calvin how much she disapproved of his bringing his child bride home to new solway i remembered geraldine grahams comment that she had felt sorry for renee bayard until she saw how well renee could take care of herself as if echoing that thought edwards pushed himself to his feet im sure whatever happened she was no match for you mother im going back to the hospital that guard doesnt seem reliable to me i dont know where you found him but im going to get spadona to set us up with a better service tomorrow i want to be in the room in case he lets in cops from some jurisdiction you and calvin may have persuaded trina to reject my values but shes still my daughter not yours and i still love her darling we disagree about far too many things but we agree about cherishing catherine ill come along later but you should have time alone with her and i want a last word with msim sorry im usually better with names i followed edwards out of the room when renee called out sharply that she had more to say to me i said in a minute over my shoulder you and i need to talk before the day is over edwards tried to brush me off me off but i forced him to face me he scowled started to protest then realized hed better make the best of the situation he agreed to meet me in my office at four chapter conversation between hardheads when i returned to her room renee had moved to the deep leather armchair behind her desk i helped myself to water from a pitcher on the trolley and looked at the prints on the wall most were cover art from notable books published by bayard publishing a tale of two countries held pride of place above renees desk with an inscription to the boy genius from the weary old man armand pelletier i guess it was supposed to be a jokepelletier was only a dozen years older than calvin bayard himself when calvin took on the presss first nonreligious novel id rather speak to your face than your back renee said i pulled up a chair to face her when we first met last wednesday i mentioned to you that i worked for the bayard foundation during law school because of my admiration for your husbands work when did your son start holding such very different views it was one of those things she said it started as an adolescent rebellion that hardened into adult intransigence i made a sour face you are at least as agile as i at dancing away from questions you dont want to answer im not subtleid quell you when you asked intrusive questions not dance around you if i didnt want your cooperation you wouldnt have betrayed a confidence with edwards in the room since its obvious that he supports the attorney generals efforts to round up every arab in the country for questioning but now that were alone you can tell me where this arab boy is i feel certain that you know i was startled youre wrong ms bayard i dont know where benjamin sadawi is if he is in league with a terrorist group i hope the law soon catches up with him but if hes just a scared runaway kidi hope he finds another friend as good as your granddaughter she looked at me through narrowed eyes i dont know how to persuade you to tell me because i dont believe you dont know why does it matter so much to you i should think youd be glad to have hm out of catherines life she stopped for a moment to choose her words i am and the surest way for her to continue to be infatuated with him or the romance of his situation as you put it is for her to think of him as being on the run if she could see him for what he isan immigrant dishwasher caught up in events out of his controlshed stop imagining herself as a romantic heroine in his novel shes impulsive and passionate i said but i think shes fundamentally levelheaded still as i told you im eager to question him myself so if i find him i will let you know you should realize by the way that my phones may be monitored by various law enforcement agencies she didnt want to be satisfied with my response but she couldnt think of a lever to pry the information out of me if all this had happened twenty years ago shed probably have made calvin hire me as a personal assistant just to get what she wanted but she couldnt come up with any good lever or bribe this afternoon she was a smart womanshe didnt keep pushing when she saw she had nothing to push with if darraugh graham hadnt hated larchmont so much it wouldnt be standing empty i said idly catherine might have brought young sadawi to you in that case i gather that darraugh hates larchmont because he was the person who found his fathers dead body did you ever know what drove mr graham to take his life renee looked at me steadily it happened around the time that i married calvin and i had a great deal else on my mind i do remember that mr grahams death was considered a scandal in the community although old mrs drummond made sure it didnt get into the papers it was that kind of event that made me determined not to live in new solway the women spent their lives in the most backbiting gossip while the men did deals with each other and had affairs with their neighbors the women married their sons to their neighbors daughters and so the backbiting continued between mothersand daughtersinlaw i insisted that we buy this apartment in town i involved myself in the press we spent weekends out on coverdale lane riding and doing country things but i didnt keep track of our neighbors personal lives it was my turn to look at her distrustfully i was sure she knew more about the grahams and the other coverdale lane residents than she pretended but like her i didnt have a crowbar for prying out more information i changed the subject again kylie ballantines papers are in the vivian harsh collection at the chicago public library i went down to read them and there were several references in them to an unnamed committeeand to the committees patron would that have been your husband she looked at me in hauteur calvins support of art and artists is legendary but i must say im surprised you have time to visit libraries are you planning to follow in this dead journalists steps in writing a book about ballantine no maam just trying to figure out why he went out to new solway yes well i cant see that that concerns me my only interest in your activities is how they affect my granddaughters wellbeing she got up to press a buzzer on her desk phone after a moment elsbetta appeared and was told to show me out when you decide to tell me about the sadawi boy call my office and set up an appointment ill make sure my secretary knows to fit you in immediately she was right she didnt dance she slamdunked i walked the four miles from banks street to my office id heard a great deal today and i was hoping i could remember enough of the nuances to let me sort lies from truth i wished i had someone to talk it all over with my old assistant mary louise with her astringent approach to the business side of detection would have given me good feedback or morrell whose thoughtful response to my own passionate ideasmorrelli was getting so i couldnt express his name without feeling something in my center disintegrate i had a moment of despair so overwhelming that i collapsed onto a bench head on my knees i flung out a hand as if i could touch him something cold landed in my outstretched fingers a passerby had given me a quarter i looked around but i was at a crowded intersection on north avenue any of the people leaving walgreens or heading into starbucks could have felt sorry for a woman so decrepit she couldnt hold up her head i sighed and stood up back to your loom penelope i continued west on north avenue doggedly thinking about the bayards neither renee nor edwards would have said as much to me on their own as they had together edwardss anger with his mother over catherine and his mothers anger about his rightwing views had let me learn that there was something fishy about bayard publishings financeseither today or sometime in the past edwards had also implied that his father had slept aroundhed called kylie ballantine one of his special projects and geraldine graham i had reached the bridge over the chicago river where i came to a halt staring at a crane moving scrap metal in a plant at the rivers edge had she also been one of calvin bayards special projects a lover supplanted by the new young wife from vassar if that was the case it was funny that mackenzie graham killed himself after calvin arrived back in new solway with renee instead of while geraldine and calvin were still lovers all those new solway lives they were like the twisted ribbons of steel dangling from the cranes magnet you could turn them and see them in different combinations i could see a version in which geraldine graham threw a mask into the pool so she wouldnt remember the lover who made her buy it or because she had found out that she shared the lover with the masks provider i could see less clearly her formidable mother throwing the mask away no primitive art allowed no primitive passions allowed or darraugh throwing it in because he resented anything to do with calvin bayardif calvin had been geraldines lover calvin had also forced olin taverner to buy a mask and edwards bayard had grown up to give olin any revenge against his neighbor and nemesis the old lawyer might crave but why should taverner want revengesurely it was calvin bayard who was the wronged party here and what did that have to do with marcus whitbyaside from his interest in kylie ballantine the crane dropped its load the sound didnt reach me over the traffic noise along the bridge but the end of the show galvanized me back into motion at the corner of damen a drunk was panhandling i gave him the quarter id gotten on wells street he wasnt gratefulthese days a quarter is a pathetic handout tessas truck was in the parking lot when i passed the door to her studio i stopped for a moment to watch she was working weekends to finish a commissioned piece for a cincinnati park highly polished chunks of chrome that made you want to touch and slide on them despite the cool day she had the heat turned off and was working in a tank top and shorts under her protective apron her beaded hair pulled back under a hard hat ive learned not to interrupt her when shes got her blowtorch going full blast but when she saw me in the doorway she turned off the flame and came over to me removing her hard hat and flipping her protective eye shield up over her head are you still full of germs how far away do i have to stand from you keep burning your blowtorch under your nose itll kill any viruses she laughed and came over to the door how many people have you given your office keys to lately warshawski just onea young economics phd whos doing a little work for me some men were here yesterday and again this morning who didnt seem to have any trouble with your front door whats going on so much for trying to operate without the fear that leads detectives to unacceptable levels of nerviness they think im hiding an arab terrorist if you are keep him buried until these guys lay off theyre a thoroughly meanspirited bunch if i didnt have to finish children at play this week id take a hike toothey make me nervous these are whatfederal agents you know my mothers family was from cameron mississippi my grandparents had to run away in the middle of the night when the local sheriff led a group in burning down their house because it was in a spot where some local white mucketymuck wanted to build i am not crazy about citizens having to stand helplessly by while the law takes over their homes me neither but i dont know what to do about it at this point they keep waving that damned patriot bill in my face bastards she took me to a glassedin cubicle at the back of her studio she sat at a drawing board and began sketching rapidly with charcoal in a minute she had drawn four faces two each on two separate sheets of newsprint they were the same two men dressed in service overalls in the first picture in suits in the second one of them was the man whod insisted on searching my apartment last night the one guy is a federal marshal so i suppose his sidekick is too i took the sketches from her try not to do anything to get these boys in blue so mad they burn down our space here ive got two hundred thousand dollars worth of equipment that i dont want to try to replace insurance company never paid my granddaddy one thin dime for his house you know she stomped back to her blowtorch i moved slowly across the hall and undid the locks to my office why did i bother when the fbi or whoever could come in with sophisticated lock busters and help themselves to my space at least they hadnt trashed my office not like the horrible time id had a year or so back when id gotten on the wrong side of a malevolent city cop i booted up and checked my messages i wrote morrell a long eletter telling him everything id been doing since friday morning even about getting a quarter when i was reaching out a hand for him i wanted to be able to discuss benjamin with someone or rehash how wed run away from larchmont leaving catherine bayard bleeding in the fields behind us and i poured it all into the letter but when i read it through i deleted that part if they were tapping my phone line they could pick up my email as readily as my conversations oh darling i wish i knew where you were surely you wouldnt have gone off with some set of extremists and not left word with someone from your team surely youre not with susan horseley or some other fascinating jetsetting journalist in the end i deleted the whole letter and turned to my own phone logs chapter dirty laundry edwards bayard came late to our meeting i figured that was to show me he was really in charge despite agreeing to meet on my home ground while i waited i made my call to mr contreras to let him know i hadnt been arrested at least not so far today i still had a stack of unanswered messages from yesterday most that i returned just got me voice mail since it was sunday afternoon but i reached geraldine graham she was feeling cranky for being neglected said she couldnt hear me when i mumbled into the phone then lectured me for shouting at her what she really wanted was for me to come out to new solway when i told her id try to make it tomorrow afternoon if my schedule permitted she got rather huffy and ordered me to remember who was paying me not you or darraugh maam if you want to put me on your payroll i bill my time at two hundred dollars an hour on those occasions that i found clients who could afford it she paused ill expect you at five tomorrow then if i can make it if i cantill let you know i felt honorbound to call darraugh just to let him know i was visiting his mother despite his orders to the contrary he was home and slightly less arctic than the last time wed spokenalthough naturally he didnt apologize for threatening to fire me so mother actually saw someone in the attic maybe shes a heroine in the war on terrorism she probably enjoyed herself at the social hour after church this morning he wanted a report on what had actually happened at larchmoilt like bobby mallory and renee bayard he didnt believe i didnt know where benjamin sadawi was but even if id been sure of my phones darraugh sure hadnt earned the right to my secrets lately when we finished talking i looked at tessas charcoal sketches of the men whod broken into my office so efficiently i wondered if theyd come in to bug my place even though i knew i the fbi wanted to tap my phones theyd do it from a remote location i unscrewed the handsets and went out to the junction box but didnt find anything and if they wanted to bug the office i looked around in dismay even though tessa rents twothirds of our warehouse i still have a lot of room i had it divided into humansized work areas to make it look friendliertheres a meeting space for clients with couches and a glasstopped tablemy own work area with a long table for laying out big exhibits or mapsmary lous old desk and then the computers and the light fixtures and the pictures on the walls the walledoff back area for supplies a small room with a cot for when i needed to crash i supposed i could have someone come in and sweep the room but in the meantime should i even let clients talk to me here should i take edwards bayard someplace else if he was going to spill his guts to amuse myself while i waited i made headers for tessas sketches of the two federal agents warninghousebreakers pretend to be u s marshals armed dangerous call at once if you see them in the area i made twenty photocopies and did a circuit of the block taping them to lampposts and getting the local shops and coffee bars to put them in their windows elton a homeless man who sells streetwise on my stretch of milwaukee avenue peered over my shoulder as i taped up my last copy they break into your place v l i see them on the street you bet ill let you know right away he probably would too if he was sober he struggles with his drinking but its not an easy habit to combat at the best of times let alone while youre on the streets kind of looks like one of them right now he added jerking his thumb across the street at my building i whirled around it was edwards bayard he did look like one of the feds with the thick sideparted hair thats become a kind of uniform among men in the corpopolitical world but no federal agent could have afforded his clothes or his bmw convertible bayard was looking from me and elton to his car not sure he and his valuable machine belonged near us i crossed the street and greeted him cheerily i dont have much time he said sternly as i tapped in the code for the frontdoor lock no i know youre a busy man i soothed him i of course have nothing else to do so i dont mind when youre fortyfive minutes late he flushed and murmured something about his daughter and the hospital nyaa i thought the first person to apologize loses edwards turned down offers of refreshment and aggressively moved my desk chair into the area where i meet with clients i sat on the arm of the couch so tell me why you broke into olin taverners apartment on thursday and then pretended to your family youd been in washington until catherine was shot i wasnt no no youre a busy man lets not add to your burdens by sifting through lies we both know you were there you werent wearing gloves yes i was he started and then bit his lip midsentence hed never been interrogatedhed fallen for the easiest trick in the book well take that as a yes i was there catherine will find it thrilling when she learns youre a housebreakeritll make you seem younger more daring in her eyes not to mention your mom who thinks youre on the stodgy side his jaw dropped imy daughter is too young to understand why i might have to do something unorthodox i smiled sweetly and your mother is too old so what was in those files taverner kept in his locked drawer you know so damned much you tell me bayard for a smart guy youre not so bright rick salvi may be in your familys pocket but chicagos captain mallory is starting to pay serious attention to new solway he can call on some of the working cops out in dupage to do a real criminal investigation out there so stop stalling because the next time you do im on the phone to the captain he smacked his thigh with a balledup fist im olins executor i had a right to be there then why break in through the patio why not go over to julius arnoffs office and present your credentials and get him to let you in when he didnt say anything i said is it because arnoff is really the executor and your spadona foundation is one of the heirs is it because you didnt want anyone to know you werent really in washington on thursday had you flown out on sunday and killed marcus whitby without realizing the important papers were in taverners desk bayard turned pale thats an outrageous accusation i did not kill marcus whitby or any other person including olin taverner especially not olin hewas an important figure in my life more important than your father i suggested his lip curled in a scornful smile certainly more important than calvin who barely registered my existence i looked at him curiously olin taverner paid active attention to you when you were a child he was the one who took you to ball games and taught you to ride your first pony he turned his head away discomfited no but calvin sure as hell didnthe was too busy being a hero to the whole damned world olin lived in washington when i was growing up he had an active law practice there and anyway after the hearings calvin and renee took over new solway they made olin uncomfortable in his own home can you believe that calvin and renee bore him such a grudge that they persuaded people hed known his whole life to cut him he tried to destroy your fathers life i said its not too surprising your parents werent his biggest wellwishers well they had their own dirty laundry to hide or at least calvin did and renee of course trotted around after him in her busy efficient way helping him bury it so when did taverner show you what their laundry was he cast me a sidelong glance as if trying to decide what story id be most likely to believe i spoke before he chose a version this afternoon at your mothers you were implying that your fathers financial dealings were shaky did taverner tell you that not exactly so what exactly i found a letter in calvins desk he blurted out from old mrs drummondmrs grahams mother she knew about your fathers financial situation i was incredulous apparently calvin was stealing from the drummonds or maybe the grahams i can still recite that damned letter by heart dear calvin i am aware of the theft you are committing against my household a streak of hypocrisy seems to grow deep within your familys character your mother had a similar tendency to parade the halls draped in righteousness while her conduct behind the scenes didnt bear close scrutiny i shall of course expect restitution and you may be sure that i will take appropriate measures should your actions continue she signed it with her full name laura taverner drummond which is how i learned she was related to olin no one ever told me anything about all those peoplei kept stumbling on bits of information like that and feeling goddamned blindsided the resentment from twentyfive years earlier still burned his cheeks were red now and his voice shaking with anger so then did you take the letter to taverner i was only sixteen i went to renee and demanded she tell me what the letter was about she laughedlaughed mind you as if it were a joke not a character flaw she said calvin had been a bit unscrupulous in borrowing from the neighbors but that when she married him she put a stop to all that but you know word always seeps out in a small town and people gossip endlessly its one thing i owe reneegrowing up chiefly in chicago instead of that deadalive fishbowl on coverdale lane weekends there were bad enough yes indeed in any small community including the urban neighborhood o my own childhood people gossip mercilessly about mrs thiss daughters pregnancy and how poor mrs that felt when her husband lost all the rent money at craps i felt momentary compunction for darraugh and for the angry man in front of meboth of them poor little rich boys in their way i wonder why your father kept the letter anyone on your familys staff might have found it and blackmailed him calvin iswasan incurable pack rat his study out in new solway is crammed with papers i cant imagine the lantners being bothered to look through all that crap and why were you looking at it a congenital weakness for poking through other peoples desks i spoke with deliberate roughness hoping to goad a further response deepening anger turned bayards blue eyes black all that damned talk wed had a big house partythe fortieth anniversary of calvin taking over bayard publishing his pals from the lefts glory days came even old armand pelletierhe stayed with us for three days until he got into a huge shouting match with calvin and stormed out there was one of those daylong partiespeople came to ride and have breakfast and stayed on all day until we had dinner for eightyrenee loved showing off not her possessions her genius for organizing all the neighbors from coverdale lane showed up except olin of course old mrs drummond creaked over in her diamonds she was ninetyeight and forced everybody to drop anything they were doing if she had any kind of whim even renee danced when mrs drummond banged her drum geraldine graham came too although she and renee didnt get along and she didnt get along that great with mrs drummond with her mother come to think of it and i heard some of the women talking in those delicious breathless voices does he even suspect do you think after all he looks just like his mother so why would he his chin jutted out as if he dared me to mock him i do look like renee so if calvin isnt my father i cant tell by looking in the mirror when i was little i kept believing id grow up as tall as he was and then i was sixteen and stuck at five foot eight i look like renees father like his younger twin theres not a trace of bayard in me so while they were having the time of their lives at that party i went through calvins deski knew his study was the one room that people didnt go to fuck in sacred ground not like even my own bedroom where i found armand with peter felittis wife i was hoping thered be one word in calvins old diaries about me one thought that hed paid attention to my conception or my birth bayard was panting as though hed been running hard when trina was born i made a conscious effort to write it up it was a big moment in my life i should think in any fathers life his first childs birth seeing that perfect little creature you made happen but not calvin and i never knew whether it was because he wasnt my father or because he was so damned wound up in his own importance that i didnt count for crap everyone worshiped himyou yourself do well i wanted a father not a god who expected to be on that pedestal my stomach tightened at the accusation but i kept my voice steady did your mother have affairs it doesnt seem in character although i didnt know her when she was twenty thats what i would have thought too he said savagely and of course its what she said when i put it to her so what did you tell taverner when you met did you ask him who your father really was or just about the letter from ms drummond he began picking at the rubber edge to one of my legal pads iti decided to explore other viewpoints than calvin and renees and served as an intern in senator towers office that was when i really met olin got to know him he was astonished of course to see a bayard in that office but he and tower were good friends olin was a different kind of person than calvin not as easygoing not expecting people to fall down and worship him i liked him and we got to be friends and there was the added benefit that knowing him made your parents see redso to speak as if that isnt what they always saw he ripped a length of rubber from the pad now the pages would all fall off but that was a small price for the information i was getting so you came to tell him about the letter from ms drummond did he know about it he said he was surprised old mrs drummond cared that her views on negroes were as antiquated as she wasshe hung on until you know running larchmont like it had been when she moved into it except she installed electricity talking about the coloreds knowing their place and hiring four japanese gardeners to keep the pond and gardens in order mrs drummond was olins aunt but even though he made fun of her she intimidated him too what did her views on blacks have to do with your father i tried staying on the main point but i had trouble figuring out what it was calvin had been stealing from augustus llewellyn apparently olin never spelled it out he said he wasnt there to stir up old wounds but as id seen his aunts letter i should know that calvin had been but that doesnt make sense i interjected your father lent llewellyn the money to start tsquare he stared at me did renee tell you that yes and they confirmed it over at llewellyn enterprises calvin did something with llewellyns finances bayard insisted olin told me and he wasnt a liar so what else did he tell you i demanded why did he hint around about your fathers financial deals but never spell them out because hed made a promise and he kept his word be your age bayard have you ever even read any of the transcripts of the hearings taverner masterminded he reveled in unveiling peoples secrets he kept quiet because i know you share calvins views he shouted me down you cant believe taverner had a sense of honor because the communists you admire so much didnt believe in the concept youve said about twenty actionable things in the last five minutes bayard my own temper was rising but lets keep to the real questions here isnt it more likely taverner kept his secrets to himself because he didnt want his own secrets coming out if you mean his homosexuality he didnt hide that from me it didnt affect my respect for him he said stiffly it doesnt matter now the way it did in the fifties i agreed so what secret of his own did taverner care so much about that he kept one of your fathers for four decades you are completely wrong about olins character because you only believe what you read in the liberal media this line about the liberal media is the same kind of garbage as lies of the capitalist press that the old fellow travelers reiterated i snapped exasperated both of them are slogans to keep you from thinking about what you dont want to know but have it your way taverner pledged his life his fortune and his sacred honor not to tell people your father had been stealing from augustus llewellyn now tell me how did you know taverner had this secret file in his desk the one you broke into his place to find he scowled it was a desk that had belonged to one of the early supreme court justices william johnson and it was olins most prized possession he had it in his washington home not his office and he moved it back to chicago with him a couple of times when i was visiting him and we were talking aboutabout calvin and renee he tapped the desktop and said its all in there my boy and when im gone you can learn the whole sorry story so when you learned he was dead you wanted to get to the whole sorry story before the lawyers did i suggested just in case julius arnoff thought the papers ought to go to your mother or even be suppressed instead of including them with what he turned over to the heirs it would be like julius he said bitterly damned little busybody trotting around like calvins lapdog wagging his tail anytime the big man threw him a biscuit and when you got there and went to all that trouble busting open the patio door what did you think when you saw the papers were already gone i figured the mexican who looked after him stole them to see what he could get for them i thought of domingo rivas with his quiet dignity in looking after his gentlemen and felt another spurt of anger so did you talk to mr rivas i told him id pay him a thousand dollars for anything he removed from olins desk but he claimed he knew nothing about those papers he has his own code of honor and i doubt it includes stealing from his patients you know of course that if hed wanted to take something of taverners he would have known where the keys werehe wouldnt have had to follow your sterling example and break any locks he flushed who else could have themunless that black reporter filched them because i sure as hell dont have them oh it could be a black reporter or a mexican orderly but not a rich white guy i was thoroughly angry by now thats the question isnt it if you dont have them and marcus whitby didnt take them where are olin taverners secret documents chapter tangletangle lives entangled the reporter must have taken them edwards insisted not because he was black because he was a reporter just because im against affirmative action doesnt mean im a racist in fact its quite the opposite affirmative yes ive read all those position papers i interrupted i understand how insulting it is for africanamericans if whites give up any privileges marcus whitby didnt take taverners papers when whitby left taverner locked the documents back in his drawer mr rivas saw him do so he could have come back for them later olin called me on fridayhe wanted me to know he was going to make his story public now while he was still alive i askedbegged him over the phoneto tell me what was in those papers but he wouldnt not on the phone he was obsessed about phone taps about the liberal media listening in on his conversations so i said id fly out i was going to camp david with the president for the weekend but i told him id fly out first thing tuesday but tuesday olin was dead camp david with the president a rarefied life augmented by a little housebreaking but of course theres a precedent for that isnt theredidnt the watergate burglars pal around at camp david on the odd weekend maybe you got away early on monday though and took an evening flight into ohare he narrowed his eyes at me why do you say that taverner had an unexpected visitor monday night it wouldnt have been you would it trying to argue him out of going public or knocking him off prematurely so you could collect his he got to his feet ive had as much as i can stand of your innuendos i wasnt in chicago on monday and its your word against mine that i was here on thursday and the fbis i said lightly i think your pals in the justice department are listening in on my conversations at least they sent in a couple of agents who knew how to bypass my alarm system and my locks i dont know whether they installed voiceactivated bugs but they might haveyou should ask them if they have a recording of our conversation today he turned white then red you taped this conversation without telling me no bayard do listen to what people are really saying to you im letting you know that the attorney general whose methods you applaud may be taping my conversations on account of they think i know where ben jamin sadawi is or because marcus whitby knew what was in olin taverners files and theyre hoping ill find out or because they care passionately about what the average citizen is thinking and doing take your pick his eyes darted around the room assessing where a bug could be placed like me he seemed to find the possibilities both endless and daunting and youre one of the people my mother has let into my daughters life by god catherine is going back to washington with me that should be an interesting conversation i said dryly out of curiosity why did you leave catherine with her grandmother in the first place it was easier he snapped when my wife died i let renee take over catherines care i was too shattered to look after a toddler and then i was traveling a great deal i thoughti assumed that catherine would see through renee and calvins political hypocrisy just as i had and meanwhile she got the advantages of new solway and that stable environment but i should have known easier is never better and by god now ill do it the hard way he stood so roughly that my desk chair rolled backward and cracked into the coffee table and the first change im making is that i forbid you to talk to my daughter again i will not have you continuing to involve her with terrorists i didnt involve her with terroristsi met her the same way i met youby interrupting her housebreaking if i had a kid i wouldnt let you hang out with heri wouldnt want her thinking that its okay to break the law if youre rich and powerful he glared at me his square angry face looking very like renee you probably want to get back to the hospital i got up when i visit catherine i wont mention our chat i dont pledge my honor because we both know im a liberal and dont have any but i do care about disillusioning childrens belief in their parents for whatever reason your daughter seems fond of you i told you to stay away from my daughter and i mean it he stalked from office i followed him down the hall to the front door you might notice the strong resemblance between catherine and the portrait of calvins mother that hangs over your big staircase in new solway have you ever considered dna testing that could clear up your worries about your paternity he didnt thank me for my helpful advice but walked around his bmw looking for any damage elton crossed the street to offer him streetwise but bayard ignored him and drove off with a great thrust of his afterburners i went back into my office my anger had subsided but edwards bayards turbulent emotions hung heavy in the room i wished i did have a tape recording of the conversation i tried to reconstruct it especially the letter laura taverner drummond had written calvin theft against her household that could mean anything from sexual to financial plundering i should have mastered my own temper better i didnt get as much out of the interview as i would have if id kept my cool edwards interpreted the letter as proof that calvin had been stealing from the grahams or at least from the drummondgraham household and then olin taverner said he was surprised that laura drummond cared about negroes had calvin stolen from some black servant in the drummond family augustus llewellyn was the only africanamerican whose name had cropped up in connection with bayards just in case i logged on to nexis and looked up llewellyn like bayard publishing llewellyn was a closely held corporation so i couldnt find much on their finances besides tsquare they published four other magazines including one for teens two for women and a general news magazine llewellyn also owned the license for an am radio station that featured jazz and gospel an fm station that played rap and hiphop and a couple of cable channels i couldnt see how they were financed or what their debt load was personal data were easier to gather augustus llewellyn was in his seventies lived in a big home some six thousand square feet in lake forest he had one getaway place in jamaica and an apartment in paris on rue georges v he was married had three children and seven grandchildren his daughter janice managed the two womens magazines while a grandson worked at the am radio station llewellyn himself still came to work every day he was a big republican party donor despite having been treated as a chauffeur by gop operatives when he drove his mercedes sedan to a recent fundraiser at the opera house he was a passionate sailor a photograph showed a slender dapper man in tennis whites carrying himself erect with no sign of aging except his grizzled hair from an old interview with him in tsquare i learned that llewellyn had gone to northwestern university in the forties where hed majored in journalism when he found it impossible to get the kind of job his white fellow graduates were finding hed started tsquare in his basement while he worked days as a mail clerk at the old daily news in the early days he and his wife june carried magazines to stores on the black south side ran and repaired a handpress and wrote all the copy for each issue in he was able to pay a photographer and a parttime staffer in he found financing to set up a real piublishing operation by he was making enough money to start mero for women and to buy his fm and am licenses the radio stations began to make real money he started his other publications in the early sixties about the time he built his cube on west erie street i whistled if you miss me at the back of the bus under my breath the information was all interesting but didnt tell me whether llewellyns family had ever worked for laura drummond in the dim past i flipped back to the business reports and read them in more detail and there buried in the fine print on the third screen was a fascinating little factoid registered agent for the llewellyn group lebold arnoff attorneys with addresses in oak brook and on lasalle street come on over to the front of the bus ill be riding right there yes indeedy i said aloud why are you using new solways tame lawyers as your registered agent mr llewellyn i didnt think julius arnoff would tell me anything but the young associate might i called larry yosano both his home phone and his mobile but only got voice mail at both places i left a message with my own cell phone number of course geraldine graham would know shed also know what her mother was referring to when she talked about theft against her household i called anodyne park ms graham was resting lisa told me and couldnt be disturbed i really just wanted to know if augustus llewellyns family worked at larchmont hall before he became rich and famous who are you working for she hissed does mr darraugh know youre with the newspapers trying to dig up that old dirt we never knew the llewellns mrs graham met him socially through mr bayard and if you try to say something else the lawyer will deal with you or mr darraugh will take care of you himself i hung up more bewildered than ever had geraldine been llewellyns lover but what did that have to do with her mothers letter to calvin bayard geraldine had met llewellyn socially through calvin bayard which is also how she had met kylie ballantine whod been fired from the university of chicago because olin taverner demanded it of the universitys president olin was geraldines cousin as well as a neighbor even though he spent most of his time in washington in those days amy blount had given me her photocopy of taverners letter to the university along with the picture of kyhe ballantine dancing for the committee for social thought and justice benefit i still had the copies in my briefcase i took them out and studied them dancers in western tights and toe shoes faces obscured by african shields or maskswho had known one of them was kylie ballantine or for that matter where she was dancing the shot was of the stage not of the audience all you could tell was that it was an outdoor venue because evergreen branches appeared behind the wings who had taken the picture who had sent it to taverner i dropped it on my desktop the more bits and pieces about new solway that i gathered the more confused i became and what about edwards bayards conviction that calvin wasnt his father the gossip hed overheard as a childdid that have anything to do with this story or was it just gossip amy had included a few notes on the committee for social thought and justice she said not much had been written about it because it wasnt as well known as other leftleaning groups of the forties and fifties not like the civil rights congress where dashiell hammett sat on the board and decca mitford and bob truehoft did groundbreaking legal and social work for africanamericans out in oakland shed found one article in the journal of labor history part of the oral history of black labor organizers of the forties which included reminiscences about the beginnings of the group the article dealt mostly with the role that black members of the hotel workers union played in the struggle against the mob and the hotel industry one of the men interviewed had been a communist who hung out at a west side bar called floras where leftleaning workers and intellectuals both black and white congregated apparently when armand pelletier returned from spain he started bringing some of his writer and painter friends to floras where they had informal meetings gave impromptu concerts and also helped the labor leaders write and print leaflets artists and writers from the federal negro theater project often showed up the man in the interview definitely remembers kylie ballantine coming there amy had written not very many other writers or artists were mentioned by name except pelletier because he was the important organizer of the artists the interview was focusing on black labor leaders one day pelletier joked that the dies committee in congress would shut down floras if they knew that the federal theater project was still active there well call ourselves a committee too just like dies does one that keeps american values alive but were not here to investigate peoples toilets and peer in their bedrooms well have a committee for working people who believe in the real values of america someone came up with the cumbersome title committee for social thought and justice which the members themselves shortened to comthought comthought never had an active organization or board but they did raise money to help fund some of the experimental arts programs congress had cut out of the new deal and since many of the people at floras were communists and were arrested comthought began providing legal defense money for them in the late forties and early fifties pelletier himself served six months in prison both for giving to the fund himself and for refusing to name any other donors i thought again of geraldine and the pet charity of calvins shed given money to her mother definitely would have hated any organization that she thought was a communist front i looked at the clock when id talked to lotty yesterday she had invited me to dinner with her tonight it was fivethirty nowif the traffic gods were kind i could make it out to anodyne park and back in two hours i called to say i might be a bit late she adjured me not to make it too late since she had an early date in the or but if i could get to her by eight shed still like to see me chapter charity begins at home youre a determined young woman arent you ms warshawski geraldine graham was sitting in the chair under her mothers portrait the remains of her supper on a tray on the piecrust table it gets me places brains and brawn wont take me i agreed when id reached anodyne park at sixthirty lisa had told the guard not to admit me i didnt waste time on argument but drove back around to coverdale lane it was dark now but i quickly found the entrance to the culvert under the road i shone my flashlight aroundit didnt look to me as though bobby had organized an exploration of the area yet i was still in jeans and running shoes hunched over my back aching from the need to stoop i stomped through benjis and my footprints trying not to obliterate the wheel tracks from the golf cart when i got to the juniper bush on the anodyne park side i stretched myself thankfully i tried to clean the muck from my shoes but when i got inside geraldines building i took them off no point adding mud to my other iniquities in lisas eyes getting inside geraldines building didnt require any special skill just the timehonored method of pressing apartment bells until someone buzzed me in an old person in chicago would have been more cautious but they were a trusting bunch in anodyne park at least trusting in their guard at the gate at geraldine grahams own front door lisa answered my insistent ring she was so startled she didnt react at all for a second by the time she decided to slam the door in my face i had given her a genial good evening dropped my shoes outside the door and moved past her into the hallway i could hear ms graham calling from the living room demanding to know who was at the door i went in to greet her and had the satisfaction of hearing her admonish lisa for trying to keep me out i was there at geraldines request to tell her what had happened at larchmont on friday night when id run through enough of the highlightsincluding my interrogation by the fbito satisfy her i finally turned to my own agenda i know we had an appointment for tomorrow afternoon i said but i had edwards bayard with me this afternoon and he told me an odd tale edwards i suppose he came out here because of the girl among other things do you know i actually found him in olin taverners apartment thursday night he had broken in trying to find some secret papers that taverner had promised him how extraordinary and did he find the papers she did a good job keeping a tone of light interest in her flutey voice but her hands had clenched at her sides no i waited for her hands to relax before adding but he did tell me about a letter he found from your mother to calvin bayard and i suppose you drove out here to tell me about it her hands tightened again but she still managed to keep her voice steady your mother wrote calvin about depredations he was committing against her household and a demand for restitutionor she would take action the light bouncing from her heavy glasses made it impossible for me to see geraldines eyes mother thought she was a law unto herself she defined theft according to her own canons and i prompted when she fell silent again i wrote a check for calvin to one of his pet charities it was a group mother disapproved of because it provided assistance to indigent negroes who needed legal assistance she gave one of her involuntary glances at the fulllength portrait behind her i was fortyfive years old but she still thought it within her rights to examine my bank statement when it arrived each month i didnt realize she was doing it until she confronted me over this check for once i held my ground with her i should have realized she would next turn to calvin she had such strong antiblack prejudices i was bewildered geraldine graham gave a tight little smile she had such strong feelings against her will being thwarted that i imagine she lost sight of the original issue she threatened mr bayard with reprisals what would those have been mother owned shares in bayard publishing she was always threatening to sell them to olin who was her nephew or to will them to him whenever calvin published something she thought was risqu it was a hollow threatshe disapproved of olins sexual proclivities far more than she did of calvins daring authors how odd it seems that calvins authors were once considered daring now that every sexual act is described in such detail that they all become merely boring not to mention how they appear in films men like armand pelletier who were glamorized for their bold language have become passe why was lisa so determined i shouldnt talk to you about this i refused to be diverted she accused me of working for the newspapers trying to dig up old dirt thats right madam lisa popped into the room from her selfappointed listening post i remember well what mrs drummond went through when mr mackenzie passed the work to keep that will do lisa miss victoria is trying to find out who killed the negro writer in our pond she has no prurient interest in my affairs and we have nothing to hide from her the last phrase was uttered like a warning like a way of saying our hand is so much quicker than her eye that you can speak of everything except the elephant in the drawing room which she cant see lisa muttered something that might have been an apology she retreated to the edge of the carpet but she didnt leave the room no one seemed to think i might mourn mackenzie when he died but his death marked the end of many things for me geraldine added for me to my mother his death was one more inconvenience he had caused her odd when you consider that my marriage to him was her idea hers and mackenzies fathers mr blair graham was one of my fathers business associates and everyone thought that marriage would settle both mackenzie and me down turning him from the temptations of new york city and me from those of chicago when we started our own nursery children are supposed to be a womans greatest joy after all how strange that mother would tell me that so often when i brought her no joy at all except perhaps the joy of exercising her will over mine your mother didnt think darraugh should mourn his fathers death either as always happened in talking to geraldine i had to struggle to keep on the subject or to remember what the subject was was that why darraugh ran away from school when your husband died geraldines hands began to pleat the stiff fabric of her skirt my mother was still alive when darraughs son was born she took his naming the boy mackenzie as a personal insult rather than a tribute to a wellloved parent she thought darraugh ought to name the boy matthew for my father or even call him after her own father virgil fabian tavernerhe was named during the victorian fashion for all things roman be that as it may mother rewrote her will a few days after mackenzies baptism none of the boys charms and my grandson has always had most winning ways could persuade mother not to punish darraugh through his son i know young mackenzie he does have a lot of charm what was the charity your mother took such exception to she didnt understand what i was talking about at first when i reminded her that she had written a check to one of calvin bayards charities she again stiffened but said how strange that i cant remember at the time it seemed of consuming importancemy action mothers intrusiveness and yet the memory has vanished like some longsince plucked fruit it wasnt the committee for social thought and justice renee bayard said that was one that your cousin olin was particularly determined to prove a communist front she shook her head again young woman you must be now the age i was then everything seems fresh and clear in your minds eye but if you live to my great age you will find that the past becomes such a broad landscape that many memories even precious ones get hidden under leaves and hillocks you will have to excuse me now conversation fatigues me as it didnt formerly i got up to leave lisa smiled in triumph youre very kind to have taken the time how did mr bayard come to be involved with mr llewellyn to the extent of providing the money he needed to start his own publishing firm i asked i was never involved in the business life of new solways businessmen when i was a young woman we were supposed to be decorative not to have heads for great affairs i shook off lisas arm as she tried to steer me to the door did mr llewellyn support the same charity that you did she shook her head i wouldnt know young woman its possible but it was all a long time ago in another country ms graham often dotted her speech with what sounded like quotations that i didnt recognize i knew this one as i put my shoes on in the buildings foyer i could even supply the missing second part of it besides the wench is dead i didnt think geraldine had forgotten anything the name of the charity why her mother had objected so strongly or even how calvin bayard came to support llewellyn but for whatever reason geraldine thought the person shed been in those days was dead her mother had triumphedher mothers portrait hung over her head day after day to remind her how had she spent her days back then while mrs drummond ran larchmont maybe shed thrown herself into motherhood and amateur dramatics or county politics marriage had been supposed to settle both her and mackenzie graham i remembered again the articles describing her return from europe in the early thirties looking interestingly thin shed slept around gotten pregnant gone to switzerland for an abortion and mackenzie what form had his new york city peccadilloes taken even with thirteen bedrooms to wander through how had geraldine endured all those years with her mother and a husband with whom she had nothing in common what had she been mourning when she said she mourned mackenzies death chapter silence is lotty couldnt give me as much comfort as i wanted over a bowl of lentil soup i recounted the details of my last several days trying to puzzle out the complicated relations of new solway when i finished she asked where does that egyptian boy fit in he doesnt except i think he could tell me how whitby got into the pond i described the layout of the larchmont attic to her and my imagined picture of benjamin sadawi standing on a chair watching for catherine lotty pushed her reading glasses up into her hair so you do know where he is victoria i flushed but nodded and is that why youre concealing his whereabouts because you want to get information out of him if hes a terrorist you should turn him over to the authorities if i knew he was a terrorist id turn him over in a heartbeat and youre the best judge of whether he is i got up from the couch and walked over to the window where i could see the lake glistening when car lights hit it its the trouble with these times lotty we dont know who to trust but an attorney general who thinks that calico cats are a sign of the devil doesnt inspire me with greater confidence than i have in my own judgment your judgment on this isnt backed up by any experience or expertise youve never worked with arab militants so you dont know how or what to look for to say whether he is one or not you certainly dont speak arabic so you cant even talk to him i turned to look at her lotty do you think every arab in this country should be interned of course not you know i loathe stereotyping of any kind but this mornings paper ran a story about the mosque this youth attends the antijewish rhetoric there runs high she sighed and looked down at her hands it seems to run high these days in london and paris as well nothing has changed since my childhood all over europe and the middle east instead of blaming terrorists for our current woes people are blaming the jews even some poet in new jersey is chanting that tired old litany so id like to make sure this particular arab boy doesnt want to see me dead before i applaud you for hiding him i pulled savagely on the cord for her blinds i understand its what makes everything so difficult these days what if i cut benjamin loose and he kills someone like yousomeone beloved whos saving lives not a party to his quarrel with the universe what if i turn him over to the authorities and they send him to a prison remote from anyone he knows where he can be gangraped by the adult male population if hes not already a terrorist that seems guaranteed to turn him into one she nodded her face pinched with worry so what are you doing to resolve this dilemma ive left him with father lou hes sorted out a lot of gangbangers in his day maybe he can sort this kid out too i hope for everyones sake youre right about this victoria im worried about oh everything but also your own safety you could get badly hurt yourself you know not even necessarily by this boy but by some gunhappy policeman like the ones who shot the bayard child is this egyptian boys health and safety really worth the risk to your own life her mouth twisted in an ironic smile why am i even asking that question youre like your own dogsonce you have a bone in your teeth you wont let it go we talked of easier matters for a time but at ten she told me she was due in the or at six and that i should go home and try to be careful she smiled at me but her eyes were sad lottys somber words haunted my sleep filling it with dreams where i caused disasters in which she died and morrell stood in the entrance to a cave shaking his head at me before turning his back and disappearing from sight a little after fourthirty i picked myself out of bed it was better to stumble grittyeyed through the day than get another hour of such tormented sleep i drove over to st remigios for early mass taking a roundabout route through the early morning streets until i was sure that no one was on my tail i slipped into the lady chapel about halfway through the lessons read in spanish by a stocky woman who was the school nurse a handful of neighborhood women were there and a sleepy boy a student at the school was serving after the service father lou beckoned me into his study benji was doing all right a bit nervous about being in christian hands but hed loved going to the gym yesterday afternoon and had started a workout on the equipment and still had nothing to say about what if anything hed seen from his attic window the night marcus whitby was killed dont know how well this is going to work i put him in the fourth grade he can read enough english for that hell improve fast if he stays told the kids he was africanthe truth and keeps them from thinking hes an enemy but theyre teasing him for being in the kiddie class so his pride is hurt explained to him and them what real strength is not beating someone in the ring beating your own devils at their game only weak people take part in mobs never know how much of a lecture like that gets through to them i nodded the mosque he goes to yesterdays papers said they carry literature on how zionism is responsible for the world trade center and jews make purim cakes out of muslim childrens blood i hate to think im protecting someone who wants to kill my friends he grunted best i can tell you is i grew up in the catholic church hearing same kinds of stories jews killed jesus made matzo out of christian babies blood grew up learned different learned better hope this kid can do the same hows the girl healing nicely shell come home from the hospital today to a showdown between her father and her grandmother the father has the legal rights but my money is on granny can i talk to benji for a minute father lou looked at his clock should be in the kitchen seems able to look after himself i think hes a good boy shy but eager to respond to people i walked down the unlit hallways to the kitchen where benji was washing dishes in the old zinc sink he looked up nervously at my entrance but relaxed when he recognized me i put a piece of bread in the toaster i saw catherine yesterday shes doing well she got hit in the upper arm but not badly and theyre sending her home from the hospital today that is very well that news you telling her where i am i nodded shell be in touch when she knows it wont put you in any danger for her to visit you benjiwhat do you want to do in the long run if we can sort out your problems do you want to stay in chicago or go back to cairo he started drying the plates hed washed carefully as if they were sevres china instead of industrial pottery sort out my problems you are saying what end my problems yes solve them for my family is good i am here i send money and my sisters and my littlest brother they go to school they study for me always hiding is no good is unhealthy is he made an expressive gesture comprehending humiliation and anger and also when i hiding i cannot working cannot work i cannot work when i am hiding always this christian priest is what you saying he is good man and he is helping with learning english but still i cannot work i cannot go mosque i cannot see my people so i need to figure out how to let you stay here but keep you out of the fbis clutches i spread butter on the toast benji last sunday a man died in the pond behind larchmont hallthe house where catherine hid you you know its name is larchmont hall right i think someone put this man in the pond i think someone killed this man when you were watching for catherine what did you see nothing i seeing nothing he dropped the plate he was holding it landed with a bang on the tiles breaking into large jagged chunks i knelt to gather up the pieces but squatted on my haunches to look up at him why are you afraid to tell me what you saw i got you away from the police you saw how much trouble i took to keep you safe why do you think i would hurt you now i seeing nothing i poor i not aa professor but i know what be happening i seeing someone you telling police they saying ah egyptian boy he terrorist he killer i seeing someone and they killing me next no i seeing no person he flung the dish towel onto the kitchen table and fled into the interior of the rectory chapter stiffed at the morgue i left the church feeling tense and jumpy my conversation with benji had confirmed my assumption that hed seen marcs killer and hed managed to explain why he was afraid to report what hed seen i couldnt exactly blame him the law had shot catherine bayard in their eagerness to kill him why should he trust that i could keep them from executing him if he came forward to testify if i could figure out a way to get the justice department off his back maybe benji would give me the information in exchange but i didnt have clever ideas about much of anything right now my day didnt unfold in a way that made me any happier back in my apartment i found a message from bryant vishnikov hed phoned only a few minutes after i left hoping that meant he had hot information i dropped my coat and purse on the floor and returned his call at once he interrupted an autopsy to talk to me why didnt you tell me the city wanted an autopsy on your stiff hi bryant have a nice weekend mine was good too thanks just the usual two hours under bright lights with three law enforcement agencies i dont know if youve ever noticed but despite my winsome manners the police arent my biggest admirers they dont share their hopes and wishes with me when did they order the autopsy the paperwork came over from bobby mallorys office yesterday afternoon when i called to explain id already done it as a private job captain mallory not surprisingly wanted to know who for he said you were at the meeting sunday where they agreed to send whitby here for a second opinion and he was not happy that you hadnt told him that youd hired me on behalf of the whitby family i was at that meeting i agreed as a suspect in hiding an egyptian boy from the feds not as a participant in discussions about crime fighting what did you find when you did the autopsy damn you warshawski dont blindside me like this and then think ill tell you what i know and damn you vishnikov for calling me up to yell at me instead of talking it through with me i said thoroughly angry i hired you in good faith i followed the protocol you outlined for getting the body to you through a private funeral parlor what did you find for nothing ill tell you what i told mallory there werent any external blows or wounds whitby wasnt shot or knifed or bludgeoned before he went into the pond he drowned and his blood alcohol the tox screen will come in tonight or tomorrow that you can get from mallory i wont charge you for my work since the county ordered the same job but you also dont get a free look at the screen he severed the connection whick like slicing off the top of a corpses head i looked at my hands with a sense of deflation i had expected so much more from vishnikov id been so sure thered be some kind of in jury and then the golf cart that had gone through the culvertor maybe those wheel tracks hadnt belonged to a golf cart sherlock holmes would have measured a cart taken a plaster cast of the wheels checked them against the tracks in the culvert maybe id made up a whole lot of connections that didnt exist wanting to create a murder where thered only been an inexplicable accident my father used to lecture me about being too impulsive dont ride your emotions so much pepper pot take the time to think it through first you can save yourself a lot of grief and me as well hed said that more than once but i vividly remembered his voice from a day hed been called to meet me in the principals office id tried to stage a sitin to protest a schoolmates expulsion i thought theyd done it because joey lived in a shanty and stank it turned out to be because joey was setting fires in the lockers i wondered now if riding my emotions was leading me to shelter another joey whether benjamin sadawi would prove to be a fire starter as well i didnt seem to have learned much in twentyfive years i took the dogs for a short run then went to the safe in my bedroom closet for my smith wesson i drove out to the range and fired a hundred rounds venting my frustration with myself more than anything else i was off the target more than i was on it which didnt improve my mood i went to my office feeling that id better be able to use finesse to solve my problems i didnt remember any finesse when bobby called me a little after ten it was his turn to chew me out for not letting him know that vishnikov was already working on whitby you heard that whole discussion about where the body was and who would do the second autopsy and you didnt let out one peep that you already had vish working on it id been the subject of a hostile interrogation for over two hours if i said anything to that crew id have been there another two hours but later when you were alone with me bobby you were focusing on the egyptian kid and i was tiredi forgot have you found him yet im telling you vicki this isnt a joke if you know where benjamin sadawi is and youre sitting on him like you sat on the autopsy i am personally going to tie you up in pink ribbon and deliver you to the federal marshals use some other color okay i forgot i was going to think things through before speaking you know i hate sex stereotyping he slammed the phone in my ear i sat staring at nothing for a long time the front door bell finally roused me from my stupor it was a messenger with a large envelope from cheviot labs which included the salvageable material from whitbys pocket organizer separated and placed in protective plastic as well as several pages summarizing the work done on them and the results excitement at the contents made me forget my frustrations for a moment kathryn changs cover letter explained that shed had to come in on a different project yesterday and had found my packet you said your need for analysis was urgent so i took care of it most of the paper had been destroyed first by being wet too long and then by drying out for future reference if you ever need this kind of work done again keep the paper damp until we can work on it as far as i can tell a small notepad suffered the most damage two documents had been folded and placed in a side compartment these were relatively intact and i was able to restore them of course its very difficult to judge paper and ink after theyve been soaked as long as these pieces had one was handwritten on school exercise paper that dated to the nineteenthirties the other typed on a pound cream stock around forty or fifty years old ive placed the originals in protective casings you should be very careful about touching them attached are photographed copies and transcriptions photography preserves the original document better than photocopying i laid out the photoed pages one was a typed letter to kylie ballantine the other her own spidery handwritten response so marc had found some documents the letters so precious that hed kept them in his breast pocket over his heart my own heart beat faster as i read the typed letter dear kylie despite the turns of dame fortunes wheel which dictate when we mortals shall enjoy fame and money and when we shall live by writing bilge for womens magazines under pseudonyms my own in case you havent been reading womans day lately is rosemary burke i have a few friends remaining at the august institution you no longer grace one of them tells me that olin taverner somehow came by a photograph of you dancing at the lodge for comthought back in fortyeight he sent it to the university president with a demand that they dismiss you i dont know who was at the resort with a camera and who would have supplied that prize fascist with a picture but you might ask taverner what are you living on these days calvin is giving me fifty cents for bleak land and being hoitytoity about it in the bargainbut at least it appears under my own name not rosemary burke and does she ever at the tripe she produces probably next april ever yours especially when i remember that night under the stars armand that didnt tell me anything i didnt already know from the material amy had found in the universitys archives i pulled out my magnifying glass to help me read kylies response dear armand i am tired of the whole wretched business i did write to olin taverner and received back a reply expressing hauteur to the nth degree as one would expect from someone who knows he is the sole rightthinking person on the planetwalker bushnell is only protecting the rest of america from the likes of you and me and instead of inveighing against rep bushnell and the rest of his feebleminded ilk i should talk to those of my own blood to find out how taverner got the photograph etc etc if you want to pursue this with calvin or try to find a public forum for grievance i wont attempt to dissuade youbut i leave on the th for africa where i shall celebrate and renew myself as my mother celebrates and renews herself let america chew on itself i no longer care i can taste and feel freedoms canopy over me already her signature flowed from the k indecipherable as when id seen it at the harsh collection i turned the two documents over and over in my hands as if somehow that would make their meaning clearer when marcus whitby found these letters hed taken them to taverner surely even sherlock holmes would assume that much or maybe not but something had taken whitby to taverner and what else could it be but these letters whitby wanting to know about the photo taverner had sent to the university of chicago president all those years ago i wished whitbys notepad had survived the immersion or that id known enough to keep it wet until i got it to cheviot labs marc had taken notes during his meeting with taverner thats what taverners attendant had said the mess of gray pilling which kathryn chang had sealed into a protective wrapper was all that remained of those notes kathryn been able to pull some of it apart into fragments of pages but only a few individual words survived inform disgrace and tired now the dead sixty i doubt if even the enigma machine could have put those into a meaningful sentence i glanced back at kathryn changs letter to me i hadnt read the last paragraph in which she explained that whitbys palmpilot had also been in his pocket organizer she could send it to the electronics division to see if they could recover the data but this is likely to be quite expensive so i dont want to proceed unless you authorize the work since her bill for doing the paper restoration was eighteen hundred dollars i was afraid to find out what her idea of quite expensive might be entered the eighteen hundred into the expense sheet for the whitby inquiry the debit side was building nicely and i wasnt sure how much of it i could expect harriet to payshe hadnt authorized overtime costs at cheviot labs for instance i looked wistfully at my open file for darraugh but i couldnt push that expense over to him i called kathryn chang and told her to wait on the palm pilot the material shed salvaged contained a lot of information but i felt i needed some kind of key or clue to make sense of it i hadnt learned enough from ballantines papers in the harsh collection but maybe pelletiers would be more revealingif they were available i phoned amy blount and described the documents that kathryn chang had rescued pelletier was more closely involved with ballantine than i realized maybe theres more information in his own papers do you know whether theyre available to the public some place the idea that marc had found hidden documents brought real excitement to amys voice she couldnt wait to see these letters shed locate pelletiers papers at once while i waited for her to call back i kept rereading the letters taverner had told ballantine to talk to those of her own blood i winced at the phrase with all its implications about race and heredity but i also wondered who he had meant it could have been augustus llewellyn who certainly was involved in this drama on the other hand someone i didnt know about might have ratted out ballantine shed been involved in the federal negro theater project shed known every important black writer and artist of the midtwentieth centurytaverner could have been referring to shirley graham or richard wright or a host of other people it seemed ludicrous to imagine one of them denouncing her to huac but i couldnt imagine augustus llewellyn doing so either i stared at the photographed sheets until the words danced red in front of my eyes i finally put them down to do work for a paying client a tedious bit of tracking that id been putting off for a week while i was deep in the background of an old insurance transaction larry yosano the legal dogsbody called id forgotten phoning him yesterday and had to look at my notes before i could remember why larry youre on sensible hours this week yep that means i turn my phones off at ten pm so dont imagine you can call me if youre locked in or out of larchmont hall the junior whos covering this week is an aggressive young woman who is more likely to side with sheriff salvi than with you so watch your step i laughed larry your firm is the registered agent for llewellyn publishing how did that come about to my relief he didnt interrogate me on why i wanted to know just put me on hold while he looked at the back files calvin bayard secured llewellyns original loans back in the early fifties he referred mr llewellyn to us and weve been working for him ever since was there ever a time when bayards own finances were rocky i met edwards bayard yesterday and he was hinting that bayard publishing was on shaky ground during that same time mr edwards is bitter because of what mr arnoff told you on friday that mrs renee passed over him in distributing her shares who inherits them then he thought a minute i guess theres no real harm in your knowing they go to catherine bayard in trust until shes twentyfive prodded further he told me darraugh was the trustee jointly with the lebold arnoff firm and that the drummonds the taverners and mackenzie grahams father blair had all been among the original shareholders of bayard the bayard family held a thirtyone percent stake the drummonds taverners and grahams a thirtyfive percent total with the remainder divided among twentysome smaller shareholders so geraldine graham has a controlling interest in the firm now she inherited from her mother her father and her husband right yosano hesitated again but finally said actually she only holds her husbands five percent stake laura drummond was angry both with ms geraldine graham and with mr darraugh graham when she made her will she passed her shares on to ms grahams daugher ms van der cleef who lives in new york state laura drummond really was a nasty woman wasnt she so was it financial need that made ms graham sell larchmont no oh no she had a large fortune partly from her husbands estate but her father also settled substantial monies on her when she married no i thinkmrs drummond could be very spiteful especially where her daughter was concerned ms warshawski id be grateful if you kept this information to yourself of course i promised readily id keep it to myself unless it had something to do with marcus whitbys death that is amys return call came soon after id hung up pelletiers papers are right here beside me in the university of chicago library want me to go look at them i think ill come down myself i said its a fishing trip and i dont know what im fishing for from what i can tell online its a huge archive she said forty hollinger boxeswhat they call the special cartons made for documents you know i could help you sort through it if youre coming down now i looked at my calendar nothing on it until four when i had a meeting with a small corporation for which i ran background checks i told amy id be with her in twenty minutes chapter boy wonder hey boy wonder what meat cloth caesar feed on your child bride is an attractive little colt and your infatuation is understandable but until she grows up and learns how to read dont fob my work off on her if you dont like bleak land say so yourself getting a letter from the baby saying its not right for our list at this time is such an outsized insult im even willing to believe just barely mind you and only out of selfdelusionthat you didnt know your infant had written to me what i also will delude myself into believing is that you cant be as chickenshit as the rest of the industry afraid to touch me because the lesser apes in washington put me in the can for six months and had my books yanked from every embassy around the world me and dash no undersecretary of protocol in canberra is going to have his morals corrupted by the maltese falcon or a tale of two countries dash poor bastard is drinking himself into an early grave but i refuse to break so easily this was a carbon copy and therefore unsigned but the smudgy type sizzled as amy had said the pelletier archive was enormous she and i were facing each other across a table in the university of chicagos rare books room with boxes of papers and books between us when wed signed in the librarian said pelletier must suddenly be a hot itemwe were the second people asking to see the papers in the last month with the instincts of the born detective amy said yeah her cousin marcus always had been a jump ahead of her and the archivist agreed that marcus whitby had been looking at the boxes three weeks ago hed only come once the archivist said so whatever he wanted he found on his first trip we were lucky she added that mike goode their premier processing archivist had sorted and labeled the boxes even so we had a formidable hoard to inspect the collection was probably a lit crits dream come true but made for a detectives nightmare pelletier had kept everythingbills eviction notices menus from memorable dinners he thought highly enough of his historical importance that hed made carbons of most of his own letters most were like this one to calvin long fulminations against someone or something in the thirties and forties the correspondence was energetic if causticastute observations on personalities or public events as time passed though pelletier became more embittered and more embattled he wrote angrily to the new york times over the review they gave bleak land to the university of chicago for not keeping him on as a lecturer in the sixties to his landlord for raising his rent to the laundry for losing a shirt amy and i looked at each other in dismay what had marc found in this mass on his first pass through it the heraldstar had given pelletier a twocolumn obituary i read it for biographical information hed been born in lawndale on chicagos west side in gone to the university of chicago for a year volunteered to fight in france in and had come back to join the radical labor movements sweeping chicago and the country pelletier made no secret of having been a communist during the thirties and forties a tale of two countries was based on his fifteen months in spain during and where he fought with the abraham lincoln brigade during the spanish civil war supposedly it was filled with thinly disguised references to historical figures including scathing portraits of picasso and hemingway and it revealed the arguments about the war that took place in a communist party cell each member possibly a real person pelletier had known in his own chicago cell when called to testify in front of representative walker bushnell and the house unamerican activities committee the committee pressed pelletier hard to identify the characters in the book but he refused claiming that it was a work of fiction and spent six months in prison for contempt of congress afterward as a blacklisted writer he found it difficult to get his work published and wrote romances under the pen name rosemary burke he died thursday of pneumonia exacerbated by malnutrition at the age of seventyeight pelletier wrote one novel before a tale of two countries and two in the decade after all four were published to critical and commercial acclaim although the reviewers all agreed two countries was his masterwork after that thered been a gap of over ten years before he finished bleak land which he apparently had shamed calvin into buying since bayard published it in we found a carbon of another letter to calvin saying it wasnt surprising bayard had sold only eight hundred copies of bleak land since theyd refused to spend a nickel on promotion eight hundred people must have been stumbling around in the dark inner recesses of their local bookstores trying to avoid hangovers or tax collectors when they fell down and found themselves clutching a copy of bleak land on the way up what did olin do to you in that hearing room tell you hed lay off if youd forever foreswear the friends of your youth i rubbed my eyes this is more than a days work i almost wish pelletier had ratted to bushnell and tavernerid love to know who his communist cellmates were in the thirties does that have anything to do with marcs murder amy asked i dont know i said petulant but scanning the reviews i see two countries has an earnest young black photographer whos a homosexual malemaybe that was meant to be llewellyn theres a crowd of intellec tuals and worker wannabes from the universitykind of like the kids in sds back in the sixties it would be nice if hed provided a key amy grinned thats someones doctoral dissertation not the job of the great writer himself i read a tale of two countries for a lit class its beautifully written and more substantial than for whom the bell tolls but bleak land i think it didnt sell because it wasnt a good book maybe pelletier was too angry when he wrote it or maybe he was out of practice even before the blacklist hed stopped writing fiction and was doing a lot of work for hollywood did bleak land deal with things as autobiographically as two countries i mean would i learn anything about calvin and that group from reading it because pelletier only got to be friends with calvin after bayard publishing brought out two countries in such a big way you mean was it another roman a clef if bleak land is i wouldnt have known when i read it because i didnt know who any of the players were i guess i could check it out of the library and try to see now if i recognize any of them the librarian looked at us warningly other people were trying to read in the reading room we continued in silence for a time only stopping briefly to eat some oddlooking sandwiches out of a vending machine while we ate i told amy that the police were starting their own investigation into marcs death the bad news is they think he was killed by benjamin sadawi the kid in the larchmont attic so theyre not interested in following up on the ideas weve been generating but at least they say theyll do some digging on how marc got out to larchmont and theyve ordered a full autopsy from dr vishnikov vishnikov has ruled out any external blow or wound to marc before he went into that pond but hes mad at mehe thinks i blindsided him with the cops so he says he wont give me the tox screen results when those come in can you get harriet to request them as next of kin id be glad to supply my lawyer to run interference for her amy scribbled a note in her pocket diary and took freeman carters information from me harriets moving into my place tonight her folks are flying back to atlanta this afternoonthank the goddess we dusted the crumbs from our fingers and went back to the rare books room at two knowing i had to leave soon i stopped reading letters in detail and began flipping through the contents of the remaining cartons in the middle of a set of manuscripts i found a manila folder labeled total eclipse unfinished unpublished ms pp it was typed on yellowing paper with pelletiers handwritten notes in the margins the writing itself was shaky this must have been written at the end of his life when he was often drunk or ill or both they want us to think that when lazarus rose from the dead his friends and sisters were beside themselves with joy but inside the grief when he was buried were the secret thoughts thank god we got him safely underground revolting drunkard couldnt keep his hands to himself thank god he wont live to tell a soul about that night in jericho when he caught me with my mothers maid behind the sheepfold no more scurrying when we hear him coming in late from tavern or tussle demanding hot food and wanting it now and then he rose again and behind the joy saw his loved ones thoughts writ large we were just settling down with the new shape to our lives minus his sharp words and demands and here he is raised from the dead i know i was dead and now that ive slunk out of the grave into a corner of the basement trailing my winding sheets i can smell the stink of fear rising from my dear ones although maybe its just the stink of my own rotting flesh gene who is the most terrified predictably wept loudest at my grave the baby the darling he used to tag after me when he was five let me play herman show me how herman following me from sandlot ball to taverns crossed out bar written in by hand and then to girls i should have known from the way he watched me but that was when he was still my eager golden brother the one i teased and gave a little careless attention to i was the hero back from the war a hero in some places anyway with my arm in an interesting sling and my eyes dazed from too much blood so much blood that i couldnt drink it away a hero to my golden brother whod spent my war years getting rich i was fighting he was taking over the family firm no george bailey role for gene nossir no gene had a truly wonderful life big brother risking his life on the ebro little brother minting the stuff in buckets turning a sleepy family business into an international power so that when i came back although the girls clustered round to hear my battle stories they slipped out the side door with gene he was renting the apartment on elm street in those days just the place to take the girls where mother couldnt see and then come home for church on sunday hair slicked back bending solicitously over her butter not melting in his mouth we hung out at goldies it was just one of those west loop bars guys heading home for work stopped for a quick one listened to the racing results or a late ball game we used to go after a meeting toffee noble all excited about his basement magazine he sometimes came with lulu who painted outsized canvases of african ritual dances he also hung out with edna deerpath the tiny black whirlwind who represented the hotel laundry workers in their bloody battles against the mob toffee never joined in anyones battles just smirked from the sidelines mr cool then went home and wrote us all up in stories he cranked out on his basement press we never knew whether he held one of those pasteboard squares the pass to the inner circle or not some said he was too chicken to join others that he was too chicken to admit he traveled all the way we were all brothers then or brothers and sisters even gene my blood brother although everyone knew he only came to meet girls we used to tease him you think youre the good capitalist the one who wont be hanged from the lamppost just because you like red nookie i was the grand old man being five or six years older than everyone but lulu and the only one whod ever been shot at for being redalthough edna and lulu had ducked their share of stones for being black goldie herself didnt care if you were black or white or red as long as your folding paper was green and she set the tone everyone at goldies took you as you were so of course it was a place where rich girls came because rich girls gravitate to poor men when they want a little kick on the side and one of those was rhona id met plenty of rhonas before or thought i had rich girls with too much money and too little to do when theyve tried dope and skiing and race cars then they dabble a little in politics a little in communism because its daring and exciting in the powder room at the drake the next day oh darling i went to this hovel on the west side can you believe people live in two rooms there wasnt even a closet i had to hang my balenciaga on a nail and a shared bathroom halfway down the hall and theyre all so earnest comrade this and that but herman fixes me with those black eyes and i feel actually pinned to my chair a wet puddle i cant get up or everyone will know and its all so exciting because the government could raid us at any second i brought him to oakdale and mother never guessed she would have turned fifteen shades of red herself oakdale larchmont hall coverdale lane the name seemed deliber ate i looked at my watch and tried to read faster rhona with her silk teddy and painted nails became enthusiastic about communism but was terrified of being discovered by her family she would type fliers in hermans kedvale avenue apartmentwearing nothing but her rose teddy to hermans intense satisfaction then put on overalls and a blond wig to march on picket lines or to leaflet commuters she and herman made love in the afternoons on his unwashed sheets the sheets were gray from too little soap a girl like rhona she might type or run a mimeograph machine but she stood baffled in front of the washing machine in the basement teased by thirteenyearold girls whod been turning a mangle since they were five i didnt get to the laundry more than once a month so the sheets came to smell like rhona and like sex a little joy by patou a little joy by herman cute i muttered showing the paragraph to amy couldnt he operate a mangle himself dont get so exercised its only a novel and anyway the guy is dead and for heavens sake dont mark on it shamefaced i put my pencil down and turned back to pelletiers words i loved leaving my own scent on her she was too fastidious to wash in the communal bathroom rich little communist girl and when id licked her nipples into red cherries against her whipped cream body id ask what ken would think when she raced home to undress and bathe wont he lean over you and wonder who or what hes smelling over the bath salts at first she would laugh it away but one day she explained the sad truth that ken was impotent that hed long since stopped leaning over her in the bath or bed or any other place it was dryden who said that pity melts the mind to love and maybe thats when i started to love her when i started to pity her maybe if shed whined about it the first time she unbuttoned her white silk blouse i only fuck strange men because my husbands impotent i would have despised her but it was four months before i learned the truth and then she never mentioned it again and gene who never missed anything saw the pity and the love and began coming to the apartment where he pantomimed dismay at the rat droppings in the hall and uncurtained cracked windows in the front room but it didnt stop him hanging about after meetings i can run rhona home and come back to finish discussing business with you herman do you need a buck for the laundry those sheets are going to get up and walk off that bed on their own pretty soon disgust didnt keep him from lying in those sheets it was the day after id found her there with him the day i beat her long red fingers on the whipped cream skin red fingers from her red lover red fingers turning to blue blue blood of the master class it would rule her in the end the day she left and didnt come back the day i started to die the next twenty pages dealt with his dying every man imagines hes jesus or at least trotsky important enough for execution thats what i thought for the first five years i lay in the ground finally i realized selfpity and booze were what really did me in he compared himself to lulu she was in the same boat as me unloved unwanted but she didnt turn her face to the wall instead she turned her back on all of us went to africa painted her giant canvases whether anyone bought them or not if pelletiers works were allwhat had been amys phrase a something of claylulu definitely stood in for kylie ballantine kylie continued her work she went to gabon she refused to be bowed down by taverners spite in getting her fired and gene stood for calvin the boy wonder and rhona and ken mackenzie graham hed been impotent so geraldine turned elsewhere for love was that what she meant when she said she and mackenzie had so little in common i drew circles on my notepaper edwards bayard had overheard talk as an adolescent about someone who looked just like his mother and so didnt seem to realize who his father was adolescent selfabsorption a fantasy yearning for the perfect father made edwards assume the neighbors were gossiping about him and then his hurt and bitterness with calvin kept him clinging to this adolescent version of events funny to see someone with so much education and with the power of his personal wealth and his position in the spadona foundation unable to let go of his adolescent view of the world i listed all the bayards in one of the circles id drawn in another i put darraughs family starting with laura taverner drummond then geraldine and mackenzie whose father connived with laura to marry the two wild children their daughter laura named after the formidable grandmother darraugh born in darraughs son young mackenzie i slowly added a line joining the grahams to the bayards darraugh looked exactly like his mother everyone said geraldine graham had been a wild young woman in his current illness calvin bayard wandered to larchmont in the dark he had kept a key to the house he had clutched me crying deenie geraldeeme she had spilled coffee all over herself when i reported it whatever pelletier had thought about calvin the boy wonder calvin had loved geraldine graham i again imagined darraugh as a boynot galloping around the fields on his horse but kneeling in bed in the middle of the night head cupped in his hands watching calvin bayard appear through the woods and let himself into larchmont after the servants had locked the place up he had stood up fiercely for mackenzie graham he had weathered his grandmothers fury by naming his son mackenzie whether calvin bayard mackenzie graham or for that matter armand pelletier had been his birth father mackenzie was the man darraugh loved no wonder he hated larchmont hall chapter the ice cube man cometh i skimmed the rest of the manuscript armands sense of personal grievance ran too deep for him to record a little thing like rhonas pregnancy so he didnt leave any hint about whether he or calvin might have been darraughs father on the other hand he heaped a lot of scorn on toffee noblean offensive name for anyone even someone totally imaginary if noble was supposed to be augustus llewellynand it sounded like him with his basement printing presspelletier must have really hated him llewellyn was a prominent republican donor these days but in the forties hed hung out with calvin and pelletier and kylie ballantine at the bar where lodal leftists and labor organizers congregated marc had read this manuscript what if hed gone to see llewellyn after all im troubled sir by a manuscript armand pelletier wrote it suggests you were some kind of fellow traveler in the forties maybe llewellyn wouldnt want hisrepublican pals or his sailing friends to know this if hed asked marc to meet him after hourscome with me to new solway ill show you what that setup what those people were really likemarc would have gone with him readily llewellyn did know all those new solway people after all he was the one black member of the anodyne park golf course julius arnoff was his registered agent as well as geraldine grahams and calvin bayardsin his casual gossip with his clients arnoff had probably told llewellyn about the nounous abandoning larchmont hall what a shame its standing emptythe ornamental pool is filling up with dead carp vi wake upyouve gone catatonic on me amy was shaking my arm didnt you say you had an appointment at four its threeforty and youve been blanked out for the last ten minutes i blinked at her trying to feel some urgency about my appointment twenty to four yes i guess i need to get going i started to put the manuscript into my briefcase but remembered it was the librarys a second before amy squawked at me sorry look theyll be closing the reading room in an hour do you think you could read this by then or get a copy made if its a thingamajig a clay something roman a clef amy interrupted spelling it for me a novel with a key i can read it and tell you what i think and get a copy made but its still a novel even if its a novel with a key and i dont think you can rely on it for evidence the librarian came over to ask if we would carry on our conversation outside other patrons were complaining about our noise amy walked out with me not as evidence i said but come on the article on comthought you found said it started at an integrated bar on the west side called floras where leftleaning intellectuals and labor organizers met pelletiers manuscript talks about a west side bar called goldies where artists and labor organizers met this manuscript casts light on all these people even if armand is distorting what happened for the sake of his story or because he saw himself as a victim at calvins hands or even at augustus llewellyns the manuscript suggests that llewellyn and ballantine and geraldine all hung out together with pelletier and calvin bayard back before the mccarthy hearings they all dabbled in communism which might be the secret taverner sat on for fifty years although it doesnt explain why taverner kept quiet until the night marc came to see him i kicked a stone in irritation damn it all id better run look just read the thing will youill call you tonight yeah ill read the blessed book and ill make you a copy of it now go unless these are clients you want to blow off amy gave me a push between my shoulder blades i sprinted past the dorms stuffed behind the library to fiftyfifth street where id left my car my clients were in the west loop on wacker drive which the city had completely dismembered by the time i found parking and ran back to their building i was over twenty minutes late not good for my professional image worse i had forgotten to put a pen in my bag and had to borrow one from the client worse still i had trouble keeping my mind on their problem which wasnt fair since they pay their bills on time as i was looking at my notes in the elevator down to the ground floor i saw to my embarrassment that id written toffee noble on my legal pad three or four times like a schoolgirl with a crush the reports id read on llewellyn said he still came to work every dayunless he was in jamaica or paris i looked at my watch it was fivethirty and the lobby was thick with departing office workers but i was only a ten minute walk across the river from llewellyns building and it was possible that he stayed late i stuffed my notes into my bag and started north when i got to erie street my optimism was rewarded a navy bentley with a license reading tsquare was parked in front of the building a uniformed chauffeur sat inside with the suntimes propped open on the steering wheel that meant the great man was still in his office as id trotted up franklin street i tried to figure out how to get past the hostile receptionist in the lobby it was one thing to crawl through a culvert to get into anodyne park but more difficult to get into an office building where they dont want to see you i still hadnt come up with a good idea when i saw jason tompkin about half a block away on erie i broke into a run again when i caught up with him at the light on wells i tapped him on the arm and called his name he turned brows raised then gave his cocky grin the lady detective well well have you come to arrest me for killing marc did you kill him that would be a help i could stop trying to ask people questions that they dont want to answer i think a gal like you would develop a pretty thick skin by now no one wants to answer a dicks questions not even me the grin was still in place but it pushed me back as effectively as a stiff arm yeah well even a rhinoceros starts showing wear and tear if its hit by enough big sticks i dont imagine you killed marc whitby but maybe ive been barking up the wrong tree all week maybe you got tired of his ambition and his standoffishness got him drunk and drove him to a pond to drown him he stopped smiling i didnt kill the brother i just didnt join in the choir of the blessed shouting hallelujah every time someone said his name if you do me a favor i wont ask you any more questions or even expect you to shout hallelujah over marcs name i want to see mr llewellyn without having to sweettalk my way past your receptionistshes one of the people whos whacked at my rhino hide recently ah yes the dulcet shantel i cant get you in to mr llewellyn he knows all his staff of course because he owns us and anyway its not like were time inc at the christmas party or in the elevator when our paths cross he greets me by name he says how are you today mr thompson that was a nice piece you did for the last issue a very fine piece of writing indeed one year he called me mr pumpkin i laughed ill take my chances once im in the building if he hasnt left for the day and in return if you lose your dog ill find it for you no charge dang you mustve known i have a cat he turned around and led me back to the llewellyn building the chauffeur was still reading the suntimes a good sign since it meant he didnt expect to see the boss for a bit inside the lobby the hostile receptionist was gone replaced by a uniformed guard who asked for my id but didnt make any objection to jt taking me up in the elevator after all the place published magazines writers are always bringing in people to interview on the sixth floor i got jt to let me use his computer to type up a note for llewellyn do you know that marcus whitby tried to see you before he died he had read armand pelletiers unpublished memoirs about the group that used to get together at floras on the west side he went to see olin taverner after he read the memoir the forties must have been heady days for you can we discuss them jt kept shifting from foot to foot as we waited for my note to come out of the community printer he quickly deleted my file from his machine told me llewellyns office was on the eighth floor and fled down the hall while i was stapling a business card to my note by the time i reached the elevator bank jt had disappeared when the elevator opened on the eighth floor a woman about my own age was standing on the other side age was all that we had in common the makeup on her cinammon skin was fresh but subtle her hair was perfectly combed her nails recently manicured the wool in her rustcolored suit was that smooth soft weave that doesnt make it into the stores where people like me shop she looked me up and down as if she could see the tear in the lining of my own jacket before asking if i needed help im here to see mr augustus llewellyn and you have an appointment i know youre not his secretary and this is a confidential matter the name of the daughter who ran llewellyns two womens magazines came to me i suppose youre ms janice llewellyn she didnt smile back mr llewellyn is leaving for the day if you dont have an appointment and you want totalk to him you can call his secretary in the morning just at that minute a door at the end of the hall opened and llewellyn came out in person accompanied by a couple of young men and an older woman janice called out daddy go back into your office for a minute why dont you im going to get this person out of the building in the second that everyone stood frozen trying to absorb the situation at the elevator i walked up the hall and handed llewellyn my note he took it reflexively but the two young men formed a barrier between him and me and ushered him back into his executive offices along with the older woman as soon as they had the old man safely inside one of the young men reappeared and joined janice and me by the elevators he seized my arm and said to janice you go in with daddy and call down to ricky in the lobby ill get her out of the building he had the stocky build of a middle linebacker i knew i couldnt really fight him but i never like being grabbed and i was tired of being stiffed and pushed around by everyone i wanted to talk to i moved into the circle of his arm and elbowed him sharply in the ribs he cried out and dropped my arm ill leave if your daddy doesnt want to see me i said moving away from him but you dont need to help me janice had her cell phone out she was starting a firm conversation with the lobby guard demanding to know how i had come to be in the building without permission when the door to the executive offices opened again the other brother appeared in a voice overflowing with astonishment and indignation he announced that daddy wanted to talk to me janice and her brother glared at me but daddys wishes took precedence over their bruised egos or rib cages as the case might be janices plucked brows met briefly over her nose but she kept from wrinkling her forehead it pays to work for a womans magazineyou learn good tips on how to preserve your face she put her cell phone into the side compartment of her briefcase and told me to follow her her brother stayed in step next to me when we got to the executive suite the other brother took me into his fathers office augustus llewellyn was sitting behind his desk a leatherinlaid partners specimen that might have been a couple of hundred years old there were a number of interesting antiques in the room besides the desk but the one that caught my eye was an old hand press standing on an octagonal table i walked over to look at it good evening sir is that what you used to print tsquare on llewellyn ignored me turning to his children and telling them they could leave when the son id elbowed protested that i might be violent his father managed a small smile if she harms me youll know exactly who did it and you can have her arrested but for now i want to be alone with her and that means you too marjorie the last remark was addressed to the older woman who i assumed was the secretary id spoken to the day before when all four had left i pulled up one of the two contemporary chairs in the room and faced llewellyn across his desk he folded his hands in his lap but didnt speak im the detective whom the whitby family he cut me off i know that you and your underlings have been questioning my staff recently young woman not much happens in this company that i dont know about then you know that marcus whitby wanted to see you shortly before he died did he talk to you about his meeting with olin taverner if he did that would be of no concern to you you agreed to see me mr llewellyn i said gently i think if you knew what taverner had told whitby you wouldnt need to talk to me so im assuming you didnt see marc whitby before he died he nodded slightly but didnt offer any comment olin taverner held on to a secret or maybe a series of secrets about people in new solway and people involved in comthoughtthe committee for social yes i know what comthought is or was he cut me off again and i know taverner was obsessed with it as a communist front i dont think they were ever the threat to americas safety that olin claimed but i had my fill of the left at floras all those years ago they were a ramshackle lot who turned on each other like rats in a proverbial barrel they had no real interest in the working man or woman only in their stupid revolutionary rhetoric america rewards selfdetermination they could never see that pelletier says you sat in on the committees beginnings at floras i spoke flatly as if what i were saying were undisputed truth not my own unverifiable guesses you say this is an unpublished manuscript llewellyn tapped my note with his index finger how did you come to read it the same way marc whitby didby going through pelletiers papers at the university of chicago it sounds as though floras was an exciting placemeatpackers and novelists rubbing shoulders with dancers and journalists a miniature greenwich village on the near west side calvin bayard dropped in from time to time so you got to know him and ultimately he guaranteed the loans that allowed you to abandon that hand press over there and move to real machines what did you have to do in return mr llewellyn i fail to see how that concerns you young woman did he ask you to make a contribution to comthoughts legal defense fund and if so why should that be a secret again this is no concern of yours you come in here with tales of armand pelletier and miss ballantine but you were hired i believe to find marcus whitbys killer and if im not mistaken mr whitby died last week not in i smiled evilly he died because of what hed learned about about the relations among you and calvin bayard and armand pelletier im tracking those down his pressed his lips together in a tight angry line but said armand pelletier made calvins fortune not that book alone that famous tale of two countries but he got calvin the entree to the kind of authors bayard publishing needed if calvin was going to turn a stodgy family firm into a success if pelletier was enthusiastic about something calvin was bound to be there too i never knew if calvin was protecting his investment in pelletier or if he really was the eager puppy dog he acted around pelletier after all armand had been shot in spainthat counted for a lot in the crowd they hung out with i was a young and earnest journalist pelletier thought he could patronize me calvin tagged along i paid back those loans if youve dug enough dirt to find that calvin secured them you know that i repaid them yes sir but mr bayard exacted a quid pro quo which startled even some of the starchy old ladies in new solway who didnt share his enthusiasm for your enterprise and if he did you think i should tell you his voice was level but a pulse throbbed in his temple ill find it out i said geraldine grahamdo you remember her from those days at florasmay make up her mind to speak or ill find out from renee bayard orsomeone else people like to talk and when they get old they get to be like olin tavernerthey dont want their secrets to die with them a corner of his mouth lifted into a sneer oh i remember geraldine graham she was like so many rich white girls of the forties and the fifties and the current age hot bored things who look for the secret thrill the black man can provide in her case it was the red man the communist man but the spice of feeling the sweat of black workers gave it an added zest for her if she decides to talk to you about those days i will be very surprised every generation likes to think it was the first to discover sex ms graham might enjoy reminding the rest of us thatshe got there ahead of us if pelletier can be believed she was sleeping first with him then with calvin bayard meanwhile you brought kylie ballantine to floras bar where she met pelletier and bayard and all those other people i was embroidering recklessly both on pelletiers manuscript and on the hints id picked up from geraldine graham so when they decided to hold a fundraiser for comthoughts legal defense fund you all went up to eagle river together he said coldly its not unusual for a journalist to write up a political fundraiser especially when its an unusual political group pelletier wrote that you were a fellow traveler back in the forties im sure that interested bushnells committee no end pelletier wrote a lot of crap in his later years he was a drunk and bitter man i didnt worry about it then and i wont lose sleep over it now you wouldnt mind if the republican national committee found out youd been communist or at least a communist sympathizer he gave a derisive snort my fellow republicans include many repentant former leftists as a black man i already command unusual attention in the party if i confessed to communism it would only add to my luster so it didnt bother you that marc whitby learned youd been at the comthought fundraiser would you mind the world knowing it was you who sent olin taverner a photograph from that same event that cost kylie ballantine her job thats a damned lie in fury his voice rose to a shout whether armand wrote that or not ill see anyone who spreads that rumor destroyed in the courts and damned in hell or pushed into larchmonts pond to drown he stood if that means what i think it does my lawyers will talk to you about a slander suit young woman slander is slippery in court i said marts notes would be part of my defense which means the accusations would come into the public domain i was hoping hed say what notes i destroyed all his notes but instead he said marc couldnt have any notes about him sending kylies picture to olin because he hadnt done so taverner wrote a letter to kylie ballantine she discussed it in a letter of her own to pelletier i took the photocopy from my bag and showed it to him see where she says taverner told her not to blame him and bushnell but to talk to those of her own blood if he didnt mean you who did he mean the hotel workers an ugly smile creased llewellyns face even if i knew youre not the person id tell you will do well to inform the whitby family that the tragedy of their sons death is one of those many murders of young black men that will never be resolved let them go home to atlanta let them grieve decently and move forward with their lives get your stick out of that old pond youre stirring the stench from the rot on the bottom could rise up and choke you the interview was clearly over chapter hamster on a wheel llewellyns children were waiting outside their fathers office when i emerged the sons hustled me into an elevator which theyd kept waiting then muscled me outside with more force than the situation really warranted they watched until i turned the corner onto franklin the sky was dark the area restaurants and nightspots were just starting to fill up i passed knots of eagerly chattering thirtysomethings on their way to jazz bars and dinner was there a geraldine among them escaping from an impotent husband and an overbearing mother into the citys nightlife or an armand pelletier brilliant impetuous trying to organize them all to act i walked slowly hunched over my hands in my pockets llewellyn was yet another player from that old new solway team with old secrets to keep he said he didnt care if people thought hed been a communist but that could be a sophisticated bluff its always the best strategy to scoff at threats not to cower before them what made him furious was the suggestion that hed cost kylie her career if marc thought hed found evidence proving llewellyn had betrayed her to olin taverner maybe llewellyn would have silenced his star reporter those muscular sons of his werestrong enough to carry someone from his car to a pond and hold him under until he drowned to death and they would pretty much do whatever their daddy wanted the merchandise mart loomed in front of me its mass ominous in the dark i skirted it to wells street when i reached the river i didnt cross over but walked east alongside it picking my way through construction rubble passing homeless men in makeshift shelters who froze at my passing rats skittered across my path the walkway narrowed and the concrete bank on my left grew steeper struts for the bridges loomed over me between the fathomless black of the water and the iron towering above me i felt small and fragile a chill wind cut down the river from the lake i pulled my torn jacket tightly across my chest and plodded ahead i needed benjamin sadawi to reveal what hed seen from the attic last sunday night he was afraid to tell me or father lou but there was one person he would talk to catherine bayard it might be hard to persuade her to dig the information out of him but i couldnt see any other road to pursue she was supposed to come home from the hospital today maybe renee would let me into the apartment to talk to her i took out my cell phone but the ironwork around me blocked the signal when i reached michigan avenue i climbed the two flights of stairs to the street i blinked as the lights of the night city hit me suddenly instead of the solitary rustling of rats or homeless men and women i was in the middle of crowds tourists students taking night classes at a nearby university people shopping on their way home from work swarmed around me a mass of buses and cars crept up the avenue honking irritably at each other i picked my way along the street until i came to a hotel where the glass wall would block enough noise to let me use my phone i pulled open my palmpilot to get the bayard apartment number when i suddenly realized i hadnt called mr contreras when i reached him my neighbor had already been on the phone to freeman carter to warn him that id disappeared the old mans relief at hearing from me slid rapidly into a prolonged scolding i cut him short so i could get to freeman carter before he spent billable hours trying to find me in a holding cell it was seventhirty freeman was at home im glad youre still at large vic your neighbor has been anxious enough to phone me three times for gods sake if youre not in trouble remember to check in with him on timeonce he starts he goes on for a year or two before he stops yeah sorry i was in a meeting with augustus llewellyn trying to figure out what all these rich important people did fifty years ago that they dont want anyone to know about today while ive got you on the phone did harriet whitby talk to you about getting her brothers tox screen from the county the tox screen right callie told me it came in just as we were shutting down for the day neither of us have read it but ill have her messenger over a copy first thing in the morning im going to dinner good night people kept hanging up on me abruptly or shoving me out of their homes and offices as if talking to me wasnt the pleasure it should be even lotty and morrell who should have been here to hold me close and tell me i was a good detective and a good person where was he as if to underscore that i was a pariah these days a concierge came over and asked if i was waiting for someone in the hotel if not could i go elsewhere to use my phone rage rose in meuseless since i had no choice except to leave on my way through the revolving door i caught sight of myself in a lobby mirror my face was haggard from lack of sleep my hair wild from running across the loop this afternoon no wonder the concierge wanted me to leave and no wonder janice llewellyns first instinct had been to send for the guardi looked more like the people in the shanties underneath the avenue than those passing me on top of it now i felt more like them too confused tired cold my tired brain went round and round like a hamster on a wheel at the top yes it was clear that whitby had been killed at the bottom no hed gone into the pond on his own how had whitby why wouldnt benji why had llewellyn said why had darraugh renee bayard i was too tired to make decisions too tired to do anything but doggedly plow in the direction id already started under the dim bulb of a streetlight i picked the bayards apartment number out of my paimpilot and typed it into my cell phone yes elsbetta told me miss catherine had come home today but she was resting now and couldnt be disturbed could i call back later this evening no mrs renee had given strict orders a request for mrs renee brought the wabash cannonball to the phone she wanted to know if i had located the missing egyptian boy if i hadnt there wasnt much point in our talking and no i couldnt see catherine i had caused enough disturbance in her granddaughters life she didnt want me bothering her again im not the one who summoned sheriff salvi to larchmont hall friday night i said i was just a bystander remember caught in the crossfire you were generating youre hardly a bystander ms warshawski id call you more of an instigator thanks to you i had an offensive call from geraldine graham and i just got off the phone with augustus llewellyn who says you all but accused him of orchestrating his own journalists death shivering under a streetlamp wasnt the best way to carry on this conversation did he now thats quite telling all the old crowd from floras rallying around what i really wanted to know is why it was such a shameful thing to give money to comthoughts legal defense fund that neither llewellyn nor ms graham will discuss it i gather your husband persuaded them to make their donations why should they be afraid to tell me taverner and bushnells most despicable legacy was to make people afraid to acknowledge they had ever supported progressive causes even successful rich people or perhaps most especially successful rich people augustus actually wanted to know what i had told you about comthought i had to remind him all that happened while i was still in high school the torn muscle in my shoulder began to ache from cold did you know that armand pelletier left an unpublished manuscript in his papers describing where comthought met and who took part in the discussions according to him mr bayard was prominently involved in those conversations at florasi thought he might have told you about it especially since you were helping him when he was facing down bushnells interrogation armand was a sad case a gifted man who frittered away his talents on drink and on blaming others for his problems he never forgave calvin for the poor sales of his book bleak land and he never forgave me for suggesting to calvin that we not publish it armand had served prison time for his beliefs and calvin felt we owed it to him to help him out my husband tried to help a number of the comthought people in ways like that to show olin and walker bushnell he didnt care about their vulgar blacklist thats quite different from being the driving force behind an avowedly communist group which olin and congressman bushnell hoped to pin on calvin i wouldnt pay much attention to armands unpublished manuscripts he was a bitter man with an ax to grind all of that past is long dead i think its time for you to leave it to bury itself is that why ms graham called you to complain that i was resurrecting the past renee paused briefly i dont know which of the two of you is more intrusive she wanted to inquire after calvins health as if i didnt know how to care for him an impertinence i wouldnt have received if you hadnt first invaded my privacy in new solway and then discussed mr bayard with geraldine unless you have something useful to contribute ms warshawski dont bother my family further you may not be an instigator but youre certainly not a bystander you generate turmoil when she cut the connection i had an impulse to run up to banks street and hurl a bazooka rocket through her window something that would make an explosion big enough to match my impotent fury instead i stomped over to michigan and flagged a taxi to my car where i found yet another ticket one more and id get booted i kicked a piece of concrete savagely enough to hurt my toes damn it all anyway at home soaking in a hot bath i tried to make sense of all the conversations id had today taverners secret was about sex the complicated relations among calvin and geraldine mackenzie graham and laura drummond but it was also about money there was the money geraldine had given calvins pet charity presumably the committee for social thoughts legal fund and the money calvin had loaned llewellyn sex and money they led to murder in the heat of the moment but the heat from these moments surely had cooled in the last fifty years still something about that past was upsetting people so much they kept menacing me darraugh called it quicksand llewellyn a pond filled with some kind of rot darraugh himself had threatened me when he realized what information i was starting to dig up even though he was the one who brought me out to new solway in the first place he was strong too strong enough to overpower marcus whitby but he was the person whod brought me to new solway to begin with the hamster wheel began buzzing in my brain again i ran more hot water into the tub and sank deeper into it my shoulder started to relax my bones warmed up i drifted away from whitby and turmoil my birthday last july lake michigan warmer than this bathwater lying on an indiana beach under the summer stars the night air and morrells long fingers caressing me the shrill bell to my front door jerked me awake i sat up splashing water onto the floor when the bell sounded a second time i climbed out of the tub and padded to the front room wrapping a bath sheet around me it wasnt cops but a trio of boys on bikes doing wheelies on the walk pranksters my lips tightened in annoyance i walked back to my bedroom to dress but when they rang for the third time i suddenly remembered that father lou had said he would send messages by his kids on bikes be right with you i shouted through the intercom i dried off fast pulled on jeans and a heavy sweater tucked my damp hair into a baseball cap and skittered down the stairs mr contreras and the dogs were already in the lobby arguing with the boys who were backing away from mitchby far the most vociferous of the group s okay ive got it i pushed past them out the front door one of the boys came forward striking a determinedly aggressive posture you the detective lady yep you the guy from st remigio he nodded eyes slits detective on a mission father lou said to tell you you wasnt alone when you came to church this morning got it is that all he said did he want me to call i demanded uh yeah yeah you should try to call him mechanically i thanked the boys i gave them a five to share among themselves and went back into the building what was that about mr contreras demanded you shouldnt give punks like that money only encourages them to come around begging for more i shook my head theyre from father lou someone followed me to church this morning somehow some way butdamn i made sure i was clear i have to call him see whether the feds got benji i sprinted back up the stairs the dogs racing ahead of me while the old man followed more ponderously in the rear by the time he got to my door i had on my running shoes and a coat mr contreras offered to let me use his phone but i couldnt be sure that wasnt tappedif they were listening to me they would know to listen in on him too the nearest pay phone i could think of was in the belmont diner a couple of blocks south of us us i ran down there and called the rectory no one was on my tail this morning i triplechecked i said when the priest finally answered his phone what happened had a federal marshal and a chicago cop here this afternoon they asked after youtold them youre one of my parishioners dont come often enough he let out a rusty chuckle im never sure whether he harbors secret fantasies of converting me they also thought i was hiding some runaway they want told them to be my guest search the place but its a big church took them the better part of two hours got me behind in catechism and boxing classes both did they find anyone i asked boys playing hideandseek behind the altar was all thinking it was a good joke to jump out on a cop gave them what for when i found them but if youre bringing cops into the church youd better find someplace else to worshiptoo disruptive of education here meaning if i understood him right that hed put benji in the crypt which lies behind the altar but that id better move him in case the feds came again is this something i have to figure out tonight i asked you know i dont go to church very often dont have a second one right at my fingertips he grunted can wait until tomorrow maybe the next day not much longer the feds might have gone to st remigios because theyd done so much research on me that they knew father lou was a friend of mine and morrells ortheyd installed an electronic gadget on my car so they could follow me without putting manpower on the street my stomach turned over i tried to remember if id gone anywhere else incriminating the last few days the hospital the university library back up to the loop then home maybe agents would next be down at the university of chicago demanding to know what id read today under the patriot act they didnt need a warrant or probable cause to make the library tell them but if the librarians told me the feds had come around the librarians would go to jail so id never knowunless of course pelletiers archives disappeared id been tired all day but now i felt completely exhausted it was what id tried to tell lotty last night i didnt know who frightened the more these days radical muslims or radical americans i hadnt eaten dinner and i certainly didnt have the energy to cook for myself i went inside the diner and took a seat at the counter the diner is a gallant survivor from the days when lakeview was a bluecollar neighborhood from when mr contreras and i had bought shares in our coop now its become a neighborhood we can barely afford the diner has changed tooi guess it had to in order to survive the formica tables are gone and the chickenfried steak replaced by polyurethaned wood and grilled salmon i didnt want modern trendy food tonight but they still had some old diner standbys on the menu i ordered a plate of macaroni and cheese it wasnt anything like what my mother used to make with her handrolled pasta and homemade white sauce but it was comfort food nonetheless while i drank a cup of weak diner coffee i tried to imagine where i could put benji i couldnt bring him home either to me or mr contreras i certainly couldnt ask lotty or max to put him up i hardly knew amy blount and anyway she lived in a studio apartment if i could get in to see catherine bayard in the morning id see whether she had some fallback place maybe the family apartment in hong kong or london no that would mean getting him out of the country past a security screen i gave up on it and went home to bed chapter tough on a rhino hide when i woke the sun was out for the first time in days perhaps that was an omen i had slept for nine hours deeply hardly stirring despite the anxieties id taken to bed with me another good sign i dressed for the day in jeans and running shoes since the cops had trailed me to st remigios i was going to leave my car at my office i wanted to be able to move fast through the city the dogs got the shortest of walks i left them with mr contreras then drove to my office where i went inside just long enoughto check my messages no tox report no messages that couldnt wait i put a fresh battery pack in my cell phone and took off on my way to the el i turned abruptly into a bakery then stuck my head out the door no one had halted on the walk behind me i bought a ginger scone and a bottle of orange juice picked up the morning papers and hurried to the train the detectives life is harder on public transport the train was so packed i had to stand i couldnt eat or read and when i got out i was still two miles from my destination since the line to the gold coast is different from the one near my office at division i flagged a cab to the corner of banks and astor when i got out a young woman swung into the backseat before i finished payingit was eightten the time when aggressive young lawyers and financiers race to their desks i crossed the street to where i could see the bayard apartment with the heraldstar in front of my face i called up and asked for renee she was still inside i hung up just as she came to the phone i made a little eyehole in the heraldstar while i ate my scone i watched nannies and mothers hurry their children to school i also got to see a ferocious competition for cabs among the workboundincluding a shoving match between two women the one i was silently betting on lost renee bayard could probably have won a battle for a taxi but she didnt have to fight a dark sedan was waiting in front of the banks street apartment at eightfortyeight the driver climbed out and stood by the rear door at eightfifty renee came through the front gate a commanding figure in navy wool her son was with her the driver tucked renee into the backseat but edwards walked over to state street and headed north he could be going anywhere but the vina fields academy lay in that direction if he was going to pick up books or lesson plans for catherine elsbetta would know about it and i couldnt use that as my pretext for getting into the building i bit my lip in indecision but finally crossed the street and rang the lower apartments starting with the first floor no one answered there the second floor hung up on me but the third floor buzzed me in as soon as i said i was from the vina fields academy they buzzed me again through the inner door just to minimize suspicions in the building i rode to the third floor said i was there for catherine bayard and was directed to five so far so good on the fifth floor the entrance to the bayard apartment stood openthey assumed the locks on the gate and lobby doors were enough protection i shook my head disapprovingly this is how ax murderers get into your home i slipped into the entry area pausing to admire a louise nevelson bronze before passing through the arched doorway that led to the interior i tried to remember how to find catherines room the path to renees study lay to the left i thought catherines bedroom was in the opposite direction as i walked down the hall a vacuum cleaner roared into life i jumped but moved boldly forward a furtive glance showed me a cleaning crew in action elsbetta stood with her back to me barking orders in polish excellent at the end of the hall i came to catherines room the door was shut i gave a perfunctory knock and went in the bedroom was empty but an open door on the near wall led to a bathroom when i peered around the door i saw catherine in front of a dressing table trying to button a mans shirt with one hand her dark hair fell unbraided down her back she didnt look around at my entrance but kept stubbornly trying to manage the buttons its easier if you dont watch in the mirror i said she turned startled oh its you i thought it was elsbetta why are you here is benji okay i pulled up a chair to face her i saw him yesterday he seemed fine he asked after you but there are a couple of problems her eyes grew dark with dismay like what like the chicago cops showed up late yesterday to look for him apparently because id been there so we need i thought you were a detective her voice was scornful dont you know to watch for tails check for tails now you tell me gosh i slapped my forehead listen you little mutt i drove in circles at six in the morning the streets were empty no one was behind me one of two things happened they put a tracer on my car so they can watch me on a screen instead of wasting gas or they have been tracking down every person i know and checking up on them father lou had time to get benji into a safe place inside the church but the kid cant stay there much longer for obvious reasons i cant take him to any of my friends i was hoping you could talk to your grandmother and get her to agree to let him stay at your new solway house shes basically on the side no she thinks im in love with benji or in love with benjis adventure she wants him out ofthe country the only thing she and daddy agree on is that benji needs to go back to egypt if i tell her i know where he is shell call the justice department but they wont deport him theyll lock him up you said i didnt read any news but ive been reading on this and reading on this and reading on this it happens all the time people are caught with their visas expired and they cant even go home they get put in detention some place and held for months i promised benji i wont let him down she started to cry i patted her good hand its okay babe well think of something else youre recovering from a bullet wound try to calm down you need to save your strength for healing im on your side in this really truly if i wasnt i would have talked to your granny without consulting you you know she blew her nose i cant even braid my own hair i cant play lacrosse or ride for months until this stupid arm heals everything takes forever or i have to get people to do stuff for me i hate it speaking as one whos been through the wars i agree its a pain want me to finish buttoning you just this once she nodded her eyes still tearing a bit judging by the size and the cut the shirt must have been filched from her fathers closet it covered her tasted right arm with room to spare your dad off getting your lesson plans yeah hes meeting with ms milford to see what i can do online its only a few days i keep telling him not to be so anal and he says young lady where did you pick up that kind of language i suggested she gave a shaky laugh something like that and that its a competitive world and i need to learn that losers are not strivers then he adds hes going to take me to washington to a school with my natural peers where ill learn how to behave with proper respect like learning how to totally trash the environment or something while im pretending to protect it thats his idea of respect where can benji go i he has to leave st remigios ive only had one not very bright idea i could put him up in a motel for a few days while i try to find an immigration lawyer who can help him its not the best ideai hate for him to have keep skulking around not to mention for him to have to be by himself its not good for his spirits and anyway as he himself says theres no point in his staying here if he cant work and he ought to be with kids his ageyour ageand feel able to relax but he cant do that as long as those racists are looking for him she smacked the dressing table with her good hand i tried to get him to let me send his mom money but he wouldnt take it no matter what daddy and granny are saying he isnt trying to exploit me i have a tiny idea about that too last sunday night when marcus whitby drowned in the larchmont pond benji was standing at the attic window watching for you im almost certain benji saw what happened if marcus whitby didnt go in on his own benji saw who pushed him in benji wont tell me or father lou but if you could get him to talk about it i might be able to work out a deal with the chicago police captain mallory whos in charge of the citys antiterrorism squad could no she shouted her face very white youre not on my side or his are you you only want to use him for what you can get out of him about your stupid murder i should have known better than to trust you get out of here dont come near me again dont go near benji again catherine something has to change if hes going to stay here without being arrested or deported if he witnessed a murder go away if you dont leave now ill page granny and shell get our lawyers i hate you i hate you she doubled over with sobs i stood up im leaving my card on your desk if you change your mind if you realize im on your side you can call me on my cell phone at any hour but im going to have to move benji whether hes willing to talk to me or not i waited another minute but she only sobbed oh go why arent you gone yet i left a card inside her laptop away from her grandmother and fathers prying eyes but where shed see it when she next went to log on on my way out of the apartment elsbetta appeared from the other wing the one that held renees office she was taken aback since she hadnt let me in and demanded to know my business i told her id been calling on catherine yes i knew mrs renee didnt want me here but i had come anyway and now i was leaving my visit was completed by running into edwards bayard just as i opened the gate to the street he also wanted to know what i was doing there i peddle tupperware doortodoor it augments my agency income i hit schiller street yesterday but this neighborhood is a tough sell he reacted as predictably as peppy to a squirrel he was a presidential adviser he was a bayard no one talked to him like that yeah youre a bayard when you want to call up some privileges the rest of the time you slink away from your parents i stomped west away from the island of wealth and privilege back toward my own world i felt exhausted the mornings good omens dissipated by catherines outburst her wound and the anesthesia that lingered in her system were knocking her off balance and then she was sixteen it wasnt like her judgment was the steadiest to begin with i knew these things but her tantrum left me feeling as though i had been beaten by sticks i kept replaying the conversation wondering what i should have said differently i should have described bobby first explained that he was at odds with the feds i should have spent more time talking to her on neutral topics first i should have this i shouldnt have that over and over youd think a detective like me would be thickskinned by now as jt had said last night but lately every whack against my rhino hide was making me more prey to selfdoubt chapter seizures i walked up to north avenue where i caught a crosstown bus to my office the street is an important conduit between the city and the expressway which is why i suppose the big national chains have stuffed it full of outlets the traffic is so heavy on north these days that it took half an hour for the bus to trundle the three miles across town delays like that usually leave me gnawing my nails in annoyance today i welcomed the chance to rest when i finally got off at western i didnt bother to check for tails i was tired i didnt care and anyway it didnt matter if people followed me to my officeif they were tapping me theyd know i was in there it was close to lunch time i walked down to la llorona for a fish taco the lunchtime crowd was heavy so i didnt chat with mrs aguilar but ate my taco at one of the high tables in the corner while i finished glancing through the papers the taco was so good and i was feeling so sorry for myself that i took a second one back with me to eat at my desk at division street where milwaukee changed abruptly from a neighborhood street to an extension of yuppie town i stopped in one of the coffee bars for a cappuccino either protein or caffeine would revive me or at least that was my theory while i was out freemans secretary had messengered over the toxicology report tessa had signed for it and taped it to my office door i took it in with me and laid it on my desk i almost couldnt bear to read it id moved heaven and earth or at least medical examiners in two counties to get this document if it told me nothing i might he down and never get up again i finally took the report from the envelope and began reading callie had sent a photocopy of a tenpage fax so it was blurry in places the text bristled with epithelial cells of the distal part of the renal tubules and immunocytochemical electron microscopy of the hepatocytes fascinating if you knew what it meant i slowly went through the whole ten pages the analysis of marcs last meal skinless chicken broccoli baked potato and a lettucetomato salad consumed three hours before death with a statistical variation of so much based on digestive whatever was so detailed that i abruptly tossed the second taco into the trash the lab had found no trace of cocaine diazepam nordiazepam hydrocodone cocaethylene benzoylecgonine heroin hydrochloride or marijuana metabolites in marcs urine he had alcohol in the vitreous humor and phenobarbital in the blood plasma discovered with highperformance liquid chromatography the report gave the drugs in milligrams per liter with the information that marc had weighed eighty kilos so i couldnt tell how much marc had drunk on top of the drug but vishnikov had provided a summary at the end a six hundred milligram dose of phenobarbital taken with approximately two shots of bourbon would have depressed respiration and most likely killed him if he hadnt first died of drowning i leaned back in the desk chair it wobbled badly i needed to get a screwdriver out to tighten the castors all i knew about phenobarbital was that it was used to treat epilepsy if marc had epilepsy he should have known better than to mix alcohol with his medication he would have known better by all reports he was a careful man he wouldnt have taken a drug without knowing its side effects but maybe after years with the disease he knew he could drink a modest amount without getting into distress with his medication the sinking feeling returned to my diaphragm he had gone into that pond alone unlessa couple of shots of whisky wasnt much for a man who weighedeighty kilosi scratched arithmetic on a scrap of papera hundred seventyfive pounds but i didnt know how to evaluate the amount of phenobarb hed taken since i couldnt ask vishnikov to explain i phoned lotty who was in her clinic today mrs coltrain her longtime administrator said dr herschel was with patients and couldnt be disturbed all i want to know is how much of a dose six hundred milligrams of phenobarbital is can you ask her or lucy choi lucy was the advanced practice nurse who did a lot of the routine patient care at the clinic after a minute on hold lotty came to the phone herself six hundred milligrams is a huge dose victoria did someone prescribe that for you it could kill you if you took it all at once how long would it take this isnt a game is it i dont know it moves fast into the system depresses respiration you might have an hour for someone to try to revive you possibly only half an hour what if i weighed thirty pounds more than i do still far too much if someone prescribed that for you dont ever see her again she hung up i looked again at the report if marc had epilepsy he wouldnt have taken such a lethal dose on purpose not unless he wanted to die but then why go into the larchmont pond why not stay in the comfort of his bed maybe he didnt know he would die from itmaybe he thought it would just make him unconscious enough not to mind drowning but why go all the way out to that foul pond at larchmont instead of the welcome expanse of lake michigan and then his cari shook my head trying to stop the incessant buzzing hamster on its wheel again my hand hesitated over my phone harriet whitby had planned to move in with amy after her parents left for atlanta yesterday if i phoned amys apartment would that get the law to monitor her calls too i shook my head angrily i couldnt live like this secondguessing whether anyone was listening to me and my friends or following me and i wasnt going to spend an hour on public transport just to make sure i talked to her unsupervised amy answered sounding relaxed she and harriet were enjoying a comfortable day alone together she explained without having to worry about harriets folks as she called her friend to the phone i felt like a vulture intruding on their light mood dr vishnikov sent me your brothers autopsy report i told harriet would you like me to come to amys so we can discuss it in person are you trying to prepare me for something awful she demanded something i dont want to know tell me now this has been the hardest week of my lifei dont want even a half hour of agony imagining things while i wait to see you marc had a lot of phenobarbital in his system but only one largish bourbon did he suffer from epilepsy or have any history of seizures where he would have been taking this drug no she said blankly no hes always beenalways wasreally healthy what does this mean im afraid it means what weve been saying all along he really was murdered someone gave him a drug that knocked him out and then put him in that pond to die saying it out loud brought me a sense of relief the wheel stopped turning the buzzing in my head ended murder not suicide not accident i didnt have to make a plaster cast of the wheel marks in the culvert marks killer had driven him to the pond in a golf cart harriet became so quiet i thought perhaps shed gone away but at last she said in a dull dead voice that sounded like her mothers weve known this anyway all week not about the drug but that someone killed him its just hard to hear it finally said out loud marc wasnt really healthy after all was he it didnt matter that he attended the university of michigan or was a prizewinning writer or kept a healthy diet did it he still died from the black mans disease im sorry i was confusedall i could think of was sicklecell anemia murder she hiccupped it doesnt matter if youre educated and live a decent life its still going to get you im sorry i repeated helplessly ill come to amys right now if you want no thank you i know youve been working hard on my behalfon my familys behalf i know youre only doing what i asked you to do but i need to be alone with a sister for now when she hung up i felt embarrassed the news that elated me had brought her distress i got up and walked around the room wed found marks bottle of makers mark when we searched his house last week bourbon and branch his drink amy had told me if there were fingerprints on his bottleif the whisky had been doctoredi wanted to collect that makers mark and get it tested even if i had to pay for the job myself after amy and i had finished inspecting marks house on friday what had i done with his keys i dumped the contents of my briefcase onto my desk the set id borrowed from marks housekeeper tumbled out in the jumble of papers tampons and my palmpilot so did the key luke edwardss locksmith had created for me to get into the saturn i picked up the car key and turned it over in my palm studying it as though it were a text in an unknown language i could take the train down to marks house collect his bourbon and borrow his car as long as i didnt park it near my office or home i should be able to drive freely around town for a few days i might even be able to pick up benji and instead of taking him to a motel i could leave him at marc whitbys house tell the neighbors benji was my cousin needing a job and a place to staywe were letting him look after the house so it didnt stand vacant until the family sold it gosh youre good v i i stuffed the toxicology report back into its envelope and put it in my bag picklocksyou never know a loaded clip for my gunbecause again you never know latex gloves a gallonsized plastic bag for the bourbon pulled clean from the box and inserted into a second clean bag to make sure there was no contamination of the specimen far from this something bosom haste ye doubts ye fears that laid it waste i sang dancing to the door it was a long el trip to the south side since i had to ride into the loop to change trains i danced impatiently on the platform while i waited and found myself leaning forward in my seat as if that would move the train faster at thirtyfifth street i jumped down the stairs two at a time and ran over to giles when i jogged down the walk to marks house a halfdozen girls were jumping double dutch out front they watched me go up the stoop and unlock marcs front door maybe this wasnt such a good place to bring benji nothing happened unobserved in this neighborhood except for someone coming here to steal all marcs papers the house had taken on the forlorn musty aspect of any abandoned building after a week dust was visible even to my unhousekeeperly eye i took a quick look around i didnt think anyone had been here robbers or cops despite bobby mallorys assertion that the police would reopen the investigation into marcs death in the kitchen i pulled on the latex gloves picked up the makers mark at the base with my thumb and forefinger and slipped it into the clean plastic bags the whole package went into my briefcase on my way out i stopped to look up at the poster of kylie ballantine in the stairwell what could you tell me i demanded were you calvin bayards lover were you augustus llewellyns what secret do those new solway people care about so much that they killed your young champion to protect it the vital silhouette floated above meabove all the petty concerns of the people she had known kylie ballantine had moved on had not let her life be mired in the bitterness the mccarthy era had generated she had struggled financially but unlike that crew of wealthy people she had shrugged off the wounds of those turbulent times even if shed known hardship ballantine had been fortunate to die with her powers intact her spirit strong unlike calvin bayard whose mind once overmatched olin taverners and now was happy to watch the cook boil milk my fingers clenched on the handle of my case i started toward the front door trying to make myself think about the best way to deliver the makers mark to cheviot labs but the image persisted urine masked by talcum calvins nurse shepherding him toward the kitchen my hand was on the front doorknob when i stopped the house around me was quiet as death the nurse theresa jakes who had seizures catherine bayard told me granny mustnt know about them i hadnt wondered where the phenobarb had come from but there it was right out in new solway where theresa took it to control her own seizures where ruth lantner the housekeeper threatened to tell renee about them if theresa slept through calvins wanderings again i turned around and walked back to stare again at the poster nothing happened at new solway that renee didnt know about even if ruth lantner hadnt told her about theresas seizures renee would have found out somehow renee exulted in her organizational skills during the day she juggled details of a mammoth commercial enterprise at night she stayed effortlessly on top of a major domestic one if she had killed marc it would have been to protect calvins reputation but calvin didnt need protecting he was the man who had stood up when few people would who had confronted taverner and bushnell and walked away fragments of conversations passed through my head they turned on each other like rats in a proverbial barrel augustus llewellyn said last night pelletiers boy wonder skimming the cream from pelletiers work from pelletiers love life who had sent taverner that picture of kylie and told him where it had been taken who wanted people to give money to comthoughts legal defense fund without coming forward himself what had llewellyn done to get that money from bayard taverner had kept a dastardly secret about calvin bayard only because bayard knew one just as bad about taverner that truth had been staring me in the face for days i just hadnt wanted to see it not about the hero of my youth not calvin not not my knees buckled i collapsed on the stairs chapter terrorist on the runor in an suv i sat under kylies picture a long time someone else might have access to phenobarbitalit was a common drug it didnt have to have come from the bayards it didnt have to be renee who used it to dope marcs whiskyit could have been theresa jakes herself or ruth lantner ruth lantner could have had the necessary strength to push marc into that pond if he was close to death already but she had no reason to do so what about edwards bayard determined to protect olin taverners memory after all it was edwards who had broken into olins apartment last week edwards who held a grudge against his parents who was desperate to establish some kind of ascendancy over those two strong personalities the cold in the hallway was getting into my bones and making my sore shoulder ache i wanted it to be llewellyn or edwards rather than renee i liked her i didnt like her son but the truth oh the truth wasif calvin bayard had donehad done things i didnt want to say even in the silent space of my own mindi couldnt bear it he had done much that was good didnt that count if renee had killed marcus whitby shed done it to keep the world from knowing her husband had betrayed kylie ballantine couldnt i let it go to keep calvins reputation intact in these times any whiff of wrong doing by a prominent progressive would only give rightwing radicals more cause for triumphalism i couldnt bear to contribute to their jubilant trampling on human rights i couldnt pursue this investigation further i looked again at kylie ballantines silhouette she had lost her career because someone had betrayed her to olin taverner marc had lost his life for the simple crime of trying to revive her memory no amount of good that calvin had done through his foundation or the books hed published could outweigh the crime of killing marcus whitby if it was renee whod killed him and look at the probabilities she was the one who relished organizing great enterprises i could imagine edwards ordering a subordinate to take care of this problem for me i couldnt imagine him doing it himself i shouldnt discount augustus llewellyn he could have given marc doped whisky more easily than a stranger and he too had secrets he was determined to hide i tried to imagine a confrontation that would make renee or llewellyn show their hand nothing came to me let the police figure it out bobby mallory had been telling me for years that murder was police work id give him all my tangled ideas the nurse with seizures every little thing id learned from geraldine graham and from the archives he could turn the police machinery on and if it led to renee then thats where it would go i pushed myself to my feet my joints stiff from sitting so long in the cold the weight in my bag reminded me of my own brief jubilation marcs bottle of bourbonid turn that over to bobby too in exchange id ask bobby to protect benji tell him that benji was his material witness to whoever put marc in that larchmont pond bobby was at odds with the federal attorney hed work out something i thrust away a nagging voice that said bobby would brush off my ideas as insubstantial or unsubstantiable or that hed be so angry with me for hiding benji he wouldnt listen to me i didnt have evidence the nagger said only the connections that came from reading archives and listening to people i didnt have hard evidence i fought the notion that bobby would flat out refuse to investigate that new solway crowd anyway i shouldnt go to bobby without talking it over with benji and father lou id explain to benji that things had changed since yesterday morning now i knew the murderer was one of two maybe three people all i needed from him was a shortcut to the persons identity bobby and benji would both do my bidding they had to i went slowly down the stairs to the front walk and climbed into marcs saturn to my astonishment it was only four oclock i felt as though the day had been going on for thirty or forty hours by now the girls were still jumping double dutch in the road among them was the one whod pointed out marcs car to me last week she nudged someone waiting a turn at the ropes they all stopped jumping to stare at me i waved as i climbed into the drivers seat you with the police miss the police want that car or are you stealing it my informant asked hands on hips stealing i said rolling down the window so they could hear me that made them laugh and draw closer what the police want with mr whitbys car miss clues he was killed you know were hoping the car will hold some clues about who killed him none of you saw the person who drove this car back here last sunday night did you that was too strong they pulled away huddling together quiet a killer coming right onto the block no they didnt need that fear over their young heads i said cheerfully dont worry if you see lights on in the house tonight were bringing in a caretaker someone to live here until the family decides to sell okay and dont worry about this killertheyre not going to come back here how do you know one of them demanded no one been arrested no one been suspected three people are suspected they live far away youre safe here in your neighborhood when i drove up the street i could see them in my rearview mirror jump ropes dangling from their hands while i waited at the light on thirtyfifth they finally started turning the ropes again but the energy had gone out of their play good work vi sucking the enthusiasm out of little girls i took a look at the traffic stalled on the dan ryan expressway and stayed on the side streets driving slowly but quietly up to st remigios marcs green saturn was just the car for these streets not flashy not the kind that people stare at and remember i parked two blocks west of the church and made a great circle around it on foot so that i came up to the school entrance from the south i walked briskly through the gates to the playground not looking around although the back of my head prickled as i wondered if any lawmen had me in their sights inside a hall guard still sat on duty although it was fourthirty now afterschool activities were going full spate no one could come into the school without an id or a legitimate reason to be there the guard made a phone call father lou was in the gym i could talk to him there the priest was standing in front of one of his punching bags dressed in sweats showing a group of tenyearolds how to move their arms curious glances from the boys made him turn to look at me barking a few hasty instructions to them he came over to my side i got a clean car i said and i think i have a safe house where benji can stay for a couple of days buti want to turn the murder investigation over to the police its too big for me i really need benji to cooperate i think i can get captain mallory to protect benji if hell only say what he saw last sunday night can you help me persuade him he nodded should be in here now but maybe this is one of his prayer times ill find him wait here he trotted out of the room light on his feet as a dancer after a couple of minutes i put my briefcase down in a corner and picked up a basketball my first shot caromed off the backboard at a crazy angle but after that i sank five in a row before the priest returned jerking his head at me to follow him back to the hall hes gone girl came for him thirty forty minutes ago had to be the girlone arm bound up inside her clothes she asked the guard for benji bold as brasssaid he was her cousin from morocco guard sent her to the principal principal called benji in says kid was thrilled to see the girl walked off with her idiots all principal guard the lot none of them sent for me his popeye cheeks swelled larger with anger but i felt only cold if catherine had taken benji back to her grandmotheras id counseled this morningif renee had put marc whitby in the larchmont pond he was as good as dead dully i followed father lou to the principals office i went through the motions with the guard and the principal had either of them seen how the kids left taxi bus they didnt knowthe school was an old building put up when windows were built high off the ground to keep you from looking at the street father lou ordered the principal to summon any teachers or staff still in the building to her office one of the janitors moving cartons in from a supply truck had seen a girl with one arm bound up inside her jacket leave with an older student he was pretty sure theyd gotten into a white suv but he hadnt been paying close attention the old priest was furious after having the fbi in yesterday looking for benji he couldnt believe the principal would let the youth leave without even trying to discuss the matter with father lou were trying to make a safe place here if anyone can come in this school ask for any kid without you blinking an eye whats to stop gangbangers kidnappers the whole lot from destroying our peace the principal turned red angry in her turn was she supposed to know that a girl benji was thrilled to see constituted a menace if father lou wanted to run the school he should take overshed be glad to resign on the spot the principals red face broke into wavy lines her mouth moving up and down as if she was a puppet the cabinets behind her began moving too in the same unsteady waves it seemed so funny that i started to laugh the floor began moving which seemed funny too and i was still laughing when i fell over my head was wet father lou was wiping water from my neck and face with a rough gym towel no fainting from you my girl need one working brain around here besides mine sit up and pull yourself together i sat up the priest hoisted me to my feet with only a mild grunt hundredandfortypound women are nothing to an old boxer he held a cup to my mouth and i swallowed hot tea choked then drank down the rest i put my head between my knees and willed the gray cloudy pieces of my mind into some kind of order where would the girl go he spoke to me roughly to make me concentrate it depends partly on why she ran away my voice wobbled i steadied it and continued she turned hysterical this morning when i asked her to talk to benji i also suggested she confide in her grandmother i just hope she didnt follow that piece of advice i pulled out my cell phone and called the bayard apartment elsbetta answered why are you making trouble here she demanded mr edwards he wants to fire me because you came this morning now miss catherine has run away all because of you is renee or edwards there i ignored her outburst i want to talk to them about catherine you cannot be bothering them they have ordered no phone calls tell them im reporting catherines disappearance to the chicago police i said coldly if they want to speak to me they can call me on my cell phone ill give you the number at that she put me on hold within a minute both renee and edwards were on the phone each trying to order the other to leave the conversation to them do you have catherine renee demanded isnt she with you i said shes run away edwards said without leaving a note you acted like a victorian father eds ordering her to pack for washington and no argument allowed elsbetta phoned me at my office but edwards shouted over her voice if youd thought she deserved half as much attention as calvin and your goddamned publishing empire if you listened to anyone but your knock it off both of you i said savagely when did she leave and what was she driving you cannot call the police they said in chorus i can damn well do what i want someone reported seeing her in a white suv do you seriously imagine shes safe driving a threeton vehicle with one arm that briefly united them they wanted to know who had seen her i grew angrier pushing on them until they admitted catherine had taken renees white range rover that they knew she hadnt shown up at the new solway house that shed left around threethirty after her fight with her father have you called julius arnoff to see if shes gone back to larchmont i asked it didnt seem likely to me because she and benji had been flushed from the mansion once already but neither teenager was probably thinking much right now my first thought edwards said while renee was still cursing you for taking trina to her arab boyfriend i had a guard stake out the house she isnt there when you came uninvited to the apartment this morning did you or did you not arrange an assignation for trina renee demanded grow up i snapped i dont know where benji is nor catherine stop casting around for who to blame for her disappearance and tell me what youre doing to find her edwards is using his private security connections his mother said bitingly theyre likely to shoot her if they see her if you were looking for her where would you start nowhere id tell either of you i said nastily and closed my phone they have a private security force out looking for her i turned to father lou that really scares me girl adored her grandfather isnt that what you told me the other day maybe they had some special place everyone goes to ground where they feel secure place connected to her grandfather would feel secure to her hes got advanced alzheimers he wont be able to tell menever mind i know who can ill call you from the car i ran from the school chapter loves labors lost north of madison wisconsin a freezing rain began to fall the interstate turned glassy on the overpasses i had to keep my speed down to stay in control except for the occasional giant rig charging through the slush at eighty we had the road pretty much to ourselves geraldine graham was snoring lightly in the seat next to me she had insisted on coming she still had keys to the cottageshe had found them easily in a drawer in her bedroom and put them into a black hermes bag that rested now at her feet i tried to force her to stay home but she said she knew the route which i didnt and more important at least to her she needed to make sure benji and catherine were all right if id told you these things last week they might not be in danger now when id reached anodyne park lisa had answered the bellbustling officious you cant come in madam is resting i pushed her aside and strode down the hall opening doors i found geraldine dozing on her bed with a reading light on and a book open beneath her fingers lisa darted in under my arm oh madam this detective is here breaking in shall i call mr darraugh or mr julius geraldine sat up with a start lisa stop dithering the detective mr darraughs detective is here oh there you are young woman wait while i collect myself i knelt next to her something urgent has come up i need your help i dont need you to put your clothes on grant me the foibles of my upbringing young woman i think better while dressed than naked i will be with you directly i walked impatiently up and down the hall outside her room but she was in fact remarkably quick despite her age and lisas interference and in a few minutes was talking to me in her alcove in the sitting room i told her i was going to tell her things that were utterly confidential and that lisa could not be a party to them after a look at my face geraldine summarily dismissed her maid lisa gave me the kind of expression that makes you glad a handgun isnt backing it up but she retreated when i heard the door closeand made sure lisa was on the far side of iti told geraldine about catherine and benji i know you and calvin were lovers all those years ago it was you he meant when he called for deenie last week wasnt it her fingers clenched on the arms of her chair but she nodded how did you know was it the key to larchmont that he had kept that and some other things armand pelletier left an unfinished manuscript among his papers that pretty well spelled it out ah armand i wondered if he would come back to haunt me he was so passionate about workers rights and for a time i reflected that passionbecause i was passionate and needed some object for my ardor he was bitter when i left him for calvin he accused me of being too fastidious of needing the fleshpots of egypt i told him clean sheets would suffice but it had more to do withcalvin was a generous lover and armand took more than he gave his passions ultimately were for himself alone with calvin too it was only a way of getting what he himself desired but i didnt see that until much later there was never a question that you would leave your husband involuntarily i let myself be sidetracked i thoughti had the notion that if i divorced mackenzie calvin and i might marry but however much mother hated mackenzie she couldnt stand the scandal a divorce would cause and before id nerved myself to stand up to hercalvin had married renee she twisted the great diamond on her right hand i had gone to washington when he was called before the committee i was in the hearing room i was one of the spectators i had gone with the idea that i would surprise him i loved him i thought he loved me and that if i declared myself it would be a help to his spirit during those difficult days and he turned you down she turned her head so i couldnt see her face i never made the offer he left the room surrounded by lawyers and reporters i looked for him in his club at the end of the day and they told me where he was dining when i got to the restaurant i saw him sitting with reneeas he had often sat with meso close the clothes themselves might melt from our bodies i walked away walked blindly walked through the night thinking only that i must never let anyone know how humiliated i had been i walked for hours until i ended up weary in some district i didnt know i went into a bar thinking i would have a brandy and get them to call me a cab she stopped her fingers still working on her ring and saw my husband with olin taverner as close as renee had been to calvin it was that kind of bar mackenzie looked up and recognized me your husband was gay not impotent was that the night you found out gay what a strange word for a man whose homosexuality weighed on him like a druids stone no i had known for years my only surprise was seeing him with olin when we married mackenzie was often in new york it was an open secret between him and his parents that he went there to visit homosexual bars marriage was supposed to cure him of that as it was supposed to cure me oflovers and unwanted pregnancies i suppose i took lovers in the hopes of shocking my mother away from me but she was far more tenacious than i she would take me to europe to those swiss sanitoria after she and blair graham married mackenzie to me he and i tried for a few years my daughter laura was his child but mackenzie was miserable in my arms in any womans arms so we arrived at a tacit understanding we would present a bland united front to the world and seek our pleasures privately we were both discreet and we came to be good friends for a time after another pause when i thought she would slice her finger to the bone with her diamonds she said and then i met armand at a party calvin gave for him a triumphant party when armands tale of two countries had been on the times bestseller list for twenty weeks i started going to organizing meetings with himbut you know that part yes i said gently i know that part was calvin darraughs father ive never been sure she turned bitter eyes back to me it might have been armand but i think it was calvin it doesnt matter darraugh and mackenzie loved one another oh i think better than most fathers and sons do even though mackenzie knew the boy couldnt possibly be his and mother suspected as much and when mackenzie diedwhen i killed him no the exclamation came out involuntary oh i didnt pull the noose tight but i let calvin know what i saw in that washington bar my last gift to him as a lover i thoughtit would give him leverage with olin and it did my eye was on the clock i tried to hurry her to get to the point where shed tell me a place calvin might have taken his granddaughter geraldine wouldnt be rushed she was telling me a tale she had rehearsed so many times in her mind it had worn a groove there now her first chance to say it all out loud after all those years of silence she could only tell me the story as shed memorized it it was all on account of the committee for social thought and justices legal defense fund olin had learned that calvin supported it and he was on calvin like a dog to a rabbit theyd despised each other for so many years you see you gave the fund money so calvins name didnt appear i prompted her trying to curb my impatience she smiled sadly yes those were the days when i would do very nearly anything calvin demanded he told me that if he gave to the fund directly bayard publishing couldnt operate freely during those bleak blacklist days since then ive come to seecalvin was generous and handsome and spoiled and cowardly he couldnt face hardshipbut i only realized that later what mattered at the time to me was that my mother found i had written checks for him to the legal defense fund once again she turned to look at the portrait when i told calvin that she was going to give her shares in the press to olin if i donated more money to the fund calvin turned to augustus llewellyn llewellyn was a fellow traveler back then i knew that from my months with armand when i withdrew calvin got llewellyn to donate a great deal of money into the fund but it was money calvin actually contributed himself by creating loans for llewellyn to start his business calvin was quite pleased with his own cleverness we lay in my great bed at larchmont one night while he laughed and told me about it she shut her eyes holding her breath for a long moment ive never known exactly what happened between olin and calvin after that first committee hearing no one ever talked we live by secrets in new solway they are our meat and breath i assumed that olin went to llewellyn because his name was on the checks you see the checks written to the legal defense fund and i supposed that llewellyn told olin he would give him the name of the ringleader if he didnt have to go to prison himself and if his name never appeared but augustus llewellyn must have reported calvins involvement to olin who else could have known when olin confronted him calvin in turn revealed kylies and armands namesthey were prominent in the committee for social thought and justice back when we met so often at floras bar calvin would have turned them in perhaps he would have turned even me in to avoid public disgrace himself a part of me knew that the part that wasnt still painfully in love did renee know this about calvin when they married i ventured i think renee suggested that calvin trade kylie and armand for his own safety she said with surprising calm she would never have seen it as a betrayal of principle you see but as an organizational necessity i think that now at the time i only saw that she was twenty and i was fortyfive and i made one last effort to bind calvin to me i told him aboutolin and mackenzie i left a note in his club on my way to the train station i went up to new york city so that i could be alone for a time away from mothers eyes and also so i wouldnt have to face mackenzie he was a good man mackenzie and i knew i had done a terrible thing in betraying him to calvin her mouth worked the committee halted their investigation into calvin that afternoon while i was sleeping in my suite at the plaza i assumed calvin and olin came to a gentlemans agreement she gave the phrase a savage inflection olin would cease and desist armand would go to prison kylie would lose her job and calvin would keep olins affair with mackenzie to himselfthat would have ruined olin in the fifties you see i made all of these assumptions because mackenzie returned to larchmont and hanged himself neither of us knew that darraugh was sent home unexpectedly from exeter she looked at me bleakly of courserenee knew everything about me and calvin about olin and mackenzie and she flaunted her knowledge to me in those subtle ways one can in a closed community i was never more thankful for anything than when she and calvin bought that apartment in town i went to the kitchen and brought her a glass of water maam i didnt mean for you to tell me so much or to have it be so upsetting for you but you see i think olin told this story to marcus whitby and i think marc went to renee for her version marc was working on a long project on kylie ballantine and he was a careful journalist he wouldnt print such a story without hearing the bayards side renee killed him in an efficient way she gave him bourbon dosed with phenobarbital and when he fell into a coma she drove here to anodyne park where she borrowed a golf cart and drove him to your old pond nowim afraid shell kill the egyptian boy if she gets to him before i do geraldine drank the water and you think i can stop her i showed no capacity for that when i was younger and more vital im wondering if catherine ran away to some place that was important to her and her grandfather i desperately need to knowit may be too late already nowbutwas there some private special place that you and calvin cherished her mouth twisted in a sardonic smile many special places all by necessity private buti supposehis family used to own a hunting lodge near eagle river up in northern wisconsin when the north woods became a national forest in the thirties the family had to give up their land but calvins father worked out an agreement where the family could keep the lodge for private use for twentyfive years the agreement must have expired about the time calvin married renee the lodge is where we held the committee benefit that caused so much questioning in congress and its where calvin and i used to go sometimes in the fall besides the great lodge which would sleep thirty people there was a cottage in the woods behind it we were happy there in a place where we couldbe intimate without wondering who was outside the bedroom door i think calvin took the girl up there when she was younger it was a long shot but it was my only shot i got to my feet and braced myself for the long drive north chapter the dead speak in portage fifty miles north of madison the rain changed to snow i pulled over for gas and hamburgers geraldine woke used the gas station toilet without comment although it hadnt seen soap for a few decades and ate one of the cardboard burgers i drove up here through the snow with calvin one december she said i told mother i was going to st augustine to ride i often did that in the winter to get away from new solway even in daylight it was a difficult passage it was still a twolane road then with stop signs every so often of course the war was on with gas rationing and rubber rationing only the wealthy like calvin and me could afford to be driving such distances we didnt pass many other vehicles i wondered if she would remember the route to the lodge but i would worry about that when we got to eagle river right now keeping the car on the road was taking all my energy that and staying awake i dredged the pond out at larchmont on friday i said i found a ringi forgot to tell you when i saw you on sunday something that looked like a beehive of diamonds with ruby and emerald chips along the base she made a sound that might have been a laugh so it was in the pond all those years it belonged to mother she actually fired one of the maids for stealing it although i always thought darraugh must have taken it it was a terribly ugly thing that ring but mother prized it because her father gave it to her at her comingout party it disappeared soon after mackenzie died when mother was in her element holding the press at bay publicly flaunting herself in black crepe privately gloating darraugh turned on her in an almost violent way he turned on me too but i felt i had earned it and did nothing to try to deflect his rage everything was gray for me then losing calvin losing mackenzie losing darraugh all in one short spring my daughter laura was away at vassar and anyway she shared my mothers attitude towardme toward her father she held herself disapprovingly aloof from all of us and our turmoil shes a wonderful matron now her grandmother would be proud of her for upholding the ancien regime does darraugh know that your husband wasnt his father i asked i never told him mother hinted at it but she couldnt have known with certainty although of course she made burrowing into my private life her major business bribing servants searching my room geraldines flutey voice wavered i turned my eyes briefly from the slippery road to look at her she was staring straight ahead her hands knotted in her lap darraugh and mother fought in an interminable intolerable way after mackenzies death she called mackenzie ugly names cruel names to my son and suggested mackenzie could never have fathered a child darraugh came to me i said of course he was mackenzies son but darraugh didnt believe me and he felt mothers words bitterly felt them as my betrayal of himself and of mackenzie he ran away from home we hired detectives such as yourself but couldnt find him i finally fled to france where i stayed for almost a year until i learned that darraugh had suddenly reappeared at exeter one of the masters inspired his confidence it seemed it was still years before he talked to me again but when he married his wife acted as a peacemaker elise was a lovely girl she softened all o uswell she softened darraugh and me certainly not mother who kept trying to make us despise her for having been a typist when darraugh met her when we lost elise to leukemia darraugh froze over again i pulled over to the side of the road to clean off the headlights and the buildup of snow at the bottom of the windshield when i got back into the car geraldine asked if id found anything else in the pond bits of crown derby one of kylie ballantines masks that was my doing she said how strange it is to talk about all of this so calmly when i held it fast inside me for five decades we all bought masks to support kylie after she lost her teaching position at the university of chicago and then after calvin brought renee home renee made it clear to me that i had only been one of calvins loves only one of the women who traveled this road to eagle river with him all those years ago i threw the mask in the pond in the middle of a night much like this one she was quiet for a bit i thought shed gone back to sleep but it was the past shed journeyed to i dont believe calvin ever took renee to the cottage the familys agreement with the government had expired as i said and calvin wouldnt come here if it wasnt his private home anymore besides he was busy establishing himself in political and social circles with his new wife after the hearings he became a public darling i couldnt help noticing him you know even when i returned from france and found my wits again i couldnt help noticing his comings and goings it was a small balm to the spirit to know that even if kylie ballantine and a dozen others had lain with him on the bearskin rug before the cottage fire renee herself never did so so catherine doesnt know about this cottage i cried out have we come all this way for nothing i would much prefer it if you didnt shout at me young woman calvin didnt have much interest in children he didnt care that darraugh might be his son and he paid little heed to his and renees boy but when catherine was left to renees care and to his he became as proud as if he had just invented children and she was the first example ever created he was growing old but renee was still young renee had always worked for his firm he let her take over more responsibility she was in her element hiring and firing buying and selling calvin devoted himself to the girl he used to take catherine to wisconsin to fish and ride until he stopped driving some four years back he told you these things she gave a brittle laugh good heavens no i kept in touch with him through servants gossip its how the wealthy have always kept track of each other ones servants know everything that one does and their friends are the servants in the other great houses until renee built a thick wall of silence around his illness i would know whatever calvin did lisa could tell me if she wanted to punish me it was with tales of great events renee and calvin had taken part in with him glowing proudly over renee if lisa wanted to comfort me she told me of their quarrels i thought of my mothers words on the worries of grand ladies i was glad of the poverty id grown up in glad of having to earn every dime id ever spent you pay a high price for money too high a price we fell silent while i concentrated on the road stopping every thirty or forty miles to clean the headlights by the time we reached wassau it was midnight but the snowplows were out and the road became easier to negotiate i pulled over at a truck stop for a cup of bitter coffee and a detail map of the north woods back in the car i handed the map to geraldine and asked her to see whether she could piece together the route to the lodge she couldnt read the map she said the print was too small even with her glasses she dozed off again i had started the journey exhausted the cones of snow swirling into the headlights hypnotized me into drowsiness i turned on the radio but only picked up allnight revivals of religion i pushed the tape player in case marc had been listening to something an old mans scratchy voice came through the speakers oh no young man no tape recorders you may take some notes but no one puts my words on tape a younger deeper voice responded very well sir several loud clicks followed and then the young man spoke again his voice muffled im writing a book about kyhe ballantine i found a letter from her to armand pelletier in which she mentions a meeting with you the saturn fishtailed madly i fought for control spinning the steering wheel in the direction of the skid by some miracle we ended up in the middle of the road facing south but we werent in the ditch thats olin geraldine sat up in surprise ignoring the cars gyrations and marc whitby i agreed i pulled over as close to the edge of the road as i could without going into the ditch and rewound the tape to the beginning marc apparently had put his tape recorder in his pocket or a briefcase but hadnt turned it off hed recorded the whole conversation olin laughed thinly the negro dancerwhat was her name ballantine yes thats right she was very exercised but i told her she had made a gross error in judgment if she thought weeping and shouting would change my mind emotional women have always disgusted me and an emotional negress is a terrible parody of feeling is that why you sent the letter to the university demanding that they fire her marc asked because her emotions disgusted you the muffled mike didnt pick up everything olin said so the first part of his response was missing the university of chicago deserved better than the red faculty that infested the campus in those days she was one i could prove to have an association with a communist front if i could have proved it about any of the others i would have seen that they lost their jobs too young man dont imagine this was about race or about sex it was about the safety of america ive seen the photographits in the university archives how did you know it was ms ballantine and how did you know where it was taken i guessed it was her troupe because the masks were like those shed brought back from french equatorial africa but you couldnt have known that i havent talked about this for fortyplus years young man why should i tell you because im going to write about it if you dont tell me your story ill make assumptions about what you did and why you did it and that will be the version that the whole world will know the tape was muffled here but then olin called out to domingo rivas to help him get to his desk i hadnt seen marcs tape recorder anywhere but he must have owned a good one because it picked up the sound of olins walker tapping across the floor marc apparently followed him because i could hear rivass soothing murmur yessir here we go sir a few more steps and then the noises of the lock in the drawer scraping open and olin muttering what rivas had reported when we spoke last week i am old and the time for holding on to secrets is past even the secrets that ive kept from myself papers rustled it was maddening to sit in marcs car and not know what hed been reading after a moment olin said i signed one copy calvin the other julius arnoff witnessed the documents and put a third copy in lebold arnoffs vaults marc exclaimed but why did you sign it calvin signed one copy of what i screeched mr bayard sent you the photograph marc said he gave it to me after llewellyn sent me to him mr llewellyn marc echoed who owns tsquare oh you work in his organization dont you young man i had forgotten tsquare was his precious magazine yes hed signed all those checks and we had him dead to rights bushnell wanted to lock him up he hated negro agitators even more than he hated reds and he figured llewellyn as a redandblack agitator but i knew what kind of slippery bastard calvin could be so i believed llewellyn we called calvin before the committee he sat there smiling as though he owned the world my god i hated that smile more than anything else about him i let him smirk his way through his testimony and then i made a mistake marc was too experienced a reporter to push he waited until olin picked up the story himself i confronted him after the meeting and told him we had llewellyns testimony that i was going to put it into the record the next day that hed bullied llewellyn into writing those checks unless calvin began naming names and if he didnt he could go to prison he said hed have to think about it but i knew calvin would never go to prison he loved himself too muchhe wouldnt make the grand gestures of people like pelletier or dashiell hammett calvin came back to me two days later with the dancers photograph and pelletiers name of course we already had pelletier in our sights and we didnt care much about the dancer only enough to destroy her career marc spoke hotly forgetting his reporters facade she destroyed it herself young man by taking part in those communist activities but we couldnt prove shed ever given them money or been a party member so we let her go i told calvin he had another day to give me some real names and he came back in the morningwith that letter that was enough why did you let mr bayard off the hook marc sounded bewildered as bewildered as i felt its there in the document young man i dont want to discuss it the tape ended soon after that with marc thanking olin and the apartment door shutting behind him i ran the tape to the end but there wasnt anything else on it geraldine and i stared at each other in the dark car your young man went to renee after that didnt he geraldine said marc was careful he wouldnt publish anything without checking the whole story i agreed sadly if he hadnt been such a good journalist he wouldnt have died chapter someones packing at onethirty in the morning we finally reached eagle river nothing was open not a gas station not even a hamburger stand i wished id bought food back at the truck stop instead of the thin coffee which had burned a hole in my stomachand now was making me desperate for a bathroom eagle river is a little resort town it comes to life in the summer when chicagoans by the thousands move up to their summer homes some return in the winter for snowmobiling but in midmarch everything was shut up tightly as the locals rested between waves of outsiders if we couldnt find the lodge on our own wed have to wait until morning we might even have to sleep in the carnoile of the motels we passed showed any lights geraldine was dismayed by the strip malls lining the highway all of this is so new when i came here with calvin none of these monstrous sterile stores existed do you think you can find the lodge with the landmarks so changed i was testy if you cant were in trouble not so impatient young woman i only need to get my bearings look at that map there should be a forest northeast of town the nicolet national forest yes is that what they call the north woods these days you need to find a road into the forest that goes past elk horn lake i studied the map the lake was about three miles northeast of the forests edge i drove north through the town found a county road east and made my way under the canopy of giant sycamores and pines in the dark with the snow the forest felt cold and menacing the wild woods of fairy tales where writhing trees held demons the little saturn skittered on the unplowed surface i got out to check the road to make sure we hadnt slipped off itand to crouch shivering in a ditch to relieve myself no tire tracks lay ahead of us catherine if she had come this way had a fourhour start the snow would have covered her tracks but what about renee how long would it take the master organizer to work out where her granddaughter would flee for refuge after half an hour of hard driving i spied a sign covered in snow i climbed out again it pointed to elk horn lake when i told geraldine she shut her eyes rebuilding landmarks in her mind i was to take the second turning north grimly hoping that more roads hadnt been added since she was last here i took the second turn to the north the snow had stopped but the wind kept whipping the tree branches in their tormented dance my arms ached i could hardly bear to keep them on the steering wheel and the muscle in my left shoulder began to throb just below the level of unmanageable pain after two miles when i thought i couldnt drive another yard i saw the sign grand nicolet lodge onequarter mile when i told geraldine she smiled in triumph shed been righti couldnt have found it without her a heavy chain slung between two posts blocked the entrance to the turnoff the lodge was open from may through november a sign on the chain explained giving a phone number to call for reservations if catherine and benji were here they could have taken the range rover around the pillars in fact they probably hada bush on the left looked recently mangledbut the saturn wasnt built for that kind of driving under its headlights my fingers thick with cold i worked my picks into the padlock geraldine came out to watch she had never seen a professional lock breaker at work and wanted the experience even though she slid in the snow and was saved from falling only by crashing against one of the pillars the padlock wasnt a sophisticated one fortunately or i could never have undone it in the cold when id driven the car through the entrance i pulled the chain across the road again if renee was behind me that might slow her downfor thirty seconds i cut my lights and crept forward driving with my left hand while i warmed my right fingers under the heating vent we slipped and slid a quarter mile until the lodge loomed suddenly in front of us a giant timbered shape blotting out trees and sky geraldine directed me to its left where the drive led to outbuildings and the cottage the saturn stuck briefly in the snow then bucked forward at the rear of the lodge geraldine pointed out where the rear walls could be unhinged and opened they had done that to create an impromptu stage for the famous benefit the audience had sat on chairs and blankets in the yard we crept onward to a barn which served now as a garage and equipment shed beyond the barn lay elk horn lake black showing through white as the wind whipped the snow cover away from it in a clearing on the shore stood a stone house compared to larchmont hall and the lodge behind us i suppose you could call it a cottage but it was about twice the size of the bungalow id grown up in geraldine handed me the keys shed brought with her the big one used to open this barn if not youll find your way in i daresay to my amazementand reliefthe lock hadnt been changed in fifty years i slid the doors open glad now of the wind it blew snow into my eyes and mouth but its moan through the trees blocked the noise i was making i let out a small woof of relief inside the barn stood a white range rover it had a fresh deep scrape on its right side where catherine had misjudged the clearance around the pillar but she was here i drove geraldine as close to the cottage as i could she climbed out absurd for the setting in her nylons and heels and hermes handbag but still possessing a touching dignity before she left the car she told me what she remembered of the cottages layout the main rooms faced the lake we would be entering through the kitchen to the right was the dining room and beyond it a living room that ran the length of the house a staircase rose from the living room to the bedrooms above i backed the saturn into the barn shutting the door but leaving it unlocked in case we needed to get away in a hurry when i rejoined her i told geraldine to stay behind me on the way in i need both hands free to deal with whatever lies on the far side of this door and im going to have my gun out so dont run into my back she handed me the key like the barn door the lock here hadnt been changed either it was an old dead bolt which slid back with a snap taking my gun in my right hand i went into a crouch turned the knob and slid inside a high young voice cried if you come one step closer i will shoot a hole through you chapter death for the undeserving it was catherine sounding wobbly with fear i couldnt see her i couldnt tell how far away she was or what kind of angle she had or what kind of weapon dont be ridiculous i said irritably geraldine graham is with me even if you could shoot a hole in me in the dark ms graham will tell your grandparents and your father and youll have a hell of a time avoiding juvie court let alone a washington school is benji here its you her voice quivered withwhat disappointment rage i ordered you to stay away from me put a sock in it catherine i crawled forward feeling for a chair or something to use as a shield im not interested in your temper tantrums do you imagine yourself as some kind of heroine living in the north woods on the muskrats youll trap what happens when the crew comes around to get the lodge ready to openyoull shoot them too i bumped into a stool behind me i could hear geraldines slow clumsy step well think of something before then we have a month go away unless youve already told daddy and granny where i am as my senses adjusted to the space i could tell she was above me probably on a back staircase a servants staircase that hadnt registered in geraldines mind when she was recalling the layout darlin there are no secrets in new solway ms graham told me youd likely be here where you spent all those golden childhood days with your grandfather for that same reason your grandmother has probably guessed youre here and i daresay your father may have also so put away your rifle and come along with me before your folks show up you dont want your granny to find you like this do you not with benji let me get you home to your bed and let me take benji to chicago where i can negotiate his safety she began to cry racking sobs of frustration exhaustion adolescence i heard benji murmur to her words too soft for me to make out over her sobs i moved toward her sobs as fast as i could in the dark the stairwell opened in front of me suddenly a blacker black in the dark room i climbed up left hand feeling the steep risers in front right hand keeping hold of my gun just in case fifteen stairs and i touched the metal of the rifle barrel i grabbed it and pushed it aside catherine pulled the trigger the noise was overwhelming in that narrow space the shock from the barrel knocked me off balance i jammed my spine against the bannister below me geraldine graham cried out above the whining in my ears i heard the thud as her body hit the floor and then benjis appeal of catterine catterine why you are doing this shooting turn on the light one of you i snapped after a moment the lights came on in the upper landing i could see geraldine lying at the bottom of the stairs i yanked the rifle out of catherines hand and stomped down the stairs with it blood covered geraldines foot and leg and pooled under her i slid the safety onto my smith wesson and stuck it in my jacket pocket in the light coming from the stairwell i found the kitchen switch i needed towels water soapa miracle i rummaged in the drawers found a stack of dish towels and ran back to the old woman as nearly as i could tell the bullet had grazed the side of her left foot she might have a broken bone in the instep but as i probed her leg she didnt seem to have any other injuries i turned the taps in the sink water came out a boiler hissed to life catherine said something but the whining in my ears was still too loud i couldnt hear her as i wrung towels out she appeared at my side is shedid i kill her no you hit her foot im sorry she said in a small voice im so sorry sheshe isnt moving youre sure she isntisnt dead shes unconsciousi hope just from shock not from hitting her head im wrapping up her foot you find some ammonia look under the sink if you dont find any there hunt for a supply closet benji i yelled up the stairs bring down blankets i lifted geraldines skirt she wore oldfashioned nylons attached to a garter belt i pulled down her stocking and cleaned her leg i tore a towel in strips and wrapped her foot now we had a crippled old woman a disabled teenager an egyptian fugitive and a detective whose skin was itching from fatigue i had to stay awake i had to stay alert enough to get us all out of here and into a place of greater safety and i had to do it fast benji appeared with two blankets before catherine found ammonia i got him to help me wrap geraldine and to carry her to the living room where i fumbled onehanded for a light when i got a lamp switched on i saw the long wide room was filled with furniture and useless knickknacks a couch was set against the far wall under a line of windows that overlooked the lake we lay geraldine there as i straightened her legs i saw one of kylie ballantines masks hanging by the fireplace i ran back to the kitchen where catherine was looking ineffectually in drawers i pulled open a corner door and found a shelf of cleaning supplies bleach furniture polish bingohousehold ammonia i dashed back to the living room poured some onto a towel held it under geraldines nose she sneezed and twisted her head away from the smell her eyes fluttered open lisa lisawhat is goingoh its you young woman yep i shut my own eyes briefly sick with relief that she recognized me do you remember where we are the cottage calvins granddaughter what happened i fired a twentytwo mrs graham i shot you i never meant toim so sorry catherine appeared under my left shoulder sweet words dont make ice cream geraldine snapped youve caused us all yes a lot of trouble i interrupted we need to get out of here catherine really fast geraldineexcuse me maamms graham im going to leave you here for a minute while i bring catherines range rover up to the door i dont like to make you travel with this wound but i think we can lay you flat in the rover benji the youth materialized at the entrance to the living room go upstairs and pull together whatever you brought with you catherine sit down and dont do anything for two minutes dont cry dont run away dont shoot anyone she stuck out her lower jaw for a second then smiled weakly and collapsed obediently in an armchair that faced the lake nursing her tasted arm on her lap benji and i turned on the propane feed and the water he knows where the taps are we wont bother with those just give me your car keys she fished them out of her back jeans pocket i took them to the kitchen with the used towels the floor looked as though wed fought the battle of the bulge in here i wiped up enough of the blood that i wouldnt be slipping in it when i carried geraldine out and dumped all the towels in the sink the caretakers could deal with those when they opened the lodge in may i had dropped my briefcase by the back door when i came intwenty days ago was it or only twenty minutes i put geraldines shoe and nylon in the case and called up the stairs to benji to hurry up im going to get the car you bring everything of yours and catherines downstairs and then ill need you to help me carry ms graham to the car the whining in my ears was dying down when i went outside i could hear the wind again whipping the tree branches around i slid the barn doors back and started the range rover id have to figure out some way some other time to come back for marts saturn the rovers engine turned over with a roar that made me jump but as soon as it caught it ran so quietly i couldnt hear it at all it felt queer to be perched so high above the ground and it was hard to judge the sides i inched forward cautiously not wanting to scrape marts car nor ram into the barn door when i jumped down from the rover to slide the doors shut behind me the whining in my ears returned i shook my head impatiently trying to clear my ears the whining got louder it wasnt my ears it was a snowmobile roaring past the lodge and skimming to a halt in front of the cottage door a compact figure with dark hair in a dark parka jumped off renee i shouted above the wind she whirled around at my voice the detective i should have expected to find you with my granddaughter i knew you were lying about the egyptian boy you used him to lure my granddaughter from her home didnt you a good story but dont run the presses with it just yet i yelled i was about ten feet from her when she fired i hit the ground struggling to get my gun out of my jacket before i could shoot she had opened the cottage door and gone inside when i had made it back into the kitchen i could see catherine at the bottom of the stairs renee above her on the second step catherine was clutching at her grandmother with her sound arm no granny nobody forced me to come it was my idea not v ls not benjis i kidnapped him he didnt force me to do anything catherine they call this the stockholm syndrome im all too familiar with its effect on people im not surprised after the week youve had with your injury and the anesthesia still in your system go outside now and wait in the rover ill be with you directly catherine turned to me tears streaming down her face oh tell her tell granny benji came with me he didnt force me you didnt force me granny granny its all right she screamed catherine go out to the rover youre in the way in here renee stepped down to point her gun at me you drop your gun now kick it under the table i couldnt risk a shot at her without hitting catherine i dropped my gun and kicked it under the kitchen table catherines eyes were black holes in her white face granny you dont understand vi came here to help me shes a friend and you dont understand catherine youve gotten involved in something too big for you right now catherine ducked under renees arm and ran up the stairs her grandmother fired at me a reckless shot that made me hit the floor she ran after her granddaughter by the time i had crawled under the table for my own gun and gotten back on my feet renee and catherine were both at the top of the stairs i heard benji scream no i doing nothing nothing to catterine not touching you not shoot and catherine shouting you mustnt you mustnt shoot him hes my friend granny no and then the gun sounded again i pelted up the stairs but before i reached the top renee appeared in the stairwell head and shot down at me plaster fell on me blinding me and i flattened myself against the side of the stairwell squinting through the plaster dust i could just make out renees legs and the motion of her hand i tried a shot her legs moved back but she fired again crouching down hugging the wall i ran up the stairs shooting twice to back her away renees legs suddenly crumpled her gun clattered past me on the stairs i climbed the last three steps uncertainly on the upper landing geraldine graham was standing over renee the gabonese mask clutched in her arthritic hands she was trembling and blood oozed through the towel on her left foot but she was smiling grimly look to the children she said benji and catherine lay in a heap of coats and blood flowers of blood spread petals around them i didnt know at first which one was wounded so closely were they entwined but when i knelt to feel them catherine was warm and benjis fingers were ice his pulse a thread he opened his eyes said something in arabic and then in english added i seeing granny before one week she driving thing like tonight thing not car like tonight i seeing from window she putting man in water hush i know you did you hush now catherine let go of him im going to carry him downstairs and take him to the hospital i pried her fingers from his cold side you bring the coats so we can keep him warm i picked him up a slight youth a feather in my arms hold on you hold on to me benji catherine followed me leaning against me so she could keep her good hand on benjis body in the kitchen i kicked renees gun in front of me tipping it into the snow on my way out before we reached the rover benji was dead in my arms chapter unnatural sleep i longed for sleep more than i had wanted anything my whole life i wanted a bath and a bed and oblivion but instead i had the eagle river cops and the vilas county sheriff as they tried to make sense of the senseless when catherine and i returned to the house with benjis body i laid him on the dining room table a catafalque of sorts a laying out in state catherine refused to leave him even though she was shivering so violently that her hand couldnt stay in place on benjis head i went to the living room for the blankets wed wrapped geraldine in earlier when i brought them back to the dining room catherine had climbed up on the table beside benji she was cradling his head in her lap i swathed her in blankets but her shivering wouldnt stop i took my cell phone from my bag and looped the mike around my neck while i tracked down the local emergency services i folded my arms around catherine trying to rub some warmth into her by the time i was finally connected to the county dispatcher the worst of her shaking had eased but the room was filled with the sickly sweet scent of her fear and her urine a shadow in the living room made me let go of her and run to the arched doorway it was geraldine not renee drawing on her own formidable will to hobble down the stairs on her wounded foot she looked from me to catherine shivering in her blankets then limped over and draped her sable coat across the girls shoulders i tucked it around catherine as best i could she wouldnt move or look at me but stared straight ahead benjis head in her lap id seen a set of wicker chairs in one corner of the living room i brought two of them over to the arch connecting living and dining rooms so we could sit but still keep an eye on catherine i pulled over a coffee table for geraldine to prop her foot on shed lost the towels id tied around her wound blood oozed onto the glass tabletop that was a terrible deed shooting the boy in front of her own granddaughter geraldine said adding in a conversational tone i wasnt able to kill renee what are we going to do with her when she revives try to get our story in first i said grimly the law will be here soon and shes going to be spinning her line about benji as a terrorist kidnapper was he a terrorist geraldine asked i think he was an orphan boy far from home who got caught in a war he didnt know was going on all he wanted to do was make money to help his mother and his sisters tears pricked the back of my lids i shook them off angrilyi needed my wits not my emotions for whatever lay ahead geraldine and i sat silent both of us exhausted at one point she said how odd darraugh and edwards will find it to know their mothers have been fighting i grunted but didnt move or speak until i heard renee stirring on the upper landing i got up gun out as she staggered down the front stairs disheveled but haughty she looked past me to geraldine you have a knack for hovering around my family when you are least wanted geraldine you may leave my granddaughter to me now i felt my temper rising renee i dont know if youre insane or just giving a good impersonation but a highhanded act isnt going to work tonight catherine is in shock because she saw you murder benjamin sadawi in cold blood we will not leave you alone with her renee looked at me loftily i thought you and that terrorist had kidnapped her i shot him in the belief i was protecting her i should have hit you harder renee geraldine said in her flutey voice it brought me such satisfaction i should have hit you forty years ago perhaps i could have beaten some sense into you i understand what youre doing i understand you believe you can persuade a policeman and a judge of what you are saying because you have the power and position of the bayard name behind you you think victoria is a servant of no account who can be belittled and discounted the way my mother treated detectives forty years ago but times have changed detectives are sophisticated nowadays and victoria stands high in my sons and my estimation very high we are prepared to support her version of tonights events you cant forgive me for marrying calvin can you renee said amused contempt in her voice after all this time you still dont understand that he was weary of your posturing and your needinessand your aging body he turned to me for relief from all those things geraldine smiled im the one he calls for when hes frightened renee not you nor kylie nor any of the others your staff may think he means you when he cries deenie but i was always deenie to him from the time we first tried swimming together in the larchmont pool when we were four im the one who protected his reputation renee snapped her composure cracking im the one who saved him from prison who helped build up the bayard foundation and the press im the one who turned him into an international figure while you sat withering turning grayer and grayer in that mausoleum buried alive by your mother until calvins reputation became so important to you that you killed three people to protect it i put in im not going to pretend to weep over olin taverner but marcus whitby was a fine young journalist a fine young man while benji sadawi was a helpless bystander do you think your granddaughter will ever want to live with you again now that she knows you killed these people you sacrificed their lives you sacrificed her wellbeing catherine knows me she knows i love her as deeply as i do calvin renee said so shell stay with you because she knows youll kill anyone who threatens your idea of her i dont think so i think nature made something finer than you or calvin in your granddaughter shell recoil from you the way she would from sewage renee smiled contemptuously you have no children no home life i doubt very much you are a judge of family relationships i thought of my mothers fierce love for me and my fathers more level affection the price they demanded in return was not adoration nor achievement but integrity i could not lie or cheat to avoid trouble i didnt try to tell renee that the sad thing is that i liked you renee i admired your husband to the point of hero worship but i genuinely liked you you have the kind of energy and competence ive always admired she flushed and left us to go into the dining room catherine sat motionless on the table like a small furry buddha but when renee took her good arm and tried to move her she jerked away and lay down next to benji kissing him on the lips i could hear the sirens from the emergency crew keening their way up the drive a moment later the cars poured into the yard their strobes staining the night sky red chapter shootout at the eagle river corral a cold sun hung well over elk horn lake before i got into a bed it took hours to sort things out with the local authorities i didnt blame themthe carnage in the house was shocking nor did i blame them for first wanting to haul me awaya youth lay dead in the dining room a teenager and an old woman both had gunshot wounds and i was the one with a gun the officer in charge a rawfaced man named blodel ordered a couple of deputies to hold on to me and my gun when she realized what they were doing geraldine put on her grandest dame manner she commanded blodel to listen to her before he did anything he might afterwards feel had been regrettable despite her pain and her loss of blood she gave a short fluent account of renees role in the evenings wreckage she stayed in the wicker chair but her air of command was such that blodel stopped what he was doing to attend to her she shot the boy she tried to kill victoria victoria where is renees gun i told blodel he would find the gun in the snow outside the kitchen door it will have ms bayards fingerprints on it and youll find its bullets will match the one that killed the youth in the dining room blodel sent a woman out to look for renees gun but his other officer kept a grip on me renee saw this as her opportunity to seize control of the situation she left catherines side wearing an air of command like a second jacket to tell blodel that benjamin sadawi was a terrorist wanted by the fbi and that she had shot him to protect her granddaughter she would appreciate blodels help in getting her granddaughter to an airplane the child was in shock was recovering from an injury and needed to be flown back to chicago for medical care geraldine and i listened to this with mounting indignation but we couldnt edge in a word to contradict her blodel kept silencing us when we tried to speak geraldines wrath finally pushed her to her feet oh these lies renee these lies they fit you like the glove to hand and you should know renee that marcus whitby saw the agreement calvin and olin signed together whatever was in that agreement julius arnoff has a copy of it before she could go further her bad foot gave way and she collapsed scrabbling at blodels arms on her way down my deputy let go of me to help get geraldine back into a chair and to make sure she hadnt suffered further hurt while their attention was on geraldineand on renee who was saying oh geraldine must you always play the victim to garner attentioni retreated to a corner of the living room with my cell phone my first call was to freeman carter my lawyer wasnt happy to hear from me at four in the morning but he took in a summary of what had happened he said he knew a lawyer in rhinelander the nearest big town and put me on hold while he looked up the number when hed given it to me he told me to wait half an hour before phoning so he could put the local guy in the picture i called bobby mallory next years of midnight emergencies brought him to the phone grouchy but coherent im in eagle river bobby renee bayard just shot benjamin sadawi give it to me fast victoria and straight no frills i gave it to him straight mostly straight not too many frills i told him how catherine ran away with benji yesterday afternoon at which he interrupted how did i know it wasnt because i had known where benji was and helped him escape i sidestepped that issue and told bobby about the phenobarb about calvin bayards nurse with her seizures i even told him about calvins secret deal with olin taverner although i choked over the words hardly able to utter them renee helped broker that deal fortyfive years ago bobby marc whitby stumbled on it and went to ask her about it she wasnt going to let calvins secret see the light of day shed built her life around making him into the great man she wasnt going to let the world see him as lesser she probably killed olin too your sayso bobby was sarcastic the family lawyer has a copy of an agreement calvin bayard and olin taverner both signed i dont know its details but the firm is lebold arnofl if hell let you read it it may make everything clearer bobby grunted in my ear so what got the kid involved in this he saw renee bayard put marcus whitby into that pond last week right before he died benji said he saw renee drive up in some kind of vehicle that wasnt a car he watched her put marcs body into the pond remember that golf cart i told you about on sunday it would have been so easy for her i had been picturing how shed worked it she would have invited marc to meet herprivately keep it to yourself so there isnt a possibility of llewellyn hearing about it she would have said you dont want to ruin your career by having him know you talked to me marc played his cards close to his chesteveryone agreed to thatso renee could have counted on his silence catherine was spending that sunday night in new solway elsbetta had the night off renee invited marc to banks street gave him his favorite bourbon doctored with theresas phenobarb as soon as he started feeling ill before he lost consciousness and couldnt walk she would have hustled him to his carid better get you to the hospital i could imagine her saying the organizational genius at work when renee reached coverdale lane marc would have been barely conscious she could safely leave him in the car go under the culvert get a golf cart push his body from car to cart and drive him to the pond bobby listened to me all the way through but he was skeptical when i finished picturesque but no proof i almost stamped my foot in frustration if im right that cart in the equipment shed will have evidence for your forensic techs to find it would be great if they got to it before the golf course repaints it or trashes it he paused all right ill move that up the priority list but what does your fairy tale have to do with the mess youre in now renee hightailed it up here to silence benji so he couldnt identify her but geraldine graham and i both heard him say hed seen her put marcus whitby into the pond when he was up in the larchmont attic yeah hearsay testimony of a dead terrorist im not even going to try to take that into court well try some real evidence then with some real police work my temper was fraying before renee returns to chicago as a triumphant heroine who killed a terrorist it would be great to nail down calvin bayards nurse and the housekeeper and find out how much of the nurses phenobarb is missing whether renees prints are on the bottle whether they saw renee last monday night when she claimed to be in chicago also someone might have seen renee go into taverners place the night taverner died also someone might have seen whitby go to renees apartment last sunday thats a lot of mghs bobby objected adding with heavy humor and a hundred mites dont add up even to a flea the golf cart is pretty damned concrete i tried not to shout dont swear vicki its ugly in a woman i told you well look at the cart well do it today but for the rest of it you know i dont like playing with your theories especially not when they cross jurisdictions like this and even more especially not with a wanted man like sadawi involved and especially not with a family like the bayards but the grahams will back me up on this and im going to sic murray ryerson on it if the police dont find evidence he will its even possible one of the dupage deputies will have the guts to go to the bayard house if i tell her what i just told you i dont stand for your threats any more than i do your insinuations vicki bobbys temper was also wearing thin you know damn well that my work is always by the books regardless of who or what a suspect is and you know too im going to have to talk to jack zeelander in the federal attorneys office about what happened to sadawi and im not going to feed him your line about the helpless orphan boy you hear oh bobby if you were here now if you could see catherine bayard lying like juliet in the tomb you wouldnt okay vicki calm down youve had a long day youve seen too much blood you need to go to bed ill tell zeelander sadawis dead and well leave the rest until weve got some ballistics okay thank you bobby his sudden switch to kindness made me want to cry again which i couldnt afford right now will you talk to the officer in charge here see if you can move him along ms grahams lying down with this wound in her foot and shes ninetyone she needs a doctor i need a bed bobby talked to officer blodel to my face he might poohpooh my detecting but he would support mesupport tony and gabriellas daughterto an outsider after talking first to bobby and then to the lawyer freeman had recommended the tenor of blodels questions began to change he stopped addressing me as cop to perpetrator and began speaking as one law professional to another finally around six in the morning someone collected benjis body to deliver to the county morgue it took two officers to move catherine away from him when they finally lifted her from the table she started to follow them to the hearse one of the deputies picked her up and carried her back into the kitchen she stumbled over to me clutching me as an infant would put my arms around her and murmured those senseless coos one gives to aching children an ambulance came to take geraldine to the local hospital the ems techs wanted to take catherine with them as well to treat her for shock and check on her wound but she burrowed deeper into my arms her cast digging into my breast renee bustled forward the cannonball in full throttle come along darling lets get you checked over by a doctor and then well charter a plane for home catherine clung to me go away dont come near me you shot benji you shot him like he was a horse with a broken leg i dont want to see you again go away go away go away i didnt know if the law would ever catch up with renee bayard but catherines outburst shocked her as nothing else had all evening for a brief moment her face collapsed she looked like a stricken old woman not the brigadier in charge this wasnt retribution that i could offer to harriet whitby or benjis mother but it was a small offering on the scales of justice renee tried to argue with catherine but her granddaughter began to scream two officers hustled renee away they werent charging her with anything they said but they wanted to question her more about her gun blodel saw that he couldnt possibly take me to the station for a formal statement unless he was prepared to deal with more hysteria from catherine in the end he talked to me in the living room at the cottage while a deputy took notes i finally had a chance to recount everythingwell almost everythingthat had happened since geraldine and i left chicago i left out the tape wed found in the saturn because i wanted to take that home to chicago with me while blodel and i finished talking a woman officer fetched clean clothes for catherine from her own teenage daughters closet she also roused a local motel owner to get us a bedroom in the motel the woman officer helped me bathe and undress catherine and get her into a nightshirt i spent a long time under the shower myself trying to stop my skin from feeling as though it were turning inside out when i got into bed i collapsed into sleep so fast i couldnt even remember lying down i woke once around noon because catherines cast was digging into my back but was asleep again as soon as i turned over when i finally came to at three that afternoon she was still sleeping her narrow face gray and puffy i stumbled to my feet and into my wellworn clothes wishing the woman officer had brought something clean in my size last night i roused catherine to tell her i was leaving to find food but would be back within an hour she blinked at me dopily and went back to sleep when i returned with a bag of groceries and a hot pizza i was stunned to find darraugh graham waiting for me he had hired a small plane to collect his mother he said and he planned to fly catherine and me down to chicago with him i explained that i already had two cars at the cottage but he told me hed send up a team later in the week to drive them back mother told me what you did the last twentyfour hours for her for the boy for catherine its enough for one week im going to collect mother at the hospital now ill swing back for you and catherine my pilot is instrument rated but its a small plane its better to fly while we still have light i said i needed to check with the local lawyer to make sure everything was settled with the local police but darraugh had taken care of that too i think i was twelve the last time anyone took care of things for me i thanked him shakily and went down the hall to rouse catherine on the flight south we sat in a stupor for most of the journey at the little airport on the lakefront where we landed darraugh had a car waiting he sent his driver out to new solway with his mother and escorted catherine and me into the city in a cab when he directed the cab to the banks street apartment catherine started sobbing again she couldnt see her grandmother she wouldnt see her father not now not after seeing benji die and listening to everyone call him a terrorist finally not knowing what else to do i said she could come home with me chapter death notices at my apartment darraugh paid off the taxi and walked us to the door saying he wanted to talk to me thats good because i want to talk to you too i said i have to explain to my neighbor what ive been doing and get catherine settled in do you want to meet tomorrow tonight i need to go to washington tomorrow ill use your phone while you do what you have to do mr contreras and the dogs boiled out of his apartment just then darraugh withstood the onslaught remarkably well he and mr contreras had met once or twice but they had about as much in common as a fish and a giraffethey were both animals but that was as far as it went catherine on the other hand took to mr contreras at once peppy helped but mr contrerass direct unpretentious personality reassured her as little else had these last few days my neighbor came upstairs with me to help set up a portable bed in my dining room for catherineand to hear the blowbyblow details of our adventure i had called him from eagle river but he wanted to know everything from the moment geraldine and i left chicago until we got on the plane to return this afternoon darraugh sat in my living room with the phone while i showed catherine how to work the locks and where things like toilets and tea were i wondered how long shed be comfortable staying in four rooms with no housekeeper to get the dust out of the corners or make sure she had the bulgarian yogurt and particular tofu she required while i showed her around mr contreras had been poking in my refrigerator and cupboards you dont have no food in here doll you been living on the fly like i keep telling you is bad for your health you going out with mr graham ill make spaghetti for this young lady no meatballs shes a vegetarian i said tomato sauce i make my own tomato sauce and your own ma couldnt do a better job thats a fact mr contreras assured catherine she smiled shyly apparently not bothered by the reference to the mother whod died when she was one the old man took catherine and the dogs downstairs i changed out of my rank clothes and washed putting on wool crepe trousers and a rose silk shirt whatever darraugh had to say to me i wanted to feel alert and attractive when i joined darraugh in the living room he wrapped up a complicated conversation with caroline his personal assistant i offered him a drink but he wanted to go out he didnt want mr contreras or catherine coming in on us midconversation we picked up a cab on belmont and rode down to the trefoil hotel on the gold coast darraugh got us one of the little tables in the corner that overlooks lake michigan ordered a dry martini for himself black label for me sent the waiter about his business he made a job out of his lemon peel rubbing it around the rim of his glass twisting it until it broke apart i wasnt about to try to help him larchmont is a terrible housesucks the life out of everyone who comes near it he said tearing the peel into smaller pieces i should have known when mother told me she was seeing lightsshould have known disaster would follow you did well under the circumstances very well no one else could have been as effective with my mother shes a remarkable woman its a pity she let your grandmother dominate her life a muscle twitched in his jaw laura taverner drummond was a dreadful person she did terrible damage to everyone around her when my father diedshe made my life hell i didnt talk to her for ten years until i married and my wife insisted we make some kind of effort at reconciliation and then my grandmother tried to belittle elise in the eyes of everyone out in that wasps nest of a village elise was the gentlest person who ever lived and laurabut thats neither here nor there he swallowed half the martini then spoke rapidly not looking at me i found my fathers body i know mother told you that she doesnt know i found his suicide note i put my glass down so fast that whisky slopped over the rim it was meant for her for mother if hed known i was going to find his body he would never have killed himself as he did or where he did exeter sent us home in a hurry because three of the boys came down with polio i didnt bother to telegraph them i was used to coming home alone and i knew mother was in washington with calvin theres a study on the first floor where my father would read watch television i went to look for him when i arrived hoping he was in and found him hanging over the desk it was he covered his face with his hands the image was vivid in his head even fortyfive years later i cut him down i tried to give him artificial respirationthey taught us that at summer camp or someplace all i could think was that grandmother must not know she hated my father using the study it was a mans room she said built by her husband for doing mans work so she would never enter it once my father took it over i covered his face with my coat and then i saw the note he took his wallet from his breast pocket and removed a muchcreased sheet of paper a schoolboys round hand covered the page did you begrudge me a little love geraldine i never held your loves against you but youve used mine to help your own lover i know olin and calvin have always been at odds i know olin believes things that no rightminded person can support but loves a malady without a cure and i loved olin now that youve seen us together and told calvin olin plans to tell the world that i tried to seduce him that i shocked him with my homosexual declarations the truth isno one knows the truth olin and i recognized each other the first time we met we fell in love we snatched odd meetings in new york or washington and now he plans to betray me to the world to save his own skinno not even that to gain advantage over calvin i am sick in heart and body and mind and there is no cure no way to continue on this planet watching you helplessly in love with calvin while he abandons you watching olin betray me watching your mother watch us all with her malevolent glare only darraugh ties me to the earth and he will soon be in the wider world leaving me behind do as you will when you find me when i handed it back darraugh continued harshly we didnt talk about homosexuality when i was a teenager not the way they do now i was shocked everything that afternoon was a shock i was like young catherine reeling from watching my universe disintegrate sitting there with my fathers body my one thought was to protect him from my grandmother my mother olin i didnt know anyone to talk to in my panic i chose renee i thought she was an outsider a newcomer she could keep olin from doing what he threatened i showed her the letter and she said she could manage things to protect my fathers secret i see i said renee must have used the letter to force olin to end his interrogation of calvin i havent been able to understand why olin kept calvins sins to himself even after homosexuality in public life ceased to be so shocking but all these years renee must have used the note as an enforcer if olin betrayed calvin she would show the world the kind of man he wasnot his being queer but his willingness to betray your father to save his skin and he kept quiet until marcus whitby came along darraugh finished his martini and ordered a second did you tell her she could always get the letter from you if she needed it i asked this is a copy i wrote it out for myself and carried it with me not knowing what id do with it i lived on the streets of new york for a year i livedas a prostitute i guess you could call it that yes i tried to live my fathers life but i finally knew it wasnt mine and went back to exeter he gave his wintry smile i was fortunate it was before aids as it was i experienced other nasty diseases and maladventures i reached across the table to clasp his hand he squeezed his eyes shut but not before id seen the glint of candlelight on the tears in them after a moment i pulled my hand away why were you so angry last week over where my investigation was heading you were threatening me in a way that left me wondering whether i would or could ever work for you again renee called me she told me you were trying to dig up all that old dirt on my father on calvin on my mother he bit his lips and turned his head away for a moment then looked back at me i loved him mackenzie graham was a good man he was a good father his death his life thats a scar on a wound that still hurts i thought you were trying to slice it open i should have known you better chapter lovers lostand found during the next week i had dinner with darraugh several times one evening i almost went to bed with him in his east lake shore drive condo at the last minute realized i couldnt do itnot as penelope faithful to the absent ulysses but as a detective it was only loneliness mine as well as his that was drawing us together that would pass and when it did id find it hard to work for him again i think he understood i think we parted on good terms catherine stayed with me for over a week wisconsin officials held renee briefly but released her without filing charges those might come later if the police machinery ground through all the forensic evidence around marc whitbys death but for now renee was home in fact she was back at work running bayard publishing she even appeared on good morning america to spin her version of what happened that night in eagle river when catherine wouldnt take her phone calls renee wrote a letter to her granddaughter the letter was in the spirit of the times not acknowledging guilt or shame but begging catherine to understand that if renee had done anything that distressed catherine it was done out of love for calvin and the ideals they shared the letter upset catherine so much that we had to stay up until three the next morning discussing it id forgotten how much emotional energy adolescents absorb geraldine and i both put such muscle as we had into trying to convince both illinois and wisconsin authorities that renee had shot benji only to protect herself from his testimony but we were no match for the governments itch to shed islamic blood and catherine while bitter with her grandmother over benjis death wasnt going to try to send renee to prison she refused to testify marcs death was also a sticky matter despite his frosty words to me bobby had dispatched his righthand detective terry finchley to work with the dupage sheriff on looking for evidence the tape id found in the saturn of marcs interview with olin helped piece some of the story togetherthe part id learned from mackenzie grahams suicide note i kept to myself i was hopeful when terry found a cabdriver whod picked renee up at thirtyfifth and king the night marc died but i still knew we were facing an uphill struggle as i tried explaining to amy blount and harriet the three of us got together for frequent strategy sessions and to try to make sense of why or how marc had died why did renee take marc out to larchmont amy asked i shrugged my guess is she figured hed be there for months before anyone found him the house was empty and in this economy no one was looking to buy it the agents arent doing a lot of maintenance on the grounds so it was a good bet that marcs body would disintegrate to where it would be hard to identify him or get a real cause of death it was just one of those pieces of luck that renees granddaughter was also using the deserted mansion i hate it when you talk like this like it was a game harriet said sorry but it was a game to reneeher wits against the world she drove marcs car back to his house in the middle of the night let herself in and destroyed all his notes and computer files she killed olin with the phenobarb in his nightcap and destroyed the papers in his secret drawer and showed up at her office the next morning as bright as a new lightbulb her son says renee has always prided herself on her organizational gifts the last couple of weeks she was in her element trouble was she was trying to organize too much and it started oozing out around the edges one afternoon i took catherine to see father lou who left her in a chastened frame of mind she had been irresponsible in racing off to the north woods with benji renee had shot him but catherine had put him in the line of fire the priest was still angryno one who had come to his church for sanctuary had ever died while under his care he wasnt softened by catherines pale face and quivering upper lip the next day catherine and i went to benjis funeral at his mosque we stood outside with a handful of other women while the men conducted the service a couple of women hissed at usthe two westerners who had led benji to his deathbut several commiserated with catherine imagining her in love with him as perhaps she had been romeo and juliet when youre sixteen everything seems as though it will be forever the bad as well as the good it was mr contreras who brought catherine the consolation she needed he was delighted to have a beautiful young waif to fuss over in the daytime while i was working he brought catherine down to his place where she convalesced on his couch and watched horse races on television with him and the dogs as someone who rode and groomed horses she even gave him tips on animals that might run well on her advice mr contreras won a hundred dollars at the offtrack place he frequents and bought us all steaks catherine vegetarian that she was wasnt proof against his ingenuous good will she ate a bite to please him catherine knew that i was trying to build a case against renee for marcus whitbys murder but whitby had never existed for her one evening after id been on the phone with stephanie protheroe in the dupage sheriffs office going over theresa jakess statements about how much of her medication had disappeared catherine asked if i couldnt just let it go i know granny behaved terribly but i dont want her to go to prison you want two things that cant both happen i started to say then told her instead to come for a ride with me not home she said suspiciously not home i want you to meet someone we drove to the south side where i introduced her to harriet whitby this is catherine bayard her arms in a cast because some excitable deputies shot her a couple of weeks back tell catherine about marc i want her to know what kind of man your brother was harriet thought for a minute he was a writer he was a careful man quiet and private really quite shy but when hed made up his mind to stand up for someone he could be fierce and always loyal when i was six and he was twelve i had a bad infection on my face some kind of outofcontrol acne some kids used to wait for me and taunt me on my way to school until it got to the point where i would leave home in the morning then hide in the park all day when marc found out i was skipping school he told me i would go that no bully could keep me from my right to an education and he walked me to school holding my hand when we got to the waiting children he stopped and said this is my sister who is a beautiful black girl child i expect you to recognize her beauty and respect her he said it as calmly as if he were reading the weather report he walked me to school every morning for three months and fought five of them two of them more than once and i will never know a better man if i live to be a hundred and twenty catherine didnt say anything on the ride home but the next afternoon when i got in from work she tried to sort out her complicated feelings i loved granny i thought she and grample were the most wonderful people on earth i thought of them the way harriet thinks of her brother so how could they give kylie ballantines name to that creep olin and then set themselves up as the biggest free speech defenders in the universe she was sitting on my living room floor with her good arm around peppy i shifted in my chair these same questions had been churning in my own mind everyone has a different breaking point and a different fear point the things you cant bear to face i mean the mccarthy and huac blacklists shattered lives people never worked again or never worked well they were ostracized they lived in terrible poverty some committed suicide many went to prison only for their beliefs not for anything theyd donenot in china or iraq but right here in america you dont race to embrace that kind of martyrdom at the same time your grandfather feared for the future of bayard publishing geraldine grahams mother was constantly threatening to give her shares in the company to olin taverner if laura drummond had known your grandfather supported a group that she thought was a communist front shed certainly have given olin her shares and that would have turned bayard into a rightwing organization they wouldnt publish the great magazines they do today such as margent or writers like armand pelletier and the guy you worked with last summer haile talbot so you think grample was right to betray kylie ballantine and pelletier andwhoever else he did betray to save the press her eyes blazed no i dont think it was right i dont believe that considering the greater goodthe integrity of bayard publishing in this case justifies betraying friends and now with his mind gone i can never ask him what he was thinking why he did it she cried i cant stand any of this seeing him sick when i loved him so muchi used to feel so smug knowing granny and grample were my family compared to the kind of people my friends have the kind who only think about money all the time and nowmy family is thinking maybe not about money but they dont think about people and how to live a principled life like they always claimed they did you and i are judging this in the calm and safety of my living room i said were not facing a congressional inquiry that would use our beliefs to turn us into criminals if that ever happens to us then well know what were made of i spent a month in prison once it was a terrible experience one that very nearly destroyed me if i knew i had to go to prison again i dont know how strong i would be in standing up for my values i hope strong to the end but even more i hope i never have to find out im only trying to say that what your grandfather did makes meoh incredibly sad heartbroken really but i cant judge him because i havent been on that battlefield looking into the mouths of those cannons but your grandmother crossed a different river when she resorted to murder and i want to see her pay the price she earned by killing marcus whitby which is why you should move out instead of staying here to watch me do it but how can i ever live with them again you could go to washington with your father i suggested yeah you know he calls me every hour on the hour it wasnt quite that often but he did call from washington once or twice a day alternatively cajoling and ordering catherine to follow him east daddy cant believe im not ready to embrace the right he thinks seeing that grample was a fraud means i should abandon all his and grannys ideals daddys fed up with me trying to defend them so i gathered you cant stay here forever you know after a while the romance of living on a trundle bed would pall youd start wanting your private bath your widescreen television and all the other simple pleasures of home anyway aside from your grandmother you need to be in school back to vina fields with everyone staring at me and talking about me i grinned a chance to show what youre made of but youre a rich girl and a smart one you have choices you can go to washington but insist on a school with more progressive values than the one your father picked out you could go to boarding schooldoesnt your family have a tradition with exeter but you only have one more year after this one transferring for your senior year might not be in your best interest isnt there a friend you could stay with she muffled her face in peppys fur ive been through too much this winter none of my friends is close enough to understand and anyway school seems totally pointless lacrosse whos dating who its likeafter seeing benji die none of it means anything you could take a year off to work with habitat for humanity or a similar group that tries to help people as poor as benjis mother my loverif morrellwhen morrell comes home he can help you find a good program that suggestion appealed to her at once we spent the next several days discussing hows and whens catherine finally decided to finish out her year at vina fields since she couldnt do much until her arm recovered then try to start in a program like habitat during the summer i hadnt heard from darraugh since the night id abandoned him in his bedroom but he surprised me again after catherine had decided to go back to school he called to offer her a home for the balance of the school year to my relief catherine accepted i was more than ready for someone else to have care of an ardent adolescent she decided to spend a weekend in new solway with her grandfather she would collect her things and move in with darraugh on monday morning she talked to renee making her promise to stay in town and on the last weekend in march when daylight savings time began climbed with me into the mustang for the drive west i brought the dogs with me after id seen catherine into the bayard mansion where ruth lantner refused to say a word to me i drove over to larchmont and let the dogs out i took mitch and peppy with me through the woods retracing the route that catherine followed as she slipped home after bringing benji supplies the dogs loved it they found deer and chased them through the woods i wasnt really thinking about catherine and benji as i walked back to larchmont but about calvin bayard and all the nights he walked this path to lie with geraldine to lie with geraldine to lie to her the boy wonder had he been a golden calf an idol too false for worship or just a flawed human being calvin shone that was his problem when i heard him speak all those years ago he seemed literally to shine like gold itself i was dazzled to the point of enchantment if you had that gift the gift of enchanting those around you what would ever make you want to temper it the dogs caught up with me as i passed the larchmont outbuildings mitch dove into the pool and pulled out one of the rotting carp he rolled in it before i could grab him i got peppy into the car before she could join him then went back to leash him up one things certain in this life my friend i told him you need a whole lot more dazzle than youve got to make me overlook that stench when id shoved him into the back of the mustang i drove the short distance around coverdale lane to anodyne park geraldine graham was home the guard at the gate told me i could go right up geraldine answered the door herself as she had when i first came to visit her her left foot was still in a cast she was using a walker but she was managing on her own she did ask me to get down her coalport mugs for tea but she handled the boiling water and the tea bags without my assistance i carried the cups to her alcove burning my fingers on the thin china as i had on my first visit the space looked bigger and lighter at first i couldnt figure out what was different and put it down to the greater light in the room from the coming of spring when geraldine clumped in behind me on her walker and sat though i realized she had taken down her mothers portrait the small mountainscape hung there instead she saw me looking at the wall and smiled in satisfaction when i hit renee with kylies mask it brought me a sense of pleasure i dont believe i ever experienced before not even in calvins arms certainly not in armands or any of the others she paused then added i loved calvin you know i knew his weaknesses but i loved him nonetheless i didnt think i could forgive renee for sweeping in and taking him over for queening it over me or for setting him up on a pedestal and indulging his weaknesses but when i brought that mask down on her headi felt an extraordinary lightness i am ninetyone now i have not now the strength to move heaven and earth but i am grateful for a freer spirit for whatever remains in life to me i decided you were right i didnt need mother up there reminding me of past humiliations i stayed with geraldine for an hour rehashing the case her life darraughs life she had finally told him this week that calvin was probably his father that explained why darraugh had invited catherine to live with him i supposedthe startling realization that she was his niece how did it feel to know edwards bayard was his brother i wondered it upset darraugh of course geraldine was saying in her high tremulous voice he loved mackenzie i told darraugh it didnt matter that he did right to love mackenzie as a father mackenzie was the man who stood beside darraughs nursery bed when he had chicken pox mackenzie not the nurse certainly not bathed his face to keep him from scratching the pustules mackenzie read darraugh nursery rhymes and put him up on his first pony mackenzie did all those things a father does and some that a mother who wasnt fleeing the torments of her home might have done darraugh should tell his son his own mackenzie i said you guys live such an incestuous life out hereit would never do for young mackenzie to fall in love with catherine bayard she looked at me with a momentary return of hauteur then relaxed and said she would suggest it to him what is happening with renee they have not yet arrested her i grimaced i dont know if they ever will the evidence is there but its all circumstantial in a way so what that her prints are on theresa jakess phenobarb bottlewhy shouldnt renee have picked it up wondering what medication her husbands nurse was taking and the rest of itthe cab she took from the corner near marcus whitbys house the valet at the golf club who saw her climb into a golf cart and ride off shes taking a firm hand with that and claiming they must be mistaken the police tread warily when it comes to arresting people from places like new solway she caught the bitterness in my tone dont make that the only way you think of us victoria we do some good as well without us there wouldnt be money for symphonies and theaters after all i rubbed my fingers wearily through my hair i dont think theres a ledger of good and evil this much good offsets that much evil its just oh you know there was that popular book a few years back when bad things happen to good people or whatever it was thats pieinthesky stuff to keep all us working stiffs from rising up in fury at the inequities in the world no one ever writes about all the good things that happen to bad people how the rich and powerful walk away from the messes they make and people like me like my neighbor like my parents pay for the clean up i get tired of it ive been pampering a confused rich girl all week i like catherine but she put benji at risk when she ran off with him she can take time off from school to focus her life while benjis mother and sisters cant even come to america to mourn at his grave and who knows what theyll live on yes thats very wrong geraldine said to leave them wanting i will talk to catherine when shes with darraugh and remind her that she must look after benjis family she pushed herself upright with her walker to escort me to the door i hope you will visit me again despite your misgivings about our new solway morality i walked slowly along the winding paths trying to shake a sense of melancholy the conversation had given me the rich are different than you and me they have more money and they have more power i finally dragged myself back to my car the stink of rotting carp filled the mustang i indulged in a moment of melodrama and imagined it as the stink of new solway riding with me to chicago but it was just mitch after all doing what dogs love to do i opened all the windows and drove along the tollway at a fast clip when i got home i dragged mitch up the back stairs and chained him to the porch rail i fetched a bucket and a scrub brush from the kitchen he was covered in lather when the phone rang i almost let it go but just before it kicked over to my answering service i sprinted in to pick up the kitchen extension a man with an italian accent answered he was looking for victoria warshawski that was me he was giulio carrera with humane medicine my heart stood still the scrub brush clattered to the floor morrell yes we have morrell he was shot out in the afghan countryside we dont quite know what happened yet but local women found him and took care of him we traced him through rumors and airlifted him to zurich early this morning hes alive hes alive the women saved his life he is weak but he gave us your telephone number and told us to ring you he said to tell you it was not the khyber pass where he was shot do you understand that i laughed shakily my worry about his being shot and left to die in the khyber passhe was alert he could remember that he remembered my phone number he remembered me where is he carrera gave me the name of the hospital i sent messages to morrell i babbled in italian and english long after carrera hung up i still clutched the phone to my chest my face wet once in a blue moon in the midst of pain and helplessness life hands us a reprieve sara paretsky
